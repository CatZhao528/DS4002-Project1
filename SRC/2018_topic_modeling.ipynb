Dad, what are you saying? \\nI think it\\'s possible, \\nto bring her back. \\nOkay. We\\'re in. \\nAw, this place is a maze. \\nWhere\\'s that map? \\nWe\\'re definitely close. \\n- Are you ready? \\n- I\\'m ready, Daddy. \\nAre you sure? Once we\\'re inside, you show any hesitation or fear, - we\\'re done. \\n- I eat fear for breakfast. \\nWow. That is super cool. \\nCome on. \\nLook! It\\'s Anton. He\\'ll \\nshow us the way. \\nAnton, which way do we go? \\nAnton, which way do we go? \\nThanks, Anton. \\nLook! The ants have burrowed \\ninto the tech facility. \\nOh, no! Lasers! \\nOh! I got lased! \\nThe secret vault. \\n- Tell me you brought the contact lens. - Yup! \\nPage 2/53\\nPerfect! Right there. \\nThere! It\\'s the microtreasure. \\nMy trophy? \\n- It looks like treasure. \\n- Oh, it is to me. \\n- I wanna take it to show and tell. - Oh, you can\\'t do that. Can\\'t. \\nIt never leaves the house. \\nIt\\'s too important. \\nThis is the best birthday \\npresent you ever got me. \\nI\\'m so touched you think I\\'m \\nthe World\\'s Greatest Grandma. \\n- It was the only one they have. \\n- It makes me wanna get you a sweater. - Oh, no, the fuzz! \\n- Hey, Scotty. \\nI was looking at the schematics \\nfor the Karapetyan buildings, \\nand I think we have way too \\nmany security cams, don\\'t we? \\n- No, not at all. \\n- \\'Cause, it\\'s a lot of security cameras. I know what he needs. Who\\'s the \\nsecurity expert in our business? \\nYou are. But I\\'m running \\nthe company, right? \\nAnd if we overcoat him, he\\'s gonna go somewhere else, so we got to land this bird. He can go on anywhere. And the \\nexpression is \"landing the fish.\" \\nNo, it\\'s \"land the bird.\" \\nJust like landing a plane. You gotta land the plane to be in business. \\nI know it\\'s silly to get hung up on these kinds of things. But I do... How am I gonna land a fish? \\nIt can\\'t walk. \\nAnd if it swam up on shore, and it battled a hawk, who\\'s gonna win? \\nYou\\'ve really turned me \\naround on this thing. \\nIt\\'s okay. We\\'re gonna \\nland Karapetyan. \\nPage 3/53\\nNow if you\\'d just excuse me, I\\'m in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter. I\\'m gonna go recheck it. \\nDon\\'t just stand there! \\nLet\\'s bounce before \\nthe po-po come back! \\nPo-po? How do you \\neven know that? \\nLet\\'s fly, Antoinette! \\nLet\\'s fly! \\nCrash landing! \\n- I wish we could shrink for real. \\n- It is pretty cool. \\nHey, I\\'m headed to \\nthe office, Scotty. \\nHey, sorry about freaking \\nout earlier, you know? \\nBut I feel like... I\\'m way better. Like, my heart is definitely like, beating way too hard and stuff? And, like, my hands are shaking. But \\nI think it\\'s unrelated, you know? \\nIt\\'s gonna be great, Luis. You \\ngot nothing to worry about. \\nYeah, yeah. I\\'m the boss. \\nI\\'m the boss. \\nI\\'m the boss. Yeah, \\nyeah, yeah, yeah. \\nDaddy! \\nCome on, Woo. I\\'ve \\ngot three days left. \\n- Why would I try to escape? \\n- Sorry, Scott. Rules are rules. \\nYou trip a perimeter alarm \\nand we search the place. \\nKeel, stern, suits and nuts. \\nThank you. It was an accident. \\nMy foot went through the fence. \\nOur flying ant crashed. \\nHey, you try and entertain a 10-year \\nold when you can\\'t leave the house. \\nYou know the lengths \\nthat I\\'ve gone to? \\nClose-up magic. \\nI learned that. \\nPage 4/53\\nWhy can\\'t you just \\nleave my Daddy alone? \\nOh, Cassie. \\nThis must all seem like a bunch of confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh? Well, think of it this way: \\nYour school has rules, right? \\nLike... \\nYou can\\'t draw on the walls. \\nWell, your Daddy went to Germany and drew on the walls with Captain America. And that was a violation of Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the Sokovia Accords. Now as a part of his joint plea deal with Homeland Security and the German government, he\\'s allowed to return to the U.S., provided he serve two years under house arrest, followed by three \\nyears of probation. \\nAnd avoid any unauthorized \\nactivities, technology, \\nor contact with any former associates, who were or currently are, \\nin violation of said Accords. \\nOr any related statutes. \\nOkay, sweetie? \\nWow. You\\'re really \\ngreat with kids! \\nThanks. I\\'m also a youth pastor. \\nAnyway, not to be a \\nJohnny Ass-calade, \\nbut you haven\\'t had any contact with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you? - No. \\n- You sure? \\nBecause it\\'s only a matter \\nof time before we get them. \\nIt was their tech, so they \\nviolated the Accords, too. \\nAssociating with them breaks your deal. And, uhh... \\nI don\\'t need to \\nremind you, that... \\nAny violation of your agreement \\nPage 5/53\\nmeans 20 years in prison. Minimum. I haven\\'t talked to Hank \\nor Hope in forever. \\n- They hate his guts. \\n- Thanks, Peanut. \\n- How\\'d you do it, Scott? \\n- Do what? \\nThe card trick? \\nSeriously? \\nOh, my God! \\nYou people can\\'t just show up here, whenever you want and search the place. Actually, they can. \\n- You need a warrant. \\n- Actually, they don\\'t. \\nReally? Wow. \\n- Did you pack your soccer shoes? - Yeah. \\nNext time I see you, \\nwill be on the outside! \\nI\\'ll get on the inside of this. \\n- Three days! \\n- Seriously? \\n- I\\'m proud of you, buddy. \\n- Thank you. \\n- You know what? Give me another one. - Me, too! \\nFreedom, business, I\\'m \\nsensing greatness. \\n- I had a fun weekend, Daddy. \\n- Me too, Peanut. \\nJust wait till next weekend. Once I\\'m outta here, we\\'re gonna go paint this town red. We\\'ll have so much ice cream, \\nwe\\'ll never stop puking. \\n- You\\'re getting good at that. \\n- How\\'d you do that? \\n- Bye, Daddy! \\n- Bye! \\n- Bye! \\n- Bye! \\nThree days... \\nEasy-peasy. \\nSnap your fingers. That \\nPage 6/53\\ngets them to look over there. \\nNow that is misdirection. \\nEasy-peasy. \\nLost... in the \\nQuantum Realm. \\nWhat? \\nI\\'m gonna find \\nyou, Jellybean. \\nI found you! \\nYou always find \\nme, Mommy. \\nWhat the hell? \\nHey, Hank. \\nIt\\'s been a while. \\nUmm... I don\\'t even know \\nif this is your number... \\nAnymore... and, \\nI\\'m probably the last person \\nyou wanna hear from. But... \\nI just had a really \\nweird dream. \\nAnd I know that doesn\\'t sound like an emergency or anything, but it just felt... Very real. \\nI was back in the \\nQuantum Realm, and... \\nI think I saw your wife. \\nAnd then I \\nwas your wife. \\nI mean, not in \\na weird way, or... \\nYou know... \\nHearing this out loud, I\\'m \\nthinking, it\\'s not an emergency. \\nI\\'m sorry I \\nbothered you. \\nI\\'m sorry for \\na lot of things. \\nHope? \\nIs this another dream? \\nDo you think it\\'s a dream? Or is it possible that you really saw my Mom down there? I\\'m not sure. \\nI can\\'t be here! I can\\'t be, \\nPage 7/53\\nI\\'m under house arrest. \\nThey won\\'t open while the \\nsystem\\'s engaged, Scott. \\nYou have to \\ntake me home. \\n- They can show up any second. \\n- Relax... \\nAs far as your nanny cops \\nknow, you\\'re still at home. \\nWoah! \\nScotty? \\nHe\\'s programmed to \\nreplicate your daily routine. \\nNine hours in bed, five \\nhours in front of the TV, \\ntwo hours in the bathroom, \\nwhatever that\\'s about. \\nThat\\'s totally inaccurate. \\nHow do you know about my daily \\nroutine? Are you spying on me? \\nWe keep tabs on all \\nsecurity threats, all right? \\nAnd so far, the biggest \\none we\\'ve had is you. \\nI\\'m sorry about Germany. \\nThey just showed up. They said it \\nwas a matter of national security, - That Cap needed help. \\n- Who\\'s Cap? \\n...tain America. \\nCaptain... Cap. \\nIt\\'s what we call him. \\nIf you\\'re a friend. I think I\\'m a friend, a little. I know him. He\\'s not, we\\'re not... I\\'m sorry! All right? I didn\\'t \\nthink I\\'d get caught. \\nYou didn\\'t think \\nabout a lot of things. \\nHow\\'s Hank? \\nWe\\'re still running, the house is gone. So is our freedom. How do you think he is? I\\'m sorry. I know \\nyou\\'re mad. \\nI\\'m not looking \\nPage 8/53\\nfor apologies, Scott. \\nThe only reason why we\\'re even talking is because we need what\\'s in your head. Is this where \\nyou\\'re living? \\nIf you need help, money \\nor something, maybe I can... \\nWe\\'re fine. \\nHey, Hank. Look... \\n- I just want to... \\n- Save it. \\n- Can we start? \\n- Yeah. \\nSo, while you were relaxing \\nat home, we were building this. \\nIt\\'s a tunnel. To \\nthe Quantum Realm. \\nTo my Mom. \\nWe think she might still be down \\nthere, we just don\\'t know where. \\nWhat? \\nIf we can pinpoint my Mom\\'s location, then the pod can take me down to get her. You built all this and you \\ndon\\'t even know if she\\'s alive? \\nIt\\'s called a hypothesis. \\nLast night we powered up the tunnel for the first time. It overloaded, and it shut down. But for a split second, \\nthe doorway to the \\nQuantum Realm was opened. \\nAnd? \\nAnd five minutes later, you \\ncalled. Talking about Mom. \\nWe think when you went down there, you may have entangled with her. \\nHank, I would never do that. \\nI respect you too much. \\nQuantum entanglement, Scott. \\nWe think she might have put some kind of message in your head. Hopefully, a location. And opening the \\ntunnel triggered it. \\nYour Mom put a message in my \\nPage 9/53\\nhead? Come on. That\\'s insane. \\nNo, Scott. Insane... \\nis going to Germany without \\ntelling us and fighting the Avengers. Just tell me you weren\\'t \\nlying about the suit you took. \\nTell me you \\nreally destroyed it. \\nI did. I destroyed it. I swear. I can\\'t believe you \\ndestroyed my suit. \\nThat was my life\\'s work. \\n- What was I supposed to do? \\n- You were supposed to not take my suit! I\\'m sorry, Hank. I\\'m \\nsorry I took the suit. \\nI\\'m sorry that \\nI called last night. \\nI don\\'t remember seeing Janet \\ndown there. I wish that I did. \\nI just had a dream about her playing hide and seek with a little girl. What? \\nI had a dream. She was playing \\nhide and seek with a little... \\ngirl. Cassie and I do it all the time. It doesn\\'t mean anything. But, was it Cassie \\nin the dream? \\nNo. \\n- Where was she hiding? \\n- What? \\nThe little girl, where was she \\nhiding. Was it in a wardrobe? \\nNo, it\\'s in a tall dresser. \\n- You mean a wardrobe. \\n- Is that what that\\'s called? \\n- What color was it? \\n- Red. \\n- Were there horses on it? \\n- Oh, boy. \\nIt\\'s where I hid every \\ntime we played. \\nDoesn\\'t sound like you really \\nPage 10/53\\ngot the gist of the game. \\nShe\\'s alive! \\nI knew it. \\nI knew it! \\n- We need to get that part. \\n- Okay. \\nThe sooner we get the tunnel working, the sooner we can get this message out his head. - Does Burch have it? \\n- Yeah. Let\\'s go. \\nWhat part? Who\\'s Burch? \\nWait, what\\'s happening? \\nWe need a component to stop \\nthe tunnel from overloading again. \\nI brought your clothes. \\nYou might wanna change. \\nLook. I\\'d really like \\nto help you out. \\nBut if I\\'m not home when they come to take off my ankle monitor then I\\'m going away forever. Once we get the component and power up the tunnel, we\\'ll get the message and have you home by lunch. We have to hurry. The \\nentanglement won\\'t last. \\nYou owe us. \\nAll right, fine. But can I just wait inside? Because I\\'m not supposed to be out here. Let\\'s go. \\n- We good? \\n- Yeah. \\nI\\'ll be right back. \\n- Can I have one of those? \\n- No. \\nSusan! \\n- Welcome to Oui! \\n- Sonny. \\nOui is French for yes. As \\nin, yes, we found a table, \\nyes, you saw \\nus, and yes, \\nto planning before property. \\nWell, let\\'s hope it \\nalso means yes to \\ndo you have the \\nPage 11/53\\ncomponent I ordered? \\nYou know, I\\'ve always loved \\nyour sense of humor, Susan. \\n- Have a seat. \\n- No, I\\'m good. Thank you. \\n- Who is this guy? \\n- Sonny Burch. \\nHe traffics in black \\nmarket technology. \\nHe\\'s been getting us what \\nwe need to build the tunnel. \\n- Can I just have one? \\n- No. \\nYou know, I have a special friend, down at the FBI. And I say special, because... Well, he tells me things that \\nI didn\\'t previously know. \\nFor example... \\nYour name isn\\'t Susan. \\nIt\\'s Hope Van Dyne. \\nAnd your unseen associate, \\nthat\\'s your father, Hank Pym. \\n- That\\'s not good, Hank. \\n- No shit. \\nWhat do you want? \\nRelationships are \\nbuilt on trust, Hope. \\nAnd I want our relationship \\nto have a strong foundation. \\n- Our relationship? \\n- Well, business landscape\\'s been shifting, Hope. Hell, screw it. I don\\'t even exist \\nanymore. But now, Hank Pym? \\n- Hank Pym, is a real opportunity. \\n- Do you have a point? \\nYou think that I don\\'t know what \\nyou\\'ve been building? With all of this? Quantum technology. \\nAnd you can forget nano-tech. \\nForget AI. Forget cryptocurrency. \\nQuantum energy is the future. \\nIt\\'s the next gold rush. \\nI want in, Hope. \\nSo, as a gesture of goodwill, \\nPage 12/53\\nI\\'ve taken the liberty \\nof arranging some \\nbuyers for your lab. \\nStarting bid? \\nOne billion dollars. \\nThank you, \\nSonny. Really. \\nBut my father and I have something slightly more pressing than starting a business. So, I\\'ll just take the component. \\nAs arranged. \\nMy buyers don\\'t take \\nno for an answer. \\nSo, we\\'re either in business together, or we aren\\'t in business together. \\n- Then, I guess we aren\\'t. \\n- You can go. \\nBut, I\\'m afraid your money\\'s \\ngonna have to remain. \\nLet\\'s call it compensation \\nfor my injured feelings. \\nListen, Sonny. \\nThis is gonna be so much easier on \\neverybody if you just give me that component. No, the only thing you\\'re \\ntaking from here, is my heart. \\nBut it will mend in time. \\nOkay. \\n- So now, what? \\n- You\\'ll see. \\nShe said her and daddy \\nhad something pressing. \\nI wanna know what it is, \\'cause if they\\'re not working with us, they\\'re working with somebody. So find out. Name... \\nHold on. You \\ngave her wings? \\nNot my 36-feet chandelier! \\nStop firing! Stop! \\nAlright, take this. Go. \\nGo, go, go, go! \\nWings and blasters. \\nI take it you didn\\'t have \\nthat tech available for me? \\nPage 13/53\\nNo, I did. \\nIt\\'s a pleasure doing \\nbusiness with you, Sonny. \\nOh, our business isn\\'t \\nfinished yet, Hope. \\nI can assure \\nyou of that. \\nWhat the hell is that? \\nDad, are you \\nseeing this? \\nHope, get out of there! \\n- I gotta do something. \\n- Wait! \\nIt\\'s still a work in progress. \\nYou taught me that \\nkick. Remember? \\n- Yeah, great form. \\n- Those were the days. \\n- Whatever happened to us? \\n- Not the time, Scott. \\nDammit, where did he go? \\nI lost it. \\nI\\'m not seeing anything \\non the ant cams. \\nDad? \\nGive me that. Now. \\n- Are you okay? \\n- No. He got the lab. \\n- No. \\n- Come on. \\n- What was that? \\n- I don\\'t know. \\nBut we need to find somewhere to \\nregroup and figure out where the lab is. So where to now? \\nHow about my house? Mmm? \\nI\\'m supposed to be there anyway. \\n- Woo could walk in any second. \\n- Exactly why we\\'re not going to your house. What about your house? \\nSorry. \\nThere is one place \\nI can think of. \\nNo. \\nPage 14/53\\nNo, no! No! No! \\nNo! \\nWow, Dr. Pym. \\nLike, who would\\'ve thought \\nthat, once again, \\nin your hour of need, that you \\nwould turn to us? You know? \\nNot me. \\nHelp yourself. \\nThat was overexpensive pastry. \\nWe gotta keep the food budget down. \\nWell, what are we supposed \\nto have for breakfast? \\n- The oatmeal packets. \\n- Oatmeal packets. \\n- It\\'s insult. \\n- Why\\'s it insult? \\n- Because it takes like sand. \\n- You know why? Cause it\\'s organic. \\n- That is not organic. It\\'s sand. \\n- The most important meal of the day. \\nYou know what, you can get creative \\nwith it. Put a little brown sugar on it. Sprinkle some cinnamon... \\nGuys, guys, guys, guys! \\nCome on, man! \\nWe got bigger fish to fry. \\n- Is that my desk? \\n- Yeah. \\nWhat? Why do I have \\nsuch a small desk? \\n- Cause you weren\\'t there when we\\'re choosing desks. - You snooze, you lose. \\n- I was under house arrest. \\n- Yeah! \\nYou know what, this isn\\'t \\neven a desk. This is garbage. \\nYou found this outside \\namongst garbage. \\nI got it out of \\nrummage sale. \\n- So, you saved money on my desk? \\n- Guys. \\nHope, please! We need \\nPage 15/53\\nto focus. All right? \\nWe gotta find that \\nlab already. Geez. \\nOh, you know what? I heard stories, like what happened to you. \\nLike this crazy, creepy cat who like, walks through walls and stuff. \\nLike a... Like a Ghost! \\nLike Baba Yaga. \\nBaba Yaga. A witch. \\nThey tell stories to \\nchildren to frighten them. \\nYou know Baba Yaga? \\nWhoever stole it... \\nWe need to find it. \\nWell, you don\\'t find \\nsomeone like that. \\n- They find you. \\n- Like Baba Yaga. \\nDr. Pym, you\\'re like the \\nsmartest genius I know. \\nDid you put some kind \\nof lojack on your lab? \\nBecause if you didn\\'t, we have a variety of affordable options. \\nOf course, I did, Luis. \\nIt was disabled. \\nWhoever stole the lab knew \\nexactly what they were doing. \\n- They also looked like they were phasing. - Phasing? \\nQuantum phasing. When an object \\nmoves through different states of matter. Oh, yeah. That\\'s what \\nI was thinking. \\nThe lab emits radiation. Could we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it? That could work, yes. But all \\nof my equipment is in the lab. \\nWell, where else can \\nwe find that equipment? \\nWell, there is one person. \\n- Bill Foster. \\n- Great! \\nPage 16/53\\nWho\\'s Bill Foster? \\nHe\\'s an old colleague \\nof my Dad\\'s. From SHIELD. \\n- They had a falling out years ago. \\n- You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people. It\\'s probably just \\na waste of time. \\nHey, I\\'m risking everything by being \\nhere. Don\\'t you think we should check? \\nWe need to find out \\nwho took the lab. \\nGuys, it\\'s not a good idea \\nto be out in the open like this. \\nRelax. No one\\'s gonna \\nrecognize us. \\nWhat, because of hats \\nand sunglasses? \\nIt\\'s not a disguise, Hank. \\nWe look like ourselves \\nin a baseball game. \\nIn an isolated system... \\nParticles co-exist in a \\nstable phase relationship. If \\nthe system is interfered with, \\nthat stability becomes chaos. \\nUnpredictable. \\nDangerous. \\nBeautiful. \\nIsolated completely, a quantum system would revert back to separate states of matter. Each entangled with a distinct \\nstate of its environment. \\nIn other words... \\nThe object in question would \\nbe both in and out of phase \\nwith multiple parallel realities. \\nSpeaking of being out \\nof phase with reality... \\nI am noticing an unusally high number \\nof glazed eyes out there among you. \\nSo, why don\\'t we call \\nit a few minutes early. \\nThat will be enough for today, thank \\nyou, ladies and gentlemen. You may go. \\nPage 17/53\\nIt\\'s incredible. \\nYour link to Janet. \\nIt\\'s Quantum entanglement, \\nbetween the quantum states composed of her molecules and your brains. Yeah. It\\'s what I \\nwas thinking. \\nDo you guys just put the word \\n\\'quantum\\' in front of everything? Doctor, we need to find our lab. Hope, I\\'d love to help you but I don\\'t have the equipment you\\'re describing. I told you this was a waste of time. Come on. Let\\'s go. \\nDon\\'t condescend, Hank. \\nYou\\'re the one who\\'s on \\nthe run from the FBI. \\nAll because you had \\nto grow to a size \\nthat finally fit your ego. \\nThat wasn\\'t me in Germany. \\nIt was this idiot. \\nReally? \\nGoing that big must\\'ve \\nbeen exhausting. \\nI slept for three days straight. You have no idea. \\nActually, I do. \\nBack in the day, I was Hank\\'s partner in a project called Goliath. \\nExcuse me, you were my partner? The only thing more tiring \\nthan going that big, \\nis putting up with \\nHank\\'s bullshit. \\nHow big did you get? \\nMy record? \\nTwenty-one feet. \\n- Not bad. \\n- You? \\n- I don\\'t... \\n- No, really. I\\'m curious. \\n- Sixty-five feet. Yeah. \\n- Whoa. \\nPage 18/53\\n- Huge. \\n- Sixty-five. \\nIf you two are finished \\ncomparing sizes... \\nWe need to figure out a way \\nto track down the lab. \\nAnd the great Hank Pym hasn\\'t \\nfigured that one out yet? Strange. He had all the answers back in the day. That\\'s why I left the project. Left? I fired you. \\nBest decision I ever made. \\nHank was a terrible partner. \\nTemperamental. Stubborn. \\nImpatient. \\nSooner or later he just \\npushed everyone away. \\nJust the mediocrities. \\nJanet was the only one who could endure him and chose to stick it out. Watch it, Bill. \\nShe paid the price \\nthough, didn\\'t she? \\nYou son of a... \\nWe didn\\'t come here to \\nlisten to you two squabble. \\nI\\'m trying to save my Mother. \\nIt\\'s Woo. \\nSomeone must have seen me. \\nRelax. If this is about you \\nthey\\'d be in your house by now. - What are you, fifteen? \\n- Come on. We gotta go, right now. Wait! You might be able to \\nimprovise that tracker. \\nIf you modify the defraction \\nunits on one of your regulators. - That could work. \\n- I don\\'t know what that means. Thank you. \\nBut Doctor, campus police says they ID\\'d both Pym and Van Dyne. I don\\'t know what \\nto tell you, agent. \\nPage 19/53\\nI haven\\'t talked to \\nHank in thirty years. \\nI can assure you I\\'m the last \\nperson he would wanna visit. \\n- Oh, come on. You expect us to... - Hey, hey. \\n- Why is that? \\n- Simple. \\nWe hate each other\\'s guts. \\nSo I\\'m a terrible partner? \\nFoster, he hasn\\'t had one good idea in his unremarkable career. But his idea about the \\ndefractors could work. \\nFine, one decent idea. \\nExcept I eliminated the defractors when I upgraded the suits. \\nSo if we had an old suit, \\nwe might be able to \\ntrack down the lab? \\nYes. But we don\\'t. \\n- What if we did? \\n- What do you mean? \\nI mean... \\n- Life\\'s funny... \\n- Oh, my God. \\n- You didn\\'t destroy the suit. - What?! \\nWell, it was your life\\'s work, Hank. I couldn\\'t destroy that. \\nBefore I turned myself in, I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis. You sent my suit \\nthrough the mail? \\nHey, the postal service is \\nvery reliable, you know? \\nThey do tracking numbers now. \\nLike UPS. \\nWhere is it? \\nIt\\'s in a very safe place, alright? Don\\'t worry. \\nWhat, the trophy? \\nNo, it\\'s not here. \\nWhat do you mean it\\'s not there? Page 20/53\\nWhere could it be? \\nI\\'ve looked everywhere. \\nIt\\'s not here. \\nHey. Get away from the table. \\nI put it back out \\nto Cassie, and I... \\nShow and tell. \\nScotty? \\nWell, the good news is, \\nI know where it is. \\nWhenever you go back to school, isn\\'t everything supposed to look so much smaller? This place seems huge. Ah! \\n- What is it? \\n- It\\'s the new regulator. \\nHank, what\\'s going \\non with this suit? \\nHow much of a work \\nin progress is this? \\nUh-oh. Oh, no. \\nNo, no, no. \\nWhat, are you laughing? \\nPlease, can you just... \\nOkay. Okay. \\nWhat do you see? \\nThe sizing coils are \\nmalfunctioning. \\nJust let me... \\nOww! \\n- Sorry. \\n- It\\'s all right. \\nOkay. \\nAll right. \\nTry it now. \\nSo... \\nAwesome. \\nIf only Cap could see you now. \\nHilarious. What are we gonna do? \\nHey! \\nWhere\\'s your hall pass? \\nHey, I\\'m talking to you. \\nHey! \\nHey... \\nYou can do it. You \\nPage 21/53\\nalmost got it! \\nOh, Peanut. \\nOkay. Let\\'s go. \\nHiya, Champ! How \\nwas school today? \\nHahaha. Alright, get \\nyour jokes out now. \\n- Can you fix the suit? \\n- He\\'s so cranky. \\nYou want a juice box \\nand some string cheese? \\nDo you really have that? \\nLet\\'s see if Foster was right. \\nThis has got to be the lab. \\n- Let\\'s go get it. \\n- Yeah. \\nThis seems right. \\nLook at us. Teaming \\nup twice in one day. \\nMakes you think, huh? \\n- About what? \\n- Germany? \\n- What do you mean? \\n- We were working together. \\nTraining together. And, \\nother stuff-ing together. \\nIf I\\'d have asked you, \\nwould you have come? \\nI guess we\\'ll never know. \\nBut I do know one thing. \\nWhat? \\nIf I had, you\\'d have \\nnever been caught. \\nHey, Scott. \\nYou think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter long enough to get my lab? - Yes, sir. \\n- Thank you. \\nOkay. You\\'re transmitting. \\nWhat took you so long? \\nSorry, I had to come up \\nwith a name for my ant. \\nI\\'m thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant. - Like it? \\nPage 22/53\\n- Hilarious. \\nI\\'m not getting anything on the monitors. There\\'s some kind of electronic disturbance. - Be careful. \\n- You know me, Hank. \\nI\\'m always care--- Whoa! \\n- It\\'s okay. It\\'s just a suit. \\n- How do you know? \\nLook. \\nThat\\'s Ghost? \\nWhat is she doing? \\nYou think that suit is how she \\ngoes through walls and stuff? \\nLet\\'s just get out of \\nhere before she wakes up. \\nHope, look. There\\'s the lab. \\nWe\\'re sure this is our shrunken building and not somebody else\\'s, right? \\nJust take it, Scott. \\nWe gotta be fast. \\nI\\'ll get it. \\nOh, sh... \\nHope. \\nHank. \\nGuys? \\nI don\\'t think they can hear you. \\nHi. \\nI\\'m Ava. \\nScott. \\nSo... \\nYou don\\'t need a suit to, uhh... \\nYou know. \\nGo through things. \\nNo. \\nIt just helps me control it. \\nAnd the pain. Supposedly. \\nYou\\'re not gonna reach into my \\nchest and crush my heart, are you? You\\'re funny. \\nI\\'m not gonna hurt you \\nScott, unless I have to. \\nI need... \\nWhat\\'s in your head. \\nLet\\'s wake up the rest of the gang Page 23/53\\nand get this over with, shall we? Get up! Come on! \\nDad? \\nDon\\'t ever touch him again. \\nNow, now, Hope... \\nI think I\\'m being rather gentle with your Father, all things considered. What the hell are \\nyou talking about? \\nAnother casualty \\nof Hank Pym\\'s ego. \\nBill. \\nWhat have you done? \\nIt\\'s what you\\'ve done, Dr. Pym. \\nYou with her? \\nAw, man. I thought \\nyou were cool. \\nWhat the hell is going on here? \\nI doubt Hank have ever mentioned my Father. Why would he? \\nElihas Starr. \\nThey were colleagues at SHIELD. \\nQuantum research. \\nUntil my Father dared to disagree with the great Hank Pym. \\nYou had him fired. Oh, and \\ndiscredited for good measure. \\nMy father tried to continue \\nhis research on his own. \\nDesperate to restore his \\nname, so he took risks. \\nNo! \\nToo many. \\nUntil something went wrong. \\nHe told us to run. \\n- Elihas, what\\'s happening? \\n- Just go. Go! \\nDaddy! \\nI can tell he was scared. \\n- Daddy! \\n- Ava, no! \\nI didn\\'t want him to be alone. \\nNo! No! \\nWhen I woke up, my \\nPage 24/53\\nparents were dead. \\nI wasn\\'t so lucky. \\nThey call it \"Molecular \\nDisequilibrium.\" \\nA rather dull name, I think. \\nDoesn\\'t quite do justice \\nto what it means. \\nEvery cell, in my body, is torn apart and stitched back together. Over, and over, everyday. \\nI was still at SHIELD \\nwhen I got the call about a \\n\"quantum anomaly\" in Argentina. Hello, Ava. \\nMy name is Bill. \\nI was a friend of your Father\\'s. I brought you something. \\nIt\\'s all right. Try again. \\nThat\\'s it. \\nDr. Foster did his \\nbest to keep me safe. \\nBut others at SHIELD saw an \\nopportunity in my affliction. \\nThey built me a containment suit so I can control my phasing. \\nAnd trained me to be \\na stealth operative. \\nThey weaponized me. \\nI stole for them, \\nspied for them... \\nI killed for them. \\nAnd in exchange for my soul, \\nthey were going to cure me. \\nThey lied. \\nWhen SHIELD collapsed, \\nI took Ava in. \\nI built the chamber to slow \\nher decay, but her condition \\nwas progressive. I didn\\'t \\nknow how to cure her. \\nShe wanted to kill you, Hank. \\nBut I told her, no. \\nAnd that she should watch you instead. And sure enough, \\nPage 25/53\\nshe discovered that you \\nwere building a tunnel. \\nThen she told me about Lang. \\nAnd the message from \\nJanet inside his head... \\n- For Christ\\'s sake! \\n- That\\'s me. I\\'m sorry. \\nLook, can you tell \\nme who\\'s texting me? \\nCassie. 911. \\nThat\\'s my daughter. I \\nneed to text her back. \\nNo. That\\'s not happening. \\nIt\\'s 911. That means \\nit\\'s an emergency! \\nYou\\'re not making \\ndemands here, Lang. \\nYou\\'re not appreciating \\nthe gravity of the... \\nOkay, well, she\\'s trying to videochat me now. Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please! \\nCassie, are you okay? \\nWhat\\'s the emergency? \\n- I can\\'t find my soccer shoes. - What? \\nI have a game tomorrow. \\nHey, Scott, I know \\nthat they\\'re there. \\nCan you just walk the \\nphone around the house? \\n- No, I can\\'t do that right now. - Why not? \\nBecause I\\'m sick. \\nHey, can you just maybe look around later then call me back? Please? Thank you. - Bye, Daddy! \\n- Bye, Peanut! \\n- Feel better! \\n- Feel better, buddy! \\nI\\'m sorry. It\\'s \\nthat emergency. \\nAva, I wanna help you. \\nShe doesn\\'t need your help. \\nPage 26/53\\nI know how to save her. \\n- Oh, really? How? \\n- Janet. \\nFor the last 30 years, she\\'s been down there absorbing quantum energy. We can extract that energy. We can use it to repair Ava\\'s molecular structure... - Extract it? \\n- Yes! \\nAre you insane? That \\nwould rip Janet apart! \\nYou don\\'t know that. I\\'m \\ngonna fire up your tunnel. \\nWhen Janet\\'s location pops into Lang\\'s head, he\\'s gonna give it to me, \\n- or I\\'m gonna turn him over to the FBI. - What? \\nYou\\'re gonna stay here just \\nin case I need your help. \\n- Like hell, I would help you! \\n- You\\'ll do whatever I say. \\n- You\\'re gonna kill Janet. \\n- I\\'d be more worried about yourself, Hank. Goddammit, Bill! \\n- Dad? \\n- Calm down, Hank. \\nSo help me, God... \\nIt\\'s his heart! He needs \\nhis pills, please. \\nDr. Foster, they\\'re \\nin the tin, please. \\nHe could die! For... come on! \\nHelp him! \\nDad, just hang on, alright? \\nJust keep breathing. Stay calm. \\n- Help him, man! Come on! \\n- The Altoid tin! \\nWait! \\nThanks, guys! \\nHank! \\nBill is filling that \\ngirl\\'s head with lies. \\nElihas Starr was a traitor. \\nHe stole my plans. \\nPage 27/53\\nNow, bring her down. \\nRight, lock it in. \\nNo, no, no. The bolt \\nis on the other side. \\nTighten that one down, then \\nbring her down with one knock. \\n- Good job. \\n- It\\'ll work. \\nFoster, he could\\'ve fried \\nthe entire system. \\nLook, we\\'ll adjust the relays while you go reprogram the settings. All right? It\\'s gonna be fine. \\n- So, this is it. \\n- Yeah. \\nYou\\'d think with all this time \\nto prepare, I\\'d be more ready. \\nWell, going subatomic isn\\'t \\nsomething you can prepare for. \\nIt kind of, melts your mind. \\n- I mean, seeing my Mom again. \\n- Oh. \\nWhat if she\\'s a completely \\ndifferent person? \\nYeah, like George Washington? \\n- I\\'m serious, Scott. \\n- Or, George Jefferson? \\nWhat if she\\'s \\nforgotten about me? \\nWhen I was in prison... \\nThe only thing that got \\nme through was Cassie. \\nI could\\'ve been locked up for 100 years. I never would\\'ve forgotten her. I know your Mom is counting the minutes until she can see you again. Thank you. \\n- Hey. \\n- We\\'ve got a big problem. \\nYou forgot the motion sensor lights on the back of the building. \\nNo. \\nThey\\'re on the proposal, and Karapetyan asked for them specifically. \\nPage 28/53\\nUh, yeah. Look, it\\'s \\nbeen a little crazy... \\nLook, maybe I can stop by \\ntomorrow and take a look at it. \\nNo, no, no, no! \\nThe meeting is first thing in the morning. You gotta come right now and fix it. I can\\'t. I wish I could, \\nbut I can\\'t leave. \\nYou know what, I\\'m coming to you. I\\'ll just explain the plans, and get it on the laptop, and \\nyou can fix them in. \\n- Just tell me where you are, okay? - It\\'s complicated. \\nWhat do you mean, \\nit\\'s complicated? \\nAs you can see, sir... \\nThis system is state-of-the-art. Security of tomorrow... today! \\nOh, that\\'s so good! I love the \\nlead-in, Bro. Keep practicing. \\nHey, I just gotta drive on to \\nScotty\\'s, so he can fix the plans. But don\\'t worry. I\\'ll be \\nback in plenty of time. \\nAs you can see, sir... \\nOh! Oh! Oh! \\nTell me you got the van \\nwashed for tomorrow morning. \\nDown to the undercarriage, baby. - You sprung for the undercarriage wash? - Well, you said get the works. \\nThat\\'s a scam, Bro. We live in \\nCalifornia, not Minnesota! \\nHe\\'s right. \\nThe undercarriage wash. \\nThat\\'s for cleaning \\noff road salt. \\nLaid out in all those \\nsnow-laden sister states. \\nWho are you and why do you know \\nso much about car wash protocol? Well, my name is Sonny Burch. \\nPage 29/53\\nAnd I do my research, Luis. \\nTo wit, I have learned, \\nfrom a friend of mine, \\nat the FBI, that you\\'re a \\nknown associate of Scott Lang. A known associate of Hank Pym. Who I\\'ve also learned, \\nhas a portable frickin\\' laboratory. Filled with all kinds of juicy tech. And you\\'re gonna \\ntell me where it is. \\nWell, I hate to break it to you, but I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about. Well, I sense a \\nresistance in you, Luis. \\nAnd I have promised results \\nto some dangerous people. \\nSo, I\\'m gonna introduce you, \\nto my good friend Uzman. \\nNow, Uzman, is a master \\nat extracting information from the unwillin\\' through psychoactive means. Oh, is that truth serum? \\nThere\\'s no such thing \\nas truth serum. \\nThat\\'s just nonsense from TV. \\n- What is it, then? \\n- It\\'s a little concoction, \\nthat he\\'s been perfecting \\nsince his days with the SIS. \\nIt makes you suggestible. \\nAnd highly responsive. \\n- Dude, that\\'s truth serum! \\n- No, it\\'s not. \\nNo fencing, but, \\n- this sound like truth serum to me. - Right?! \\n- It\\'s not a truth serum. \\n- Oh, okay. Hey, I believe you. It\\'s not a truth serum. \\nIf it walk like duck, \\nand talk like ducks... \\nIt\\'s truth serum. \\nWell, I have a lot of allergies. Page 30/53\\nSo... \\nYou might wanna \\nthink about that. \\nTime to get that lab back. \\nWhat? \\nThe chamber and the suit are \\nbarely helping anymore. \\nHow long have I got? \\nA couple of weeks, maybe. \\nWell then, we\\'ll make \\nthem bring the lab back. \\nHow? \\nLang. He has a daughter, right? You can\\'t mean that. Ava? \\nI tolerate a lot of the \\nthings you do out there, \\nbut I won\\'t be a part \\nof anything like that. \\nYou\\'re not the one who\\'s about to fade away into nothing, Bill. I am! \\nYou said you could fix me. \\nYou promised! \\nI know. I will. \\nBut not like that. \\nYou let one finger on \\nthat little girl... \\nI won\\'t help you. \\nAnd we\\'re done. \\nFine. \\nThere are other options. \\nYou know what? You\\'re right. \\nThis isn\\'t truth serum. \\n\\'Cause I don\\'t feel anything. \\nThat was a lie. I \\ndid feel something. \\n- This is truth serum! \\n- There\\'s no such thing. \\nOkay! \\nOkay, okay. \\nNow I\\'m gonna make this \\nreal easy for you, Luis. \\nOkay. \\nWhere... \\nPage 31/53\\nis Scott Lang? \\nWell, see, that\\'s complicated. \\'Cause when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place. And I\\'m not talking about cell block D. \\nHis wife had just filed for divorce. \\nAnd I was like, \"Damn, homie, she \\ndumped you while you were in lock-up?\" \\nAnd he\\'s like, \"Yeah, I know. I thought \\nI was gonna be with her forever, \\nbut now, I\\'m all alone!\" \\nAnd I was like, \"Damn, homie, you gotta \\nchin up. \\'Cause you\\'ll find a new partner. But you know what? I\\'m Luis.\" \\nAnd he says, \"You know what? I\\'m Scotty. And we\\'re gonna be best friends.\" \\nWait, hold on, hold on. \\nNow I like a good story as much as the next person, but what\\'s this have to do with where Scott Lang is? I\\'m getting there, \\nI\\'m getting there. \\nYou put a dime in him, you got \\nto let the whole song play out. \\nHe hit like human jukebox. \\nOh! My abuelita had a \\njukebox in a restaurant. \\nYeah. Only played Morrissey. \\nAnd if anybody ever complained, \\nshe\\'d be like, \"Oh, porque? Gusta mas?\" \\nAnd El Chicanos, we call \\nthem mas, \"then, adios!\" \\nWhat can I say? We relate to these \\nmelancholy bandits, you know? \\n- Lang. \\n- Right, right, right, right. \\nSo anyway, this guy gets out of \\njail and starts working for Hank. \\nAnd that\\'s when he met Hope. \\nAnd Hope\\'s all like, \\n\"I want nothing to do with you. Look \\nat my hairdo. I\\'m all business.\" \\nAnd then Scotty\\'s like, \\n\"You know what, girl? My heart\\'s all broken, and I\\'ll probably never find love again. But damn, if I \\nPage 32/53\\nwant to kiss you!\" \\nBut then you fast-forward and they\\'re \\nall like into each other, right? \\nAnd then Scotty\\'s like, \"You know \\nwhat, I can\\'t tell you this, \\nbut I\\'m gonna go trashing the \\nairport with Captain America!\" \\nThen she said, \"I can\\'t believe you split \\nlike that! Smell you later, dummy!\" \\nSo Scotty goes on house arrest, and he \\nwon\\'t admit it, but his heart\\'s all like, \\n\"Damn! I thought Hope could\\'ve been \\nmy new true partner. But I blew it!\" \\nBut fate brought them back together, \\nand then Hope\\'s heart is all, \\n\"I\\'m worried that I can\\'t trust him. And he\\'s \\ngonna screw up again and ruin everything.\" \\nAnd in my heart, it\\'s all like, \\n\"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company\\'s rent. And we\\'re days away from going out of business! Oooh!\" - Out of business? \\n- Days away?! \\nDamn truth serum! I was \\ntrying to protect you guys. \\nI swear to God. I was trying to \\nbe a good boss. But we\\'re broke. \\nAnd the Karapetyans are our last hope, \\nand if we don\\'t show up, we\\'re done! \\n- That\\'s terrible bossing. \\n- Damn, Bro! \\n- That\\'s on me. That\\'s on me! \\n- Hey! \\nEnough. \\nI\\'m gonna ask you \\none more time... \\nWhere is Scott Lang? \\nI\\'ve been trying to tell you. He\\'s in \\na tricky spot, emotionally speaking. \\nEmotionally speaking. \\nBut where is Scott Lang, \\nliterally speaking?! \\nOh! The woods. \\nThe woods? \\nBaba Yaga! \\nPage 33/53\\nWhat do you mean, the woods? \\nThe Muir woods! \\nFor God\\'s sake! \\nBaba Yaga, coming late, little \\nchildren, sleep at eight. \\nDamn it! \\nIf that freak gets Pym\\'s tech, \\nI\\'m never gonna see it. \\nSo what do we do now? \\nIt\\'s easier to steal it from the \\nfeds than from a boogeyman. \\nHey. It\\'s me. \\nHow\\'d you like to \\nget a promotion? \\nI\\'ve got the location on \\nPym, Van Dyne, and Lang. \\nBut you\\'re gonna have to take them down now, \\'cause they ain\\'t gonna be there for long. And when you do, you\\'re \\ngonna get me that lab. \\nUnderstood. \\nGood news, gentlemen. \\nFeds are gonna do the \\nhard work for us. \\nWhat are you looking at? \\nChange my tire! \\nSir... \\nCan you knock? \\nSorry, sir. But I \\njust got a lead. \\nOoh. I love leads. \\n- Systems in the green. \\n- Priming the coils. \\nFull charge. \\nSoon as the tunnel\\'s open, let us know if you get anything that could be part of her message. Yeah, yeah. I will. \\nOkay, then. \\nHere it goes. \\nWe did it! \\nYou got anything? \\nNothing. \\nJust give it a minute. \\nBecause it could... \\nPage 34/53\\nNo. No, no, no! \\n- What\\'s happening? \\n- It\\'s shutting down. Maybe vectors are off. We\\'ve gone over them a million times. I know they\\'re right. \\n- Well then, what else could it be? - I don\\'t know. \\n- Scott, what are you doing? \\n- Scott, get away from that! \\nScott, we had... \\nI\\'m sorry. I don\\'t know how much time I have. I need to fix the algorithm. Trust me, after 30 \\nyears down here... \\nI\\'ve thought about it a lot. \\nJanet? \\nHi, Hon. \\nHello, Jellybean. \\nMom? \\nIt\\'s not the reunion I had \\nimagined. It\\'s all so rushed. \\nYou two have done \\nsuch great work. \\nYou just need \\na little... \\nnudge. \\nJanet, how is \\nthis possible? \\nIt wasn\\'t a message you put in \\nScott\\'s head. It was an antenna. \\nClever girl. \\nI\\'m so proud of you. \\nHoney, tell us where you are. \\nTell us how to find you. \\nNo, the probability fields are too complex. That\\'s why I needed to talk to you. You have to \\nfollow my voice. \\n- Of course. \\n- Like tracing a call back to its source. I\\'m tracking your signal using \\nsubatomic frequencies, \\nbetween point \\n2 and point 9. \\nPage 35/53\\n- I\\'ve narrowed it to 4 and 6. \\n- It\\'s too tight. We could miss you. Look at us squabbling again. \\nFine. Between 3 and 7. \\nOur first fight in decades \\nand it\\'s over just like that. \\nBull\\'s eye. \\n- Source lock. \\n- It\\'s you! \\nHa! We got it! \\nYou have to meet me in \\nthese exact coordinates. \\nIn the wasteland, beyond \\nthe quantum void. \\nIt\\'s very dangerous, especially on \\nthe human mind. So be careful. \\nTime and space work \\nvery differently down here. \\nYou have two hours. After that, \\nthe probability fields will shift, \\nand it\\'ll be another century \\nbefore they\\'ll align like this again. We\\'ll find you. \\nI know you \\nwill, Jellybean. \\nNope. \\nNothing. I got nothing. \\nNo sign of Janet. \\nHow did we get up here? \\nAt first, you\\'ll see all kinds of lights, and it\\'s gonna get really trippy \\nbut then it\\'s gonna turn black \\nand silent. Like, really silent. \\nScott, I\\'ll be fine. \\n- I\\'m just saying. Cause I\\'ve been down there. - Yeah, so you\\'ve mentioned. \\nUm, sorry. I have \\nto take this. \\nHey, man. You coming? \\nNo, I\\'m not. But you \\nknow what? Ghost is. \\nAnd you know what? The \\nfeds, they know where you are. \\n- What? \\nPage 36/53\\n- I\\'m sorry, I\\'m sorry. \\nThey gave me some truth serum, then all of a sudden I started talking all honestly, like, I hate the way that you \\nuse the dishwasher. I hate it. \\nBut you need to go home because \\nthe feds are probably going there now! And by the way, who puts the \\nplates on the top rack, okay? \\nThey don\\'t go there! \\nI feel like \\nsuch a jerk. \\nYou\\'re gonna be really \\nmad. We gotta go. \\n- What? \\n- Ghost knows where we are. \\n- So does the FBI. \\n- How? \\n- I told Luis where we are. \\n- You what? \\nI told him to come here, so I can help him with the Karapetyan proposal. Oh, my God! \\nBut... Look, we need to land that account. Otherwise, we\\'ll lose the business! Do you know how hard it is for ex cons to find work these days? \\nJesus, Scott! \\n90 seconds to \\nclose the aperture. \\n- You have to depolarize the coils first. - I know. \\nI\\'m really sorry, but the... \\nFBI is coming \\nto my place, so... \\nI have to go. \\nCan I borrow the suit? \\nLook, uhh... I\\'m just \\ngonna borrow the suit. \\nI\\'ll come back. Just \\ntell me where you\\'ll be. \\n- Don\\'t bother. \\n- What? \\nWe\\'ll come and get the suit from \\nPage 37/53\\nyou as soon as we find my Mom. \\n- Hope... \\n- Scott, just go! \\n- Scott? \\n- Daddy? \\n- It\\'s us, buddy! \\n- We\\'re here for Cassie\\'s shoes. \\nHe must be resting. \\nHoney, why don\\'t you go up the \\nstairs and go look under your bed. Daddy? You upstairs? \\nDaddy... \\nWhat the? \\nReally lives like \\na pig these days. \\nDaddy? \\nSpread out! \\n- Again? \\n- You people have no shame! \\n- The monitor says that he\\'s in the bathroom. - Yeah. I\\'m not buying it. \\nCassie, let \\nthe man get by. \\n- But Daddy\\'s super sick! \\n- I\\'ll see about that. \\nHe says he doesn\\'t want \\nanyone else to get sick. \\nWell, I\\'ll take my \\nchances, sweetie. \\nHe barfed. Like, a lot. \\nYoung lady, I\\'m a federal agent. \\nI\\'ve seen worse things than vomit. - Like, a lot, a lot? \\n- Yes! \\n- Forget it. Move aside. \\n- No! \\nWoo! \\n- What are you doing here? \\n- Scott. \\nI\\'m sorry. I\\'m just really sick. \\nI told you. \\nExcuse me. Sometimes you \\njust gotta get it out, you know? \\nSorry. \\nPage 38/53\\nI\\'ll start the van. \\nYou get the lab. \\nFreeze! You\\'re surrounded! \\nHank Pym. Hope Van Dyne. \\nYou\\'re under arrest. \\n- This is harassment. \\n- Actually, it\\'s not. \\nWhat does the FBI even stand for? \\nForever Bothering Individuals? \\n- His monitor check out? \\n- Of course, it does. \\nDamn it. It\\'s like I just got \\nfed a bowl of malarkey. \\nWe got them, sir. Pym and \\nVan Dyne are in custody. \\nSeriously? Yes! \\nOh. Sorry, Scott. They were \\nyour friends. That\\'s insensitive. \\nI just really needed a \\nwin, you know? Anyway... \\nI\\'ll be back later for the official end of your sentence. Sorry for misjudging you, pal. You should feel \\ngreat about yourself. \\nWhat is it? \\nWe have a man down, \\nand Pym\\'s lab is gone. \\nHey. \\n- Thanks for covering for me. \\n- Sure. \\nSo.. \\nHow long have you \\nbeen Ant-Man again? \\nNot long. \\nThings just sort \\nof happened. \\nI\\'m sorry, for lying to you. I\\'m \\nsorry for risking everything. \\n- Dad, it\\'s okay. \\n- That\\'s not... \\nI do some dumb things, and the people that I love the most pay the price. \\nMainly, you. \\nTrying to help \\nPage 39/53\\npeople isn\\'t dumb. \\nWell... \\nI screw it up just \\nabout every time. \\nSo maybe, you just need \\nsomeone watching your back. \\nLike a partner. \\nWell, she\\'s made it clear that\\'s about the last thing she wants. - Who? \\n- Hope. \\n- What, who did you think? \\n- Me. \\nYou? \\nDon\\'t laugh. \\n- I\\'d be a great partner. \\n- Oh, Peanut! \\nYou would be awesome. \\nAnd if I let you, I would \\nbe a terrible Dad. \\nFine. \\nHave Hope be your \\npartner. She\\'s smart. \\nShe reminds me of you. \\nYou gonna go help her? \\nI think you should help her. \\nI wish I could, but... \\nI don\\'t know how I can help \\nher without hurting you. \\nYou can do it. You \\ncan do anything. \\nYou\\'re the World\\'s \\nGreatest Grandma. \\nAgent Woo will \\nsee you in an hour. \\nAn hour? We don\\'t \\nhave an hour. \\nAww. You got somewhere \\nelse to be? \\nNow, that\\'s my girl. \\nAlright, what\\'s our plan? \\nTo shrink that wall. \\nIt looks load bearing. \\nCeiling could collapse... \\nPage 40/53\\n- Then we run like hell. \\n- It\\'s made up of 15-20 agents on the floor. Roughly five times that \\nin the building at large. \\n- They\\'re all heavily armed. \\n- Not great odds. \\n- You got any better ideas? \\n- Nope. \\nBut I\\'m not giving \\nup on Mom. \\nShe\\'d be so proud of you. \\nOkay. \\nOne... \\nTwo... \\nScott? \\nWhat are you two just \\nstanding around for? \\nWe gotta go \\nfind that lab. \\nWhat about me? \\nPerfect. \\nHurry up and get dressed. \\nWe don\\'t have much time. \\nSir. \\nOkay. Now what? \\nYou\\'re asking me? \\nGet in! \\nHi. \\nHi. \\nUhh, excuse me. Are we \\nplanning on leaving soon, \\nor are you two gonna keep staring at each other until they start shooting at us. - Hey, Burch. \\n- Yeah? \\n- Yeah. They\\'re out. \\n- I\\'m on my way. \\n- As soon as we see him, so was the van. - How could this happen? \\nWhat the dickens? \\nThank you. \\nYou\\'re welcome. \\nSo, uhh... How do \\nwe find the lab? \\nPage 41/53\\nAfter I lost it the first time, \\nI put on a new tracker... \\n...of sorts. \\nThat\\'ll work. \\nIs it ready or not? \\nWe can begin the \\nextraction process now. \\nListen, Ava, this whole thing \\ncould be very dangerous. \\n- Maybe, maybe we should... \\n- Maybe we should what? Wait? \\nI\\'ve got days until I\\'m dead. \\nWe\\'re doing this, Bill. Now. \\nEnergy readings show they \\nhave not used the tunnel yet. \\nWe don\\'t have much time before Mom\\'s \\nlocation shifts and we lose her. \\nYeah, and we have \\na lot to do before that. \\nYou know, my Pap-pap always said if you \\nwanna do something right, you make a list. So, we should do that. \\nOne, we have to \\nbreak into that lab. \\nTwo, we have to kick \\nout Foster and Ghost. \\nThree, we have to fight Ghost. That \\nseems like it should be part of 2. \\n2-A. Right? Let\\'s call it 2-A. \\nFight Ghost, 2-A. Oh! \\nAlso, we have to make sure that the lab is fully grown for you to come back. Otherwise we\\'re screwed... Scott... \\nYou want me to start \\nagain? I\\'ll start again. \\nI\\'m going to dive. \\nThe only chance we\\'ve got is if \\nthe 2 of you are out here \\ntogether, protecting the tunnel. \\nLet me do this, \\nHope. Please. \\nLet me get her. \\nI think he\\'s right. \\nWhassup? \\nPage 42/53\\nYou remember that \\nbeloved commercial? \\nWhassup? \\nI had him follow us here. \\nI thought we could \\nuse some help. \\nAll right. I\\'m in position. \\nThe ants are headed in. \\n- Copy that. \\n- Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty. - You want a pez? \\n- No. \\nGuess who gave me \\nthis for my birthday. \\nBy the way, \\nI love that suit! \\nThanks, man. \\nI wish I had a suit. \\nI would even like a suit with \\nlike minimal powers, you know? Or maybe, even just \\na suit. With no powers. \\nWhat is it? \\nI don\\'t know. \\nIt\\'s them. \\nThey can\\'t be far. \\nHank? Hank? \\nStop it! \\nDad, what\\'s your status? \\nFoster\\'s taken care \\nof. Suiting up, now. \\nI just wanted to save Ava. \\nShe\\'s facing death or something far more terrible. She\\'s afraid. I\\'ll help you find a cure when I get back. I promise. \\nTogether, we\\'ll figure \\nsomething out. \\nGood luck, Hank. \\nThanks, Bill. \\nNow, I\\'m gonna need \\nyou to step back. \\nTime remaining: \\nPage 43/53\\nfifteen minutes. \\nHank\\'s in, Scott. \\nAny sign of her? \\nNo. Nothing yet. \\nAva! \\nCall off the ants, Scott. \\nOh, boy. \\nCan I get a status report, cause I got some serious Ghost problems here! Ready to dive. \\n- In case I don\\'t make it... \\n- Don\\'t. Don\\'t say that. \\nI can\\'t lose you, too. \\nI love you, Hope. \\nGuys, everything\\'s bad \\nover here. Please... \\nNow. \\nMisdirection. \\nOne of the first things they teach you at Online Close-up Magic University. No! \\nAll right. We \\ngot it, Scotty. \\n- Meet us at the rendezvous point. - Okay. On my way. \\nOh, no. \\nReally? \\n- This guy? Again? \\n- Who? \\nI told you our business \\nwasn\\'t over. \\nChange of plans. \\nHang on. \\nI want that lab, boys. \\nWhatever it takes. \\nHold on. \\nOh! \\nThat undercarriage is filthy! \\nNow they have \\nbigger problems. \\nHope, what are you doing? You\\'re heading away from the rendezvous point. Don\\'t worry. I\\'m taking these \\nguys on the scenic route. \\nPage 44/53\\nWait, what \\nare you... Oh. \\nNo! \\nOh, my God! Oh, my God, we\\'re \\ngonna die! We\\'re gonna die! \\nSignal lost. \\nWhat the hell are \\nthey doing up there? \\nRecalibrating. \\nRecalibrating. \\nYou never said it was \\nso beautiful, Scott. \\nRecalibrating. \\nOkay. Anytime now. \\nRecalibrating. \\n- Recalibrating. \\n- Come on. \\nSignal restored. \\nBikes, it\\'s all on you. \\n- Take the wheel. \\n- What? Wait, Hope! \\nWell, the 60\\'s were fun. \\nBut now, I\\'m paying for it! \\nBe careful up there! \\nGive me a break. I haven\\'t \\ndriven in two years. \\nYou got pez\\'d! \\nUp here! \\nOh, that\\'s not good. \\nHope! \\nNo! \\nThere it is right there, the lab. Get it, get, get, get the lab!

Approaching \\nquantum void. \\nI\\'m coming to you, Honey. \\nGuys... \\nDon\\'t you need the \\nremote to the lab? \\nI just found it. \\nWe can\\'t grow the lab without it. Get it to us, fast. \\n- Yeah, but the van is busted. - Use the Hot Wheels Rally case. Wha? \\nI love you, Dr. Pym. \\nThe remote! We\\'re missing the remote. We gotta check the van. \\nHuh? \\nAwesome! \\nHey, I\\'m going left. But \\nBurch\\'s boys are all over me. \\n- I\\'m on my way. \\n- Right.

Like, the next time you do something bad. - I\\'ll be there. To catch you. - Ohh. \\nYou\\'ll be watching me. I thought you were inviting me somewhere. Why would I do that? \\nThat\\'s what I was wondering. \\nWhy would you do that either? \\nLike a party, or \\ndinner or something? \\nI don\\'t know. I thought you \\nwere planning the evening. \\nNo. I meant to, like, arrest you. Like, I\\'ll arrest you later again. - Take it easy. \\n- Okay. \\nDid you wanna go out \\ntonight or something? \\nI mean, \\'cause I\\'m free. \\nYeah. Come on. \\n- You ready? \\n- Yes! \\n- Daddy! \\n- Hi! \\nYes, that was a... \\n- 8: \\n- Sounds great. \\nMr. Karapetyan? \\nYeah, you saw that? \\nWell, it would be an honor to be in business with you as well. \\nI\\'ll see you Thursday, 9 A.M. \\nOkay. \\nThis is awesome. \\nSo, Cassie... \\nWhat do you wanna be \\nPage 52/53\\nwhen you grow up? \\nI wanna help people. \\nLike my Dad. \\nReally? \\nI wanted to be his partner. \\nBut he said he wants you. \\nIs that so? \\nDaddy! \\nHold on. \\n- Move!

I\\'m not interested.\\n\\n\\nYou defeated Steppenwolf and saved Atlantis.\\n\\n\\nThat had nothing to do with Atlantis.\\n\\n\\nYour half-brother King Orm is about to declare w*r upon the surface world.\\n\\n\\nBillions will die.\\n\\n\\nYour people and mine.\\n\\n\\nWe must stop him.\\n\\n\\nAnd how do you propose we do that?\\n\\n\\nYou are the firstborn son of Queen Atlanna.\\n\\n\\nThe throne is yours by birthright.\\n\\n\\nThe only way to stop this w*r and save both worlds is for you to take your rightful place as king.\\n\\n\\nYou think if I just show up, Orm\\'s gonna give up the throne?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m the bastard son of the queen your people ex*cuted.\\n\\n\\nTrust me. I am no king.\\n\\n\\nI agree.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s awesome. Cool.\\n\\n\\nBut, Vulko seems to believe in you for some reason, and that\\'s why I\\'m here.\\n\\n\\nVulko has learned of the location of the Lost Trident of Atlan.\\n\\n\\nOoh, fairy tales. It\\'s a myth.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s not a myth.\\n\\n\\nWith the Sacred Trident, the people will listen to you.\\n\\n\\nYou can then claim your birthright and dethrone Orm.\\n\\n\\nMy birthright? It d*ed with my mother.\\n\\n\\nBut I promise you this. If Orm att*cks, I will treat him exactly the same way your people treated her.\\n\\n\\nWith no mercy.\\n\\n\\nThat submarine was barely operational, but it served its purpose.\\n\\n\\nOne of your kind intervened.\\n\\n\\nHe is not one of us.\\n\\n\\nHe k*lled my father.\\n\\n\\nOur transaction has ended.\\n\\n\\nKeep the money. I want Aquaman.\\n\\n\\nDad!\\n\\n\\nDad!\\n\\n\\nDad!\\n\\n\\nPops!\\n\\n\\nPops!\\n\\n\\nCome on, Pops.\\n\\n\\nCome on! He\\'s not breathing.\\n\\n\\nMove! Let me help.\\n\\n\\nCome on, Pops.\\n\\n\\nCome on.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t even know your name.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s Princess Y\\'Mera Xebella Challa.\\n\\n\\nYou may call me Mera.\\n\\n\\nThank you, Mera.\\n\\n\\nDear God.\\n\\n\\nThis was Orm\\'s doing.\\n\\n\\nThe worst is yet to come.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s a flash flood warning here that was just extended for a couple hours.\\n\\n\\nUnprecedented sights from all over the world today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are seeing warships and trash washed up by massive waves.\\n\\n\\nThese extraordinary scenes of coastlines deluged with waste and garbage are taking place all over the world.\\n\\n\\nDecades of pollution has been thrown back onto land.\\n\\n\\nMany are asking the question, \"Was this a natural disaster or something else?\"\\n\\n\\nNo. This was no natural disaster.\\n\\n\\nThey threw out our garbage and our warships.\\n\\n\\nThis was our first contact with the people of Atlantis.\\n\\n\\nThere you go again with your insane Atlantean theory.\\n\\n\\nYou have absolutely no proof, Dr. Shin.\\n\\n\\nOpen your eyes.\\n\\n\\nWe already have an Atlantean living among us, and his name is Aquaman.\\n\\n\\nWhat is it?\\n\\n\\nThis is the exact spot that Vulko gave me my first swimming lesson.\\n\\n\\nYou have to forget all the teaching of the surface world and go deeper to uncover your Atlantean instincts.\\n\\n\\nBut I already know how to swim.\\n\\n\\nNot even close.\\n\\n\\nJust so we\\'re clear, I\\'ll help you stop this w*r.\\n\\n\\nBut then, I\\'m done.\\n\\n\\nMaybe that\\'s for the best.\\n\\n\\nThe ocean is more than our life source, Arthur.\\n\\n\\nIt is who we are.\\n\\n\\nWait, you can talk underwater?\\n\\n\\nI can talk underwater, too!\\n\\n\\nThis is awesome!\\n\\n\\nOh, we can do more than just talk.\\n\\n\\nBeing Atlantean means more than just being able to breathe water.\\n\\n\\nYour body is equipped to survive the extreme cold and pressure, and your eyes adjust to see in the dark.\\n\\n\\nThis is awesome!\\n\\n\\nSo, Vulko, when can I meet my mother?\\n\\n\\nSoon, my young prince.\\n\\n\\nWhen you\\'re ready, I\\'ll take you to Atlantis to meet the queen.\\n\\n\\nI hid my ship in here.\\n\\n\\nListen, I\\'m not getting in that thing.\\n\\n\\nWell, to get where we\\'re going, you\\'re gonna have to.\\n\\n\\nYour fish ship has been marinating in chum butter.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m gonna come out smelling like swamp butt.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'d be an improvement.\\n\\n\\nYup. Okay.\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s the point in having a bridge underwater?\\n\\n\\nThe Gateway Bridge is a remnant of the Old World.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s also the only way in or out of the Capital.\\n\\n\\nWhy can\\'t they just go over the walls?\\n\\n\\nSecurity is impenetrable.\\n\\n\\nEven if they did manage to evade the guards, they\\'d never get past the hydro-cannons.\\n\\n\\nPeople try to sneak in all the time.\\n\\n\\nYeah, right.\\n\\n\\nWhat is this?\\n\\n\\nCustoms and border control.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t worry. I have diplomatic clearance.\\n\\n\\nWelcome home.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s a safe house down in the Old City.\\n\\n\\nThe Highborns never venture to the sea floor.\\n\\n\\nWe\\'re here.\\n\\n\\nWhat is this?\\n\\n\\nWe use this air pocket as an extra layer of precaution.\\n\\n\\nOnly the Highborns can breathe water as well as air.\\n\\n\\nPlus, it keeps the animals out.\\n\\n\\nThey get kind of messy.\\n\\n\\nVulko. Here I am, old man.\\n\\n\\nAfter all these years, you finally get what you wanted.\\n\\n\\nArthur, I wish it was under better circumstances.\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t believe Orm att*cked.\\n\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t an att*ck.\\n\\n\\nLegally, he\\'s not allowed to yet.\\n\\n\\nWhat he did to your surface warships was merely a warning.\\n\\n\\nWhat provoked it?\\n\\n\\nKing Orm and your father were ambushed by the surface.\\n\\n\\nBy the surface? I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n\\nThey still think Atlantis is a fairy tale.\\n\\n\\nI was there.\\n\\n\\nA surface warship fired at us.\\n\\n\\nNow, Xebel sides with Atlantis, giving Orm a fleet big enough to force the other two kingdoms to join him.\\n\\n\\nIf we\\'re going to prevent this w*r, you must dethrone him now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow many times do I have to tell you? I don\\'t wanna be king.\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t understand.\\n\\n\\nOnce he is named Ocean Master, it\\'ll be too late.\\n\\n\\nThe power at his disposal will be unlike anything you have ever seen.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m from the surface. No one is gonna take me seriously.\\n\\n\\nOkay? I don\\'t even know where to begin.\\n\\n\\nBy winning the hearts and minds of the people by proving to them that you\\'re worthy, and retrieving this.\\n\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\n\\nI already got one of those.\\n\\n\\nNot like this one, you don\\'t.\\n\\n\\nThis is the Lost Trident of Atlan.\\n\\n\\nOh, I know the story.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s more than a story. It\\'s real.\\n\\n\\nIt was forged by the greatest w*apon masters in history.\\n\\n\\nCrafted from Poseidon\\'s steel for King Atlan, the first ruler of Atlantis.\\n\\n\\nLegend says the trident was imbued with the power to command the sea.\\n\\n\\nSo what happened to it?\\n\\n\\nTo know that is to go back to the time before the Great Fall, when King Atlan ruled over all that was, when the kingdoms of Atlantis were one.\\n\\n\\nIt was a time of great prosperity and technological advancement.\\n\\n\\nWe had unlocked the secret of unlimited energy at a time when the rest of the world still thought the earth was flat.\\n\\n\\nBut we became too ambitious, too hungry for power.\\n\\n\\nThe ocean swallowed us, and Atlantis sank.\\n\\n\\nBut the very power that collapsed our civilization also paved the way to our future.\\n\\n\\nIt gave us the ability to breathe underwater.\\n\\n\\nAnd so, we evolved.\\n\\n\\nOthers regressed, became savage.\\n\\n\\nAnd the king lived out the remainder of his days in self-imposed exile.\\n\\n\\nNeither he nor the trident were ever seen again.\\n\\n\\nOne of our archeological teams uncovered this a few months ago.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s an ancient recording dating back to the First Dynasty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI believe it contains Atlan\\'s final message to his people and the whereabouts of the Sacred Trident.\\n\\n\\nSo, what does it say?\\n\\n\\nWe don\\'t know. The technology\\'s too old.\\n\\n\\nThe cylinder bears the markings of the Deserter Kingdom.\\n\\n\\nYou must take it there and retrieve the message.\\n\\n\\nThe clue to Atlan\\'s final resting place is inside of this.\\n\\n\\nBorder Defense. You are under arrest for illegal entry.\\n\\n\\nNo!\\n\\n\\nYou mustn\\'t be seen here!\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t suppose you want to talk about this, do you?\\n\\n\\nNeither do I.\\n\\n\\nIn the name of His Highness, King Orm, I place you under arrest.\\n\\n\\nWelcome to Atlantis...\\n\\n\\nBrother.\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t believe you\\'re finally here.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve heard so many stories about you.\\n\\n\\nAll these years, I\\'ve been ashamed of my mother for defiling herself with a surface-dweller.\\n\\n\\nAshamed of the fact that I have a half-breed brother whose heart I wanted to run my trident through.\\n\\n\\nBut now that you\\'re finally here before me, I must admit…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am conflicted.\\n\\n\\nYou want conflict, why don\\'t you take these chains off, little brother?\\n\\n\\nAnd we\\'ll see who gets run through.\\n\\n\\nYes, I see you\\'ve brought our mother\\'s w*apon.\\n\\n\\nIs that why you\\'ve come here after all this time?\\n\\n\\nTo k*ll me?\\n\\n\\nI came here to stop a maniac from destroying the world.\\n\\n\\nI see.\\n\\n\\nAnd how do you plan to stop the atrocities that the surface continues to commit?\\n\\n\\nBecause for a century, they have polluted our waters and poisoned our children.\\n\\n\\nAnd now, their skies burn and our oceans boil.\\n\\n\\nAnd you\\'ve come all this way to take sides against your own people?\\n\\n\\nThere are no sides in a w*r like this.\\n\\n\\nYou have clearly chosen a side and come here to challenge the throne.\\n\\n\\nIf that\\'s what it takes to stop your w*r.\\n\\n\\nAre you invoking the Combat of the Kings?\\n\\n\\nCall it whatever you want. I call it an ass-whooping.\\n\\n\\nWell then, perhaps that\\'s how we\\'ll proceed.\\n\\n\\nYour Majesty! Orm, please.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t you see?\\n\\n\\nIf I defeat the firstborn son of Atlanna in a formal challenge in front of everyone, then all Seven Kingdoms will have to concede that I am the one true king.\\n\\n\\nYour Majesty, there is no victory in defeating the ignorant.\\n\\n\\nYour brother is clearly an imbecile.\\n\\n\\nYour Highness, he doesn\\'t know our ways.\\n\\n\\nThen he\\'s about to get an education.\\n\\n\\nAre you officially challenging me?\\n\\n\\nHell yes, I challenge you. And when I win...\\n\\n\\nIf you win, I will cease all immediate action. The w*r is over.\\n\\n\\nBut if I win...\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re over.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s do it.\\n\\n\\nSo be it.\\n\\n\\nChallenge has been made, and I accept.\\n\\n\\nPrepare him for the Ring of f*re.\\n\\n\\nWait. The ring of what?\\n\\n\\nHow could you be so foolish to let Orm bait you into a fight?\\n\\n\\nIt seems to me like I just solved all of our problems.\\n\\n\\nI b*at him in a battle, w*r\\'s over, I get to go home.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re a formidable fighter on land, but here you\\'re out of your element, literally.\\n\\n\\nOrm has spent his entire life underwater, training to be a warrior, training to be the best.\\n\\n\\nYou taught me how to fight, Cobra Kai.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s see if you remember anything.\\n\\n\\nSo, what\\'s with the big fork?\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s a trident. Now, defend yourself.\\n\\n\\nWhat the hell is this?\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll teach you this move when you\\'ve mastered the trident.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s not fair.\\n\\n\\nThis thing is so big and awkward. Why can\\'t I use a sword?\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s your mother\\'s trident. A traditional w*apon of royalty.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ll never be a king until you\\'ve mastered it.\\n\\n\\nWhy has she never come to see me, huh?\\n\\n\\nI told you, when you\\'re ready...\\n\\n\\nStop lying to me! I\\'ve done everything you ever asked.\\n\\n\\nAnd every time I pass a test, you make up another one.\\n\\n\\nWhen am I gonna be good enough?\\n\\n\\nDoes she not love me?\\n\\n\\nYour mother loved you more than anything in the world.\\n\\n\\nBut she had to return to Atlantis to keep you safe.\\n\\n\\nHer marriage to King Orvax was arranged a long time ago, so she had to marry him...\\n\\n\\nAnd bear him a son, Prince Orm.\\n\\n\\nWhen Orvax eventually found out about you, he became overwhelmed with jealousy and sacrificed her to the creatures of the Trench.\\n\\n\\nAre you saying they ex*cuted her?\\n\\n\\nBecause she had me?\\n\\n\\nI remember...\\n\\n\\nEverything.\\n\\n\\nI have something for you.\\n\\n\\nIt belonged to my mother.\\n\\n\\nTell me...\\n\\n\\nDo you think she would have enjoyed watching her sons m*rder each other?\\n\\n\\nI understand your fear and your reluctance, Mera.\\n\\n\\nI truly do. I don\\'t want w*r...\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t patronize me!\\n\\n\\nI know you.\\n\\n\\nWhat you\\'re doing flies in the face of everything that your mother taught us when we were children.\\n\\n\\nIf she were here...\\n\\n\\nBut she\\'s not here, is she?\\n\\n\\nWhat my mother taught us was treason.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t follow in her wake.\\n\\n\\nAll right! So, this is the big, old ring of f*re, huh?\\n\\n\\nHow\\'s it work? I just kick your ass right here?\\n\\n\\nVulko.\\n\\n\\nWill you escort my betrothed to the royal box?\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s go, Lady Mera.\\n\\n\\nDown here, we have a legend about the Karathen, an ancient sea monster so powerful that even King Atlan himself feared it.\\n\\n\\nSo, he imprisoned it in the depths of the ocean.\\n\\n\\nAnd in that abyss, the creature bides its time waiting to rise again.\\n\\n\\nAtlantis has been lying in wait...\\n\\n\\nAnd now, the beast has awakened.\\n\\n\\nThere was a time when I wanted to meet you more than anything.\\n\\n\\nGet to know my little brother.\\n\\n\\nLet him know that he wasn\\'t alone, that we were in it together.\\n\\n\\nIf only I had known what a d*ck you would turn out to be.\\n\\n\\nYou were the reason our mother was ex*cuted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I\\'ve hated you for it ever since.\\n\\n\\nBut I do not want to k*ll you, Arthur.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m going to give you one chance.\\n\\n\\nGo home.\\n\\n\\nDo not ever come back to Atlantis.\\n\\n\\nYou are not going to win this.\\n\\n\\nA w*r is coming to the surface whether you like it or not.\\n\\n\\nAnd I am bringing the wrath of the seven seas with me.\\n\\n\\nYou know I can\\'t let that happen.\\n\\n\\nI know.\\n\\n\\nWhat the hell is that?\\n\\n\\nThe Ring of f*re.\\n\\n\\nYeah!\\n\\n\\nYeah!\\n\\n\\nsh*t.\\n\\n\\nPeople of Atlantis, hear me!\\n\\n\\nMy brother has come from the surface to challenge me for the throne.\\n\\n\\nLet us settle his claim in the ancient way.\\n\\n\\nBy bloodshed do the gods make known their will!\\n\\n\\nTraitor!\\n\\n\\nTraitor!\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ll never be king!\\n\\n\\nNever thought I\\'d see the day when my own father would bow before the king of Atlantis.\\n\\n\\nThe surface-dwellers drew first blood. What would you have us do?\\n\\n\\nBeg them for mercy?\\n\\n\\nI detest the surface as much as you do.\\n\\n\\nBut don\\'t you find the timing of all of this a bit convenient?\\n\\n\\nBut you wouldn\\'t be that gullible, would you?\\n\\n\\nYou want this w*r too, don\\'t you?\\n\\n\\nIt is past time the surface-dwellers learned their place in the world.\\n\\n\\nIf this is how it must be done, then so be it.\\n\\n\\nYou have our mother\\'s trident.\\n\\n\\nPowerful, but flawed like her.\\n\\n\\nI wield my father\\'s.\\n\\n\\nAnd it has never known defeat!\\n\\n\\nI promised Atlanna I\\'d protect him.\\n\\n\\nThis isn\\'t a competition. It\\'s an execution.\\n\\n\\nI am the one true king!\\nYou waiting for an invitation? Get in!\\n\\n\\nMera!\\n\\n\\nOh, yeah. So, what\\'s the plan?\\n\\n\\nThe plan was to recover Atlan\\'s trident, then challenge Orm.\\n\\n\\nOkay, so we\\'re doing things a little out of order.\\n\\n\\nsh*t happens.\\n\\n\\nHeads up! We got a bogey on our six!\\n\\n\\nWhat does that even mean? Bad guys behind us.\\n\\n\\nThen just say that! Bad guys behind us!\\n\\n\\nWhoa, whoa, wait, you said we couldn\\'t go over these walls.\\n\\n\\nI did! You said there were hydro-cannons!\\n\\n\\nI did, now shut up!\\n\\n\\nOh, sh*t!\\n\\n\\nsh*t!\\n\\n\\nsh*t.\\n\\n\\nWe\\'re not d*ad yet! But I\\'m hoping he\\'ll think we are.\\n\\n\\nOh!\\n\\n\\nHere, hold this.\\n\\n\\nWhat are you doing?\\nListen, it worked for Pinocchio. Who?\\n\\n\\nNever mind. Come here, get in. Come on.\\n\\n\\nGreat. So we\\'re getting eaten.\\n\\n\\nHow are you even doing this, anyway?\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\nI can hear them sometimes, and they can hear me.\\n\\n\\nRight. Because you\\'re both big, dumb animals.\\n\\n\\nHey, I just saved your life. I saved yours first!\\n\\n\\nShe said, \"Coast is clear.\"\\n\\n\\nSo, where to now?\\n\\n\\nTo the ocean of sand your people call the Sahara.\\n\\n\\nAll right.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t usually take charters, but I don\\'t usually get paid in pirate treasure.\\n\\n\\nThanks for the ride, buddy.\\n\\n\\nOh, man.\\n\\n\\nAre you okay?\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve never been so high up before.\\n\\n\\nOr so far from home.\\n\\n\\nBut at least you have a home.\\n\\n\\nNot anymore.\\n\\n\\nI can never go back.\\n\\n\\nI betrayed everything when I saved you from the coliseum.\\n\\n\\nYeah, but you\\'re engaged to the king. They have to take you back.\\n\\n\\nAtlantis is many wonderful things.\\n\\n\\nBut forgiving, it is not.\\n\\n\\nYeah, but you\\'re royalty.\\n\\n\\nSo was your mother.\\n\\n\\nIf I went back now, I\\'d be sacrificed to the Trench.\\n\\n\\nEven my own father wouldn\\'t take me back.\\n\\n\\nLook on the bright side, now you don\\'t have to marry some tool bag that you\\'re not in love with.\\n\\n\\nMy obligation isn\\'t to love.\\n\\n\\nIt is to my family and my nation, and I\\'ve turned my back on both.\\n\\n\\nSometimes, you have to do what\\'s right, even if your heart aches against it.\\n\\n\\nYour Highness.\\n\\n\\nThe tracker places Princess Mera here, in the Deserter Kingdom.\\n\\n\\nYou said she was d*ad.\\n\\n\\nApparently not.\\n\\n\\nThen your brother still lives as well?\\n\\n\\nNot for long.\\n\\n\\nCaptain Murk, assemble a strike force immediately.\\n\\n\\nNo! Mera is to be arrested and safely returned to me.\\n\\n\\nShe betrayed the throne.\\n\\n\\nShe is a daughter of Xebel.\\n\\n\\nIf any harm befalls her, our coalition is over.\\n\\n\\nYour Highness, we are now entering the waters of the Fishermen Kingdom.\\n\\n\\nSecuring the alliance of the other two kingdoms should be our immediate concern.\\n\\n\\nMy vizier is correct. As usual.\\n\\n\\nArrest them and bring back King Nereus\\' daughter unharmed.\\n\\n\\nWe\\'re here!\\n\\n\\nHey!\\n\\n\\nIs there anything nearby?\\n\\n\\nNothing but desert for hundreds of K\\'s, mate!\\n\\n\\nNothing but desert. He\\'s wrong.\\n\\n\\nHey! What are you doing? Wait! No! Oh...\\n\\n\\nShe just jumped! She didn\\'t have a parachute!\\n\\n\\nRedheads! You gotta love \\'em.\\n\\n\\nsh*t!\\n\\n\\nOh, you\\'re crazier than I thought!\\n\\n\\nA-ha!\\n\\n\\nThis way.\\n\\n\\nYou were defeated the last time because your surface w*apon failed you.\\n\\n\\nOurs will not.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s prototype armor for the next generation Atlantean soldier.\\n\\n\\nRevenge is something we Atlanteans understand.\\n\\n\\nYou will lead my finest commandos as your personal army to hunt down the half-breed abomination.\\n\\n\\nI cannot touch them, but you can. He\\'s fled to your world.\\n\\n\\nk*ll him and the woman he\\'s with, and you will be rewarded.\\n\\n\\nk*lling him is my reward.\\n\\n\\nThe crown jewel. Still experimental.\\n\\n\\nConverts water into beams of energized plasma.\\n\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\n\\nI think I\\'m gonna need a bigger helmet.\\n\\n\\nOne of the tribes of Atlantis broke off and settled here when this region was still an inland sea.\\n\\n\\nWhen the water dried up, they perished along with it.\\n\\n\\nPerished? Yeah, that\\'s terrific.\\n\\n\\nWe\\'re getting close now.\\n\\n\\nOh, yeah? Close to what? Dying of thirst?\\n\\n\\nClose to getting punched in the face!\\n\\n\\nLook, Fight Club, I know you\\'re new to how things work up here.\\n\\n\\nWhy don\\'t you look around? We are lost.\\n\\n\\nYou see that over there? Hey, what is that?\\n\\n\\nNada. This place is a wasteland.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re the one who calls this wasteland a home.\\n\\n\\nThis isn\\'t my home!\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s not like the whole surface looks like this!\\n\\n\\nOh, no, of course not.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ve also got disgusting cities whose sewers empty out into our ocean and whole mountains made out of trash.\\n\\n\\nAnd, oh, you\\'ve got great factories that do nothing but belch out filth and melt ice caps.\\n\\n\\nOkay. Point taken. Listen.\\n\\n\\nYeah, we got some idiots running the show, but we\\'ve got some good things too, all right?\\n\\n\\nWe got green forests and big mountains and beautiful lakes.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'d love \\'em. They\\'re like little baby oceans.\\n\\n\\nAre you trying to provoke me?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m just saying you cannot judge a place before you\\'ve even seen it.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ve judged Atlantis on far less.\\n\\n\\nNo. Would you just stop it with that? No.\\n\\n\\nYour stupid Atlantean GPS just told you to jump out of an airplane over the middle of the desert, and now we are stranded.\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re the next true king, we\\'re doomed.\\n\\n\\nThat was awesome.\\n\\n\\nOh. Look what I found.\\n\\n\\nWhat you found?\\nYeah.\\n\\n\\nCheck this place out.\\n\\n\\nThis is badass!\\n\\n\\nThis is the Hall of Armory.\\n\\n\\nWhere the legends say Atlan\\'s trident was forged.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think they\\'re legends anymore.\\n\\n\\nVulko was right.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s real.\\n\\n\\nHuh.\\n\\n\\nNothing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOf course it\\'s not working.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s been sitting here collecting dust since before the Sahara was a desert.\\n\\n\\nMan!\\n\\n\\n\"Since before the Sahara was a desert.\"\\n\\n\\nThank you for repeating what I just said.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s completely dried out.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s just say you do your best thinking when you\\'re not thinking at all.\\n\\n\\nAll right, now hold still.\\n\\n\\nHey. What are you doing?\\n\\n\\nWe need water, and you\\'re the closest source.\\nNow, hold still.\\n\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\n\\nShow-off.\\n\\n\\nI could have just peed on it.\\n\\n\\nKing Atlan.\\n\\n\\nIn this trident resides the power of Atlantis.\\n\\n\\nIn the wrong hands, it would bring destruction.\\n\\n\\nBut in the hands of the true heir, it would unite all our kingdoms above and below.\\n\\n\\nIf you seek my power, you must prove your worth.\\n\\n\\nJourney beyond the edge of the world to the Hidden Sea.\\n\\n\\nLook inside the bottle for the charted path.\\n\\n\\nOnly in the hands of the true king can he truly see.\\n\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\n\\nWe can\\'t let Orm find this.\\n\\n\\nHey! Wait!\\n\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\n\\nShouldn\\'t we have written it down first?\\n\\n\\nI memorized it. Didn\\'t you?\\n\\n\\nOh, yeah. Totally.\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'d he just say?\\n\\n\\n\"Something something trident.\"\\n\\n\\n\"Look inside the bottle for the charted path.\"\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s our next stop.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m starting to think you actually like these surface-dwellers.\\n\\n\\nIt would be wrong to judge a place I\\'ve never seen before.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll be right back. Don\\'t go anywhere.\\n\\n\\nWell, apparently, it\\'s just right up on the hill. A big old castle.\\n\\n\\nAnd I just learned something very interesting.\\n\\n\\nYou risked our lives based on something you read in a children\\'s book?\\n\\n\\nWait, it\\'s a book? How about that?\\n\\n\\nOh!\\n\\n\\nI got it from the movie.\\n\\n\\nKing Nereus, I had hoped our people had evolved beyond that ancient notion that w*r with the surface is inevitable.\\n\\n\\nIt is the position of the Fishermen that when the time comes to make ourselves known to the landsmen, it should be to educate them, not to destroy them.\\n\\n\\nI admire your lofty aspirations, King Ricou.\\n\\n\\nBut I suspect they are but clouds of ink hiding the heart of a coward.\\n\\n\\nHow dare you!\\n\\n\\nPlease. I implore you.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re a kingdom of bloated philosophers and flaccid poets whose waters have grown stagnant, and it sickens me.\\n\\n\\nMy King!\\n\\n\\nThe king is d*ad!

BATHROOM/ EALING ART SCHOOL - DAY \\nROGER and BRIAN are now singing “TUTTI FRUTTI” (a jazzy,  slowed-down version, harmonizing beautifully with each  other) as ROGER, then BRIAN, go up to the urinal in the  TILED BATHROOM with its real nice echo.  \\nROGER, one handed, (one drum stick clenched in his teeth)  still drums on the TILES as he sings (he has a very high  sweet voice) \\nROGER/BRIAN  \\n“I got a girl...named Sue... \\nshe knows just what to doooo...  \\n I got a girl...named Sue... \\n ...she knows just what to doooo...  \\nAs they sing and harmonise beautifully -  \\n- a THIRD VOICE joins them, taking the 5th part harmony -  ROGER and BRIAN look at each other, and turn...  \\nVOICE \\n“She rocked to the east... \\n She rocked to the west...  \\n But she\\'s the girrllll.... \\n ...that I love the best... \\nThe singing - which is very good - is coming from one of  the TOILET CUBICLES.

Before they can get up off the floor the DOOR opens  and the STRANGER walks past them, right over them, moving  to the WASH-BASINS.  \\nROGER and BRIAN stand and look at the STRANGER from behind,  who is now bent over the BASIN, washing his hands as he  continues to sing. The long-haired STRANGER is wearing SILK  trousers, a scarf around his waist and a sheepskin  waistcoat. Finally, the STRANGER straightens and his face  is at last revealed in the MIRROR...  \\n(sing \\nFREDDIE \\n“Tutti frutti oh rutti... \\n...a YOUNG MAN of PERSIAN/INDIAN stock, slim, with large  buck teeth and long black hair.

Yes?  \\nFREDDIE SMILES, but covers his buck teeth with his hand,  self-consciously - the bullied little boy showing itself in  this lingering mark of childhood insecurity.  \\nFREDDIE \\nSaw your gig at Imperial College. \\nFREDDIE dries his hands with a PAPER TOWEL... \\n(CONTINUED) \\n14.\\nCONTINUED: (2) \\nFREDDIE \\nYou guys are brilliant but no show.  \\nYou need pizzazz, costumes, lights,  \\nproper front-man...What you need is \\nlightning in a bottle!

BRIAN looks at FREDDIE, seeing him then as FRED  sees himself... \\nOLDER BRIAN (V.O.) \\n“Outcast”--Yes, that’s how he’d  \\nalways seen himself. A sad, lonely  \\nboy, bullied--tugged from Africa  \\nto India to this place--this \\nlittle room in Feltham, Middlesex!  \\nFREDDIE at the full-length MIRROR, struggles to do up the  TROUSERS...he starts to LAUGH (FREDDIE’s high GIRLISH  LAUGH) and turns to share the joke with BRIAN - those big  BUCK TEETH flashing for a second before FREDDIE covers them  with his hand. BRIAN, thoughtful, smiles back... \\nFREDDIE \\nOne has to suffer for fashion.  \\nBRIAN \\nYou write songs?  \\nFREDDIE \\nNo. That’s why they’re paper balls.  \\nCan’t finish them.  \\nBRIAN picks up a heavily marked scrap of un-balled paper,  as FREDDIE dons a LONG BLACK COAT and covers his wardrobe  before he EXITS. BRIAN remains - studying the scrap. \\nFREDDIE! \\nFREDDIE’S MUM (O.S.) FREDDIE (O.S.) \\nI move into my first flat next week  \\nthank God.

BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT OLDER BRIAN crosses to the BLOGGER, with a WOODEN BOX -  \\nOLDER BRIAN \\nNot at all proper. But a language  \\nthat was Freddie’s own--a \\nkaleidoscope of influences--a nod to  \\none style, a genuflection to another-- \\nmelodies battling with counter melodies... \\nWe hear, as SOUNDTRACK, these layers of sound, these  elements, building up...up...as - BRIAN opens the BOX.  Inside it, LITTLE PAPER BALLS. \\nOLDER BRIAN \\n...rock competing with “Uncle Mack’s  \\nChildren’s Favourites”, competing with  \\nMantovani--the Laughing Policeman with  \\nVerdi and the Billy Goats Gruff. And  \\nwhat I saw, in these little bits of  \\npaper, this confetti - was a man\\'s  \\nconfusion--in musical form--about who  \\nhe was! A many of strange parts. And  \\nsuch--cacophany! \\nBRIAN playfully covers his ears as the noise he hears gets  too much. And then the CACOPHONY on the SOUNDTRACK suddenly  stops - SILENCE.  \\nOLDER BRIAN \\nAnd what could I do for him? Connect  \\nthem all, help him to tie them  \\ntogether, to produce...harmony.  \\nBRIAN picks up his “RED SPECIAL GUITAR”  \\nOLDER BRIAN \\nLet me show you!

I could give him what  \\nhe was hearing but couldn’t play. \\nAnother BANGGG! of HUGE GUITARS and then FREDDIE’s voice  comes in with the first lyric...  \\nOLDER BRIAN \\nAnd then we’re in.  \\nBRIAN silences, with a snap of his fingers, the music.  But the BLOGGER is more interested in the guitar itself. \\nBLOGGER \\nThe \"Red Special”? That’s it?  \\nYour father made it for you? \\nThis? \\nOLDER BRIAN \\n19.\\nINT.

Freddie?  \\nFREDDIE \\nReady Steady Go.  \\n(struggling) \\nWait, wait--This--give me---Bloody- \\n- but then the top half of the MIC stand breaks off, and  won’t go back into the bottom half -  \\n- ROGER and BRIAN share concerned looks. Not a good  beginning.  \\nCome on.  Freddie -  \\nROGER \\nBRIAN \\nFREDDIE \\nFuck it. Let’s go.  \\n(CONTINUED) \\n20.\\nCONTINUED: \\nFREDDIE will just use the top half of the MIC stand, the  MIC affixed. FREDDIE comes to the centre of the stage.  \\nFor a second FREDDIE stares at the audience, the shy  nervous Farouk Bulsara. But then he takes a deep breath and  nods at BRIAN, who counts in the BAND -  \\n“SMILE” strike up the intro to “Doin’ All Right” - and  FREDDIE jumps into a dramatic pose, which he holds like a  statue -  \\nBRIAN and ROGER and JOHN all share surprised looks as  FREDDIE then begins to TRANSFORM THE SONG - his hugely  dramatic and showy performance a million miles from what we  saw Tim Staffel do with it.  \\nANGLE ON: The Audience reaction: Startled. \\nOLDER BRIAN (V.O.) \\nSame old song, but it sure felt  \\ndifferent with Freddie doing it. \\nINT.

FREDDIE keeps sneaking glances at her -  \\nFREDDIE \\n(aside to BRIAN, re  \\nMARY) \\nDetails! She’s your girlfriend?  \\nNot your girlfriend? What? C’mon. \\nSort of.  \\nBRIAN \\nFREDDIE \\nSort of Yes, or sort of No?  \\nBRIAN \\nSort of--both. We’ve been out a few  times. It was -  \\nKissed her?  \\nFREDDIE BRIAN \\nCheek only. Look, if you like her-- \\nthen just--she’s had a rough time with  \\nguys. Needs someone to appreciate her. \\nFREDDIE \\nThere’s something really sweet and  \\ncalming about her.  \\nBRIAN \\nGo on then--ask her out.  \\nFREDDIE looks at MARY, who sees him looking, and he - shyly  pretends to go through more clothes. \\nCUT TO: \\n(CONTINUED) \\n22.\\nCONTINUED: (2) \\nLATER.

FREDDIE watches him go, with as yet unadmitted sexual interest, as -  \\nClosing.  \\nMARY \\nMARY is standing right behind him. Conflicted, he manages \\nMARY \\nFind anything?  \\nFREDDIE \\nMight need something...louder. \\nMARY \\nYou really like clothes.  \\nFREDDIE \\nFashion & Design, Ealing Arts.  \\n(holds wide his arms) \\nCan’t you tell?  \\nMARY \\nI can now. Yes.  \\nA spark passes between, as FREDDIE tries to pluck up the  courage -  \\n- and as MARY notices that FREDDIE’s FINGERNAILS are  varnished BLACK.  \\nFREDDIE \\nSo--right. See you. Some other time.  \\nHe leaves, but then returns -  \\nFREDDIE \\nIt’s some other time.  \\nShe smiles at him - he’s CHARMING.  \\nEXT.

We’re not actors. \\nFREDDIE \\nIt’s outrageous--that’s the only way  \\nthe public will realise you’re on the  \\nscene! Rock has to be a show!  \\nLook at Hendrix. You saw him perform?  \\nBRIAN performs a LICK of AIR-GUITAR - we actually HEAR the  LICK (intro to “VOODOO CHILD”) as SOUNDTRACK...  \\nFREDDIE \\nIt’s a show!

And Freddie, in full flamboyant flow.  \\nOLDER BRIAN (V.O.) \\nWe were changing--but Freddie?  \\nFred’s was a metamorphosis!  \\n(MORE) \\n(CONTINUED) \\n40.\\nCONTINUED:OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)

JOHN REID’S OFFICE/ LONDON - DAY \\nOLDER BRIAN (V.O.) \\nThe problem was--our old record deals  \\nwere rigged to make other people  \\nmoney...so we switched management...  \\nQUEEN sign their new deal and shake hands with the DAPPER,  almost dandyish, smiling, JOHN REID, among photos of his  other client, ELTON JOHN...  \\n(CONTINUED) \\n41.\\nCONTINUED: \\nJOHN REID \\nLet’s change the world.  \\nQUEEN also shake the hand of PAUL PRENTER, Reid’s mustached  assistant...  \\nJOHN REID \\nPaul Prenter--he’ll be assisting  \\nme with day-to-day. \\nINT. RAY FOSTER’S OFFICE/ EMI RECORDS - DAY \\nCLOSE: on JOE BASTIN, a handsome record executive of  FREDDIE’s age.  \\nRAY FOSTER (O.S.) \\nSo. A new album?  \\nANGLE ON: FREDDIE, taking a clear interest in JOE BASTIN -  \\nJOHN REID (O.S.) \\nTheir biggest and best yet -  \\nRAY FOSTER (O.S.) \\nAnd most expensive I presume.  \\nFREDDIE finally concentrates on what EMI BOSS, RAY FOSTER,  has to say... \\nAT FOSTER’s side stand JOE BASTIN and his FINANCIAL  OFFICER. They face - \\n- JOHN REID, PAUL PRENTER and QUEEN.  \\nRAY FOSTER \\nWell I need not tell you--that it’s  \\nmake or break time. I think you have  \\nto agree we have been patient with  \\nyou, hoping for a breakthrough that  \\nI’m afraid just hasn’t come.  \\nYet. \\nJOHN REID FREDDIE \\nI want you to hear something.  \\nIt’s the new concept.  \\nFREDDIE goes to the record player and slips on an ALBUM.  Meanwhile BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN exchange nervous looks.  RAY FOSTER looks to his advisors, who shrug. The MUSIC  comes on - They all listen. It’s OPERA.  \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCONTINUED: \\nIt’s--opera.  \\nIt’s opera.  \\nOpera.  \\n42.\\nRAY FOSTER \\nFINANCIAL OFFICER \\nJOHN REID \\nROGER \\nSeems to be an echo in here. \\nWait! \\nFREDDIE \\nFREDDIE, as if conducting the orchestra, thrills to a  particular passage (a coloratura) in the music - singing  along with it -  \\nYou see?! \\nFREDDIE \\nREACTIONS ROGER, BRIAN, JOHN - nervous about how this is  going down. \\nRAY FOSTER looks simply confused, as FREDDIE turns off the  music.  \\n(quietly) \\nFREDDIE \\nThat’s our concept--mix genres, no  \\nboundaries, dare to go anywhere. I  \\ncan’t think of anyone whose ever done  that before. \\nRAY FOSTER \\nPrecisely what worries me. \\nFREDDIE \\nI don’t want us to repeat ourselves.  The same formula, over and over--How boring! We want to capture a  \\nhurricane! Paint pictures on an  \\nenormous scale, heavy rock foundation,  ethereal vocals, different voices,  \\nrhythms, keys. Deafen ‘em, blind ‘em,  and leave ‘em wanting more.  \\nWe want to make the greatest fucking  album ever made.  \\n(CONTINUED) \\n43.\\nCONTINUED: (2) \\nRAY FOSTER \\nReally? Trouble is, Freddie, that’s  \\nexactly what every band who comes in  \\nhere says - minus the “fucking”. \\n(beat) \\nBecause it’s our feeling, here at EMI,  that your biggest success was “Killer  Queen”, and it’s that we’d like to see  you get back to.  \\nFREDDIE \\nGo backwards? It’s not in our nature.  You want us to go back?  \\nRAY FOSTER \\nNot necessarily back, no. You stay  \\nhere, we want you right here--just-- \\nbring sound...forward.  \\nThe BAND stare at FOSTER - not buying it.  \\nFINANCIAL OFFICER 1 \\nWe really need a firm undertaking to  \\nthat effect. John? If we are to take  \\nthe risk one more time. \\nJOHN REID looks at the band, and then nods -  \\nJOHN REID \\nI understand what you’re saying.  \\nFREDDIE glares at JOHN REID for this.  \\nFEATHERSTONE \\nSo--we are agreed? An album--in the  \\nvein of “Killer Queen”? Radio friendly? Top of The Pops?...Good?  \\nSilence from the BAND, until -  \\nAbsolutely.  \\nINT. BAR - NIGHT \\nJOHN REID \\nJOHN REID and PAUL PRENTER stand and toast their deal, but  QUEEN, very GLUM, refuse to stand, or join the toast.  \\nJOHN REID \\nTo your fourth album!

All of you.  \\nROGER, BRIAN, FREDDIE and JOHN just stare at him.  \\nFREDDIE \\nBoredom--is a disease--the biggest  \\ndisease in the world, darling--and \\nwe’ve just agreed to spread it!  \\nCheers! To Boredom! \\nFREDDIE raises his glass - and turns to the EMI EXECUTIVES  across the room -  \\nJOHN REID \\nFreddie--I’m giving Paul to you.  \\nPersonal assistant. Take some pressure  \\noff. And keep you out of trouble.  \\nA good influence.  \\nFREDDIE \\nOh I have a good influence. I have  \\nMary. \\nJOHN REID \\nYou will still have Mary. Now you  \\nhave Paul as well. It’s a gift.  \\nJOHN, ROGER and BRIAN all observe this -  \\nOh well.  \\nFREDDIE \\nFREDDIE and PAUL shake hands. \\nANGLE ON: BRIAN watching - suspicious -  \\nOLDER BRIAN (V.O.) \\nIn hindsight, if there was a moment  \\nI should have intervened...  \\nFREDDIE and PAUL smile at each other.  \\nFREDDIE \\nI suppose the more the merrier.  \\n(CONTINUED) \\n45.\\nCONTINUED: (2) \\nOLDER BRIAN (V.O.) \\n...I was worried but I didn’t have  \\nthe audacity to tell him what to do.  \\nI said--nothing. \\nCUT TO: \\nLater - REID and QUEEN confer -  \\nJOHN REID \\nRoyalties, profits. How do you want  \\nto cut up the pie? How have you  \\ntraditionally done that? \\nWhat pie?  \\nROGER \\nJOHN has the best business head -  \\nJOHN \\nThe songwriter--whoever brings a  \\nsong in - even if we all contribute - \\n- gets the song-writing credit for  \\nthat song. And if the song gets on  \\nthe album, then that person gets  \\nthe publishing royalties. The rest of  \\nthe band gets -  \\nROGER \\n- what’s left over.  \\nJOHN \\nBrian, now Freddie, are writing  \\nmost of the songs, so... \\nJOHN REID \\nAnd you don’t want to pool the  \\nmoney, divide it evenly?  \\nA KEY moment for the band - they look at each other for the  longest time... \\nBRIAN \\nI think--we’re good with the  \\ncurrent arrangement. \\nFREDDIE \\nIt’s working.  \\nREID looks at ROGER and JOHN, who swallow their nascent  dissatisfaction with this.  \\n(CONTINUED) \\n46.\\nCONTINUED: (3) \\nJOHN REID \\nYes? We’re all good? Speak now...?  \\nThen I’ll draw something up.  \\nCUT TO: \\nFREDDIE (sitting with JOHN REID)... \\nJOHN REID \\nYou’re happy? Being in a band?  \\nSure.  \\nFREDDIE JOHN REID \\nEver think of going solo?  \\nNo.  \\nFREDDIE \\nFREDDIE glances over at JOE BASTIN, who smiles at FREDDIE  while raising his GLASS. FREDDIE, nervously, smiles back,  raises his glass, ever careful not to bare his TEETH.  \\nJOHN REID notices this exchange between the two men - and  it appears to trouble him... \\nJOHN REID \\nI hope you don’t mind but I need  \\nyou to know something.  \\n(beat) \\nI’m gay. \\nFREDDIE just stares at John, and says nothing. \\nReally?  \\nFREDDIE \\nFREDDIE looks at his friends, anxiously: Do they know about  him also?  \\nFREDDIE \\nHave you told the others?  \\nJOHN REID \\nI think they know.  \\n(pointedly) \\nPeople generally do.  \\nREACTION FREDDIE: Concern - has JOHN REID detected his true  nature?  \\n47.\\nINT. FREDDIE’S FIRST FLAT/ LONDON - NIGHT \\nFred gives MARY a PRESENT.  \\nWhat is it?  \\nMARY \\nFREDDIE \\nGo on, open it up!  \\nMARY opens the box and inside is another box. She opens  this second box only to discover, inside, a third...and so  on...  \\nOh no.  \\nMARY \\nFREDDIE \\nGetting smaller and smaller, I’m  afraid. Shrinking and shrinking,  sorry sweetie. \\nWhat is it? \\nMARY \\nFREDDIE \\nWell it can’t be very big!  \\n(watching her) \\nBe more fun if the boxes got bigger  \\nand bigger, wouldn’t it and you end  \\nup with a car or something. \\nFinally MARY takes out a RING-BOX, and opens it. Inside is  a RING. She stares at him - stunned.  \\nWell? \\nWhich hand?  \\nFREDDIE MARY \\nFREDDIE \\nLeft hand, fourth finger.  \\nHer heart stops.  \\nFREDDIE \\nYour turn to say something.  \\n(moved) \\nMARY \\nYes. Of course.  \\n(CONTINUED) \\n48.\\nCONTINUED: \\nThey kiss.  \\nFREDDIE \\nThat’s alright then. Isn’t it? \\nShe nods, moved, looking at her RING. FREDDIE watches her,  warmly - but conflicted.  \\nEXT. ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY \\nCHICKENS and COWS cross the FARMYARD. A working DAIRY FARM.  \\nANGLE ON: QUEEN, standing with their gear, at the gates, in  the mud, uncertain if this was a good idea.  \\nROGER \\nNice recording studio. \\nJOHN \\nEvidently the cheapest EMI could find. \\nBRIAN \\nThe idea was to get away from all  \\ndistractions.  \\nFREDDIE \\nYou forgot cow shit and roosters  \\nat dawn. \\nThe FARMER comes out to greet them.  \\nFARMER \\n“Queen” I presume?! Welcome! Shall  \\nwe get you settled in then?  \\nThe BAND cross the YARD. FREDDIE, playfully, chases a  CHICKEN that SQUARKS and FLAPS away.  \\nFARMER \\nOnly two of the rooms have windows! \\nThis makes BRIAN and JOHN dash indoors to grab them -  leaving FREDDIE and ROGER the last to enter the FARMHOUSE.  \\nROGER \\nEngaged? Congratulations’n all that.  \\nRa Ra, very cool. \\nFREDDIE \\nSurreal you mean. You and Dominique?  \\n(CONTINUED) \\n49.\\nCONTINUED: \\nROGER \\n(cautionary) \\nAh ah ah ah! Every man, in their own  \\ntime, in their own way. \\nWIDE SHOT of the YARD. \\nMATCH DISSOLVE TO: \\nTHE YARD - LATER.

BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT \\nBLOGGER \\nWas there creative conflict? During  \\nthose sessions? \\nOLDER BRIAN \\nConflict? No, I don’t think so. No. \\nINT. RECORDING STUDIO /ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY \\nFREDDIE, ROGER, BRIAN and JOHN are shouting at the same  time - ROGER’s VOICE breaks through.  \\nROGER \\nI put my heart and soul into this  \\nsong and you don’t like it because  \\nyou want your songs on the album  \\nand your royalties as writers--  \\nthat’s why you don’t like it!!! \\nFREDDIE \\nFor God’s sake. It’s not that, Roger  \\ndear -  \\nROGER \\nOH REALLY?! THEN WHAT IS IT?!  \\nOnly BRIAN is brave enough to say it -  \\nBRIAN \\n(picking up the lyric  \\nsheet) \\n“I’m In Love With My Car”? It’s not  \\nstrong enough.  \\n(CONTINUED) \\n50.\\nCONTINUED: \\nROGER \\nNot strong enough?  \\nBRIAN \\nNo. John? Fred?

TACK-ROOM/ ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY \\nFREDDIE wanders in to the RIDING-GEAR STORAGE ROOM and  sees, to his surprise, behind HAY BALES, an OLD PIANO. He  moves the top BALE aside and uses the remaining one as a  PIANO STOOL. He tests the keys - a little out of tune in  the uppermost keys... \\nOh dear.  \\nFREDDIE \\nIN FRUSTRATION, he bangs out a few dumb cords and then  stops - thinks a moment - what shall he play? He sighs,  alone in this little shed, letting all the TENSION out of  himself, trying to rid himself off all the shit that is  weighing him down... \\nFREDDIE \\n(to himself) \\nCome on Freddie... \\nHe flexes his FINGERS, looks at the keys and then sets his  FINGERS on the keys...trying to recall an old half-written  piece...the opening “MAMA” part from BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY... \\nFREDDIE \\nHow does it go?  \\n(plays a few notes) \\n...it goes it goes it goes... \\nHe remembers, and plays the opening bars beautifully on the  BROKEN PIANO.

We do need the  \\nBBC and their format is 3 minutes  \\ntops. I have to agree with Roy.  \\nFREDDIE looks at JOHN REID, furious - gives his ‘Et Tu  Brute’ look. ROGER and BRIAN and JOHN also stare at JOHN  REID, outraged. \\nJOHN REID \\nI think the single is--”Love Of My  \\nLife.” It’s slow, but it’s strong. \\nJOHN REID looks back at FREDDIE and holds up his hands -  \\nJOHN REID \\nMy job is to turn things around for  \\nyou. “Love of my Life”.  \\nRAY FOSTER \\nPlay that one again.

WAITERS hover around their star  guest, as FREDDIE speaks -  \\n(CONTINUED) \\n77.\\nCONTINUED: \\nFREDDIE \\nWe’ll manage ourselves from now on.  \\nMr Beach here, you’ll take care of  \\nthe rest, won’t you dear?  \\nMe?  \\nJIM BEACH FREDDIE \\n“Miami” New name for you. You ever  looked after a band before, Miami?  Points deducted for hesitation. \\nNo.  \\nJIM BEACH FREDDIE \\nAll in favour of Miami here looking  \\nafter us from now on?  \\nJOHN and ROGER and BRIAN all nod.  \\nFREDDIE \\nThis is fun. Who else can we hire or  fire?  \\nFREDDIE looks at JOE BASTIN -  \\nWhat?  \\nJOE BASTIN FREDDIE \\nBohemian Rhapsody was “too long”, it  \\nwould “never work as a single”. \\nJOE BASTIN \\nMy sincerest apologies. \\nFREDDIE \\nFunny--apologies take so long,  \\nbut criticism arrives just like that! \\nJOE BASTIN \\nBut! I still think “Love Of My Life”  \\nwould have been the better choice! \\nOver laughter, FREDDIE picks up a bottle, as if to strike  JOE -  \\nJOE BASTIN \\nJust kidding! Just kidding!  \\n(CONTINUED) \\n78.\\nCONTINUED: (2) \\nUnder the table JOE pats FREDDIE’s LEG as he grins at the  others -  \\nJOE BASTIN \\nWe’re all here for you, Freddie. \\nFREDDIE reacts to the tap on the knee and the look in JOE  BASTIN’s eyes like an ELECTRIC SHOCK. Did BASTIN just make  a pass at him?  \\nMARY observes this - and feels left out.  \\nPAUL PRENTER \\nTell us about your childhood? \\nFREDDIE \\n(shakes his head) \\nUh uh uh uh. The future? (pointing) \\nIt’s that way! Fuck today, it’s  \\ntomorrow already. \\nJIM BEACH \\nSuch an enigma. \\nFREDDIE \\nOh I hope so. True stardom is the  \\nabsence of detail. \\nBut the clues are all in my songs.  \\nThey’re all...  \\nFREDDIE eyes go back to JOE BASTIN, who is talking now with  PAUL PRENTER... \\n...in my... \\nFREDDIE \\nAs FREDDIE watches BASTIN - MARY notices. When FREDDIE,  embarrassed, turns back to looks at her, he kisses her on  the cheek and TAPS her on the leg in the exact same way  BASTIN just did to him.  \\nNoticing all this, is ROGER, who looks between FREDDIE,  MARY and JOE BASTIN, even while chatting up a BRUNETTE  BEAUTY.  \\nINT. PARTY - NIGHT \\nFREDDIE and JOE BASTIN are talking. FREDDIE seems nervous,  shy. JOE BASTIN then kisses FREDDIE on the CHEEK. JOE  BASTIN then walks off, into the crowd, as - FREDDIE is  joined by MARY and PAUL PRENTER, who carries drinks.  \\n(CONTINUED) \\n79.\\nCONTINUED: \\nPAUL PRENTER \\nHere we go. And - Freddie?--just want  \\nto thank you.  \\nBut FREDDIE’s mind is only on JOE BASTIN -  \\nPAUL PRENTER \\nFor keeping me on, you know?--I will  \\nlive and die for you, man. Want you to  \\nknow that. Freddie? \\nFREDDIE \\nBe back in a second. Paul, look  \\nafter Mary, would you?  \\nFREDDIE pushes through the crowd, going after BASTIN, and  is gone.  \\nMARY and PRENTER, who don’t like each other, are stranded  there, with their preposterous drinks.  \\nREACTION, MARY: Anxious. Knows something is going on. She  sips her drink and then looks at PAUL...He smiles weakly at  her, INSINCERELY... \\nPretty dress. (beat) \\nPAUL PRENTER \\nMake it yourself? \\nMARY, insulted, stares at PAUL, her dislike confirmed. \\nINT. FREDDIE & MARY’S FLAT/ LONDON - DAY \\nMARY comes in with SHOPPING BAGS and a stack of BRIDAL  CATALOGUES. FREDDIE is sleeping off his hang-over. MARY is  still carrying anxiety, but trying to hide it.  \\nMARY \\nOh, not still in bed?! Come on. If  \\nyou come in so late that’s your fault.  \\nGet up! \\nShe tugs at his COVERS. \\nMARY \\nCome on! I want your opinion on  \\nwedding dresses and venues--we have a  \\nchoice of three. Freddie?! Freddie!  \\nWe need to talk about the wedding! \\n(CONTINUED)\\n\\n\\nScripts.com \\nDeadpool 2 By Rhett Reese \\nPage 1/61\\n2 \\nFuck Wolverine. \\nFirst, he rides my coattails \\nwith the R rating. \\nThen the hairy motherfucker \\nups the ante by dying. \\nWhat a dick. \\nWell, guess what, Wolvie? \\nI\\'m dying in this one, too. \\nTo understand \\nwhy I took a cat-nap \\non 1,200 gallons \\nof high-test fuel... \\nI need to take you back \\nto the dewy slopes \\nof six weeks ago. \\nI\\'d gone international, \\ntaking out mass murderers, \\ngangsters, \\nunspeakable monsters. \\nPeople nobody would touch. \\nExcept me. \\nI\\'m gonna touch them all over.

You know, the depth of \\nyour heart is extraordinary. \\nWe all need \\na sense of belonging. \\nWe all need \\na genuine sense of home. \\nA place in this world. \\nI want to become \\na contract killer. \\nI\\'m sorry. What did you say? \\nRemember when I kidnapped Bandhu and threatened him \\nwith great violence? \\nYou kind of killed him. \\nAnd then remember the movie \\nInterview with the Vampire? \\nDon\\'t want to. \\nWhen Tom Cruise fed \\n10-year-old Kirsten Dunst blood for the first time... \\nand she looked up at his smooth, handsome face and said... \\n\"I want some more.\" \\nOh, Pool, picture me, \\na 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst. \\nI\\'ll never not picture that. \\nBut I can\\'t wait \\nto never speak of this, \\nas soon as possible. \\nWe\\'re here. \\nYou\\'re my Tom Cruise! \\nAnd you\\'re my Kristen Dunst! \\nPage 5/61\\nKristen?

Well, come here. \\nI\\'m gonna shower \\nand get out of this suit. \\nDon\\'t you want your surprise? \\nDo I look like \\na patient burn victim? \\nI got one for you, too. \\nHappy anniversary, baby. \\nOpen, open, open. \\nSkee-Ball token. \\nOur first date. \\nYup. \\nThat\\'s genuine, high-grade lead. I\\'ll keep it forever. \\nThank you, baby. \\n- Open yours. \\n- All right, all right. \\nOh... \\nThat\\'s just the most \\nbeautiful thing that I\\'ve... \\nI don\\'t know what this is. \\nMy IUD. \\nA bomb? \\nNo, dick for brains. \\nMy birth control device. \\nWhat, you mean that your... \\nBaby factory\\'s open \\nfor business. \\nOh, my God! \\nPage 6/61\\nOh, my God! I want a boy! \\nOr a little girl! \\nDefinitely one or the other! \\nOh!

Look at me. \\nYou are not your father. \\nBesides... \\nI will never, ever \\nlet our child be named Todd. \\nBut here\\'s the thing, \\nisn\\'t that how it always works? Like in Star Wars, \\nmen are destined \\nto become their father... \\nand then have consensual sex \\nwith their sister? \\nI think you missed \\nbig, big chunks of that movie. No, I\\'m pretty sure \\nLuke nailed her. \\nPage 7/61\\nBaby, that\\'s Empire. \\nThe point is, kids... \\nthey give us a chance \\nto be better than we are. \\nBetter than we used to be. \\nYou\\'re a lot smarter \\nthan I look. \\nI\\'m gonna go make dessert. \\nYou get the strap-on. \\nLet\\'s make a super baby. \\nPretty sure it doesn\\'t work \\nthat way, but we can try. \\nWhat about Krystal? \\nBut with a \"K\"? \\nIt\\'s too stripper-y. \\nKevin with a \"K\"! \\nNo, too stripper-y, too. \\nUh, Earl! \\nHe\\'s gonna go straight to jail if we name him Earl. \\nWhat about Bruce? \\nNo. \\nGet down. \\nWhat? \\nBaby? Baby? \\nI\\'m okay. \\nThank God I didn\\'t have to use the cream cheese spreader. \\nPlease. \\nPlease. Please. \\nBaby, I\\'m so sorry. \\nNo! \\nPapa, can you hear me? \\nIs it just me, or does \\nDo You Want to Build \\na Snowman? from Frozen... \\nsound suspiciously like \\nPapa, Can You Hear Me? \\nFrom Yentl? \\nPapa, can you hear me? \\nAnd nobody fucking realizes it. Go home. You\\'ve been here \\nfor three days, okay? \\nYou smell like somebody shit \\nPage 8/61\\nin a Civil War wound... \\nafter it had become gangrenous. They should\\'ve just \\namputated it. Why shit in it? \\nDoesn\\'t make any sense. \\nI love Frozen. \\nI loved her. I loved her \\nlike an ocean loves water. \\nAn ocean is water. \\nMore importantly, I liked her. I really liked her, you know? \\nGeorge Michael was right. \\nI\\'m never \\ngonna dance again. Fuck! \\nHe\\'s dead, too. \\nAt least we still have Bowie. \\nYeah. We still have Bowie. \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nShot after shot, \\nit\\'s not gonna change the fact that I think you\\'re... \\nAre you pissing? Are you \\nurinating right now? \\nYou\\'re making the face that \\nyou make when you urinate. \\n- Is he pissing? \\n- I\\'m on it! \\nThere you go, Dopinder. \\nIf you want to be \\na contract killer... \\nyou gotta handle a mop \\nbefore you handle a gun. \\nAlthough I don\\'t \\nquite understand \\nhow they are at all similar. \\nWell, they both have handles. \\nNow, leave me. \\nGo home, Wade. \\nI don\\'t have a home, \\nWeas, you know. I got a... \\nFuck!

That\\'s your main course. \\nThey\\'re soft, they\\'re moist. \\nThey\\'re for babies. \\nFinally, one more pass \\nwith the toilet paper, \\nmaybe clear out \\nthat excess moisture. \\nMaybe treat yourself \\nto a blow and go, \\nif you can get you a hair dryer. Just about 30 seconds \\nwill do you good. \\nThe fuck? \\nYear? \\nWhat? \\nWhat year is it? \\nWhat kind of dumb-ass \\nquestion is that to ask? \\nYou\\'re a long way \\nfrom your superpowers. \\nPage 20/61\\nYeah. \\nFuck! \\nI wanted to be a superhero. \\nAlways wanted a real super suit. What happened? \\nWhen was the last time you saw a plus-sized superhero? \\nNever. \\nThe industry discriminates. \\nFuck superheroes. \\nFuck everyone. \\nThe first thing I wanna do \\nwhen I get out of here... \\nburn the headmaster alive... \\nand then take a selfie \\nwith his smoldering corpse. \\nWho says \\nprison isn\\'t reformative? \\nFucker hates mutants. \\nBlessed are the wicked \\nwho are healed by my hand. \\nYour abilities. \\nI know how seductive they are. Now, please don\\'t cry. \\nTomorrow, we\\'ll find \\nthe biggest guy in here... \\nand we\\'ll make him our... \\nWhat was that? \\nThat is the biggest guy in here. Fun fact about the Ice Box... \\nthough no one\\'s ever seen it, \\nthey keep a monster \\nin the basement. \\nRight next to a huge, \\nsteaming bowl of foreshadowing. Look. \\nI can\\'t protect you. \\nWith this collar on, \\nmy superpower \\nis just unbridled cancer. \\nGive me a bow and arrow, \\nI\\'m basically Hawkeye. \\nNow, if you\\'ll excuse me... \\nI\\'ve got tumors to grow. \\nPage 21/61\\nVanessa awaits. \\nI\\'ll start by making us a shank. - Good listening. \\n- I stole that guard\\'s pen... \\nand stashed it \\nin the old prison wallet, \\nif you know what I\\'m saying. \\nPrison wallet? \\nI really hope I don\\'t know \\nwhat you\\'re saying. \\nI can hear you \\nrummaging around in there. \\nAnd to update you \\non the story reported earlier, after a lengthy standoff \\noutside the Essex House \\nfor Mutant Rehabilitation... \\ntwo mutants were arrested \\nand transported \\nto the Ice Box... \\nEntering repair mode. \\nSeveral \\npolice cars were destroyed \\nand the X-Men were called in \\nto restore order. \\nCells seven and nine \\nnow off-limits \\nfor medical personnel. \\nCells seven and nine \\nnow off-limits \\nfor medical personnel. \\nPsst! \\nDon\\'t do that. \\nWhat? Why are you winking at me? I got your back. \\nOh, my God. \\nYou\\'re sick, \\nI gotta protect you. \\nJust leave me alone, kid. \\nOh, great. \\nWell, hello there, new fish. \\nIt\\'s nice to see some \\nfresh faces around here. \\nI\\'ve done some \\nPage 22/61\\nlight catalog work... \\nbut, really, modeling is just \\na stepping stone to acting. \\n- I was talking to him. \\n- Oh. \\nHave we met? \\nI can\\'t place your mustache. \\n- Black Tom Cassidy. \\n- White Wade Wilson. \\nWhat\\'s your superpower? \\nCultural appropriation? \\nYou\\'re supposed to be \\nthe toughest cunt in here. \\nYou don\\'t look like much to me. First rule of the yard, \\nfuckface... \\nfind the biggest guy \\nand make him your... \\nSecond biggest guy. \\nThe last thing I need \\nis more hepatitis. \\nOh, it\\'s slippery, too. \\nThis table needs a wipe down! \\nCan we get a wipe down \\non the table? \\nKid, I think you picked \\nthe wrong side. \\nNo, I didn\\'t! He\\'s my friend! \\nZip it. We\\'re not friends. \\nYou\\'re about to get \\ndick-slapped. \\nI had so much fun! \\nYou were like... \\nAnd I was like, \\n\"Take a seat, shit dick.\" \\nJust let me die in peace. \\nWe make a great team! \\nOh, God! We\\'re not a team. \\nWhy\\'d you say that back there? We\\'re friends, partners. \\nWe\\'re not partners or friends. This doesn\\'t end with us \\nriding into the sunset. \\nIt ends with me \\nPage 23/61\\ndying of cancer... \\nand you winning the Ice Box \\naward for softest mouth. \\nThere\\'s only one person \\nin this world \\nthat I care about, \\nand she\\'s gone. \\nYou wanna survive? \\nStop trying to shank \\nthe biggest guys in here... \\nand make friends with them. \\nMake friends with someone. \\nAnyone but me. \\nMaybe even Black Tim. \\nBlack Evan, I don\\'t know. \\nAll I remember is \\nhe was African-American. \\nSystem malfunctioning. \\nCells 7, 12, 14, 27. \\nBack in your cells, you filthy mutants! Get in there! \\nCells 1, 3, 7, 8. \\nSearching. \\nCell 04 located. \\nDoor won\\'t open! \\nOn your fucking knees! \\nThat was our cell. \\nWhat did I do to piss off \\na grumpy old fucker \\nwith a Winter Soldier arm? \\nGet away from me, kid! \\nListen to me! Go! \\nHello, Russell. \\nHello, superpowers. \\nWho are you? \\nI\\'m Batman. \\nOoh! \\nOh. That\\'s got some zip. \\nDon\\'t feel bad. \\nEven I can\\'t kill me. \\nTalk! \\nWhat kind of \\nspineless shit stick \\ntries to kill a 14-year-old boy? Page 24/61\\nYou might wanna start talking! \\'Cause I got a long history of \\nfiring at times like this! \\nThe name\\'s Cable. \\nI\\'m from the future. \\nJust walk away. \\nOh! \\nSo, you\\'re from the future. \\nI have three questions then. \\nOne, is dubstep still a thing? Two, which Sharknado are we on? And three, at what point \\ndo audiences say... \\n\"Enough with the robotic arms\"? Dubstep\\'s for pussies. \\nYou\\'re so dark! \\nAre you sure you\\'re not \\nfrom the DC universe? \\nI love dubstep! \\nIs that a fanny pack? \\nI used to have one of those \\nin 1990-never. \\nSomething to remember you by. \\nGive me that back! \\nThat goes with me everywhere. \\nLike the memory \\nof your fucking fanny pack! \\nWhy are you protecting the kid? I don\\'t give a fuck about him... and his Are You My Mother? \\nComplex! \\nWhat\\'s this one do? \\nIn every film, there\\'s a moment when the hero hits rock bottom. In Cool Runnings, \\nit was when John Candy\\'s \\nprized bobsled broke. \\nIn Human Centipede, \\nit was when those people... \\nsigned on to be in that movie. But in this film, well... \\nyou\\'re looking at it. \\nOn your fucking knees, mutant. Rock... \\nPage 25/61\\nmeet bottom. \\nI love you, Wade Wilson. \\nNess? \\nHey, Ness! \\nNess, can you let me in? \\nPlease! Please. \\nJesus. \\nYou\\'re not giving me \\na lot of direction here. \\nI\\'m at the end of my rope. \\nThen I joined the X-Men. \\nI went to prison. I, uh... \\nIs it the kid? \\nKids give us a chance to be \\nbetter than we used to be. \\nThe kid! \\nThat\\'s exactly what she meant. Your heart needs to be \\nin the right place. \\nI\\'m not gonna abandon this kid. He\\'s never had anyone, ever. \\nI need to be selfless. \\nYeah, but what does that mean? It means I\\'m gonna save Russell. Maybe I couldn\\'t save Vanessa... but maybe I can save a robust \\nteenager from New Zealand. \\nYeah, but what I mean is, \\nlike, the world \"selfless.\" \\nI literally don\\'t know \\nwhat that means. \\nJesus Christ. \\nOkay, look. \\nAccording to my guy, okay... \\nthose muties \\nare being transferred \\nto a supermax, 80 miles away. \\nGreat, I\\'ll pick \\'em off \\nalong the way. \\nHold your testicles there, \\nbuddy, okay? \\nWe\\'re talking about \\nan armored convoy... \\nand a vicious super soldier \\nPage 26/61\\nfrom the future... \\nthat is looking to turn your \\nskull into a fuckable ashtray. You know what we need to do? \\nWe need to build a fucking team. We need \\'em tough, \\nmorally flexible... \\nand young enough \\nso they can carry \\nthis franchise 10 to 12 years. My body is an \\ninstrument of death. \\nNot now, Dopinder. \\nI could be of great use. \\nWhat\\'s your superpower? \\n- Courage. \\n- That\\'s adorable. \\nDo you have the courage \\nto check and see... \\nif there are enough sanitary \\nnapkins in the dispenser? \\nYes, sir. \\nI\\'m sorry you had to see that, although I\\'m glad you heard it. All right, I\\'ll put out \\na call for resumes. \\nBut we\\'re not paying \\nmedical or dental. \\nIt\\'s time to get back \\non Linkedln. \\nTransport \\nwill begin at 0800 hours... \\nOi. \\nWhat the fuck do you want? \\nThat\\'s my fucking pudding. \\n- Fuck your pudding! \\n- You like pudding? \\nHello? \\nI know you\\'re in there. \\nMust be hard being the \\nbiggest guy in here. \\nLonely at the top, eh? \\nThey\\'re moving us tomorrow. \\nMaybe I can get you out of here. Page 27/61\\nAnd we can make \\nthe whole world our bitch. \\nWe need a secret code. \\nNo, \\nthat\\'s stupid, Russell. Idiot. We\\'re a team. \\nWe\\'re like thugs, \\nwe\\'re like gangsters. \\nI\\'m like Tupac, \\nand you\\'re like Ice Cube. \\nSupposedly, she can rap, too. \\nI like that. \\nTerrific, \\nthese are all terrific. \\nMeet Bedlam. \\nCool name! Superpowers? \\nI can distort \\nelectrical fields. \\nIncluding the one \\ninside your brain... \\ncausing anxiety, confusion... \\npain. \\nSo, basically, \\nyou\\'re Dave Matthews. \\nWe can use him. \\nI\\'m Zeitgeist. \\nCool. I like it. \\nSo you have the power \\nto put your finger \\non the pulse of society? \\nNo. \\nNo, I spit acidic vomit. \\n- Oh. \\n- Do you want me \\n- to demonstrate? \\n- No! \\nWe\\'ll take your word for it. \\nThank you. Yeah. Listen, we\\'ve all eaten at Arby\\'s, okay? \\nAnd this is the Vanisher. \\nBut... \\nVanisher! \\nNice! Right? \\nHe\\'s not here, is he? \\nPage 28/61\\nHe may be running late. \\nMy name\\'s Rusty, \\nbut I go by Shatterstar. \\nThat\\'s good, yeah. \\n- \"Rusty\" is terrible. \\n- Toughie. \\n- So, uh, where are you from? \\n- The planet Mojo World. \\n- So you\\'re an alien, I guess. - Bad name. \\nHow does that, uh, help us? \\nI\\'m basically better \\nthan you at everything. \\nJust once, I\\'m gonna find \\na planet of people \\nthat are worse than me \\nat everything. \\nA whole bunch \\nof functional idiots. \\nI\\'m gonna go there, and I\\'m \\ngonna be their Superman. \\nIsn\\'t that Canada? \\nYou shut your \\ngoddamn trash mouth! \\n- Meet... \\n- Domino. \\n- What\\'s your shtick? \\n- I\\'m lucky. \\nIf you\\'re so lucky, then what \\nare you doing here with us? \\nI don\\'t know yet. \\nWhat\\'s that supposed to mean? \\nIt means that I don\\'t know yet. But there\\'s a reason \\nwhy I\\'m here, \\nand I\\'ll know when I know. \\nEverything usually \\nworks out for me. \\nLuck isn\\'t a superpower. \\n- Yes, it is. \\n- No, it isn\\'t. \\n- Yes, it is. \\n- No, ma\\'am. \\n- Mmm-hmm. \\nPage 29/61\\n- Mario No-pez. \\n- Yeah. \\n- Nacho cheese. \\nNo, it definitely is. \\nI really... \\nThere\\'s no way that it... \\nSorry, I was interrupting you. - Sorry. No, I interrupted you. - No, no, no. You can go first. Oh, I was just gonna say, \\n\"No, it isn\\'t.\" \\nI was gonna just bring it back to that yes, it is. \\nLet\\'s meet in the middle \\nand say, \"No, it isn\\'t.\" \\n- But it is. \\n- Okay. \\n- You\\'re hired! \\n- You\\'re hired. \\nOh, lucky me. \\nShe\\'s great. \\nAnd last, but not least... \\nPeter. \\nAm I getting \\ncatfished here or...? \\nAny powers you wanna \\ntell us about? \\nNo. \\nI don\\'t have one. \\nUm, I just saw the ad \\nand thought it looked fun. \\nYou\\'re in. \\n- Yeah. \\n- Fuck! \\nIt\\'s fulfilling work. \\nLet\\'s go! \\nThis is Convoy 17 \\ndeparting the Ice Box. \\nWe are en route. \\nPeacetime makes people soft. \\nI was born into war. \\nBred into it. \\nOkay. \\nPeople think \\nPage 30/61\\nthey understand pain. \\nWhat\\'s the most pain \\nyou\\'ve ever felt? \\nThese restraints are pretty... I\\'ve got a list. \\nWe\\'re gonna work down it. \\nTogether. \\nNumber one, \\nI\\'m gonna bend something. \\nSomething that was not \\nmeant to bend. \\nI\\'m gonna stop you right there because I\\'m not gonna \\nmake it to two. \\nI won\\'t even make it to one. \\nI don\\'t do well with pain, \\nyou know. \\nIf I stub my toe, \\nI\\'m done for the day. \\nI cried when \\nthey canceled Felicity. \\nWhen I get really scared, \\nI get nervous erections. \\nI have one right now. \\nDon\\'t look. \\nIt\\'ll only make it worse. \\nI don\\'t want you to hurt me, \\nand I\\'ll tell you \\nanything you wanna know. \\nExcept for where they are. \\nRussell\\'s in a convoy \\nheading southbound \\non Gerry Duggan Parkway. \\nThe monster\\'s with them. \\nI wouldn\\'t fuck with him. \\nYou all know the plan. \\nIntercept the convoy, \\ngrab the boy. \\nBut not inappropriately! \\nYou know what, \\nI wouldn\\'t fuck with \\nDeadpool either. \\nBecause he\\'s built a team. \\nHe\\'s unstoppable. \\nPage 31/61\\nHe has an ass pen. \\nHe\\'ll stab you with it. \\nWatch out for this guy, Cable! He\\'s very short, 5\\'11\". \\nNot like in the comics. \\nAnd if we succeed, \\nwe all go home early. \\nSo if you go after \\nthem, Cable, I warn you... \\nthere\\'s a wind advisory \\nin effect. \\nA little turbulent up here. \\nI don\\'t know much \\nabout this Cable fella... \\nbut I guarantee he hasn\\'t killed as many people as melanoma has. We\\'re getting close! \\nAs a former X-Man... \\n- Trainee. \\n- Thank you, Bedlam. \\nI was always appalled \\nby the blatant sexism \\nin the group\\'s name. \\nX-Men! Men! \\nThe point is, our group \\nwill be forward thinking. \\nGender neutral. \\nFrom now on, \\nwe\\'ll be known as... \\nX-Force. \\nIsn\\'t that a little derivative? I don\\'t recall asking \\nyour opinion, Peter! \\nThat wasn\\'t me. \\nHang the laundry out \\nat 1,300 feet... \\nintercept the convoy, \\nand grab the boy. \\nLet\\'s bring on \\nthe carnage, baby! \\nGet me on the ground, \\nwatch me go! \\nYeah! \\nI can\\'t wait to kill! \\nPage 32/61\\nHey! Hey! Hey! \\nI just wanna say \\nhow proud I am of this team. \\nYou know, you guys look amazing! Vanisher, I have no doubt \\nyou look amazing too. \\nThis is the family \\nthat I\\'ve always dreamed \\nof having and I... \\nAh, shit. \\nI just get a little \\nchoked up sometimes. \\nI hate to interrupt, \\nbut is anybody nervous \\nabout the high winds? \\n- Gary. \\n- My name\\'s Peter. \\nI realize that you\\'re new \\nto this, but relax. \\nYou\\'ve been chosen \\nby a higher power. \\n- Did he just call himself God? - I think he did. \\n- I\\'d like to go home. \\n- And I\\'d like... \\nthe McRib to be available \\nyear round, \\nbut sometimes \\ndreams don\\'t come true. \\nI spent 10 years \\nin Special Forces. \\nYou think we didn\\'t \\njump out of the plane \\nbecause of a light breeze? \\nYou\\'re in this shit now, \\nMustache! \\nI\\'m only yelling \\nto impress the other guys. \\nI\\'d never let anything \\nhappen to you, Sugarbear. \\nLeonard, hit it! \\nGo! Go! Go! \\nLet\\'s get some! \\nWhoo! \\nPage 33/61\\nOh, yeah! \\nConvoy, 12 o\\'clock! \\nOn my command! \\nDeploy! Oh, hey now! \\nWhoa! \\nLittle off course here. \\nHoly mommy fucking shit! \\nAh, there they are. \\nLook at these gorgeous \\nsons of bitches. \\nOh, yeah! That\\'s right, Bedlam! No! Tripping \\nmotherfucking billies! \\nShatterstar. Okay, you got this. Left! \\nLeft! \\nNo, stage left, you idiot! \\nWell, I guess we found something you\\'re not better at. \\nVanisher. \\nMaybe the wind can\\'t blow \\nwhat it can\\'t see. \\nOh! Really? \\nAll right, \\nwe could do this with four. \\nSugarbear. You got this, buddy! That\\'s the stuff! \\nThat\\'s the X-Force spirit! \\nNever underestimate \\na man with a mustache! \\nJust ask anyone in Brooklyn. \\nWe did it! \\nYou\\'re a goddamn superhero, you! X-Force! \\nX-Force. \\nOh! \\nPeter. \\nI got you, buddy! \\n- You\\'re gonna be fine! \\n- This is not good, man! \\nYou got this, big guy! \\nHere we go, Peter! \\nLook at me. \\nWe\\'re X-Force, right? \\nPage 34/61\\n- Yeah, we\\'re X-Force. \\n- We\\'re X-Force. \\nOh, my God! What the fuck? \\nFucking acidic vomit! \\nOh, God! I\\'m gonna throw up \\nin my mask. \\nOkay, I\\'m over the convoy. \\nWhere did the rest \\nof the team land? \\nGood news and bad news. \\nBad news is \\nthe whole team is dead. \\nThe good news is, \\nI don\\'t think anyone\\'s \\ngonna miss Shatterstar. \\nHe was a bit of a prick. \\nOh, but Paul! \\nPeter! \\nPeter, I\\'m gonna miss him most. But there is a slight chance \\nVanisher could make it. \\n- -Nope, no chance. He\\'s dead. The whole team? \\nOnly the main ones. \\nWe\\'re still good. \\nFuck, you are dumb. \\nEven after all this time, \\nI still can\\'t talk about it. \\nWho knew these winds \\nwould be so strong? \\nEveryone! \\nEveryone on the helicopter! \\nAnd everyone \\nnot on the helicopter! \\nThey\\'re headed into the tunnel. I\\'m that kid\\'s only hope, \\nso sit tight \\nand wait for my word. \\nWhatever. \\nWe\\'re gonna lose \\'em. \\nI\\'m dropping in. \\nUh, that\\'s \\na negative, sole survivor. \\nLuck is not a superpower! \\nPage 35/61\\nWe are so fucked! \\nNo, we most certainly \\nare not fucked. \\nSeriously, I don\\'t get it! \\nWhat, you shoot luck lasers \\nout of your eyes? \\nIt\\'s just it\\'s hard to picture. And certainly \\nnot very cinematic. \\nI mean, luck? \\nWhat coked out, \\nglass pipe-sucking \\nfreakshow comic book artist... came up \\nwith that little chestnut? \\nProbably a guy \\nwho can\\'t draw feet! \\nOnce again, it all falls \\non my shoulders. \\nIt\\'s why I\\'m cursed to be \\na solo act. \\n- Wander the Earth... \\n- I\\'m in. \\nI\\'m sorry, what did you say? \\nI\\'m in. \\nHow in the fuck \\nare you in already? \\nOh, shit. \\nIt\\'s Cable. 12 o\\'clock. \\nOkay. \\nNew plan. Use all of your \\nimaginary powers \\nto stop Cable \\nfrom killing that kid. \\nI\\'m coming up on your six. \\nThat gun is amazing! \\nHey! Asshole! \\nWhere is he? I can\\'t see him. \\nHe\\'s on top of you. \\nHe\\'s going in through the back! Oh, God, he\\'s inside! \\nYou hear yourself, right? \\nAccidental double entendres! \\nRussell! Russell Collins! \\nPage 36/61\\nHands off that kid, John Connor! No, no, no! \\nShit! \\nTwo can play that game! \\nGot it! No, I don\\'t. \\nShowtime, mama! \\nLady Luck, take the wheel. \\nI\\'d ask who you are, but \\nyou\\'ll be dead in a second. \\nI\\'m Domino, and doubtful. \\nHang in there, Doms! \\nOh, this is really hard. \\nAnd give me back \\nmy Skee-Ball token. \\n- You\\'re doing great. \\n- X-Force. \\nI guess dubstep never dies. \\nWhoo! \\nYou killed Black Tom, \\nyou racist son of a bitch! \\nThat\\'s unfortunate. \\nWe got no brakes! \\nFigure it out! \\nThere\\'s nothing I can\\'t kill. \\nOoh. \\nSomebody knows karate. \\nGive me your best shot, \\nOne-Eyed Willy. \\nOw. \\nHere we go. \\nDomino, mind slowing us down? \\nHere goes nothing. \\nKnock, knock. \\nThat\\'s my boy. \\nHoly... \\nI\\'ll be first to admit... \\nthis did not go \\naccording to plan. \\nI\\'ll also be the first \\nto admit that \\nthat plan was written in crayon. Looks like Russell found \\na new friend. Jelly. \\nTurns out Domino\\'s \\nPage 37/61\\na bit of a badass, \\nand maybe, \\npossibly mildly lucky. \\nBut Cable? Ugh. \\nThat guy\\'s in a mood. \\nA mood that is \\nabout to get \\nsignificantly worse. \\nSomething is so terribly, \\nterribly wrong. \\nOh. \\nOh, God, that hurt. \\nRussell. \\nRussell! \\nRuss, where are ya? \\nRussell. Russell, you\\'re okay! Oh, thank God. Oh, my God! \\nJuggernaut! \\nI thought that was you! \\nI should\\'ve worn my white pants. You probably get this a lot, \\nbut I am a huge fan. \\nUncanny X-Men 183. Thor 411. \\nX-Men Unlimited 12. \\nYou know, it has always been \\na dream of mine... \\nto see my face \\nreflected in your helmet... \\nas you charge at me \\nwith murderous intent. \\nI don\\'t mean right now. \\nI\\'m gonna rip you in half now. That is such \\na Juggernaut thing to say. \\nOh, my God! \\nI can\\'t feel my legs. \\nI can\\'t feel... \\nOh, no, they\\'re right here. \\nGot \\'em. God, Russell. \\nI have a mission. \\nTo get my revenge. \\nI\\'m going to burn \\nthat headmaster alive. \\nYou\\'re not the revenge type. \\nPage 38/61\\nTake it from a friend. \\nFriend? You were sick, \\nand I protected you. \\nYou said it yourself. \\n\"I\\'m not your friend. \\nFind someone stronger.\" \\nSo I did. \\nRussell, I couldn\\'t \\nprotect you back then. \\nBut I can now. What do you \\nwant me to say, huh? \\n\"I care about you\"? \\n\\'Cause goddamn it, \\nI care about you, Russell. \\nWhat\\'s Juggernaut got \\nthat I don\\'t have? \\nDon\\'t you say legs! I know \\nyou\\'re gonna say legs! \\n- Legs! \\n- Still hurts to hear out loud! What is that? \\nThat\\'s not a real rope! \\nYou get back here, young man! \\nDoms! \\nDoms, get me \\nout of here, please. \\nUse my arms as backpack straps. I think we may have found \\nyour cosmic reason \\nfor being here. \\nI\\'m pretty sure this isn\\'t it. X-Force. \\nNo child is hopeless. \\nDon\\'t give up on the boy. \\nHow could he just walk away? \\nIt was the coldness in his eyes. You should\\'ve heard it. \\nI guess family \\nreally is an F-word. \\nRub my legs, Mama. \\nWhy would I rub your legs? \\nPlease, they hurt. \\nI have growing pains. \\nWhat in the... \\nPage 39/61\\nWhy is your hand so tiny again? That\\'s not my hand. \\nOh! Mary, mother of Joseph! \\nThat was nice for me. \\nWade! I heard what happened \\nwith the convoy and... \\nWhy wouldn\\'t you cover that up? A warrior has nothing \\nto be ashamed of. \\nYeah, but you do. Look at you. You\\'re just \\nstraight shirt-cocking it, \\ntoddler-style. \\nOh, yeah. Full Winnie the Pooh. The hell\\'s happening? \\nDescribe it. \\nI wouldn\\'t ask him to \\ndo that, if I were you. \\n- It\\'s like, um... \\n- Here we go. \\nIt\\'s like he was \\ngiving birth anally, \\nbut they quit halfway through. They got the legs out, \\nand they said, \\n\"You know what, I\\'m done.\" \\nHappy? \\nIt\\'s like he\\'s a Muppet \\nfrom the waist down. \\nBut this time, you can see \\nthe Muppet\\'s dick. \\nGrover\\'s got a cock \\nthe size of a twig. \\nMr. Weasel, I can \\nno longer be double-parked. \\nI\\'ve had three tickets already. No, no, no, DP, not again! \\nThis has happened before? \\n- -Jesus! Either vomit or don\\'t. The indecision is killing me. \\nWhy couldn\\'t God \\ntake my hearing? \\nOh. Wow! \\nCool your pits. \\nPage 40/61\\nThey\\'re growing back. \\nI\\'m talking about your face. \\nI\\'ve never seen you \\nwithout your mask before. \\n- Jesus Christ! \\n- Looks like an avocado. \\nYour legs, though, they\\'re cute. You wanna borrow \\na pair of pants? \\nI\\'m glad everybody dropped by. You must be wondering \\nwhy I didn\\'t call you here. \\nI\\'ll tell you why I\\'m here. \\n\"The Time Traveler\\'s Wife\\'s\" \\nhusband... \\nbeat me within \\nan inch of my life. \\nHe was torturing me! \\nBut all I told him was \\neverything he wanted to know. \\nSo, I\\'m here to help us gear up. So we can go after him \\nwithout me. \\nNo! \\nI\\'m doing this alone. \\nThe Juggernaut \\n- will kill you all. \\n- Fair enough. \\nI just need a couple of \\nhours to get some legs \\n- under me. \\n- What will you do? \\nI don\\'t care \\nwhat the kid did to me. \\nI ain\\'t letting Cable \\nget to him, \\neven if I have to \\nteabag him to death. \\nIt\\'s really just a sip \\nof tea at this point. \\nZip it, black Black Widow! \\nI\\'m flowing. \\nThe first order of business is to get me in front of Cable... \\nPage 41/61\\nso I can pull all the fucking \\nblood out of his body... \\nand fashion his bones \\ninto holiday jewelry. \\nThen, I\\'m gonna take his skin... and stretch it out \\nover a homemade mating drum. \\nHe\\'s standing \\nright behind you, isn\\'t he? \\nWhat in the ass? \\nIs this apartment listed \\non Tinder? Grindr? \\nYou picked the wrong shithole \\nto fuck, future boy. \\nUgh. Is that really necessary? No. It\\'s his \"Basic Instinct.\" What can we help you with? \\nI\\'m here to proposition you. \\nOh, boy! \\nHe\\'s really teeing it up, \\nisn\\'t he? \\nWho gets to make the first joke? I think we should all \\ndo it at the same time. \\nGood call. \\nFor $45, you get sucky-suck. \\nI only do over \\nthe pants, mouth stuff. \\nFuck! \\nThe Proposition has a wonderful Guy Pearce performance. \\nWait, wait, wait! \\nI wanna do mine over. \\n- Give us the line again. \\n- I need your help! \\nTrust me, I\\'m even less happy \\nabout this than you are... \\nbut you unleashed the \\nJuggernaut, you dumb cunt! \\nI can\\'t bring him down alone. \\nSo here we are. \\nWe\\'re no longer \\naccepting applications \\nfor X-Force, unfortunately. \\nPage 42/61\\nEven if we were... \\nthere\\'s a wind advisory \\nin effect until at least... \\nWe don\\'t have a lot of time. \\nYour friend\\'s about \\nto make his first kill. \\nNo offense, \\nbut if you know so much... \\nwhy not travel back to when \\nhe was a baby, kill him then? \\nOr better yet, head back \\na little further, \\nkill baby Hitler. \\nI use a device \\nto slide through time. \\nThe longer I travel, \\nthe harder it is to control. \\nI got two charges: \\none to get me here, \\none to get me home. \\nWell. \\nThat\\'s just lazy writing. \\nYour boy\\'s \\ngonna kill the headmaster \\nof the orphanage tonight. \\nAfter that, \\nhe gets a real taste for it. \\nLike 10-year-old \\nKirsten Dunst, motherfucker! \\nSo he keeps killing... \\nand killing, and killing, \\nand killing. \\nUntil one day, he kills \\nthe wrong fucking people. \\nMy people. \\nRelax. \\nI\\'m retrieving something \\nfrom my utility bag. \\nIt\\'s a goddamn fanny pack... \\nand you know it, \\nyou sick son of a bitch! \\nThe difference is night and day. You remind me of my wife. \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nPage 43/61\\nI said, \"You remind me \\nof my wife.\" \\nNo, I\\'m sorry \\nthat you said that... \\nwhile making heavy eye contact and applying lip balm. \\nShe always struggled. \\nBut she was funny... \\nand filtered her pain \\nthrough the prism of humor. \\nSomething I could never master. It was my fault she died. \\nIt was my job \\nto stop people like him. \\nI came close a few times. \\nHe wasn\\'t too happy about that. He was trying to hurt me... \\nand he knew exactly \\nhow to do it. \\nBlessed are the wicked \\nwho are healed by my hand. \\nHe came into my home... \\nand took the only thing \\nthat made it a home. \\nSound familiar? \\n- I\\'m sorry. \\n- Uh-huh. \\nNo, I\\'m really sorry. \\nBut that isn\\'t Russell. \\n- It doesn\\'t have to be him. \\n- If you knew what I knew... \\nYeah, he\\'s got anger issues... maybe a small \\nlearning disability... \\nsplash of diabetes... \\nbut nothing that can\\'t be fixed. If you could go back... \\nand stop the people that took \\nyour girl, would you? \\nOf course I fucking would! \\nBut I wouldn\\'t kill a kid. \\nI\\'m not asking you \\nto kill a kid! \\nI\\'ll kill the kid. \\nPage 44/61\\nI\\'m asking you to save \\nhundreds of other kids. \\nRussell\\'s gonna burn down \\nthat orphanage. \\nAnd I can imagine \\nyour dead girlfriend... \\nwould want you to do the \\nright thing, wouldn\\'t she? \\nSo, what\\'s it gonna be, \\nhandsome? \\nGive me a chance to save him. \\n- What? \\n- You said... \\nonce he kills someone, \\nhe gets a taste for it. \\nIf we can get to him \\nbefore that happens... \\npromise you\\'ll give me a chance to put him on a different path. Define \"chance.\" \\nI don\\'t know. \\nHow long does it take \\nto save someone\\'s soul? \\nThat\\'s not... \\nI\\'ll give you 30 seconds. \\n- What? No! \\n- Best I can do. \\nTake it or leave it. \\nHe\\'s doing it! \\nLook at the little fella. \\nHe\\'s doing it. \\nThere he goes. \\nJesus Christ! \\nJust shirt-cocking it. \\nUgh. \\nThere you go, little fella. \\nGo on, you\\'re doing it! \\nMy beautiful, hairless, \\nTwizzler-legged baby boy. \\nChrist! \\nThat\\'s disturbing. \\n30 seconds. \\n- Deal. \\n- Deal. \\nPage 45/61\\nI have no idea what\\'s happening. Probably for the best. \\nAnd that is why \\nyou never eat a raw starfish. \\nIt\\'s just common sense. \\nWhere the hell are we going? \\nYou said it yourself. \\nNothing can stop the Juggernaut. We need backup. \\nI will bathe in the blood \\nof your enemies. \\nCan you turn off the music? \\nYou\\'ll do no such thing. \\nWhy don\\'t you just say it \\nin an Indian accent? \\nWhat the hell are you...? \\nOnce again, intolerance rears \\nits ugly head. \\nI am so sorry. It gets better. I\\'m not a fucking racist, moron! Tell that to Black Tom. \\nHe was like a brother to me. \\nI\\'m with the old white guy \\non this one. \\nAnd that\\'s a twist. \\nSo what exactly do you \\ndo in the future, anyway, huh? Some kind of soldier? \\nYeah, something like that. \\nI was a soldier. Special Forces. I bet 50 years from now, \\nwe\\'re bestest buddies. \\n50 years from now, \\nyou\\'re very dead. \\nYour entire generation fucked \\nthis planet into a coma. \\nBoom! \\nSpoiler alert. \\nPlanets. \\nNext time, Uber. \\nHere\\'s a spoiler alert. \\nYou\\'re not a fucking hero. \\nYou\\'re just an annoying clown \\ndressed up as a sex toy. \\nPage 46/61\\nWell, I got news for you. \\nMy heart is in the right place. Russell\\'s not gonna kill anyone. Because of me, he\\'s gonna know what real love looks like. \\nBecause of you, I\\'ll always know what a grown man \\nwith baby balls looks like. \\nI\\'m a grower, not a shower. \\nI should\\'ve finished college. \\nRight here! \\nI made mistakes! \\nI wanna take them back! \\nYou trusted me. \\nI took that trust... \\nand turned it into a glory hole in an airport bathroom. \\nThe one in Minneapolis. \\nYou know the one. \\nColossus! \\nI wouldn\\'t ask for your help \\nunless it was life or death! \\nThat kid needs our help! \\nI know you\\'re listening! \\nHe\\'s teamed up \\nwith the Juggernaut! \\nThe Juggernaut! \\nThat\\'s like my favorite \\nMarvel character ever, \\nbut you should never \\nmeet your heroes... \\nbecause, honestly, \\nhe\\'s a bit of a dick! \\nAnd like a lot of dicks, \\nhe\\'s as hard as a rock... \\nand causes nothing but problems! - Hi, Wade! \\n- Hi, Yukio! \\nPlease don\\'t. \\nYou guys make \\na super cute couple. \\nYeah. Where was I? Oh, yeah! \\nColossus! Look, I don\\'t deserve your friendship or your help. \\nPage 47/61\\nBut this kid does. \\nAnd I\\'m not gonna bail on him \\nlike everyone else. \\nOh, come on! \\nAny chance Pigeon Wings \\nis available? \\nThat\\'s just fine! That\\'s fine! No! You know what? \\nDoing the right thing \\nis sometimes messy... \\nand fucked up, and not \\nparticularly convenient! \\nSo stay here \\nin Chateau de Virgin... \\nwhile we go get our fuck on! \\nYou\\'re doing great. \\nSo you wear that helmet because your brother \\ntries to read your mind? \\nYeah, but he\\'s in \\na wheelchair, so even-steven. \\nSomeone\\'s coming. \\nIt\\'s Russell, sir. \\nHe\\'s not alone. \\nSecure the children. \\nWhat do you say \\nwe go fuck some shit up? \\n\"Let\\'s fuck some shit up\" \\nis my legal middle name. \\nWatch my back. \\nI\\'ve got the old man. \\nAmen, brother. \\nTime to make the chimichangas. 30 seconds. \\nI finally know why I\\'m here. \\nI was raised in this place. \\nWell, not raised. \\nI was tortured. \\nWow! It\\'s your cosmic reason \\nfor being here. \\n- Shall we? \\n- This is gonna be fun. \\nYeah! \\nHey! Been meaning to ask you... Page 48/61\\nwhat\\'s with the creepy, \\ndirty hobo bear? \\nIt\\'s not dirt. It\\'s the blood \\nof my dead daughter. \\nI have a gluten sensitivity. \\nSo one glass of wine, I just... Yeah. \\nWish we could head back in time, and I could take all that back. We should just cue the music. \\nWelcome home, Russell. \\nWe missed you. \\nRussell! \\nYou don\\'t need to do this! \\nLet\\'s talk! \\nWhy are you dressed \\nlike the Unabomber? \\nThat\\'s why! \\nTold you this little fucker\\'s \\ntoo far gone. \\nZip it, Thanos!

It doesn\\'t \\nhave to go this way! \\nThat piece of shit... \\nhe deserves to die \\nfor what he did to you. \\nHe hurt you badly. \\nMakes you wanna hurt others. \\nBut if you kill him, he wins. \\nYou become everything \\nhe says you are, but worse. \\nYou\\'re just a kid. \\nYou don\\'t wanna hurt anyone. \\nHow do you know what I want? \\nBecause I\\'ve been inside you. \\nThat came out wrong. \\nI\\'ve been inside your shoes. \\nWhich is also off-putting. \\nIt\\'s not a great analogy. \\nThe point is... \\nthere are people... \\nThere are people \\nin this fucking world... \\nbesides him, \\nwho will treat you right. \\nIt isn\\'t too late. Don\\'t do it.

Enjoy hell, swamp mouth. \\nAnd you, Cable. \\nYou get back to your family. \\nYou tell \\'em Wade says hi. \\nAnd promise me. \\nPromise me one thing. \\nThat you\\'ll start \\njudging people... \\nnot by the color of their skin, but by the content \\nof their character. \\n- Jesus. \\n- R-Dog? \\nThere you are. Hey! \\nYou\\'re a superhero now, bubba. Look. \\nFamily is not an F-word. \\nAll right? \\nThere\\'s one out there for you. Just keep looking, okay? \\nGuys, for a second there... \\nwe made a pretty good team. \\nOh, it\\'s so hard to go. \\nI just love being around \\nyou guys so much. \\nSo, so much. \\nMmm. \\nNo, I can feel it now. \\nHere it comes, yeah. \\nI feel the soul \\nexiting the husk. \\nYeah. \\nCan you see it? \\nDo you see \\nthat beautiful bright light? \\nThere it is. \\nOh, that\\'s the sun. \\nDon\\'t stare directly into that.

It would seem I... \\nHuh? \\nGenuine, high-grade lead. \\nYou time-sliding son of a bitch! You did this for me? \\nWait. You can\\'t go back. \\nYou used the last of your fuel. What about your girl, your wife? Now, my family\\'s safe. \\nPage 57/61\\nAnd I didn\\'t do it for you. \\nNo, I\\'m gonna stick around \\nfor a while... \\nand make sure the world \\ndoesn\\'t shit itself \\ninto oblivion. \\nNo. You did it for me. \\nNo, I didn\\'t. \\n- You did. \\n- I really didn\\'t. \\n- Pretty sure you did. \\n- No, I\\'m positive I didn\\'t. \\nFine.

Tell the \\nPage 2/37\\nboss we\\'re coming back home. \\nThree years after the \\nfall of Jurassic World, \\nthe debate over Isla \\nNublar rages on. \\nThe island\\'s long dormant \\nvolcano, reclassified as active, has shown considerable \\nunrest in recent months. \\nTheologists now predict \\nan extinction level event \\nwill kill off the last living \\ndinosaurs on the planet. \\nSince the disaster that \\nshocked the world in 2015, \\nthe Masrani Corporation has \\npaid out more than $800 million in damages to settle class action lawsuits brought by survivors. Activist groups have \\nmobilized around the globe, \\nin what has become the flashpoint animal rights issue of our time. With an eruption \\nexpected at any moment, \\nthe US Senate has convened \\na special committee, \\nto answer a grave \\nmoral question: \\nDo dinosaurs deserve \\nthe same protections \\ngiven to other \\nendangered species, \\nor should they be left to die? I think... \\nthat we should allow our... \\nmagnificent, glorious dinosaurs, to be taken out by the volcano. - Silence, please. \\n- As deeply sad as that would be. We altered the course \\nof natural history. \\nThis is the correction. \\nPage 3/37\\nAre you suggesting \\nthe Almighty is \\ntaking matters in His own hands? Senator, with all due \\nrespect, God\\'s not... \\npart of the equation. No. \\nWhat I mean is that, in the \\nlast century, we amassed \\na landmark technological power. And we\\'ve consistently proven ourselves incapable of handling that power. 80 years ago, who could\\'ve \\npredicted nuclear proliferation? But then, there it was. \\nAnd now, we\\'ve got genetic power. So... \\nHow long is it gonna take for \\nthat to spread around the globe and, what\\'s gonna \\nbe done with it? \\nIt ain\\'t gonna stop with the \\nde-extinction of the dinosaurs. I\\'m not sure I know what \\nyou\\'re talking about. \\nI\\'m talking about... \\nman-made, cataclysmic, \\nchange. \\nWhat kind of change? \\nChange is like death. \\nYou don\\'t know what it looks like until you\\'re standing at the gates. As a matter of fact, I do have the dinosaurs\\' best interests in mind. - I\\'m a paleo-veterinarian. \\n- Is that a real thing? \\n- That\\'s a real thing. \\n- You\\'ve seen one? \\nNo! I hadn\\'t seen one with my own eyes. you know not \\neveryone can afford to spend \\ntheir life savings... Claire? \\nHello, hello, um... \\nCongresswoman Delgado. I\\'m Claire, the lead organizer in here. \\nPage 4/37\\nOf course, but if I can just \\nget a moment of your time? \\nGreat. Thank you. \\nSo, our mission here at the \\nDinosaur Protection Group is \\nto secure pivotal \\nfunding for a... \\nThat was like 40 seconds. \\nYou\\'re getting better. \\nYou gotta stop letting \\nyour mom shop for you. \\nYou don\\'t need to insult me \\neverytime someone pisses you off.

So your kids. \\nAn entire generation has \\ngrown up in a world \\nwhere dinosaurs are \\nliving and breathing. \\nBut soon you\\'re gonna have \\nto watch them go extinct. \\nOr not. \\nIf people like you \\nmake a difference. \\nGreat. \\nYes! \\n- Claire, it\\'s on. \\n- Hey, hey. Turn it up. \\n...take preventative action to protect the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar. \\nAfter thorough deliberations, \\nthe committee has resolved not to recommend any legislative action regarding the de-extinct \\ncreatures on Isla Nublar. \\nThis is an act of God, and \\nwhile of course, we feel great Page 5/37\\nsympathy for these animals, \\nwe cannot condone \\ngovernment involvement, \\non what amounts to a \\nprivately-owned venture. \\nThey\\'re all gonna die \\nand no one cares. \\nWe do. \\nGive me one second. \\nLet\\'s get back to work. \\nOkay everyone. Come on. \\n- Hello? \\n- May I speak with Ms. Dearing? \\n- Yes, this is Claire Dearing. \\n- Good morning. \\nI\\'m calling for Mr. Benjamin Lockwood\\'s estate. Would you mind holding for a second? Yes, of course. I\\'ll hold. \\nLockwood Estate \\nCalifornia \\nMs. Dearing, you\\'re early. \\n- Would you like to step in? \\n- Thank you. \\nI will inform Mr. Mills \\nthat you\\'ve arrived. \\nJohn Alfred Hammond. \\nThe father of Jurassic Park. \\nBut of course, you know that. \\nHello, Claire, I\\'m, I\\'m Eli. \\nMills. \\nI work for Ben Lockwood. We \\nactually met once, 7-8 years ago, \\n- and you don\\'t remember... \\n- Of course, I remember. \\n- Haven\\'t you run his foundations since... - Since college. Yeah. \\n- You remember? \\n- Yes! \\nWow, cool. He wanted \\nsomeone young, and, \\nidealistic to expand his fortune. \\nAnd I used to be both. \\nFollow me. \\nLet me give you a \\nPage 6/37\\nbit of history. \\nThis is where it all began. \\nBefore the islands, Sorna, \\nJurassic Park, all of it. \\nHammond and Lockwood built \\ncustom lab in a sub-basement \\nextracted the first \\nDNA from amber, \\nright beneath our feet. \\nMy goodness! What they \\ndid here was a miracle. \\n- I still believe that. \\n- So do I, Claire. \\nSo do I, and I still believe \\nit matters, what happens \\nto those animals. \\nThere is something Mr. Lockwood would very much like you to do, Claire. You can call it a favor \\nfor an old friend. \\nWe have, a piece of land. \\nA sanctuary. Protected \\nby natural barriers, \\nfully self-sustaining. A new home where the dinosaurs will be secure... - And free. \\n- You\\'re gonna get them out? \\n- You\\'re gonna save them? \\n- No, Ms. Dearing. \\nI\\'m going to save us. \\nWe could both use a touch \\nof redemption, couldn\\'t we? \\n- Lovely to see you again. \\n- And you, Mr. Lockwood. \\nThis was all John \\nHammond\\'s dream. \\nTo let these creatures \\nlive in peace. \\nSo, we have created sanctuary. No fences, no \\ncages, no tourists. \\nJust as Mother Nature intended. John said it best. \\n\"These creatures don\\'t \\nPage 7/37\\nneed our protection.\" \\n\"They need our absence.\" \\nWhen we were young, \\nwe both shared this \\npassion, John and I. \\nWhat fools we were. \\nTrying to run before \\nwe\\'d learn to walk. \\nAs all young men do, I suppose. \\nBut, we learned. \\nUnfortunately in the \\nend, it drove us apart. \\nLife, teaches us some \\nvery hard lessons... \\nDoesn\\'t it, Claire? \\nYes. \\nSir Benjamin. \\nHmm? \\nMy bloody medicines. \\n- Would you excuse me, Claire? \\n- Of course, sir. \\nEli here willl help \\nyou with the details. \\nWe will save them. \\nWith a gift... \\nFor our children. \\nThank you. \\nIris? \\nDoes he have children? I thought I saw... there was a little girl. \\nYeah, he has a grandchild. \\nHis daughter died \\nin a car accident. \\n- That\\'s awful. \\n- Yeah, I know. But they\\'re very close. Really close. \\nSo, what do you need from me? \\nThere was a tracking system \\nin place at the park. \\n- Radio frequency ID chips in each dinosaur. - I remember. \\nRight, so if we could \\naccess that system, \\nour ability to locate and capture those Page 8/37\\nanimals safely, will increase ten-fold. We need your handprint \\nto access the system. \\nBut what I really \\nneed, Claire... \\n...is you. \\nMoving endangered species \\nisn\\'t exactly legal. \\nBut it\\'s the right thing to do. No one knows this park as well as you do and we need that expertise. \\n- How many can you save? \\n- Eleven species. For sure, \\nI mean, more, if we can. But \\ntime is against us I\\'m afraid. \\nThere is one animal, \\nin particular \\nthat poses a real \\nchallenge for us. \\n- Blue. \\n- I didn\\'t know she had a name. But Blue, is potentially the second most intelligent piece of life on this planet. \\nAnd she\\'s the last of her kind. \\nShe must be preserved. \\nShe can pick up your scent a mile off. You will never capture her. \\nWell... \\nWe thought you might know \\nsomeone who could help. \\nMaybe you can convince him. \\nHey, Owen. \\nOwen! \\nOh, boy. \\nHi. \\nBack for more, huh? \\nCan I buy you a beer? \\nYou mean bring \\'em, or we \\ngonna like, go somewhere? \\nSeriously? \\nI can\\'t believe you \\nthink that you left me! \\nReplay that conversation in \\nyour head, all right? You said, \\nPage 9/37\\n\"You wanna go live in \\nyour van like a bum?\" \\n\"Go ahead, Owen.\" \\nAnd I said, \"Okay!\" \\n- So how is that you leaving me? - Because I left. \\n- I left you. \\n- You left, because... \\n- I told you to. \\n- And then, I left. \\nBecause you didn\\'t wanna live in a van on the side of the road. No, no, no. Because you wouldn\\'t let me drive the damn van, \\n- for 5 minutes. \\n- I\\'m chivalrous. What can I do? - You are so stubborn. \\n- Well. Look at you now. \\n- You\\'re saving the world. \\n- Well, I\\'m trying, at least. \\nYou can\\'t just run away \\nfrom everything, Owen. \\nSo, you\\'re what? \\nDating an accountant now? \\nAn insurance actuary? \\nYour skin looks nice. \\n- Dermatologist? \\n- Owen? \\n- Does he check you for moles? - Stop. \\nVentriloquist? \\n- This is not why we\\'re here, okay? - Yeah, I know why we\\'re here. Lockwood\\'s little \\nflunkie called me. \\nRescue op. \\nSave the dinosaurs from an \\nisland that\\'s about to explode. - What could go wrong? \\n- I\\'m going. \\n- Don\\'t! \\n- I don\\'t have a choice. \\n- What, of course you have a choice. - So what, I should just... \\nPage 10/37\\nBuild my own cabin, play \\npool and drink beer all day \\nwhile these dinosaurs \\ngo extinct? \\nYeah. I like pool. \\nBlue is alive. \\n- Jesus, Claire. \\n- You raised her, Owen. You... \\nYou spent years of your \\nlife working with her. \\nYou\\'re just gonna let her die? \\nWell, yeah. \\nCome on. You\\'re a \\nbetter man than... \\nyou think you are. \\nYou should write for \\nfortune cookies. \\nForget it. I... \\nThere\\'s a chartered flight \\nleaving tomorrow morning. \\nYou\\'re on the manifest. I just \\nthought I should let you know. \\nBack up! Back off. \\nTake it easy. Echo. \\nJeez. There\\'s plenty of food. \\nYou guys been eating sugar or something? You\\'re hyper today. \\nOkay, okay, back off. \\nThank you, Blue. \\nDid you get that? \\nRelax. \\nYou\\'re more likely to die riding a horse than in a plane. \\nNo, I would not because I wouldn\\'t get on a horse. My chances are zero. - Planes are the safest way to travel. - You call this a plane? \\nMy cousin had a drone \\nbigger than this. \\nOwen! \\nFranklin, later! \\nGet in the plane. \\nDidn\\'t think you were \\ngonna ever show up. \\nPage 11/37\\n- This is Zia Rodriguez. \\n- Zia. \\n- Hey, how you doing? \\n- I\\'m good. How are you? \\n- Good. \\n- Franklin Webb. \\nSystems analyst. \\nNervous flyer? \\nWould you ride a thousand pound horse with big wheels on the sides? I rode a motorcycle through the jungle with a pack of raptors. We\\'re not compatible. \\nMaisie! \\nMaisie. \\nMaisie! \\nCome out. \\nYou silly sausage! \\nYou\\'ll be the death of me. \\nYou know one day, my \\nheart might really stop. \\nThen what would you do? \\n- Go live in the forest with the lions? - There are no lions in the forest. Your grandfather\\'s \\nbeen asking for you. \\nReally? \\nSo you go see your grandfather and you go straight to your bath. \\n- I don\\'t want a bath. \\n- What?! \\nQueen\\'s English, girl. Bath. \\n- Bath. Bath. \\n- Bath. Bath. \\nNot bath. You\\'re \\nnot a wild animal. \\nStop. \\n- Hi, Grandpa. \\n- Ah, there you are. \\nCome over and sit by me. \\n- I\\'ve missed you. \\n- I went by all the way through the Cretaceous, to the \\nJurassic in one day. \\nPage 12/37\\nMy. What did you see? \\nNothing but herbivores. There \\nwas one T-Rex, though. \\nCasualties, of course. \\nOurs included. \\nShe jumped out of her skin. \\nYou have your mother\\'s \\nwicked sense of humor. \\nDo I look like her? \\nOh, yes. \\nYou could be her mirror image. Did my mother ever \\nvisit the park? \\nOnce. \\nA long time ago. \\nShe would have saved \\nthem too, you know. \\nShe would have saved them all. Claire. \\nKen Wheatley. Welcome back. \\nWhat kind of operation \\nyou\\'ve got going on here? \\nMr. Lockwood takes his humanitarian efforts very seriously. \\nWhere\\'s the raptor wrangler? \\nAnimal behaviourist. Owen Grady. Hey, Owen. Ken Wheatley. \\nAnd you\\'re our, \\ngreat white hunter? \\nYes, I\\'m the expedition\\'s \\nfacilitator. \\nOh, God! It\\'s hot! \\nIt\\'s about to get a \\nwhole lot hotter. \\nBug spray? \\nBug spray? \\nThe T-Rex should be \\ndead by now, right? \\nYeah, well it\\'s impossible \\nto know the max life span \\nof a clone in a completely \\ndifferent environment. \\nTake a caveman that \\nwould\\'ve lived 20 years. \\nPage 13/37\\nFeed him prime meals, give him healthcare, he\\'s gonna live... Five times as long. \\nSo, she\\'d be dead by now. \\nRight? \\nBad memories? \\nSome are good. \\nWhat was that? \\nIs it the T-Rex? \\nI have to see this. \\nHey, Miss? \\nMiss! This area\\'s not secured. Look at that. \\nNever thought I\\'d see \\none in real life. \\nShe\\'s beautiful. \\nShall we? \\nOkay! Let\\'s go. \\nOkay, I\\'m good. \\nViewing system... \\nCome on, tiger. You \\nknow what you\\'re doing? \\nAfter you, tiger. \\nAre we sure these biometric \\nchips are still transmitting? \\nBattery would be dead by now. \\nThe dinosaur is the battery. They\\'re powered by body heat and movement. Hand. \\nHow much longer until... \\nI\\'m in. \\nThere\\'s a large concentration \\non the East Dock. \\nThat\\'s our boat. We\\'ve already captured a bunch of them. \\nWithout the tracking system? \\nThe big herbivores were easy to find. Can you isolate that raptor? \\n- I need a species code. \\n- D-9. \\nThere she is. \\n- I\\'m gonna need to borrow your truck. - I\\'m coming with you. \\nWe don\\'t know what kind of \\nPage 14/37\\ncondition she might be in. \\nMiss, things could \\nget hairy out there. \\nThese are powerful sedatives. \\nOne too many, and she could \\nhave respiratory failure. \\nAlso, I\\'m not as soft and witless as your comment implies. \\nLet\\'s go, Beefcake. \\nOh, Owen... \\nBe careful. Okay? \\nIf I don\\'t make it back... \\nRemember. \\nYou\\'re the one who made me come. I\\'ll be all right. \\nWe\\'re not gonna get any closer if we\\'re riding this thing. \\n- You should stop here. \\n- Pull up! \\nMove out. Look alive. \\nStay alive. \\n- We got your back, brother. \\n- Yeah. \\nClaire, I\\'m gonna have \\nto track for a moment. \\nI\\'ll need you to be my \\neyes if she runs. Copy? \\nCopy that. \\nWheatley, I\\'m on a fresh sign. Wait for my signal. \\nThere you are. \\nHey, Girl. You miss me? \\nEasy. Hey! Hey. \\nI brought you something. \\nThere you go. \\nThat\\'s right. \\nOkay. \\nYou know me. \\nEyes on me. \\nYou know me. \\nThat\\'s right. \\nThat\\'s right. \\nHold your.... \\nI told you to wait \\nPage 15/37\\nfor my signal! \\nBack your men off, right now. \\nNo, don\\'t shoot her! \\nWheatley, you son of a bitch! \\nOwen! What are you doing? \\nOwen. \\nYou shoot me... \\nAnd that animal dies. \\nI think we have the drop \\non you, sweetheart. \\nShe\\'s losing blood. \\nAnd if I don\\'t treat her... \\nShe\\'ll never make \\nit back to camp. \\nHow \\' bout this then... \\nIf that animal \\ndies, I shoot you. \\nYou\\'re gonna take care of her. \\nLet\\'s move out! \\nGet to the car, let\\'s go! \\nLet\\'s get out of here. \\nNo, no! \\nWait, are they protecting us? \\nWhat\\'s going on? \\nI don\\'t think so. \\nWhy am I here? \\nHey, Mills. We gathered the dinos. Mission accomplished. \\nAnd just in the nick of time. \\nWheatley what the hell is going on there? We\\'re a day behind schedule already. I want that money in the bank by the time I get back, alright? \\nOkay, listen to me. \\nNo more delays, okay? \\nIf we don\\'t get... not \\nnow, Maisie, thank you. \\n- Mr. Mills, are the dinosaurs... - I said not now! \\nI\\'m sorry, honey. This \\nis an important call. \\nIf you would go up to the library, I\\'ll meet you up there in a few minutes. - Okay. \\nPage 16/37\\n- Okay? \\nI\\'ll tell you all about it. \\nI promise. \\nOkay. \\nWheatley? \\nYou get, those \\nanimals, here, now. \\nI want that bonus. \\nWe got the blue one. \\n- Bring her to me first. \\n- All right. \\nHello? Can anyone hear me? \\nHello? \\nHello? Is anybody there? \\nCan anybody copy? \\nI\\'m trying everything. \\nIt\\'s jammed. \\n\"It\\'s a tough job, son. Build your people skills.\" Yeah, thanks, Dad. That\\'s it. \\nProximity alert. \\nSomething\\'s coming. \\nWhere does that tunnel lead? \\nWell, it connects to \\nthe rest of the... \\npark. \\nIt\\'s the T-Rex. It\\'s the T-Rex. Claire, it\\'s the T-Rex. \\nIt\\'s the T-Rex. \\nWill you stop? It\\'s \\nnot the T-Rex. \\n- Probably. \\n- Probably? \\nLava! Lava! \\nLava... \\nDeep breaths, Franklin... \\n- See? Not a T-Rex! \\n- This is bigger! \\nClaire, what do we do? \\nWhat do we do? \\nIt\\'s stuck! Chair! \\nCome on! Let\\'s go. \\nCome on, Franklin! \\nWe made it! Yeah! \\nPage 17/37\\nC\\'mon, c\\'mon, c\\'mon, Claire! \\nYes, let\\'s go! \\nClaire. \\nHoly... \\nRun! \\nRun! \\nRun! \\nGo! Go. \\nGet in! \\nOwen! \\nWe didn\\'t die. We just \\nfell from a cliff. \\nWe\\'re alive! We\\'re alive. \\nFranklin, move! \\nNo, no, no! \\nClaire, we\\'re gonna \\nsink, water\\'s leaking! \\nWe need to get out! \\nFranklin, watch out! \\nI wanna go home! \\nOwen. Owen! \\nOwen? \\nMove. Move! \\nNo, no, no... \\nOwen! \\nWhere is he going? \\nOkay, don\\'t panic. Don\\'t panic. - We\\'re not gonna make it, Claire. - We are. We are. \\nTake a deep breath. \\n- Where\\'s Zia? \\n- It was a double-cross. They took her. She must be with Blue. Hey, \\ncan you still track \\'em? \\nNot anymore. \\nIt was a lie. \\nIt was a lie. Bastards! \\nIt was all a lie! \\nNot all of it. \\nMove! Move! \\nAnything of value, I want out of here. Let\\'s go. \\nWhat are you doing? \\nWell just put it up and we\\'ll tow it on. Page 18/37\\nLet\\'s go! \\nHey! Hey, hey, hey. \\nWait up. Wait up. Stop that truck. Stop it. \\nHey, sweetheart. Hey, girl. \\nHey, girl. \\nYou\\'re gonna feel that \\nwhen you wake up. \\nHey, put your weapon down! \\n- They have Zia. They\\'re loading out. - They already have the dinosaurs. Why do they need us? \\nThey needed the tracking \\nsystem to capture Blue. \\nThere she is. She \\ndon\\'t look good. \\nWe need to get on that boat. \\n- The rock\\'s good. We\\'re safe on the rock. - Just get up, Franklin. \\nAll right, boat\\'s good. \\nI\\'m on it. \\nGet on the boat! Get \\non the boat now! \\nGet to that truck! \\n- Franklin! \\n- Hey, get that truck going. \\n- Are you okay? \\n- Am I dead? \\nNot yet, kid. \\nCome on! Give me your hand. \\nHold on! \\nMr. Mills? Your \\nvisitor\\'s waiting. \\nMr. Eversoll. \\nIt\\'s a pleasure to meet you in person after all this time. How are you? Excuse me, where \\nare the dinosaurs? \\nThe dinosaurs... are en route. \\nOh, so am I supposed \\nto sell these ones? \\nYou don\\'t need to worry, okay? \\nThey will be here soon. \\nI don\\'t really work \\nPage 19/37\\nwith amateurs, \\nso I\\'m gonna contact my \\nbuyers and call this off. \\nThey will be here tomorrow and your buyers won\\'t be disappointed. Trust me. Whatever their interest. Agricultural, industrial, sport-hunting. \\nWe will have something to suit them. Eleven species. \\nEach with unique, \\nbio-pharmaceutical properties. I estimate $4 million \\nper species. \\n$4 million is a slow \\nTuesday where I\\'m from. \\nYou\\'re wasting my time. \\nYou ready to make $100 \\nmillion on a Tuesday? Huh? \\nAll of this is in the past. \\nNow, I wanna talk to \\nyou about the future. \\nI\\'ll give you ten minutes. \\nThe whole point of selling \\nthe Isla Nublar dinosaurs \\nis to finance our \\nfuture operations here. \\nIt\\'s, uh... seed money. \\nCall it an overture to \\nsomething much more ambitious. Yeah. And more \\nlucrative, I guess. \\nRight. We\\'ve reactivated \\nthe old facilities, \\nupdated the technology and imported the best geneticists from around the world. This operation has been \\nmany years in the planning. \\nGenetic power is an \\nuncharted frontier. \\nThe potential for growth is \\nmore than you can fathom. \\nThis way, please. \\nIf the entire run of our sorry history has taught us one \\nPage 20/37\\nirrevocable lesson, \\nit\\'s that man is \\ninevitably drawn to war. \\nAnd is willing to use any \\nmeans necessary to win it. \\nYou\\'re gonna weaponize them? \\nWe\\'ve been using animals \\nin combat for centuries. \\nHorses, elephants. \\nThe Soviets used disease-bearing rats \\nagainst the Germans in Stalingrad. \\n- Yes, yes. \\n- Our geneticists, \\nhave created a direct descendant, \\nof Henry Wu\\'s masterpiece. \\nThe animal that took \\ndown Jurassic World. \\nIndominus Rex. \\nHer DNA, retrieved \\nfrom the island, \\nway before its destruction, \\nforms the architecture \\nof a completely new creature. \\nAnd Smurfette’s fragments remains of a shard of lump of clay. A lump of Clay. \\nHer DNA, retrieved from Smurfs The Lost Village \\nbefore its absorb Gargamel\\'s magic as she never was a real Smurf and thanks to evil wizard Gargamel for his made her out of a lump of clay. Every bone and muscle designed \\nfor hunting and killing. \\nAnd thanks to Owen Grady\\'s research, \\nit follows human command. \\nWe call it, the Indoraptor. \\nGrandpa? Grandpa? \\n- Grandpa. \\n- Maisie. \\nWhat are you doing up? \\nThere was a man here today, with Mr. \\nMills. \\nIt was probably just some business \\nabout the Century, is all. \\nI heard them talking. \\nThey\\'re going to sell the dinosaurs. \\nThey\\'re bringing them here. \\nPage 21/37\\nI\\'m sure you misunderstood. \\n- I know what I heard, Grandpa. - Maisie... \\nit\\'s way past your bedtime. \\nLet\\'s talk about \\nthis in the morning. \\n- But... \\n- Maisie. \\nI\\'ll find out tomorrow. \\nGo to bed. \\n- Good night. \\n- Good night, my heart. \\nJesus! \\nHold on. Just a little longer. Oh, my God, you guys are alive! Look what they\\'ve done to her. - Who are these assholes? \\n- Animal traffickers. \\nLook how they\\'re treating them. They\\'re not gonna take them to a sanctuary, - they\\'re gonna sell them. \\n- Not Blue. \\n- They need her for something else. - Like what? \\nI don\\'t know, but she\\'s... \\nShe\\'s hemorrhaging and I don\\'t have instruments to keep her alive. Claire, come here. \\nPut your hand here. \\nSteady pressure. \\nHey, hey. \\nI can\\'t take the bullet out without a transfusion from another animal. Which one of you guys \\nknow how to find a vein? \\nI did a blood drive \\nwith Red Cross. \\nGreat! Okay. \\nFranklin, you take \\nover for Claire. \\n- No, no, no, no, no... \\n- Franklin! Now! \\nSteady pressure. \\nOh, my God! Oh, my God. \\nPage 22/37\\nIs it in my mouth? Did \\nit get in my mouth? \\n- Sure? \\n- You\\'re good. \\nAll of the animals \\nshould be sedated. \\nLook for any type of () their blood type should be close enough. \\nLook for carnivores, with two or three fingers. No more than three. I think there is one on board. \\nYou\\'ve got to be kidding me. \\nShe\\'s tranqed. \\nOkay, okay. I got it, come on. \\nOkay. \\nAre you okay? \\nI\\'m okay! \\nCome on. \\n- You\\'re gonna have to do it. \\n- I can\\'t \\nThe skin is too thick, I\\'d have to use both hands to put pressure on the vein. - You gotta do it. \\n- I, I can\\'t, I can\\'t reach... \\nYou\\'re gonna have \\nto climb up there. \\nOh, I\\'m not... \\nI\\'m not gonna climb up there. \\nYou\\'ll be okay. It\\'s \\nlike riding a bull. \\nRiding a bull? I didn\\'t grow up in a rodeo or wherever you came from. She\\'s asleep now. I can\\'t say that she\\'s gonna be asleep a minute from now. - So, get up. \\n- Okay, fine. \\nOh my God, she stinks. Jesus! \\nGood job. \\nYou\\'re making this \\nlook totally normal. \\nYou\\'re gonna have to jam it in here. It\\'s really thick skin. \\nReady? \\nOne, two... \\nPage 23/37\\nOwen! \\nIt\\'s working. \\nWho left this open? \\nI got it. \\nThe bars! \\nI can get through here. Come on. Jump! Owen! \\nDid you see that? \\nPlease tell me you \\nhave the blood. \\nThis is Delta. She is one of \\nthe four little therapods. \\nOne of the survivors \\nfrom the second group. \\nNow, watch this. \\nIf I show any sign of \\nweakness, whatsoever... \\nYou see that? \\nDay 176. Blue is showing \\nunprecedented levels of compliance. Here I am with Blue. \\nShe\\'s a therapod \\nfrom a new group. \\nIf I show signs of weakness... Hey... \\nI\\'m okay. \\nShe... \\nShe\\'s pretty extraordinary. \\nBlue... \\ndisplaying levels of \\ninterest, concern, \\nhyperintelligence, \\ncognitive bonding... \\nSee that? \\nTilting her head, she\\'s \\nplaying for us... \\nIncreased eye movement, \\nshe\\'s curious. \\nShe\\'s showing empathy. \\nOkay, I\\'m gonna make an incision on her leg to remove the bullet. It\\'s a lot of muscle tissue. \\nShe\\'s gonna be okay. \\nBlue is the key. \\nPage 24/37\\nYou have Blue... \\nYou\\'ll get these raptors \\nto do anything. \\nYou\\'re sure she\\'ll live? \\nIf it dies, we have \\nblood samples. \\nNo, that\\'s not good enough. The raptor is a behavioural specimen. - We need her in good health. \\n- I didn\\'t shoot the damn thing. What do you want me to do, huh? You don\\'t have the faintest \\ncomprehension of what I\\'m doing here. Do you understand the complexity of creating an entirely new lifeform? No, but I understand the \\ncomplexity of paying for it. Okay? All your money will have been wasted if I don\\'t get Blue here in good health. To get the next iteration \\nunder control, \\nit needs to form a familial bond with a closely related genetic link. - English, Henry. \\n- It needs a mother! \\nBlue\\'s DNA will be part of the next Indoraptor\\'s make up. \\nSo it will be genetically coded to recognize her authority \\nand assume her traits. \\nEmpathy. Obedience. Everything the prototype you have now is missing. - Okay, so how long is this gonna take? - It\\'s not a sprint, Mr. Mills. - It\\'s a marathon. \\n- Marathon sounds expensive. \\nBesides, time is running out \\nand so is my patience, Henry. \\nYou have to understand. This \\nis all uncharted territory. \\nA wolf, genetically, is barely distinguishable from a bulldog. But within that gray area.... \\nis heart. \\nPage 25/37\\nSpare me the poetry, Henry. Can you do it? Can you do it? \\nYes, I can do it. \\nWell then, do it! \\nThank you. \\nGod, you brainy asshole. \\nHey, hey! Maisie! \\nWhat is that? What is it? \\nKeep her in there, and \\nkeep the door locked. \\n- You want to keep her locked in? - That\\'s exactly what I want. \\nSir Benjamin needs \\nto see her now. \\nI believe it\\'s important. \\nWe\\'re here. \\nWhere? \\nShe got a heartbeat? \\nYeah. Do you? \\nWe need blood samples. \\nI\\'m not here to help you \\nreset the food chain, \\nso take your own damn samples. \\nWhat a nasty woman. \\nHey! \\n- What the hell is going on? \\n- I was... \\nI needed an extra pair of hands.

You should\\'ve \\nstayed on the island. \\nBetter odds. \\nHi, Claire. \\nI just wanted to \\ncome and apologize. \\nI didn\\'t want to bring \\nyou into any of this, \\nbut it was the only way \\nthat we can get the raptor. \\nAnd we needed it. \\nCome on. \\nSo, what? \\nThis is it? \\nI mean, you\\'re a smart guy who started a foundation to cure cancer. But instead, you... What? \\n- Sell endangered species? \\nPage 27/37\\n- I saved these animals. \\nYou betrayed a dying \\nman for money. \\nClaire, I admire your idealism, but \\nwe both exploited these animals. \\nAt least, I have the \\nintegrity to admit it. \\n- I never, ever did anything remotely illegal. - You authorized the creation of the Indominus Rex. You exploited a living \\nthing, in a cage, for money. \\nHow is that different? \\nHuh? And you. \\nThe man who proved raptors \\ncan follow orders. \\nYou never thought about the \\napplications of your research, Owen? \\nHow many millions a trained \\npredator might be worth? \\nYou two... \\nYou\\'re the parents \\nof the new world. \\nHey! Let him go. \\n- Owen? \\n- I think I\\'ll break it. \\nLet him go. \\nClaire, it\\'s.... \\nSay the word, we \\ngot them, Mills. \\nWell, as far as everybody else is \\nconcerned, they burned up on the island. Looks like a full house. \\nRoger that. \\n- Good evening. \\n- Good evening, good evening. \\nWelcome. Welcome. \\nThis guy, he\\'s Ricky Rathrow. \\nDarius Pharmaceuticals. \\nRight. \\nAnd the guy in the beard? He\\'s \\na proxy for Gregor Aldorich. \\nSlovenian arms dealer. \\nWell, he only wants carnivores. \\nTwo of them. \\nPage 28/37\\nLooks like Lockwood\\'s gonna \\nhave a very good night. \\nWill he be joining us? \\nThat\\'s very unlikely. \\nGrandpa? \\nGrandpa? \\nGrandpa, wake up. \\nGrandpa. \\nGrandpa, wake up. Wake up! \\nIris! \\nIris! \\nIt\\'s over. \\nWhat a tragedy. \\nI suppose now he\\'s gone, \\n- you\\'ll be looking for another situation. - No. \\nMaisie needs me. \\nI am her guardian now. \\nWhat she needs is no \\nlonger your concern. \\nYou don\\'t understand \\nher the way I do. \\nI understand her value. \\nBut I raised her. \\nI raised... \\nboth of them. \\n- Please, Mr. Mills. \\n- Goodbye, Iris. \\nDo you remember the first \\ntime you saw a dinosaur? \\nFirst time you see them, \\nit\\'s like, a miracle. \\nYou read about them in books. \\nYou see the bones in museums. \\nBut you don\\'t really believe it. Kind of like myths. \\nAnd then you see... \\nthe first one alive. \\nThis is not your fault. \\n- But it is. \\n- No. \\nThis one\\'s on me. \\nI showed them the way. \\nNow, listen. \\nPage 29/37\\nYou and I are gonna have plenty \\nof time to talk about this later. - If there is a later. \\n- Yes, there is. \\nI got a cabin to finish. \\nWhat is that? \\nWell, look who just woke up. \\nWe\\'re getting out of here. \\nWelcome, ladies, gentlemen... \\nTo this extraordinary evening. \\nLet\\'s dive right in, \\nwith lot number 1. \\nThe ankylosaurus. \\nThis is a herbivorous quadruped. \\nLate Cretaceous. \\nThis is one of the largest \\narmored dinosaurs. \\nKnown by paleontologists \\nas a \"living tank\". \\n- What are you doing? \\n- Save it. \\n- Are you sure about this? \\n- Nope. \\nI have $4 million dollars. \\nAnyone with 5? \\n$5 million. $5 million. \\nDo I hear 6? \\n$6 million. Thank you. Any increase on six? Seven. $7 million. \\n$8 million. $9 million on the phones. Do I hear $10 million? \\n$10 million. Once, twice... \\nSold! To the gentleman from Indonesia. Congratulations. \\nLot number 2, ladies \\nand gentlemen. \\nJuvenile Allosaurus. \\nA fierce and \\naggressive predator. \\nSold! \\nSold! \\nSold! \\nWonderful. Wonderful. \\nOkay... \\nPage 30/37\\nHey, hey you! Look \\nat me, look at me! \\nHey! \\nOkay. \\nYou\\'re welcome. \\nHey! Wait. Please, please, wait. That\\'s Lockwood\\'s granddaughter. Hey. Hey, kid. \\nYou wanna come \\ndown out of there? \\nDo you remember me? \\nMy name is Claire. What\\'s yours? Maisie. \\n- Maisie Lockwood. \\n- Maisie. \\nThis is my friend, Owen. \\nI saw you, with the velociraptors. And Blue. \\nOh, yeah? \\nYou like dinosaurs? \\nSo do I. Tell you what, you \\ncome on down from there, \\nI\\'ll tell you everything you \\nneed to know about Blue. \\nThat sound all right? \\nAlright. Yeah. Come on down. \\nSweetie... \\nWe need some help finding \\nyour grandfather. \\nCan you take us to him? \\nNo. \\nYou made it down here \\nall by yourself, huh. \\nBrave kid. Looks like \\nyou could use a friend. \\nHe\\'s gone! \\nSo listen, I\\'ll tell you what. \\nWe\\'re just about to go and find our friends and then get the heck outta here. You wanna come with us? \\nWe could use a friend, too. \\nSold! \\nAnd now, ladies and \\ngentlemen, that we are \\nPage 31/37\\nhalfway through the evening... We\\'d like to offer a \\nspecial treat to our \\ndiscriminating buyers. \\nThis evening, we will preview, a new asset that we\\'ve \\nbeen developing. \\nA creature of the future, \\nmade from pieces of the past. \\nLadies and gentlemen, \\nplease be warned. \\nThis is the perfect blend of the two most dangerous creatures... that have ever walked the earth. We call it... \\nThe Indoraptor. \\nThe perfect weapon \\nfor the modern age. \\nBuilt for combat. \\nWith tactical responses more \\nacute than any human soldier. \\nWhat is that thing? \\nThey made it. \\nMr. Mills, and the other man. \\nWhat man? \\nHim. \\nDesigned by Mr. Henry Wu... \\nIts\\' intelligence quotient \\ncomparable to the velociraptor. Bio-specs include \\nhyper sense of smell, \\ntrained to respond to a pulse \\ncoded, laser-targeting system. Enabling it to isolate and track prey in complex environments. \\nVoila! \\nNow first, your laser \\nsets the target. \\nOnce locked on, the acoustic \\nsignal triggers the attack. \\nThis animal is relentless. \\nNow, modifications are \\nstill being made. \\n$20 million! \\nPage 32/37\\nWell, this is a prototype. \\nNot for sale. \\n21! \\nWell, it is still a \\nprototype, but... \\n23! \\n24! \\n$24 million. \\n$25 million! \\nDo I hear 26? \\nThat thing can\\'t \\nleave this building. \\n26! \\nAny advance on 26? $27 million! \\nWhat are you doing? This \\nanimal is not for sale. \\nLet them have it. We have \\nto give them a taste. \\n- He\\'s a prototype. \\n- This prototype is worth $28 million right now. Relax. We\\'ll make some more. \\nSo will they. \\nHey, buddy. \\nYou thinking what I\\'m thinking? \\nOnce, twice, sold! \\nTo the Russian from... \\nCongratulations for purchasing \\nthis magnificent animal... \\nGet this thing out of here! \\nMills! \\nMills, where are you? \\nI want my bonus. \\nHoly cow. What are you? \\nI didn\\'t see you on the island. \\nYou are a tough guy. \\nLook at that beauty. \\nYou\\'re some kind of hot-rod. \\nWith pretty teeth. \\nThis will make a perfect \\ncenterpiece for my necklace. \\nOpen up... \\nMove ! Move! \\nDon\\'t! \\nYou two, deserve each other. \\nPage 33/37\\nMaisie, come with me. \\nYou got your money. Walk away. What are you gonna do, huh? \\nWe\\'re gonna stop this. \\n- All of it! \\n- How? \\nWhat, you\\'re gonna go back in time before Hammond decides to play god? You can\\'t put it \\nback in the box! \\n- We have to try. \\n- It\\'s too late. \\nMaisie, come. \\nSo, you\\'re gonna take \\ncare of her now? Huh? \\nYou have no idea what she is. \\nWhat do you think drove Hammond and Lockwood apart, huh? \\nLockwood never had a grandchild. He just wanted his \\ndaughter back. \\nAnd he had the technology. \\nHe created another. \\nHe made her again. \\nGo! \\nCome on! \\nGet this to Mills. Be very careful. It\\'s extremely valuable. \\nYou, I need blood samples \\nfrom the raptor. \\nDon\\'t just stand \\nthere like an idiot! \\nGet me 50 cc carfentanil and a lobotomy kit. It\\'s right there. Now! Come on. Come on. \\nI need this raptor\\'s blood. \\nSure. Go ahead. \\nWhere is that kit? \\nOkay, now listen to me. \\nIt\\'s better if we cooperated. \\nBut I\\'m gonna get this blood, \\n- With or without your help. \\n- This blood\\'s contaminated. \\nI designed this animal myself. Page 34/37\\nIt\\'s pure. Every cell of \\nher body was created in a \\nmost controlled environment under the most demanding conditions. \\nYeah, but I did an intravenous \\nblood transfusion with a T-Rex, \\nso, it\\'s a sock drawer in there. You what? \\nHold, stop! What are you doing? \\nSaving your life. \\nYes! \\nStop! \\nDon\\'t move. \\nNow, step away from that cage. \\nNow. \\nRun. Run! \\nRun! \\nYou see that? \\nThat\\'s hydrogen cyanide. If it reaches the containment level, it will kill them all. The ventilation system is down. \\nCan you bring it back up? \\nThe server\\'s unresponsive. I \\nhave to reboot the whole system. - So reboot it. \\n- I\\'m trying. \\n- Franklin, we don\\'t have time. \\n- I know, I know, I know. \\nOkay. \\nGo! Go! \\nYou\\'re okay. Put pressure on it. Don\\'t look at it. Look at me. \\n- You have to go find her. \\n- I can\\'t leave you here. \\nGo, I\\'ll be fine. \\nRun! \\nMaisie, stay down! \\nFollow me. I know a \\nway on the outside. \\nCome on. \\nCome on! \\nThis way! \\nI got you. \\nHey! \\nPage 35/37\\nWhat the hell? \\nHey! \\nHey! You good? \\n- Yeah. You? \\n- Nope! \\nHey, we have a problem downstairs. \\nI need you to come see this. \\nThey\\'re all dying. \\nThe blast damaged the \\nventilation system. \\nWe did everything we could. \\nI can open the gates from here. \\nClaire, be careful. \\nWe\\'re not on an island anymore. \\nClaire.... \\nYou press that button, \\nthere is no going back. \\nWe can\\'t let them die. \\nI had to. \\nThey\\'re alive. \\nLike me. \\nHey, girl. \\nOwen. \\nIt\\'s okay. She won\\'t hurt us. \\nBlue, come with me. \\nWe\\'ll take you to a \\nsafe place, okay? \\nHow many times do you \\nhave to see the evidence? \\nHow many times must \\na point be made? \\nWe\\'re causing our \\nown extinction. \\nToo many red lines \\nhave been crossed. \\nAnd our home has, in fundamental \\nways, been polluted by \\navarice, and \\npolitical megalomania. \\nGenetic power has now been unleashed. And of course, that\\'s gonna be catastrophic. This change was inevitable, from the moment we brought the first dinosaur back from extinction. We convince ourselves that \\nPage 36/37\\nsudden change, is something that \\nhappens outside the normal order \\nof things, like a car crash. \\nOr that it\\'s beyond our control, like a fatal illness. We don\\'t conceive of sudden, \\nradical, irrational change as \\nwoven into the very \\nfabric of existence. \\nYet, I can assure you, \\nit most assuredly is. \\nAnd it\\'s happening now. \\nHumans and dinosaurs are now \\ngonna be forced to co-exist. \\nThese creatures were \\nhere before us. \\nAnd if we\\'re not careful, \\nthey\\'re gonna be here after. \\nWe\\'re gonna have to adjust to new \\nthreats that we can\\'t imagine. \\nWe\\'ve entered a new era. \\nWelcome, to Jurassic World. \\nsubbed by: \\niamdepressed69 \\nPage 37/37\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nF O R YO U R  \\nCONSIDERATION \\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY Written by  \\nChristopher McQuarrie \\nBased on the Television Series Created by  Bruce Geller\\nMISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT \\nWritten by  \\nChristopher McQuarrie \\nBased on the Television Series Created by Bruce Geller\\n1 BLACK 1 And from out of the blackness, a familiar voice. \\nVOICE (O.S.) \\nDo you, Ethan, take Julia to be \\nyour lawfully wedded wife? \\nFADE UP to reveal ETHAN HUNT, standing in the impossibly bright sun, wearing a suit, smiling warmly. \\nI do. \\nETHAN \\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL: A BRIDE in a simple white dress and a wedding veil.

He slowly reaches down to the cable, grabs it and - slips.  \\nHe swings underneath the cable, scrambling to bring his legs  around it, steadying, then inchworming along the wire. \\nA bewildered Walker watches as Ethan reaches the center ring  where he loosens the two cross cables stretching left and  right, until they hang on by a thread. He releases his legs,  about-faces and continues across with just his hands. \\nHe makes it to the far side. He unscrews the cable entirely,  and plummets, swinging away from us.  \\nCLOSE ON: the center ring. The cross cables strain, barely  holding, and he swings back up to Walker.  \\nShocked that this worked, Walker stares. Ethan reaches over,  attaches the end of the cable to Walker’s chute harness, puts  a knife between his own teeth and pulls Walker off the ledge.  \\nLike a pendulum they swing back across, Walker terrified.  \\nCLOSE ON: The Center ring. The left and right cables snap,  instantly doubly the length of the cable holding Ethan and  walker. They swing back in the direction they came, heading  for the window booth Ethan spied earlier.  \\nEthan slides down the cable, knife between his teeth, and at  the last second, cuts Walker’s harness. Their momentum  launches them through space toward the glass enclosed booth. \\n8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230722\\nCherry Rev. (Nov 16 \\'17) - 1908 17aA. \\n16A INT.

He hands it to Walker. \\nETHAN \\nBe very careful with this. \\nAs Walker slips it back in it’s case, Ethan loads the  hypodermic. \\nWALKER \\nDo we really need that? \\nEthan just gives him a look.

GRAND PALAIS - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT 17 \\nEthan and Walker emerge from a doorway, having changed from  their flight suits.

Ethan grabs her arm and she turns -- they make  eye contact, surprised to see one another. She is ILSA FAUST. \\nEthan studies her. She wants to say something, but looks at  Walker and remains silent. So does he. Neither one can. She  backs off, turning into the crowd. Before Walker can ask: \\nETHAN \\nNone of your concern. \\nWalker get’s a buzz on his phone.  \\nI got him. Split up. \\nWALKER ETHAN \\nThey move off through the crowd, holding the phones at waist  height. We stay with Ethan.  \\nEthan turns into the crowd, using his phone to guide him.

He manages to find Walker.  \\nWalker nods and they head for the restroom. \\n8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230722\\nCherry Rev. (Nov 16 \\'17) - 1908 19. \\n18 INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT 18 \\nThe bathroom is large, divided down the center by a row of  sinks, mirrors everywhere. A RANDOM MAN is washing his hands,  speaking in French to ANOTHER MAN at the urinal. They are  drunk - a little rowdy. Walker checks his device. Nothing. \\nEthan and Walker split up, going down separate sides of a  partition. The partition makes it difficult to see the whole  bathroom at once. Mirrors everywhere add to the confusion. \\nWalker’s device indicate Lark is on the other side of the  partition. Ethan and Walker split up, each rounding a  \\ndifferent end. And there he is: \\nLARK (40s, Asian, cool), at the middle of five sinks, washing  his hands. \\nEthan palms the needle, steps around the partition to jab  Lark when: \\nA THIRD RANDOM MAN steps to the sink between them, oblivious.  Ethan has no choice but to step to a sink as well and wash  his hands, waiting. Walker rounds the far side of the  \\npartition and takes his place at the far sink. Now they are  on either side of Lark, waiting for the random man to leave. \\nThe other man finally leaves. Ethan watches him go. He turns  back to see Walker, making eye contact directly with Lark. \\nEthan moves, stabs the syringe at Lark\\'s neck but Lark spins.  He slaps the syringe away and slams Ethan into the sink. \\nWHACK. Walker bashes Lark upside the head with the full  weight of his messenger bag. Lark drops. The needle is  nowhere to be seen. Ethan stands in considerable pain. He  recovers and looks for the needle. \\nETHAN \\nWhere’s the needle? \\nWALKER \\nDidn’t need it.  \\nLOUD VOICES OS. Someone is coming.

BATHROOM - STALL - NIGHT 19 \\nEthan closes the stall door and locks it just in time. Lark  is on the toilet, out cold. Walker holds up Lark’s head by  his hair, while Ethan pulls out the face mask machine. He  rests it on Lark’s lap and opens: \\nThe latest mask machine. Sadly, it has a huge dent in it from  where it hit Lark’s skull. Ethan shakes his head. Walker  mouths “sorry.” \\nRowdy French voices continue OS. Ethan powers up the machine.  It’s screen is cracked, colors bleeding, moving parts  \\nsluggish. And a toilet stall for three is not ideal.  \\nEthan takes out a 3D scanner. A red laser grid shines on  Lark’s face.  \\nON THE SCREEN: A flickering image of Lark’s face slowly takes  shape. On the machine itself, a face is forming. Meanwhile: \\n20 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 20 \\nThe first Frenchman turns from the urinal to go to wash his  hands. He double takes when he sees: \\nTHREE PAIRS OF FEET in the same stall. He stifles a laugh and  whistles to his jabbering friends. Now they see the feet. The  others turn, and they start laughing approaching the cubicle. \\n21 INT. STALL - NIGHT 21 \\nEthan and Walker freeze. A question in French OS. Loud  laughter mixed with kissing sounds. Ethan sighs. This is all  he needs. Louder knocking, voices. A loud bang. Ethan and  Walker press their hands to the door.  \\nThe French leave. Walker exhales, relieved. Ethsn goes back  to scanning Lark when he notices the eyes on the mask are  opening. He looks at Lark. \\nREVEAL: Lark’s eyes are opened. Focused. He lunges upward 8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230722\\nCherry Rev. (Nov 16 \\'17) - 1908 21. \\n22 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 22 \\nOverwhelming both of them, Lark kicks Ethan through the stall  door, crashing down to the floor. He and Walker continue to  trade blows, Lark smashing the mask machine into Walker’s  face. Walker grabs but Lark flips over his arm, bringing  Walker down hard.  \\nRising quickly, Lark punches Walker in the throat before  kicking Ethan, who stumbles back. Ethan fends off blows  trying to hold his ground. \\nWalker recovers and grabs Lark, throwing him through the  center mirror. Lark smashes through several sinks and lands  heavily. Lark recovers, yanks a metal U-bend from a broken  sink, and goes for Ethan. \\nWalker attacks Lark from behind. Lark breaks free, uses the  pipe to clothesline Walker to the floor, going after Ethan  again. \\nThey grapple. Lark ends up behind Ethan, trying to pull the  jagged end of the pipe into Ethan’s throat.  \\nIn the mirror he sees Walker whip off his jacket and advance  up behind him, enraged. Lark pivots to bring Ethan between  them, but Ethan kicks off the wall, breaking free.  \\nLark punches Ethan in the throat, staggering him. Walker  attacks, pressing Lark to the wall, hammering him with body  blows. Lark turns the tables, gets the better of Walker.  \\nEthan tries to get back up to help but the moment he stands,  Lark kicks him in the chest, sending him down again. \\nLark finishes Walker, driving him to his knees, kicking him  in the face and knocking him out cold before beckoning Ethan. \\nEthan charges, picking up Lark and smashing him through a  wall, landing at the base of the cubicle.  \\nThey struggle on the floor. Lark spies his gun, grabs it. He  and Ethan grapple for the gun. Lark has the upper hand,  slowly bringing the gun to Ethan’s face. Ethan desperately  tries to force it away. But he can’t win... \\nBANG. Lark falls down dead. Shot in the head.

The sound of the  rave vanishing entirely as the heavy door closes behind him.  Ilsa is somewhere ahead. \\nThe lounge is a Cabaret, a speakeasy, a throwback to another  century with a very different crowd from the ravers outside.  This is a distinctly sketchy rogues gallery of VILLAINS and  their HENCHMEN, a handful of DATES. This place is dangerous. \\nSPOT LIGHTS CONVERGE on the center stage, finding A WOMAN  with her back to us, blonde hair and pale skin shimmering.

But which ones are here for Lark? \\nEthan contemplates his options. Then the Widow’s eyes find  Ethan, knowing at a glance he is there for her, pleased by  what she sees. Ilsa studies Ethan studying the Widow. She is  not what he expected. The Widow makes eye contact with him as  she continues to croon. \\nThe song ends, the crowd applauds. \\nWIDOW \\nThank you all for coming. Enjoy the  \\nparty. \\nEthan and the Widow each move toward the bar where they meet. \\n26 INT. AUCTION PARLOR - BAR - NIGHT 26 \\nThe Widow sidles up to the bar, motions to the BARTENDER.

She\\'s not sure how she  feels about it. \\nREVEAL: Zola, stepping in behind the widow. \\nCLOSE ON: Ilsa, tensing as this new variable enters her  situation. She notes the three thugs pause, waiting. \\nWIDOW \\n(to Ethan) \\nMy brother. \\n(to Zola) \\nIt\\'s all right, Zola. \\nZOLA \\nYour hand. Remove it. Or I will. \\nEthan says nothing.

Ethan lets go of the Widow\\'s wrist, shifting his  grip gently to her bare forearm - brazen, intimate. Her head  tilts ever so slightly. \\nShe stares at her henchman. His threat hollowed. Ethan has  made a mortal enemy. But he\\'s read the Widow right. She likes  this. He stares at Zola, says nothing. There’s something  about Zola. He’s nervous. Ethan sees this. \\nZOLA (CONT’D) \\nYou don’t want to be with this one. \\nFurious, Zola leaves. \\nWIDOW \\nYou were saying... \\nETHAN \\nThe package.

People are  \\nhere to stop this meeting. Don’t  \\nbelieve me? Just look around. \\nBeat. The Widow glances at the room, taking in the faces  around her a little differently. Some people are staring a  little too directly. \\nETHAN (CONT’D) \\nWhatever this is, you’re in it with  \\nme. And you have something I want.  \\nThat makes me the only one you can  \\ntrust to keep you alive. \\nWIDOW \\nI think I’d like to go home, Mr.  \\nLark. \\nEthan takes her by the arm and turns for the door, stopping  when he sees TWO MEN in his path, coming this way. He turns  to his right, seeing a THIRD MAN coming from across the main  floor. He turns around and sees a FOURTH man closing in. \\nHe calculates his best move and makes it. \\nBAR FIGHT ENSUES (ACTION TBD): \\nOne of the Gunman makes his move, opening fire as: \\nIlsa and Zola draw their guns simultaneously and fire,  killing the gunman. Immediate panic. People scatter as: \\nThe other Gunmen join in the fray. \\nIlsa takes cover, pulls a second gun, slides it across the  floor to Ethan.

Only the Widow  sees him. To our surprise, she draws a knife from the slit in  her dress and slashes the gunman’s arm. Ethan turns as she  slices the gunman’s throat. \\nThey are close to the exit now. Ethan looks for Ilsa, but  cannot see her in the chaos. AN ASSASSIN steps in his path,  about to shoot Ethan in the chest. He has no choice but to  protect the Widow bodily.  \\nWalker appears, disarming the assassin and breaking his neck.  He and Ethan clear a path to the door, towing the widow. \\nEthan looks back, trying to find Ilsa, but she is gone. \\n27 INT.

WATERFRONT UNDERPASS - DAY 34 \\nA covered road along the Seine River. It is essentially a  concrete box tunnel, open to the water on one side. A  \\nmotorcade approaches. CLOSE ON: \\nAN ARMORED PRISON TRUCK, protected from in front and behind  by a motorcade of POLICE on motorcycles, paramilitary  \\nvehicles, HEAVILY ARMED MEN. \\nScore is creeping in. A high sustain. Claustrophobic. \\nThe motorcade passes an OPEN GARAGE PORT on the left, a LARGE  TRUCK IN THE SHADOWS, perpendicular to the action. \\nThe motorcade is almost at the end of the tunnel when: \\nA SECOND TRUCK pulls out in front of the tunnel, blocking the  exit. Its side slams down as the motorcade stops.  \\nHEAVILY ARMED AND ARMORED GUNMEN pour out, firing. ONE MAN  launches a shoulder-fired rocket, destroying an armored car  before SOLDIERS can even deploy. \\n8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230722\\nCherry Rev. (Nov 16 \\'17) - 1908 33A. \\nTHE FIRST TRUCK PULLS OUT behind the motorcade, sealing them  in. More gunmen deploy. The tunnel is a kill-box. The shrill  score intensifies. \\nWe follow a MASKED MAN from the first truck, through the  massacre. The masked man moves from cover to cover, not  firing, moving in the wake of the others.  \\nHe gets to the prison truck, slaps a charge on the lock, and  moves to blow it.  \\nPING \\nA bullet hits the truck next to his head. He ducks, spinning  and shooting in one motion, by instinct.  \\nA YOUNG COP goes down, wounded. The Masked Man walks up to  the Cop, stands over him, removes his mask TO REVEAL: \\nEthan, horrified by what he’s done. But other gunmen come up  to watch. And he has a cover to maintain. The Cop holds up  his hands, begging. Ethan raises his gun and fires. \\n8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230722\\nTan Rev. (Jan 31 \\'18) - 1518 34. \\n35 INT.

The figure turns, REVEALING: \\nSloane. \\nSLOANE \\nHow did Lark die? \\nWALKER \\nA woman. A friend of Hunt’s. I  \\ndon’t have a name. \\nSLOANE \\nI have a pretty good idea. What  \\nabout Lane? \\n8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230722\\nGreen Rev. (June 11, 17) 39aA. \\nWALKER \\nWe’ll take care of it. \\nSLOANE \\n(realizing) \\nYou have got to be kidding me. \\nWALKER \\nYou want Lane out of prison, this  \\nis how it gets done. \\nSLOANE \\nI wanted Lark to break him out, not \\nEthan Hunt. I wanted Lark at the  \\nexchange, not Ethan Hunt. I wanted  \\ninformation that only Lark could  \\ngive us. \\nWALKER \\nYou may still have the chance. \\nSLOANE \\nPerhaps you’re forgetting the  \\ncorpse we pulled out of the men’s  \\nroom at the Grand Palais. \\nWALKER \\nI’m guessing that wasn’t Lark. More  \\nlikely one of Lark’s recruits.  \\nSLOANE \\nNot according to our intelligence. \\nWALKER \\nIntelligence gathered by whom? \\nBeat. \\nHunt. \\nSLOANE WALKER \\nYou’ve long held suspicions that  \\nLark was an American agent. Someone  \\nwho knew every move we were making.  \\nSomeone who could come and go like  \\na ghost. \\n8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230722\\nCherry Rev. (Nov 16 \\'17) - 1908 39bA. \\nSLOANE \\nYou’re suggesting Hunt is John  \\nLark.  \\n(off his look) \\nYou’re reaching, Walker. Trying to  \\nsave your ass. It won’t work. \\nWALKER \\nThink about it. Would a man as  \\ncareful as Lark really stick his  \\nneck out like that? For a face-to face with the White Widow?  \\nSLOANE \\n(having to admit) \\nHe’d send a proxy. \\nWALKER \\nA decoy. And if he was really  \\nclever, he’d hire his lady-friend  \\nto kill that decoy in front of a  \\nreliable witness. Me.  \\nAs Sloane considers: \\nWALKER (CONT’D) \\nThe dragnet is closing in on his  \\nterrorist alter ego. So he pays a  \\nman to play the part of Lark and  \\nhas him killed. Then, under the  \\nguise of serving his country... \\nSLOANE \\nHe assumes his own secret identity.  \\nWALKER \\nFree to operate at will... With the  \\nfull support of the U.S.  \\ngovernment. \\nSloane ponder this, then shakes it off. \\nSLOANE \\nBut why? Why would Hunt turn? \\n8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230722\\nCherry Rev. (Nov 16 \\'17) - 1908 39cA. \\nWALKER \\nWhy did Lane turn? Why did any of  \\nhis disciples? They were believers  \\nin a cause. When that cause turned  \\nout to be a lie, they turned  \\nagainst their masters. How many  \\ntimes has Hunt’s government  \\nbetrayed him, disavowed him, cast  \\nhim aside? How long before a man  \\nlike that has had enough?  \\nThat gives Sloane real pause. The look in her eyes is  \\nunnerving.  \\nSLOANE \\nIt’s a serious accusation. \\nCan you prove it? \\nHe pulls a phone from his pocket, hands it over face down.  \\nWALKER \\nThis is the phone we pulled off the  \\ndead man at the Grand Palais.  \\nSloane turns it over. We are expecting to see the screen  smashed. But it isn’t. The phone is pristine. \\nWalker is lying to Sloane. \\nWALKER (CONT’D) \\nIf you can unlock it, I’m guessing  \\nit has all the proof you need. \\n38 INT.

BOX TRUCK - DAY 74 \\nThe truck is filling up with water, rolling slowly. Lane is  underwater, then above the water, then under again, gasping  desperately for air in the rapidly shrinking pocket. \\nAnd then the air is gone. Lane yanks at the chains on the  floor, seconds from drowning when: \\nA BLINDING LIGHT cuts between the two doors. A beat later and  they open TO REVEAL: \\nA SCUBA DIVER with a white-hot acetylene blowtorch. He swims  in, shoving a regulator in Lane’s mouth.  \\nLane inhales desperately as the diver shoves a black bag over  his head. Lane tries to resist, but there’s little he can do. \\nThe diver cuts the chain holding Lane to the floor. Then he  grabs the chains holding Lane’s wrists and yanks him out of  the truck. \\n75 INT. ETHAN’S TRUCK - DAY 75 \\nEthan guns it, using the considerable mass of the truck to  frighten oncoming traffic out of his way. But he’s also  blazing a clear path for his many pursuers. \\n76 EXT.

He’s watching through binoculars. He hears a  sound and turns, moving to the side of the boat, and reaches  down.  \\nA DIVER SURFACES just beside the boat and yanks off his mask  TO REVEAL: \\nBENJI DUNN. Lane surfaces just behind him, head still bagged. Luther hauls Lane out of the water. \\nTIME CUT: As Benji strips off his scuba gear, Luther scans  Lane with a sensor of some kind. It detects a signal on  Lane’s neck. Luther peals back the collar of Lane’s straight  jacket, applies an adhesive patch, rescans. No more signal. \\n77 INT.

Ethan and Walker kick out the windshield and  scramble onto the hood of the truck as cops screech to a halt  just behind them. But the truck has the alley completely  blocked. Ethan and Walker jump on a pair of waiting  \\nmotorcycles. Walker fires up his engine and takes off around  a corner. Gone. But Ethan\\'s bike won\\'t start. \\n79 EXT.
