He\\'s too low level, \\nhe knew nothing. \\nThis, is a man who knows things. Anatoli Knyazev. \\nHe\\'s Russian. \\nContracts all over the globe but he\\'s base out of the port of Gotham. Weapons and human trafficking. \\nSo, the \"White Portuguese\" is a Russian, that\\'s the theory. \\nNo. \\nThe theory is that the Russian \\nlead me to the man himself. \\nIf he is indeed a him. \\nYou don\\'t know if he exist. \\nHe could be a phantasm. \\nOne that wants to bring \\na dirty bomb into Gotham? \\nAh, high state front. \\nNew rules. \\nWe\\'re criminals, Alfred. \\nWe\\'ve always been criminals, \\nnothing\\'s change. \\nOh. \\nYes it has, sir. \\nEverything\\'s change. \\nMen fall from the sky. \\nAnd gods hurl thunderbolts. \\nInnocents die. \\nThat\\'s how it starts. \\nThe fever, the rage, \\nthe feeling of... powerlessness that turns good men... \\ncruel. \\nJustice turn dark across the harbor Page 6/43\\nwhen police found an alleged sex trafficker apparently tortured and branded \\nby the Gotham bat. \\nThe man is the second criminal \\nfound baring the bat brand. \\nThe first victim, an accused child predator later was assaulted in prison \\nand remains in critical care \\nfrom his injuries. \\nOne source tells Metropolis, \\nthat many believed \\nthe mark of the Bat brand in prison essentially is a death sentence. \\nIn other news, the mayor \\nhas announced that Metroplis... \\nFrank, your D! \\n(Defense) \\nWoo. \\nAh! \\nA hoi hoi. \\nI didn\\'t know you were here. \\n- Man on the marquee. \\n- Stop, don\\'t believe it. \\nMy father named the company after himself. He was the Lex in front of the Corp. - Hi, how are you doing? \\n- Oh, really great. \\nReally great? \\nGood. Good. \\nUh. \\nFollow me. \\nYou know, Dad was born \\nin east Germany. \\nHe grew up eating uh... \\nstale crackers. \\nAnd every other Saturday, \\nhe had to march in a parade \\nand waved flowers at tyrants. \\nSo, I think it was providence \\nthat his son, \\nme, would end up with this. \\nOne of my rebuild Metropolis crews found it. \\nA little souvenir from \\nPage 7/43\\nthe Kryptonian World Engine. \\nWhat\\'s a rock have to do \\nwith Homeland Security. \\nHomeland Security? \\nMmm. \\nNo, no, no... ma\\'am. \\nPlanetary Security. \\nThe fragment is of a \\nradio active Xeno mineral \\nWe suspected it might have \\nbio interactions, \\nso, we took the sample \\nto AMRIID. \\nWhere they keep the remains \\nof the Kryptonian decedent. \\nAnd, when we exposed \\ngeneral Zod to the mineral, \\nthis happened. \\nProfound biodegradation, \\ndecaying Kryptonian cells. \\nWe concluded the mineral \\ncould be weaponized, \\nif a large enough \\nsample was found. \\nAnd then, among the fishes, \\na whale! \\nLying at the bottom \\nof the Indian Ocean \\nEmerald City. \\nBeautiful. \\nNow, Rocky is radio active, but, what he needs from you \\nis an import license. \\nAnd why would we \\nwant to weaponize this material? As a deterrent. \\nA silver bullet to keep in reserve to use against the Kryptonians. So, the day doesn\\'t come, Madame. When your children are waving daisies at a reviewing stand. \\nLast I looked, \\nthe only one of those \\nflying around up here \\nPage 8/43\\nwas Superman. \\nHa. \\nYes, Superman. \\nYeah, but, there are... \\nthere are more of them. \\n- The meta-human thesis. \\n- Yes, the meta-human thesis. \\nMore likely than not. \\nThese exceptional beings live among us. The bases of our myths. \\nGods among men upon our... \\nour little blue planet here. \\nYou don\\'t have to use \\nthe silver bullet, \\nbut, if you forge one... \\nWell, then... \\nWe don\\'t have to depend \\nupon the kindness of monsters. \\nSir. \\nGet down. \\nSir, I said, get down, now! \\nCan we get some backup here? \\nHey. Hey. \\nDon\\'t do it! \\nHEY! \\nLois. \\nCrime Lab, on 3. \\nThis is Lane. \\nKent, you\\'re sports today. \\nI want you to follow \\nup on the football. \\nUnderdog dreams dashed \\n10 yards between Gotham and glory. Hey. \\nAre you guys watching this? \\nEmergency responders quickly created a precautionary perimeter around Heroes Park while they brought the man down \\nfrom this beloved monument. \\nThe suspect has been identified \\nas Wallace Vernon Keefe. \\nI work for Bruce Wayne! \\nI work for Bruce Wayne! \\nThere\\'ll be arraign on charges of Page 9/43\\nvandalism, resisting arrest \\nFALSE GOD - and a felony charge of making terrorist threats \\nthat carries up to \\n40 years in prison. \\nPoor son of a bitch. \\n- Jenny. \\n- Mm? \\nHeadline. \\n\"End of love affair \\nwith man in the sky?\" \\nOkay. \\nThere\\'re ways \\nwe can help each other. \\nAh. \\nCould you step \\ninto my office here? \\nYes! \\nWhat\\'s your wish list? \\nUh. \\nAccess to the wreck of the \\ncrashed Kryptonian ship. \\nDone. \\nThe complete remains \\nof the dead alien for testing. You want Zod\\'s body? \\nOkay. \\nIt\\'s cherry. \\n- Show him what you got! \\n- Dude, let\\'s go! \\nMake sure to hit his left. \\nCome on. \\nThrow a punch, will you? \\nLet\\'s go! \\nCome on! \\nThank you. \\nThe house treats luck like an insult. Good luck for one has always \\ngives others misfortune. \\nBut, eventually, \\nall accounts will be settled. \\n3 nights with a Bolshoi ballerina, the line was all she tell me. \\nNot all I\\'m sure. \\nPage 10/43\\nGood evening. \\nDEVICE CLONING: \\nSUCCESSFUL: \\nIt\\'s like a 1 man reign of terror. This bat vigilante has been \\nconsistently targeting the port and the adjacent projects \\nand tenements. \\nAnd as far as I can tell \\nthe cops are actually helping him. Crime wave in Gotham. \\nOther breaking news. \\nWater, wet. \\n- Did you file the football yet? - Why aren\\'t we covering this? Poor people don\\'t buy papers? \\nPeople don\\'t buy papers, \\nperiod, Kent. \\nPerry, when you assign a story, you\\'re making a choice about who matters... - ...and who\\'s worth it. \\n- Good morning, Smallville \\nThe America conscious died \\nwith Robert, Martin and John. \\nSorry. \\nSorry. \\nNo match. \\nMy guys in the crime lab, \\nnever seen one before. \\nIt\\'s called a bullet. \\nYou shoot people with it. \\nRecovered from the scene \\nof the fire fight in the desert. Not sold anywhere commercially in the world, even black market. So? \\nSo, who gave prototype military rounds to tribe fighters in the Sahara. The ass, Lois. \\nFlight to DC tonight, \\na couple of days there. \\nGo. \\nPage 11/43\\nCoach. \\nNo extra leg room. \\nEconomy plus. \\nCoach! \\nSenator. \\nMy dad always said that, \\nKentucky mash \\nwas the secret to health. \\nThis was his room. \\nI left it just the way it was. It\\'s silly. \\nThe magical thinking of orphan boys. I\\'m blocking the import license for your mineral. \\nThe Red Capes are coming! \\nThe Red Capes are coming! \\nYou and your hearings... \\ngalloping through the streets \\nto warn us. \\nOne, if by land. \\nTwo, if by air. \\nDo you know the oldest lie \\nin America, Senator? \\n- Can I call you June? \\n- You can call me whatever you like. Take a bucket of piss and \\ncall it Granny\\'s peach tea. \\nTake a weapon of assassination and call it deterrence. \\nYou won\\'t fool a fly on me. \\nI\\'m not going to drink it. \\nHey, you don\\'t think \\nDad would mind, do you? \\nIf I change just... \\n...just one thing in this room. Because, that should be upside down. Now, we know better now, \\ndon\\'t we? \\nThe devils don\\'t come from \\nhell beneath us. No. \\nNo, they come from the sky. \\nMARTHA WAYNE: \\n1946 - 1981 \\nPage 12/43\\nWrong room, miss. \\nSecretary Swanwick, you haven\\'t been returning my phone calls. \\nMiss Lane, if you like an interview, Major Farris is just outside that door. You\\'re treating me like a stranger? I\\'m treating you like a reporter. Alright. \\nIs the US providing experimental \\nmilitary arms to rebels in Africa? You know with balls like yours. \\nYou belong in here. \\nWho\\'s your source on this? \\nA tin foil hat? \\nNo, not tin, but it\\'s metal. \\nFired in the Superman incident. \\nExperts at the Pentagon can\\'t ID it. - We haven\\'t been told the truth. - Here\\'s the truth. \\nA reporter got greedy for a scoop and went where she shouldn\\'t have. Superman acted like some... rogue combatant to rescue her and people died. \\nDon\\'t invent a conspiracy theory \\nto put back his halo. \\nOr yours. \\n- Major. \\n- Sir. \\nOh. \\nI hope the next generation of Waynes won\\'t inherit an empty wine cellar. Don\\'t think there\\'s a likely \\nto be a next generation. \\nThank you, sir. \\nThis is every call made \\nfrom the Russian\\'s phone. \\nTwo mentions of business \\nwith the \"White Portuguese\" and \\nit\\'s continuing transmitting black out data to the personal residence \\nof Alexandra Luthor. \\nYou think Lex Luthor \\nis the \"White Portuguese\"? \\nI can\\'t see that he needs \\nPage 13/43\\nthe income from imported arms. \\nRegardless, I\\'ll need to \\nput a \\'leech\\' in his house, \\nand I\\'m going to need the suit. The Bat interrogated 6 people \\nand came away with nothing. \\nIt was Bruce Wayne \\nthat got the information. \\nWell, Bruce Wayne can\\'t \\nbreak into Lex Luthor\\'s house. \\nBruce Wayne won\\'t have to. \\nHe\\'s been invited. \\nHA HA HA Joke\\'s on you BATMAN \\n- That\\'s him right there! \\n- There he is! Get a shot! \\n- Bruce, over here! \\n- Bruce, Bruce. \\n- Wayne, have a shot. \\n- Mr. Wayne! \\n- Right here, one second. \\n- This way, Mr. Wayne! \\nWho\\'s that? \\nYou must be new to the \\nlet them eat cake beat. \\nThat is Bruce Wayne. \\nPhilanthropist. \\nBibliophile. \\nTrue friend of the library of Metropolis. Mr. Lex Luthor. \\nNikki. \\nYou\\'re embarrassing me. \\nSpeech. Speech. \\nUh, blah blah blah. \\nOpen bar. \\nThe word Philanthropist, \\ncomes from the Greek. \\nMeaning a lover of humanity \\nIt was coined about, \\n2,500 years ago... \\nAlright, where am I going, Alfred? Approach the elevator, \\nto your left. \\nThat where it must be. \\nIt\\'s in the service \\nPage 14/43\\ncorridor in the basement. \\nGo down the stairs. \\nPrometheus went with us, \\nand he ruined Zeus\\' plan \\nto destroy man kind \\nand for that, he was given a thunderbolt. Chooo! \\nHm. \\nThat seems unfair. \\nOn the serious note, \\nthe library of Metropolis... \\nDown the stairs. \\nIt\\'s the only way in, down the stairs. But, at one time, \\nDad could not either. \\nNo, my father could not \\nafford the books, so... \\nHe had to root through the garbage for yesterday\\'s newspaper. \\nNow you got the kitchens \\non your right. \\nTo the left. \\nRight in front of you, \\nthat\\'s where you want to be. \\nMay I help you, Mr. Wayne? \\nUh, I just... \\nthought the bathroom was down here. I must have... \\nThat last Martini was a... \\ntoo too many, I think. \\n- Men\\'s room is upstairs. \\n- Great, I\\'m okay. \\nI like those shoes. \\nI can\\'t stay down here, Alfred. Go upstairs and socialize. \\nSome young lady from Metropolis will make you honest. \\nIn your dreams, Alfred. \\nBooks are knowledge, \\nand knowledge is puff worth. \\nAnd I am... \\nHeh heh heh, no. \\nI, umm. \\nNo, what am I? \\nPage 15/43\\nAlright, what am I suppose to say? No. \\nThe bitter sweet pain among man is having knowledge with no power. Because... \\nBecause that is paradoxical, \\nand umm... \\nThank you for coming. \\nPlease, drink, it\\'s free. \\nMr. Wayne. \\nMr. Wayne. \\nClark Kent, Daily Planet. \\nOh, my foundation has already issued a statement in support of the... cause. I\\'m sorry? \\nWow. Pretty girl. Bad habit. \\nDon\\'t quote me, alright? \\nWhat\\'s your position on the \\nbat vigilante in Gotham? \\nDaily Planet. \\nWait, do I own this one? \\nOr was that the other guy? \\nCivil liberties has been \\ntrampled on in your city. \\nGood people living in fear. \\nDon\\'t believe everything you hear, son. I\\'ve seen it, Mr. Wayne. \\nHe thinks he\\'s above the law. \\nThe Daily Planet criticizing those who think they\\'re above the laws. A little hypocritical, wouldn\\'t you say? Considering every time your hero saves a cat out of a tree, \\nyou write a puff piece editorial, about an alien who... \\nif he wanted to, \\ncould burn the whole place down. There wouldn\\'t be a damn thing \\nwe can do to stop him. \\nMost of the world doesn\\'t share your opinion, Mr. Wayne. \\nMaybe it\\'s the... \\nGotham City and me, we just... \\n...have a bad history with \\nPage 16/43\\nfreaks dressed like clowns. \\nBoys! \\nMm, Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ah, I love it! \\nI love bringing people together! \\n- How are we? \\n- Lex. \\nHello, good. \\nHi, hello. \\nLex. It is a pleasure... Ow! \\nWow, that is a good grip! \\nYou should, \\nnot pick a fight with this person. So, after all these years, \\nwe\\'ve finally got you over to Metropolis. - Well, I thought I come drink you dry. - Well, you\\'re welcome. \\nYou should hop the hub more often though, I love to show you my labs. \\nMaybe we could, \\nbe partner on something. \\nMy R&D is up to \\nall sorts of no good. \\nTRANSFER COMPLETE \\n- That\\'s 7 minutes. \\nLook likes the transfer\\'s complete. - Mr. Luthor. \\n- Yes. \\n- The governor. \\n- Governor. \\n- Excuse me. \\n- Next time. \\n- Governor, hi. \\n- Lex, it\\'s good to see you. \\n\"... A deadly factory fire has interrupted the Day of the Dead celebration in Juarez.\" Excuse me. \\n\"I can\\'t believe they\\'re \\ngoing to let that poor girl die.\" We, as a population on this planet, have been looking for a savior. \\n90% of people believe \\nin a higher power. \\nAnd every religion believes \\nPage 17/43\\nin some sort messianic figure. \\nAnd when this savior character \\nactually comes to Earth, \\nwe want to make him abide \\nby our rules? \\nWe have to understand that \\nthis is a paradigm shift. \\nWe have to start thinking \\nbeyond politics. \\nAre there any \\nmoral constraints on this person? We have international law. \\nOn this Earth, \\nevery act is a political act. \\nIs it really surprising, \\nthat the most powerful man in the world should be a figure of controversy? To have an individual engaging \\nin the state level interventions should give us all pause. \\nHuman beings have a horrible track record of following people with great power, down paths that lead to \\nhuge human monstrosities. \\nWe have always created icons \\nin our own image. \\nWhat we\\'ve done is we project \\nourselves on to him. \\nThe fact is, maybe he\\'s not \\nsome sort of devil or Jesus character. Maybe hes just a guy \\ntrying to do the right thing. \\nWere talking about a being \\nwhose very existence \\nchallenges our own sense of \\npriority in the universe. \\nIf you go back to Copernicus, \\nwhere he restored \\nthe sun and the center of the \\nknown universe, displacing Earth. And you get to Darwinian evolution and you find out, \\nwe\\'re not special on this Earth we\\'re just one among \\nPage 18/43\\nother life forms. \\nAnd now we learned, that we\\'re not even special in the entire universe because there is Superman. \\nThere he is, an alien, among us. We\\'re not alone. \\nAre you, as a United State Senator, personally comfortable \\nsaying to a grieving parent, \\n\"Superman could\\'ve saved your child, but on principle \\nwe did not want him to act.\" \\nI\\'m not saying he shouldn\\'t act. I\\'m saying he shouldn\\'t act unilaterally. What are we talking about here then? Must there be a Superman? \\nThere is. \\nKeefe, you made bail. \\nOpen Two. \\nWho paid? \\nWho the hell are you? \\n- Just a man. \\n- Yeah? \\nWell, what do you want? \\nTo help you stand for something.

What would you tell them? Um. I\\'ve come here \\nto tell them to wake up. \\nThis is flesh and blood. \\nHe\\'s delivered a war here. \\nAnd this... \\nThis is what war looks like. \\nI have nothing. \\nThere are plenty of people, sir, who would say he\\'s their hero. \\nHe is not a hero! \\nGrace can you get Greg \\nup here please, right now. \\nSenator! \\nHi, you. \\nDon\\'t go anywhere. \\nPage 25/43\\nI want to talk to you. \\nYou know what, Mercy? You go in and... make sure no one takes my seat. \\nSo, what\\'d you been up to? \\nI\\'m just here to tell my story. \\nThat I was willing to finance \\na Kryptonian deterrent, \\nbut a certain junior Senator from Kentucky decided to block it. \\nYes, the Chair of the Committee \\non Superman is soft on security.

Nor we expect that Superman would give some kind of a statement to the Senate to the American people, \\nand of course to the world. \\nHe\\'s here. \\nHe came. \\n- He\\'s above the Capitol. \\n- Ow. \\nYou are going to be on the \\nhot seat in there, June bun. \\nPage 26/43\\nI grew up on a farm. \\nI know how to wrestle a pig. \\nDo you know the oldest lie \\nin America, Senator? \\nIt\\'s that power can be innocent.

This is why \\nI love coming home for Christmas... right before you leave town. \\nBe nice, dear, he\\'s been studying abroad. Really? Which broad? What\\'s her name? Candice. \\nDo me a favour? \\nTry not to burn \\nthe house down before Monday. \\nOkay, so it\\'s Monday. \\nThat is good to know, \\nI will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going? \\nYour father\\'s flying us \\nto the Bahamas for a little getaway. We might have to make a quick stop. At the Pentagon. Right? \\nDon\\'t worry, you\\'re gonna love \\nthe holiday menu at the commissary. They say sarcasm \\nis a metric for potential. \\nIf that\\'s true, \\nyou\\'ll be a great man someday. \\nI\\'ll get the bags. \\nHe does miss you when you\\'re not here. And frankly, you\\'re going to miss us. Because this is the last time \\nwe\\'re all going to be together. You know what\\'s about to happen. Say something. \\nIf you don\\'t, you\\'ll regret it. I love you, Dad. \\nAnd I know you did the best you could. That\\'s how I wish it happened. \\nBinarily Augmented Retro-Framing... or BARF. \\nGod, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method \\nof hijacking the hippocampus... to clear traumatic memories. \\nHuh. \\nIt doesn\\'t change the fact that they Page 5/52\\nnever made it to the airport... or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but... \\nPlus, $611 million for my \\nlittle therapeutic experiment? \\nNo one in their right mind \\nwould\\'ve ever funded it. \\nHelp me out, \\nwhat\\'s the MIT mission statement? \"To generate, disseminate... \\n\"and preserve knowledge. \\n\"And work with others... \\n\"to bring it to bear on \\nthe world\\'s great challenges.\" \\nWell, you are the others. \\nAnd, quiet as it\\'s kept... \\nthe challenges facing you \\nare the greatest mankind\\'s ever known. Plus, most of you are broke. \\nOh, I\\'m sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment... \\nevery student has been made \\nan equal recipient... \\nof the inaugural \\nSeptember Foundation Grant. \\nAs in... \\nall of your projects have \\njust been approved and funded. \\nNo strings, no taxes... \\njust reframe the future! \\nStarting now. \\nGo break some eggs. \\nWow. Wow. \\nThat took my breath away. \\nOh, Tony! So generous. \\nSo much money! Wow! \\nOut of curiosity... \\nwill any portion of that grant \\nbe made available to faculty? \\nI know, \"Ooh, gross,\" but hear me out. I have got this killer idea \\nfor a self-cooking hotdog. \\nBasically, chemical detonator embedded... Restroom\\'s this way, yeah? \\nPage 6/52\\nYeah. Embedded in the meat shaft. Mr Stark, I am so sorry \\nabout the teleprompter. \\nI didn\\'t know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn\\'t have time to fix it. It\\'s fine. I\\'ll be right back. \\nWe\\'ll catch up later. \\nThat was nice, \\nwhat you did for those young people. Ah, they deserve it. \\nPlus, it helps ease my conscience. They say there\\'s a correlation \\nbetween generosity and guilt. \\nBut if you\\'ve got the money... \\nbreak as many eggs as you like. \\nRight? \\nAre you going up? \\nI\\'m right where I want to be. \\nOkay. Hey. \\nSorry, it\\'s an occupational hazard. I work for the State Department. Human Resources. \\nI know it\\'s boring... \\nbut it enabled me to raise a son. I\\'m very proud of what he grew up to be. His name was Charlie Spencer. \\nYou murdered him. \\nIn Sokovia. \\nNot that that matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us? \\nYou just fight for yourself. \\nWho\\'s going to avenge my son, Stark? He\\'s dead... \\nand I blame you. \\n11 Wakandans were among \\nthose killed during a confrontation... between the Avengers \\nand a group of mercenaries... \\nin Lagos, Nigeria last month. \\nThe traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission... \\nin Lagos, when the attack occurred. Our people\\'s blood is spilled \\non foreign soil... \\nPage 7/52\\nnot only because of \\nthe actions of criminals... \\nbut by the indifference \\nof those pledged to stop them. \\nVictory at the expense of the innocent... is no victory at all. \\nThe Wakandan king went on to... They are operating outside \\nand above the international law. Because that\\'s the reality, \\nif we don\\'t respond to acts like these. What legal authority does an enhanced individual like Wanda Maximoff have... to operate in Nigeri...? \\nIt\\'s my fault. \\nThat\\'s not true. \\nTurn the TV back on. \\nThey\\'re being very specific. \\nI should\\'ve clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it. Rumlow said \"Bucky\"... \\nand all of a sudden \\nI was a 16-year-old kid again, \\nin Brooklyn. \\nAnd people died. \\nIt\\'s on me. \\nIt\\'s on both of us. \\nThis job... \\nWe try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn\\'t mean everybody. But if we can\\'t find a way \\nto live with that... \\nthen next time... \\nmaybe nobody gets saved. \\nVis! We talked about this. \\nYes, but the door was open \\nso I assumed that... \\nCaptain Rogers wished to know \\nwhen Mr Stark was arriving. \\nThank you. We\\'ll be right down. I\\'ll use the door. \\nOh, and apparently, he\\'s brought a guest. We know who it is? \\nThe Secretary of State. \\nPage 8/52\\nFive years ago... \\nI had a heart attack... \\nand dropped right in \\nthe middle of my backswing. \\nTurned out it was the best \\nround of my life... \\nbecause after 13 hours \\nof surgery and a triple bypass... I found something 40 years \\nin the Army had never taught me. Perspective. \\nThe world owes the Avengers \\nan unpayable debt. \\nYou have fought for us... \\nprotected us, risked your lives... but while a great many people \\nsee you as heroes... \\nthere are some... \\nwho would prefer the word \"vigilantes.\" What word would you use, Mr Secretary? How about \"dangerous\"? \\nWhat would you call a group \\nof US-based, enhanced individuals... who routinely ignore sovereign borders... and inflict their will \\nwherever they choose... \\nand who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind? \\nNew York. \\nWashington, D.C. \\nSokovia. \\nLagos. \\nOkay. That\\'s enough. \\nFor the past four years, \\nyou\\'ve operated with unlimited power... and no supervision. \\nThat\\'s an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. \\nThe Sokovia Accords. \\nApproved by 117 countries... \\nit states that the Avengers \\nshall no longer be a private organisation. Instead... \\nPage 9/52\\nthey\\'ll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel... \\nonly when and if that panel \\ndeems it necessary. \\nThe Avengers were formed to \\nmake the world a safer place. \\nI feel we\\'ve done that. \\nTell me, Captain, do you know \\nwhere Thor and Banner are right now? If I misplaced a couple of \\n30 megaton nukes... \\nyou can bet there\\'d be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. \\nThat\\'s how the world works. \\nBelieve me, this is the middle ground. So, there are contingencies. \\nThree days from now, \\nthe UN meets in Vienna... \\nto ratify the Accords. \\nTalk it over. \\nAnd if we come \\nto a decision you don\\'t like? \\nThen you retire. \\nHello? \\nIs this your car out front? \\nI jumped the kerb. \\nMaybe we could... \\ntake care of it ourselves. \\nIf you wanna call the cops, \\nthat\\'s okay, too... \\n- I guess. \\n- No. \\nNo cops. \\nThank you. \\nYou have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations. \\n\"Mission report. December 16, 1991.\" Who are you? \\nMy name is Zemo. \\nI will repeat my question. \\nMission report, December 16, 1991. How did you find me? \\nWhen S.H.I.E.L.D. fell... \\nBlack Widow released \\nPage 10/52\\nHYDRA files to the public. \\nMillions of pages. Much of it encrypted. Not easy to decipher. \\nBut, I have experience. \\nAnd patience. \\nA man can do anything if he has those. What do you want? \\nMission report. \\nDecember 16. \\nGo... to... hell! \\nHYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I\\'d have to use this book... \\nand other bloodier methods \\nto find what I need. \\nI don\\'t look forward to that. \\nYou\\'d only be dying for... \\nyour pride. \\nHail HYDRA. \\nSecretary Ross has \\na Congressional Medal of Honour... which is one more than you have. \\nSo let\\'s say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals? 117 countries want to sign this. \\n117, Sam, and you\\'re just like, \\n\"No, that\\'s cool. We got it.\" \\nHow long are you going to play both sides? I have an equation. \\nOh, this will clear it up. \\nIn the eight years since Mr Stark announced himself as Iron Man... \\nthe number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. \\nDuring the same period... \\nthe number of potentially \\nworld-ending events \\nhas risen at a commensurate rate. Are you saying it\\'s our fault? \\nI\\'m saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. \\nAnd conflict... \\nPage 11/52\\nbreeds catastrophe. \\nOversight... \\nOversight is not an idea that \\ncan be dismissed out of hand. \\nBoom. \\nTony. \\nYou are being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal. \\nIt\\'s because he\\'s already \\nmade up his mind. \\nBoy, you know me so well. \\nActually, I\\'m nursing \\nan electromagnetic headache. \\nThat\\'s what\\'s going on, Cap. \\nIt\\'s just pain. \\nIt\\'s discomfort. \\nWho\\'s putting coffee grounds \\nin the disposal? \\nAm I running a bed and breakfast \\nfor a biker gang? \\nOh, that\\'s Charles Spencer, by the way. He\\'s a great kid. \\nComputer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA... had a floor-level gig \\nat Intel planned for the fall. \\nBut first, he wanted to put \\na few miles on his soul... \\nbefore he parked it \\nbehind a desk. See the world. \\nMaybe be of service. \\nCharlie didn\\'t want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn\\'t go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. \\nHe decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. \\nGuess where. Sokovia. \\nHe wanted to make a difference, I suppose. We won\\'t know because we dropped \\na building on him while we were kicking ass. There\\'s no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! \\nWhatever form that takes, I\\'m game. If we can\\'t accept limitations, \\nPage 12/52\\nif we\\'re boundary-less... \\nwe\\'re no better than the bad guys. Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don\\'t give up. \\nWho said we\\'re giving up? \\nWe are if we\\'re not \\ntaking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blame. I\\'m sorry, Steve. \\nThat is dangerously arrogant. \\nThis is the United Nations \\nwe\\'re talking about. \\nIt\\'s not the World Security Council, it\\'s not S.H.I.E.L.D., it\\'s not HYDRA. No, but it\\'s run by people \\nwith agendas, and agendas change. That\\'s good. That\\'s why I\\'m here. When I realised what my weapons \\nwere capable of in the wrong hands... I shut it down and stopped manufacturing. Tony, you chose to do that. \\nIf we sign this, we surrender \\nour right to choose. \\nWhat if this panel sends us somewhere we don\\'t think we should go? \\nWhat if there is somewhere we need to go and they don\\'t let us? \\nWe may not be perfect, \\nbut the safest hands are still our own. If we don\\'t do this now, \\nit\\'s gonna be done to us later. \\nThat\\'s the fact. That won\\'t be pretty. You\\'re saying they\\'ll come for me. We would protect you. \\nMaybe Tony\\'s right. \\nIf we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off... Aren\\'t you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago? I\\'m just reading the terrain. \\nWe have made some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back. \\nFocus up. I\\'m sorry. \\nDid I just mishear you... \\nPage 13/52\\n- or did you agree with me? \\n- I want to take it back now. \\nNo, you can\\'t retract it. \\nThank you. Unprecedented. \\nOkay. Case closed. I win. \\nI have to go. \\nAnd now, I would like \\nto invite Sharon Carter \\nto come up and say a few words. Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D... \\nbut I just knew her as Aunt Peggy. She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told \\nanyone we were related. \\nI asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage... in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. \\nShe said, compromise where you can. But where you can\\'t, don\\'t. \\nEven if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world \\nis telling you to move... \\nit is your duty to plant \\nyourself like a tree... \\nlook them in the eye and say \\n\"No, you move.\" \\nWhen I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. \\nThen I found out she was alive. I was just lucky to have her. \\nShe had you back, too. \\nWho else signed? \\nTony, Rhodey, Vision. \\nClint? \\nSays he\\'s retired. \\n- Wanda? \\n- TBD. \\nI\\'m off to Vienna \\nPage 14/52\\nfor the signing of the Accords. There\\'s plenty of room on the jet. Just because it\\'s the path \\nof least resistance... \\ndoesn\\'t mean it\\'s the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together. \\nWhat are we giving up to do it? I\\'m sorry, Nat. \\nI can\\'t sign it. \\nI know. \\nThen what are you doing here? \\nI didn\\'t want you to be alone. \\nCome here. \\nAt a special United Nations conference... 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords. \\nExcuse me, Ms Romanoff? \\n- Yes? \\n- These need your signature. \\n- Thank you. \\n- Thanks. \\nI suppose neither of us \\nis used to the spotlight. \\nOh, well, it\\'s not always so flattering. You seem to be doing all right so far. Considering your last trip \\nto Capitol Hill... \\nI wouldn\\'t think you\\'d be particularly comfortable in this company. \\nWell, I\\'m not. \\nAnd that alone makes me glad \\nyou are here, Ms Romanoff. \\nWhy? You don\\'t approve of all this? The Accords, yes. \\nThe politics, not really. \\nTwo people in a room can get \\nmore done than a hundred. \\nUnless you need to move a piano. Ms Romanoff. \\nKing T\\'Chaka. \\nPlease, allow me to apologise \\nfor what happened in Nigeria. \\nThank you. \\nPage 15/52\\nThank you for agreeing to all of this. I\\'m sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today. \\nYes, so am I. \\nIf everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session. That is the future calling. \\nSuch a pleasure. \\nThank you. \\nFor a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you\\'re getting quite good at it. I\\'m happy, Father. \\nThank you. \\nThank you. \\nWhen stolen Wakandan vibranium \\nwas used to make a terrible weapon... we in Wakanda were forced \\nto question our legacy. \\nThose men and women killed in Nigeria... were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, \\nlet misfortune drive us back. \\nWe will fight to improve \\nthe world we wish to join. \\nI am grateful to the Avengers \\nfor supporting this initiative. Wakanda is proud \\nto extend its hand in peace. \\nEverybody get down! \\nMy mom tried \\nto talk me out of enlisting... \\nbut, um, not Aunt Peggy. \\nShe bought me my first thigh holster. Very practical. \\nAnd stylish. \\nCIA has you stationed over here now? Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force. Right. Right. Sounds fun. \\nI know, right? \\nI\\'ve been meaning to ask you. \\nWhen you were spying on me \\nfrom across the hall... \\nYou mean when I was doing my job. Page 16/52\\nDid Peggy know? \\nShe kept so many secrets. \\nI didn\\'t want her to have one from you. Thanks for walking me back. \\nSure. \\nSteve. \\nThere\\'s something you gotta see. A bomb hidden in a news van... Who\\'s coordinating? \\n...ripped through \\nthe UN building in Vienna. \\nGood. They\\'re solid. Forensics? More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead, \\nincluding Wakanda\\'s King T\\'Chaka. Officials have released \\na video of a suspect... \\nwho they have identified \\nas James Buchanan Barnes... \\nthe Winter Soldier. \\nThe infamous HYDRA agent... \\nlinked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations. \\nI have to go to work. \\nCall MI6, see if we can get \\nMicro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here \\nin two hours or it\\'s not worth it. I\\'m very sorry. \\nIn my culture... \\ndeath is not the end. \\nIt\\'s more of a stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands... and Bast and Sekhmet, \\nthey lead you into the green veldt... where you can run forever. \\nThat sounds very peaceful. \\nMy father thought so. \\nI am not my father. \\nT\\'Challa... \\nTask Force will decide \\nwho brings in Barnes. \\nDon\\'t bother, Ms Romanoff. \\nI\\'ll kill him myself. \\nPage 17/52\\nYeah? \\nYou all right? \\nUh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. \\nI know how much Barnes \\nmeans to you. I really do. \\nStay home. You\\'ll only make this worse. For all of us. \\nPlease. \\nAre you saying you\\'ll arrest me? No. \\nSomeone will. \\nIf you interfere. That\\'s how it works now. If he\\'s this far gone, Nat, \\nI should be the one to bring him in. Why? \\nBecause I\\'m the one \\nleast likely to die trying. \\nShit. \\nShe tell you to stay out of it? \\nMight have a point. \\nHe\\'d do it for me. \\n1945, maybe. \\nI just want to make sure \\nwe consider all our options. \\nThe people that shoot at you \\nusually wind up shooting at me. \\nTips have been pouring in \\nsince that footage went public. \\nEverybody thinks \\nthe Winter Soldier goes to their gym. Most of it\\'s noise. \\nExcept for this. \\nMy boss expects a briefing, \\npretty much now... \\nso that\\'s all the head start \\nyou\\'re gonna get. \\nThank you. \\nYou\\'re gonna have to hurry. \\nWe have orders to shoot on sight. Homecoming \\nOne \\nOne \\nFreight car \\nI have your breakfast. \\nPage 18/52\\nI could smell it before I opened the door. Side of bacon and black coffee. \\nAgain. \\nI can make you something \\ndifferent, if you like. \\nThis is wonderful... \\nI will just put this on your... \\nIt\\'s okay, I can manage! \\nHeads up, Cap. \\nGerman Special Forces, \\napproaching from the south. \\nUnderstood. \\nDo you know me? \\nYou\\'re Steve. \\nI read about you in a museum. \\nThey\\'ve set the perimeter. \\nI know you\\'re nervous, \\nand you have plenty of reason to be. But you\\'re lying. \\nI wasn\\'t in Vienna. \\nI don\\'t do that any more. \\nThey\\'re entering the building. \\nWell, the people \\nwho think you did are coming here now. And they\\'re not planning \\non taking you alive. \\nThat\\'s smart. \\nGood strategy. \\nThey\\'re on the roof. I\\'m compromised. This doesn\\'t have to end in a fight, Buck. - It always ends in a fight. \\n- Five seconds. \\nYou pulled me from the river. \\nWhy? \\n- I don\\'t know. \\n- Three seconds. \\nYes, you do. \\nBreach! Breach! Breach! \\nBuck, stop! \\nYou\\'re gonna kill someone. \\nI\\'m not gonna kill anyone. \\nSuspect has broken containment! \\n...he\\'s headed down the east stairwell! Come on, man. \\nPage 19/52\\nAhhh! \\nSam, southwest rooftop. \\nWho the hell\\'s the other guy? \\nAbout to find out. \\n- Sam. \\n- Got him. \\nStand down! \\nStand down! \\nSam, I can\\'t shake this guy. \\nRight behind you. \\nStand down, now. \\nCongratulations, Cap. \\nYou\\'re a criminal. \\nYour Highness. \\n\"A pinch of paprika.\" \\nA pinch. \\nIs that paprikash? \\nI thought it might lift your spirits. Spirits lifted. \\nIn my defence, I haven\\'t actually ever eaten anything before, so... May I? \\nPlease. \\n- Wanda? \\n- Hmm. \\nNo one dislikes you, Wanda. \\nThanks. \\nOh, you\\'re welcome. \\nNo, it\\'s a involuntary response in their amygdala. \\nThey can\\'t help but be afraid of you. Are you? \\nMy amygdala is synthetic, so... I used to think of myself one way. But after this... \\nI am something else. \\nI\\'m still me, I think, but... \\nthat\\'s not what everyone else sees. Do you know, I don\\'t know what this is? Not really. \\nI know it\\'s not of this world... that it powered Loki\\'s staff, \\ngave you your abilities, but... its true nature is a mystery. \\nPage 20/52\\nAnd yet, it is part of me. \\nAre you afraid of it? \\nI wish to understand it. \\nThe more I do, the less it controls me. One day... who knows? \\nI may even control it. \\nI don\\'t know what\\'s in this \\nbut it is not paprika. \\nI\\'m gonna go to the store. \\nI\\'ll be back in 20 minutes. \\nAlternatively, we could order a pizza? Vision, are you not letting me leave? It is a question of safety. \\nI can protect myself. \\nNot yours. \\nMr Stark would like to avoid \\nthe possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on \\na more secure foundation. \\nAnd what do you want? \\nFor people to see you... \\nas I do. \\nSo, you like cats? \\n- Sam. \\n- What? \\nDude shows up dressed like a cat, you don\\'t wanna know more? \\nYour suit... it\\'s vibranium? \\nThe Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. \\nA mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend \\nmurdered my father... \\nI also wear the mantle of king. \\nSo, I ask you... \\nas both warrior and king... \\nhow long do you think you can \\nkeep your friend safe from me? \\nWhat\\'s gonna happen to him? \\nSame thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition. This is Everett Ross, \\nDeputy Task Force Commander. \\nWhat about a lawyer? \\nPage 21/52\\nLawyer. That\\'s funny. \\nSee their weapons are placed in lockup. We\\'ll write you a receipt. \\nI better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that. You\\'ll be provided \\nwith an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favour, stay in it? I don\\'t intend on going anywhere. For the record, this is what \\nmaking things worse looks like. He\\'s alive. \\nNo. \\nRomania was not Accords-sanctioned. Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup. Try not to break anything \\nwhile we fix this. \\nConsequences? You bet \\nthere\\'ll be consequences. \\nObviously you can quote me on that, because I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir. \\n\"Consequences\"? \\nSecretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something. \\nI\\'m not getting that shield back, am I? Technically, it\\'s the \\ngovernment\\'s property. \\nWings, too. \\nThat\\'s cold. \\nWarmer than jail. \\nHey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad\\'s archives. Felt timely. \\nFDR signed the Lend-Lease bill \\nwith these in 1941. \\nProvided support to the Allies \\nwhen they needed it most. \\nSome would say it brought \\nour country closer to war. \\nSee? If not for these, \\nyou wouldn\\'t be here. \\nI\\'m trying to... What do you call it? That\\'s an olive branch. \\nPage 22/52\\nIs that what you call it? \\nIs Pepper here? I didn\\'t see her. We\\'re kinda... \\n- Well, not kinda... \\n- Pregnant? \\nNo. Definitely not. \\nWe\\'re taking a break. \\nIt\\'s nobody\\'s fault. \\nI\\'m so sorry, Tony. I didn\\'t know. A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. \\nThen, we had to mop up HYDRA... and then Ultron. My fault. \\nAnd then, and then, and then, \\nI never stopped. \\nBecause the truth is I don\\'t wanna stop. I don\\'t wanna lose her. \\nI thought maybe the Accords \\ncould split the difference. \\nIn her defence, I\\'m a handful. \\nYet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work. I\\'m glad Howard got married. \\nI only knew him \\nwhen he was young and single. \\nOh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. \\nMaybe only a thousand times. \\nGod, I hated you. \\nI don\\'t mean to make things difficult. I know, because you\\'re \\na very polite person. \\nIf I see a situation pointed south... I can\\'t ignore it. \\nSometimes I wish I could. \\nNo, you don\\'t. \\nNo, I don\\'t. \\nSometimes... \\nSometimes I wanna \\npunch you in your perfect teeth. But I don\\'t wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. \\nSo far, nothing\\'s happened \\nthat can\\'t be undone, if you sign. Page 23/52\\nWe can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to \\nan American psych-centre... \\ninstead of a Wakandan prison. \\nI\\'m not saying it\\'s impossible... but there would have to be safeguards. Sure. \\nOnce we put out the PR fire, \\nthose documents can be amended. \\nI\\'d file a motion to have \\nyou and Wanda reinstated... \\nWanda? What about Wanda? \\nShe\\'s fine. She\\'s confined \\nto the compound, currently. \\nVision\\'s keeping her company. \\nOh, God, Tony. \\nEvery time I think you see \\nthings the right way... \\nIt\\'s 100 acres with a lap pool. \\nIt\\'s got a screening room. \\nThere\\'s worse ways to protect people. Protection? \\nIs that how you see this? \\nThis is protection? It\\'s internment, Tony. - She\\'s not a US citizen. \\n- Oh, come on, Tony. \\nAnd they don\\'t grant visas \\nto weapons of mass destruction. \\nShe\\'s a kid! \\nGive me a break! \\nI\\'m doing what has to be done. \\nTo stave off something worse. \\nYou keep telling yourself that. \\nHate to break up the set. \\nHello, Mr Barnes. \\nI\\'ve been sent by \\nthe United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? \\nYour first name is James? \\nThe receipt for your gear. \\n\"Bird costume\"? Come on. \\nI didn\\'t write it. \\nI\\'m not here to judge you. \\nI just want to ask you a few questions. Page 24/52\\nDo you know where you are, James? I can\\'t help you if you \\ndon\\'t talk to me, James. \\nMy name is Bucky. \\nHello? \\nHey! \\nWhy would the Task Force \\nrelease this photo to begin with? Get the word out, \\ninvolve as many eyes as we can? Right. It\\'s a good way \\nto flush a guy out of hiding. \\nSet off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier. \\nYou\\'re saying someone \\nframed him to find him? \\nSteve, we looked for the guy \\nfor two years and found nothing. We didn\\'t bomb the UN. \\nThat turns a lot of heads. \\nYeah, but that doesn\\'t guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would. \\nYeah. \\nTell me, Bucky. \\nYou\\'ve seen a great deal, haven\\'t you? I don\\'t wanna talk about it. \\nYou fear that if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. \\nDon\\'t worry. \\nWe only have to talk about one. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Friday, get me a source on that outage. Sub-level five, East Wing. \\nWhat the hell is this? \\nWhy don\\'t we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean your real home. \\nLonging \\nNo. \\nRusted \\nStop. \\nSeventeen \\nPage 25/52\\nStop. \\nDaybreak \\nFurnace \\nNine \\nBenign \\nHomecoming \\nOne \\nFreight car \\nSoldier? \\nReady to comply. \\nMission report. December 16, 1991. Help me. \\nHelp. \\nGet up. \\nWho are you? What do you want? To see an empire fall. \\nHey. \\nEvac all civilians. \\nGet me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air. \\nPlease tell me you brought a suit. Sure did. It\\'s a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. \\nI\\'m an active-duty non-combatant. Follow me. \\nWe\\'re in position. \\nYou could at least recognise me. Damn it. \\nHe asked me again \\nif you were going to be there. I said I wasn\\'t sure. \\nYou should have seen his \\nlittle face. Just try, okay? \\nI\\'m going to bed. \\nI love you. \\nJames Barnes the suspect \\nin the UN Vienna bombing... \\n...escaped custody today. \\n...also missing Avenger \\nCaptain Steve Rogers... \\nand Sam Wilson. \\nHey, Cap! \\nSteve. \\nWhich Bucky am I talking to? \\nPage 26/52\\nYour mom\\'s name was Sarah. \\nYou used to wear newspapers in your shoes. Can\\'t read that in a museum. \\nJust like that, we\\'re supposed to be cool? What did I do? \\nEnough. \\nOh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA \\nput inside me is still there. \\nAll he had to do \\nwas say the goddamn words. \\n- Who was he? \\n- I don\\'t know. \\nPeople are dead. The bombing, the setup... the doctor did all that just \\nto get 10 minutes with you. \\nI need you to do \\nbetter than \"I don\\'t know.\" \\nHe wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. \\nHe wanted to know exactly where. Why would he need to know that? \\nBecause I\\'m not the only Winter Soldier. It hurts! \\nGood work. \\nGet me out of here. \\nWho were they? \\nTheir most elite death squad. \\nMore kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum. \\nThey all turn out like you? \\nWorse. \\nThe doctor, could he control them? Enough. \\nSaid he wanted to see an empire fall. With these guys, he could do it. They speak 30 languages, \\ncan hide in plain sight... \\ninfiltrate, assassinate, destabilise. They can take a whole country down in one night, you\\'d never see them coming. This would have been \\na lot easier a week ago. \\n- If we call Tony... \\nPage 27/52\\n- No, he won\\'t believe us. \\nEven if he did... \\nWho knows if the Accords \\nwould let him help. \\nWe\\'re on our own. \\nMaybe not. \\nI know a guy. \\nI don\\'t suppose you have \\nany idea where they are? \\nWe will. \\nGSG 9\\'s got the borders covered. Recon\\'s flying 24/7. \\nThey\\'ll get a hit. We\\'ll handle it. You don\\'t get it, Stark. \\nIt\\'s not yours to handle. \\nIt\\'s clear you can\\'t be objective. I\\'m putting Special Ops on this. What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers? If we\\'re provoked. \\nBarnes would\\'ve been eliminated in Romania if it wasn\\'t for Rogers. There are dead people \\nwho would be alive now. \\nFeel free to check my math. \\nAll due respect, you\\'re not gonna solve this with boys and bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in. How would that end \\nany differently than last time? Because this time, I won\\'t be \\nwearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed. \\n36 hours. \\nBarnes. \\nRogers. \\nWilson. \\nThank you, sir. \\nMy left arm is numb. Is that normal? You all right? \\nAlways. \\n36 hours. Jeez. \\nWe\\'re seriously understaffed. \\nOh, yeah. \\nPage 28/52\\nIt\\'d be great if we had \\na Hulk right about now. Any shot? You really think he\\'d be on our side? No. \\nI have an idea. \\nMe, too. Where\\'s yours? \\nDownstairs. \\nWhere\\'s yours? \\nHey, May. \\nMmm. Hey. \\nHow was school today? \\nIt was okay. \\nThis crazy car parked outside. \\n- Oh, Mr Parker. \\n- Um... \\nWhat are you doing... \\nHey! Uh, I\\'m Peter. \\nTony. \\nWhat are you doing here? \\nIt\\'s about time we met. \\nYou\\'ve been getting my emails, right? - Yeah. Yeah. \\n- Right? \\nRegarding the... \\nYou didn\\'t even tell me about the grant. - About the grant. \\n- The September Foundation. \\n- Right. \\n- Yeah. \\nRemember when you applied? \\nYeah. \\nI approved, so now we\\'re in business. But you didn\\'t tell me anything. What\\'s up with that? \\nYou keeping secrets from me now? I just know how much you love surprises so I thought I would let you know... Anyway, what did I apply for? \\nThat\\'s what I\\'m here to hash out. Okay. Hash it out, okay. \\nIt\\'s so hard for me to believe \\nthat she\\'s someone\\'s aunt. \\nYeah, well, we come in \\nall shapes and sizes, you know? Page 29/52\\nThis walnut date loaf is exceptional. - Let me just stop you there. \\n- Yeah. \\nIs this grant got money \\ninvolved or whatever? No? \\nYeah, it\\'s pretty well funded. \\nYeah? Wow. \\nLook who you\\'re talking to. \\n- Can I have five minutes with him? - Sure. \\nAs walnut date loaves go, that wasn\\'t bad. Whoa, what have we here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army? \\n- Uh, the garbage, actually. \\n- You\\'re a dumpster diver? \\nYeah, I was... \\nAnyway, look, um, I definitely \\ndid not apply for your grant... \\n- Ah-ah! Me first. \\n- Okay. \\nQuick question of the rhetorical variety. That\\'s you, right? \\nUm, no. \\n- What do you mean? \\n- Yeah. \\nLook at you go. \\nWow! Nice catch. \\n3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. \\nThat\\'s not easy. You got mad skills. That\\'s all on YouTube, though, right? That\\'s where you found that? \\nBecause you know that\\'s all fake. It\\'s all done on the computer. \\nMmm-hmm. \\nIt\\'s like that video. What is it? Yeah. Oh, you mean like \\nthose UFOs over Phoenix? \\nExactly. \\nOh, what have we here? \\nUh... \\nYou\\'re the Spider-ling. \\nCrime-fighting spider. You\\'re Spider-Boy? Spider-Man. \\nNot in that onesie, you\\'re not. \\nPage 30/52\\nIt\\'s not a onesie. \\nI don\\'t believe this. I was actually having a really good day today, Mr Stark. Didn\\'t miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there... and Algebra test, nailed it. \\nWho else knows? Anybody? \\nNobody. \\nNot even your unusually attractive aunt? No. No. \\nNo! If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out. You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. \\nThat tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that? \\nI did. \\nClimbing walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves? \\nIt\\'s a long story. I was... \\nLordy! Can you even see in these? Yes, I can. \\nI\\'m blind! \\nI can see in those. \\nOkay? \\nIt\\'s just that when whatever \\nhappened, happened... \\nit\\'s like my senses \\nhave been dialled to 11. \\nThere\\'s way too much input, \\nso they just kinda help me focus. You\\'re in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom, \\nhundred-point restoration. \\nThat\\'s why I\\'m here. \\nWhy you doing this? \\nI gotta know, what\\'s your MO? \\nWhat gets you outta that \\ntwin bed in the morning? \\nBecause... \\nBecause I\\'ve been me my whole life, and I\\'ve had these powers for six months. Mmm-hmm. \\nI read books, I build computers. Page 31/52\\nYeah, I would love to play football, but I couldn\\'t then, so I shouldn\\'t now. Sure, because you\\'re different. \\nExactly. But I can\\'t tell \\nanybody that, so I\\'m not. \\nWhen you can do the things \\nthat I can, but you don\\'t... \\nand then the bad things happen... they happen because of you. \\nSo you wanna look out for the little guy, you wanna do your part? \\nMake the world \\na better place, all that, right? Yeah, just looking out for the little guy. That\\'s what it is. \\nI\\'m gonna sit here, so you move the leg. You got a passport? \\nNo, I don\\'t even have a driver\\'s licence. - You ever been to Germany? \\n- No. \\nOh, you\\'ll love it. \\n- I can\\'t go to Germany. \\n- Why? \\nI got homework. \\nI\\'m gonna pretend you didn\\'t say that. No, I\\'m being serious. \\nI can\\'t just drop out of school. Might be a little dangerous. \\nBetter tell Aunt Hottie \\nI\\'m taking you on a field trip. \\nDon\\'t tell Aunt May. \\nAll right, Spider-Man. \\nGet me out of this. \\nSorry. I\\'ll get the... \\nWhat is it? \\nStay here, please. \\nGuess I shoulda knocked. \\nOh, my God! What are you doing here? Disappointing my kids. \\nI\\'m supposed to go waterskiing. \\nCap needs our help. Come on. \\nClint! \\nYou should not be here. \\nReally? \\nPage 32/52\\nI retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit. \\nPlease consider \\nthe consequences of your actions. Okay, they\\'re considered. \\nOkay, we gotta go. \\nIt\\'s this way. \\nI\\'ve caused enough problems. \\nYou gotta help me, Wanda. \\nLook, you wanna mope, \\nyou can go to high school. \\nYou wanna make amends, \\nyou get off your ass. \\nShit. \\nI knew I should\\'ve stretched. \\nClint, you can\\'t overpower me. \\nI know I can\\'t. \\nBut she can. \\nVision, that\\'s enough. Let him go. I\\'m leaving. \\nI can\\'t let you. \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nIf you do this... \\nthey will never stop being afraid of you. I can\\'t control their fear, only my own. Oh... \\nCome on. We got one more stop. \\nIt\\'s just a matter of time. \\nOur satellites are running \\nfacial, biometric, \\nand behavioural pattern scans. \\nMove or you will be moved. \\nAs entertaining as that would be... You really think you can find him? My resources are considerable. \\nYeah, it took the world \\n70 years to find Barnes... \\nso you could probably do that \\nin about half the time. \\nYou know where they are. \\nI know someone who does. \\nNot sure you understand \\nthe concept of a getaway car. \\nIt\\'s low profile. \\nPage 33/52\\nGood, because this stuff \\ntends to draw a crowd. \\nCan you move your seat up? \\nNo. \\nI owe you again. \\nKeeping a list. \\nYou know, he kinda tried to kill me. Sorry. I\\'ll put it on the list, too. They\\'re going to come looking for you. I know. \\nThank you, Sharon. \\nThat was... \\nLate. \\nDamn right. \\nI should go. \\nOkay. \\nCap. \\nYou know I wouldn\\'t have called if I had any other choice. \\nHey, man, you\\'re doing me a favour. Besides, I owe a debt. \\nThanks for having my back. \\nIt was time to get off my ass. How about our other recruit? \\nHe\\'s rarin\\' to go. \\nHad to put a little coffee in him... but he should be good. \\nWhat time zone is this? \\nCome on. Come on. \\n- Captain America! \\n- Mr Lang. \\nIt\\'s an honour. \\nI\\'m shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! \\nCaptain America. \\nI know you, too. You\\'re great! Jeez. \\nAh, look, I wanna say, I know \\nyou know a lot of super people, so... thinks for thanking of me. \\n- Hey, man! \\n- What\\'s up, Tic Tac? \\nUh, good to see you. \\nLook, what happened last time when I... Page 34/52\\nIt was a great audition, \\nbut it\\'ll never happen again. \\nThey tell you what we\\'re up against? Something about some psycho-assassins? We\\'re outside the law on this one. So if you come with us, \\nyou\\'re a wanted man. \\nYeah, well, what else is new? \\nWe should get moving. \\nWe got a chopper lined up. \\nThey\\'re evacuating the airport. Stark. \\nStark? \\nSuit up. \\nWow, it\\'s so weird how you run into people at the airport. \\n- Don\\'t you think that\\'s weird? - Definitely weird. \\nHear me out, Tony. \\nThat doctor, the psychiatrist, he\\'s behind all of this. \\nCaptain. \\nYour Highness. \\nAnyway... \\nRoss gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. \\nCan you help a brother out? \\nYou\\'re after the wrong guy. \\nYour judgement is askew. \\nYour old war buddy killed \\ninnocent people yesterday. \\nAnd there are five more \\nsuper soldiers just like him. \\nI can\\'t let the doctor \\nfind them first, Tony. I can\\'t. Steve... \\nyou know what\\'s about to happen. Do you really wanna \\npunch your way out of this one? All right, I\\'ve run out of patience. Underoos! \\n- Nice job, kid. \\n- Thanks. \\nI could have stuck the landing Page 35/52\\na little better, it\\'s just... \\nNew suit. It\\'s nothing, Mr Stark. It\\'s perfect. Thank you. \\nYeah, we don\\'t really need \\nto start a conversation. \\nOkay. Cap. Captain. \\nBig fan. I\\'m Spider-Man. \\nYeah, we\\'ll talk about it later. \\n- Hey, everyone. \\n- Good job. \\nYou\\'ve been busy. \\nAnd you\\'ve been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint... \\n\"Rescuing\" Wanda from a place she doesn\\'t even want to leave, a safe place. I\\'m trying to keep... \\nI\\'m trying to keep you from \\ntearing the Avengers apart. \\nYou did that when you signed. \\nAll right, we\\'re done. \\nYou\\'re gonna turn Barnes over, you\\'re gonna come with us, now, because it\\'s us... or a squad of J-SOC guys... \\nwith no compunction about being impolite. Come on. \\nWe found it. \\nTheir Quinjet\\'s in \\nhangar five, north runway. \\nAll right, Lang. \\nHey, guys, something... \\nWhoa. What the hell was that? \\nI believe this is yours, Captain America. Oh, great. \\nAll right, there\\'s two \\non the parking deck. \\nOne of them\\'s Maximoff, \\nI\\'m gonna grab her. \\nRhodey, you wanna take Cap? \\nGot two in the terminal, \\nWilson and Barnes. \\nBarnes is mine. \\nHey, Mr Stark, what should I do? \\nWhat we discussed. \\nKeep your distance, web them up. \\nPage 36/52\\nOkay, copy that. \\nMove, Captain. \\nI won\\'t ask a second time. \\nLook, I really don\\'t want to hurt you. I wouldn\\'t stress about it. \\nWhat the hell is that? \\nEveryone\\'s got a gimmick now. \\nYou have a metal arm? \\nThat is awesome, dude. \\nYou have the right to remain silent! Sorry, Cap, this won\\'t kill you... but it ain\\'t gonna tickle either. Wanda, I think you hurt Vision\\'s feelings. You locked me in my room. \\nOkay, first, that\\'s an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. - Hey, Clint. \\n- Hey, man. \\nClearly, retirement doesn\\'t suit you. You got tired of shooting golf? \\nWell, I played 18, shot 18. \\nJust can\\'t seem to miss. \\nFirst time for everything. \\nMade you look. \\nMultiple contusions detected. \\nYeah, I detected that, too. \\nOh, God! \\nHey, buddy, I think you lost this! Ahh! \\nThose wings carbon fibre? \\nIs this stuff coming out of you? That would explain \\nthe rigidity-flexibility ratio, \\nwhich, gotta say, that\\'s awesome, man. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve \\nbeen in a fight before... \\nbut there\\'s usually not this much talking. All right, sorry. My bad. \\nGuys, look, I\\'d love to keep this up, but I\\'ve only got one job here today... and I gotta impress Mr Stark, \\nso, I\\'m really sorry. \\nYou couldn\\'t have done that earlier? I hate you. \\nPage 37/52\\nGreat. \\nHey, Cap, heads-up! \\nThrow it at this. \\nNow! \\nOh, come on! \\nOh, man, I thought it was a water truck. Uh, sorry. \\nAll right, now I\\'m pissed. \\nIs this part of the plan? \\nWell, my plan was go easy on them. You wanna switch it up? \\nThere\\'s our ride. \\nCome on! \\nCaptain Rogers... \\nI know you believe \\nwhat you\\'re doing is right. \\nBut for the collective good... \\nyou must surrender now. \\nWhat do we do, Cap? \\nWe fight. \\nThis is gonna end well. \\nThey\\'re not stopping. \\nNeither are we. \\nWe\\'re still friends, right? \\nDepends on how hard you hit me. \\nYou were pulling your punches. \\nI didn\\'t kill your father. \\nThen why did you run? \\nThat thing does not obey \\nthe laws of physics at all. \\nLook, kid, there\\'s a lot going on here that you don\\'t understand. \\nMr Stark said you\\'d say that. Wow. He also said to go for your legs. Ahh! \\nClint, can you get him off me? \\nBuckled in? \\nYeah. No, I\\'m good. \\nI\\'m good, Arrow Guy. Let\\'s go! \\nStark tell you anything else? \\nThat you\\'re wrong. You think you\\'re right. That makes you dangerous. \\nGuess he had a point. \\nYou got heart, kid. Where you from? Page 38/52\\nQueens. \\nBrooklyn. \\nFriday? \\nWe have some weapon systems offline. What? \\nOh, you\\'re gonna have to \\ntake this into the shop. \\nWho\\'s speaking? \\nIt\\'s your conscience. \\nWe don\\'t talk a lot these days. \\nFriday? \\nDeploying fire suppression system. Uh-oh. \\nOh, boy! \\nWhoa! \\nWe gotta go. \\nThat guy\\'s probably in Siberia by now. We gotta draw out the flyers. \\nI\\'ll take Vision, you get to the jet. No, you get to the jet! \\nBoth of you! \\nThe rest of us aren\\'t getting out of here. As much as I hate to admit it... if we\\'re gonna win this one, \\nsome of us might have to lose it. This isn\\'t the real fight, Steve. All right, Sam. What\\'s the play? We need a diversion. Something big. I got something kinda big. \\nBut I can\\'t hold it very long. \\nOn my signal, run like hell. \\nAnd if I tear myself in half... \\ndon\\'t come back for me. \\nHe\\'s gonna tear himself in half? You sure about this, Scott? \\nI do it all the time. \\nI mean, once. In a lab. \\nThen I passed out. \\nI\\'m the boss, I\\'m the boss, I\\'m the boss. Holy shit! \\nOkay, tiny dude is big now. He\\'s big now. I guess that\\'s the signal. \\nWay to go, Tic Tac! \\nGive me back my Rhodey. \\nPage 39/52\\nI got him. \\nOkay, anybody on our side \\nhiding any shocking \\nand fantastic abilities \\nthey\\'d like to disclose... \\nI\\'m open to suggestions. \\nYou wanna get to them... \\nyou gotta go through me. \\nUh-huh. \\nWe haven\\'t met yet. \\n- I\\'m Clint. \\n- I don\\'t care. \\nWhoa! \\nAhhh! \\nGet off! \\nSomething just flew in me! \\nYou\\'re not gonna stop. \\nYou know I can\\'t. \\nI\\'m gonna regret this. \\nGo. \\nHey, guys, you ever see \\nthat really old movie, \\nEmpire Strikes Back? \\nJesus, Tony, how old is this guy? I don\\'t know, I didn\\'t carbon-date him. He\\'s on the young side. \\nYou know that part \\nwhere they\\'re on the snow planet... with the walking thingies? \\nMaybe the kid\\'s onto something. High now, Tony. Go high. \\nYes! \\nThat was awesome! \\nDoes anyone have any orange slices? Kid, you all right? \\nWhoa! \\nSame side. Guess who. Hi. It\\'s me. - Hey, man. \\n- Yeah. \\n- That was scary. \\n- Yeah. \\nYou\\'re done, all right? \\nWhat? I\\'m good, I\\'m fine. \\nYou did a good job. Stay down. Page 40/52\\nNo, it\\'s good. I gotta get him back. You\\'re going home or I\\'ll call Aunt May! - Dude. \\n- You\\'re done! \\nWait. \\nMr Stark, wait. I\\'m not done. I\\'m not... Okay, I\\'m done. I\\'m done. \\nI said I\\'d help you find him, \\nnot catch him. \\nThere\\'s a difference. \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nMe, too. \\nIt\\'s as I said. \\nCatastrophe. \\nVision, I got a bandit on my six. Vision! You copy? \\nTarget his thruster, \\nturn him into a glider. \\nRhodey! \\nTony, I\\'m flying dead stick. \\nRhodes! \\nRead vitals. \\nHeartbeat detected. \\nEmergency medical is on its way. I\\'m sorry. \\n- this is room 201... \\nBacon and black coffee again today? You know me so well... \\nHello? Your breakfast is here. \\nMay I let myself in? \\nWhat\\'s gonna happen to your friends? Whatever it is... \\nI\\'ll deal with it. \\nI don\\'t know if I\\'m worth all this, Steve. What you did all those years... \\nIt wasn\\'t you. \\nYou didn\\'t have a choice. \\nI know. \\nBut I did it. \\nHow did this happen? \\nI became distracted. \\nI didn\\'t think that was possible. Neither did I. \\nThe doctors say he shattered \\nPage 41/52\\nL4 through S1. \\nExtreme laceration to the spinal cord. Probably looking at \\nsome form of paralysis. \\nSteve\\'s not gonna stop. \\nIf you don\\'t either, Rhodey\\'s \\ngonna be the best case scenario. You let them go, Nat. \\nWe played this wrong. \\n\"We\"? \\nBoy, it must be hard to shake \\nthe whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA. \\nAre you incapable \\nof letting go of your ego... \\nfor one goddamn second? \\nT\\'Challa told Ross what you did, so... they\\'re coming for you. \\nI\\'m not the one that needs \\nto watch their back. \\nWhat am I looking at, Friday? \\nPriority upload from Berlin police. Fire up the chopper. \\nThe Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Doctor Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. \\nHe was met by this man. \\nDid you run facial recognition yet? What do I look like? \\nUh, I don\\'t know. \\nI\\'ve been picturing a redhead. \\nYou must be thinking of someone else. Must be. \\nThe fake doctor is actually \\nColonel Helmut Zemo. \\nSokovian Intelligence. \\nZemo ran Echo Scorpion... \\na Sokovian covert kill squad. \\nWhat happened to the real Broussard? He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found \\na wig and facial prosthesis... \\napproximating the appearance \\nPage 42/52\\nof one James Buchanan Barnes. \\nSon of a bitch. \\n- Get this to Ross. \\n- Yes, boss. \\nThis is Raft Prison Control. \\nYou\\'re cleared for landing, Mr Stark. So? You got the files? \\nLet\\'s reroute the satellites, \\nstart facial scanning for this Zemo guy. You seriously think I\\'m gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You\\'re lucky you\\'re not \\nin one of these cells. \\nThe Futurist, gentlemen! \\nThe Futurist is here! \\nHe sees all! \\nHe knows what\\'s best for you, \\nwhether you like it or not. \\nGive me a break, Barton. \\nI had no idea \\nthey\\'d put you here. Come on. \\nYeah, well, you knew \\nthey\\'d put us somewhere, Tony. \\nYeah, but not some \\nsuper-max floating ocean pokey. This place is for maniacs. \\nThis is a place for... \\nCriminals? \\nCriminals, Tony. \\nThink that\\'s the word you\\'re looking for. Right? \\nThat didn\\'t used to mean me. \\nOr Sam, or Wanda. \\nBut here we are. \\n- Because you broke the law. \\n- Yeah. \\nI didn\\'t make you. \\n- La, la, la, la, la... \\n- You read it, you broke it. \\nYou\\'re all grown up, \\nyou got a wife and kids. \\nI don\\'t understand, why didn\\'t you think about them before \\nyou chose the wrong side? \\nPage 43/52\\nYou gotta watch your back with this guy. There\\'s a chance he\\'s gonna break it. Hank Pym always said \\nyou never can trust a Stark. \\nWho are you? \\nCome on, man. \\nHow\\'s Rhodes? \\nThey\\'re flying him to \\nColumbia Medical tomorrow... \\nso fingers crossed. \\nWhat do you need? They feed you yet? You\\'re the good cop, now? \\nI\\'m just the guy who needs \\nto know where Steve went. \\nWell, you better go get a bad cop... because you\\'re gonna have to \\ngo Mark Fuhrman on my ass... \\nto get information out of me. \\nWell, I just knocked \\nthe A out of their AV. \\nWe got about 30 seconds before \\nthey realise it\\'s not their equipment. What\\'d you do? \\nGet it back up! \\nJust look. \\nBecause that... \\nis the fellow who was \\nsupposed to interrogate Barnes. Clearly, I made a mistake. \\nSam, I was wrong. \\nThat\\'s a first. \\nCap is definitely off the reservation... but he\\'s about to need \\nall the help he can get. \\nWe don\\'t know each other very well. You don\\'t have to... \\nHey, it\\'s all right. \\nLook, I\\'ll tell you... \\nbut you have to go alone and as a friend. Easy. \\nStark? \\nDid he give you anything on Rogers? Nope. Told me to go to hell. \\nI\\'m going back to the compound instead, Page 44/52\\nbut you can call me anytime. \\nI\\'ll put you on hold. \\nI like to watch the line blink. \\nYou remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach \\nin the back of that freezer truck? Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs? \\nYou blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead. What was her name, again? \\nDolores. You called her Dot. \\nShe\\'s gotta be \\na hundred years old right now. \\nSo are we, pal. \\nHe can\\'t have been here \\nmore than a few hours. \\nLong enough to wake them up. \\nYou ready? \\nYeah. \\nYou seem a little defensive. \\nIt\\'s been a long day. \\nAt ease, Soldier. \\nI\\'m not currently after you. \\nThen why are you here? \\nCould be your story\\'s not so crazy. Maybe. \\nRoss has no idea I\\'m here. \\nI\\'d like to keep it that way. \\nOtherwise, I gotta arrest myself. Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. It\\'s good to see you, Tony. \\nYou too, Cap. \\nHey, Manchurian Candidate, \\nyou\\'re killing me. \\nThere\\'s a truce here. You can drop... I got heat signatures. \\nHow many? \\nUh, one. \\nIf it\\'s any comfort, \\nthey died in their sleep. \\nDid you really think I wanted more of you? What the hell? \\nI\\'m grateful to them, though. \\nPage 45/52\\nThey brought you here. \\nPlease, Captain. \\nThe Soviets built \\nthis chamber to withstand \\nthe launch blast of UR-100 rockets. I\\'m betting I could beat that. Oh, I\\'m sure you could, Mr Stark. Given time. \\nBut then you\\'d never know why you came. You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here? \\nI\\'ve thought about \\nnothing else for over a year. \\nI studied you. \\nI followed you. \\nBut now that you\\'re standing here... I just realised... \\nthere\\'s a bit of green \\nin the blue of your eyes. \\nHow nice to find a flaw. \\nYou\\'re Sokovian. \\nIs that what this is about? \\nSokovia was a failed state \\nlong before you blew it to hell. No. \\nI\\'m here because I made a promise. You lost someone? \\nI lost everyone. \\nAnd so will you. \\nAn empire toppled \\nby its enemies can rise again. But one which crumbles from within? That\\'s dead. \\nForever. \\nI know that road. \\nWhat is this? \\nHelp my wife. \\nPlease. Help. \\nSergeant Barnes? \\nHoward! \\nHoward! \\nNo, Tony. \\nDid you know? \\nI didn\\'t know it was him. \\nPage 46/52\\nDon\\'t bullshit me, Rogers. Did you know? Yes. \\nGet out of here! \\nIt wasn\\'t him, Tony. \\nHYDRA had control of his mind! \\nMove! \\nIt wasn\\'t him! \\nLeft bootjet failing. \\nFlight systems compromised. \\nAh, crap. \\nHe\\'s not gonna stop. Go. \\nCome on, come on. \\nTargeting system\\'s knackered, boss. I\\'m eyeballing it. \\nDo you even remember them? \\nI remember all of them. \\nThis isn\\'t gonna change what happened. I don\\'t care. \\nHe killed my mom. \\nYou should have seen his little face. Just try, okay? \\nI\\'m going to bed. \\nI love you. \\nI almost killed the wrong man. \\nHardly an innocent one. \\nThis is all you wanted? \\nTo see them rip each other apart. My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. \\nHe could see the Iron Man \\nfrom the car window. \\nI told my wife, \"Don\\'t worry. \\n\"They\\'re fighting in the city. \\nWe\\'re miles from harm.\" \\nWhen the dust cleared... \\nand the screaming stopped... \\nit took me two days \\nuntil I found their bodies. \\nMy father... \\nstill holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? \\nThey went home. \\nI knew I couldn\\'t kill them. \\nPage 47/52\\nMore powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them \\nto kill each other... \\nI\\'m sorry about your father. \\nHe seemed a good man. \\nWith a dutiful son. \\nVengeance has consumed you. \\nIt\\'s consuming them. \\nI am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough. \\nTell that to the dead. \\nThe living are not done with you, yet. You can\\'t beat him hand-to-hand. Analyse his fight pattern. \\nScanning. \\nCountermeasures ready. \\nLet\\'s kick his ass. \\nHe\\'s my friend. \\nSo was I. \\nStay down. Final warning. \\nI could do this all day. \\nThat shield doesn\\'t belong to you. You don\\'t deserve it. \\nMy father made that shield! \\nMeals at 8 and 5. \\nToilet privileges twice a day. \\nRaise your voice, zap. \\nTouch the glass, zap. \\nYou step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line, hmm? \\nSo how does it feel? \\nTo spend all that time, all that effort... to see it fail so spectacularly? Did it? \\n- It\\'s just the first pass. \\n- Yeah. \\nGive me some feedback, \\nanything you think of. \\nShock absorption, lateral movement. Cup holder? \\nYou may wanna think about \\nsome AC down in... \\nOw. \\nLet\\'s go. I\\'ll give you a hand. \\nPage 48/52\\nNo. Don\\'t help me. \\nAh. \\n138 combat missions. \\nThat\\'s how many I\\'ve flown, Tony. Every one of them \\ncould\\'ve been my last, but I flew them. Because the fight needed to be fought. It\\'s the same with these Accords. I signed because it was \\nthe right thing to do. \\nAnd yeah, this sucks. This is, uh... This is a bad beat. \\nBut it hasn\\'t changed my mind. \\nI don\\'t think. \\n- You okay? \\n- Oh, yeah. \\nAre you Tony Stank? \\nYes, this is Tony Stank. \\nYou\\'re in the right place. \\nThank you for that! \\nNever dropping that, by the way. \"Table for one, Mr Stank. \\n\"Please, by the bathroom.\" \\nTony... \\nI\\'m glad you\\'re back at the compound. I don\\'t like the idea of you \\nrattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. \\nThe Avengers are yours. \\nMaybe more so than mine. \\nI\\'ve been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, \\neven in the Army. \\nMy faith\\'s in people, I guess. \\nIndividuals. \\nAnd I\\'m happy to say that, \\nfor the most part... \\nthey haven\\'t let me down. \\nWhich is why I can\\'t let them down either. Locks can be replaced, \\nbut maybe they shouldn\\'t. \\nI know I hurt you, Tony. \\nI guess I thought by not telling you about your parents... \\nPage 49/52\\nI was sparing you... \\nbut I can see now that \\nI was really sparing myself. \\nAnd I\\'m sorry. \\nHopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords. I really do. \\nI know you\\'re doing what you believe in, and that\\'s all any of us can do. That\\'s all any of us should. \\nPriority call from Secretary Ross. There\\'s been a breach at the Raft prison. Yeah, put him through. \\nTony, we have a problem. \\n- Uh, please hold. \\n- No, don\\'t. \\nSo no matter what... \\nI promise you... \\nif you need us... \\nif you need me... \\nI\\'ll be there. \\nYou sure about this? \\nI can\\'t trust my own mind. \\nSo, until they figure out \\nhow to get this stuff out of my head... I think going back under \\nis the best thing. \\nFor everybody. \\nThank you for this. \\nYour friend and my father... \\nthey were both victims. \\nIf I can help one of them find peace... You know, if they find out he\\'s here... they\\'ll come for him. \\nLet them try. \\nHey, shady baby \\nI\\'m hot like the prodigal son \\nPick a petal \\nEenie, meenie, miney, moe \\nAnd flower \\nYou\\'re the chosen one \\nWell, your left hand\\'s free \\nAnd your right\\'s in a grip \\nWith another left hand \\nPage 50/52\\nWatch his right hand slip \\nTowards his gun \\nOh, no \\nI tackle, we tussle \\nOh, my days, we\\'re rolling \\nMy right hand\\'s gripped on his Colt Single Action Army \\nOh, no \\nWell, your left hand\\'s free \\nAnd your right\\'s in a grip \\nWith another left hand \\nWatch his right hand slip \\nTowards his gun \\nOh, no \\nN-E-O, O-M-G \\nGee whiz \\nGirl, you\\'re the one for me \\nThough your man\\'s bigger than I am Oh, my days \\nHe disagrees \\nOh, no \\nSpeak easy \\nWell, my left hand\\'s free \\nOh \\nWell, my left hand\\'s free \\nOh \\nWell, my left hand\\'s free \\nOh \\nOh, no \\nHey, shady baby \\nI\\'m hot like the prodigal son \\nPick a petal \\nEenie, meenie, miney, moe \\nAnd flower \\nYou\\'re the chosen one \\nWell, your left hand\\'s free \\nOh \\nWell, my left hand\\'s free \\nOh \\nWell, my left hand\\'s free \\nOh \\nWell, my left hand\\'s free \\nOh \\nWell, my left hand\\'s free \\nPage 51/52\\nOh \\nOh, no \\nWho was it?

His P.O.V. of  the moon makes it look FRACTURED by the cracked glass. \\nRACK FOCUS to Vanessa’s REFLECTION. She, too, looks  \\nfractured. Wade’s eyes well with TEARS at the sight of her.

Tonight, a bit thin.  \\nWADE is bellied up to the bar, disheveled, unkempt, and distraught. WEASEL leans in:  \\nWEASEL : \\nJesus. Someone needs a blow-job and ashower.

Forty \\none confirmed kills? \\nWADE: \\n(bitter) \\nOne every seven weeks. Same rate most \\nfolks get a hair-cut. \\nWade grabs the recruiter’s drink and throws it back. \\nWADE (CONT’D) \\nTo wash the taste out.

Her fingers areinterlaced in his, once perfectly manicured nails chewed tothe quick. \\nVanessa is also wearing a SOMBRERO, and ANXIETY on her face.

Sorry - ¿El Cáncer? \\nELDERLY MAN : \\nStage four. \\nPage 46/119\\nWADE : \\nToughest part of the Tour de France. \\nVANESSA : \\nVery hilly. \\nThe elderly man gestures to the souvenir PATCHES sewn ontoWade’s ‘HELLO KITTY’ DUFFEL: CHECHNYA.

Cash.  \\nAmericano. \\n(CONTINUED) \\n Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 45. \\n24 CONTINUED: \\nWade grows upset as the mother counts out hard-earned CASH.

He stares back, eyes hard, then gets up and lays a crumpled dollar on the counter.

The nurse motions for Mrs. Solomon  to stay in the waiting room. \\nABE : \\n(to Wade and Vanessa) \\nHandsome couple. Good luck to you two. \\nAbe drops his WORRY BEADS. Wade bends to retrieve them, then  stands with effort and gently hands them to Abe. \\nWADE : \\nGood luck to you, Pops. \\nWade sits back down, and his eyes find the LITTLE BOY: his  SUNKEN EYES. His MISSING HAIR. His LOLLIPOP, CLUTCHED like  the richest treasure. \\nWade turns to look at Vanessa, who’s also staring at the boy. Even though Vanessa is healthy, she, too, looks sick. No  makeup. Dirty hair. Dark circles under her eyes. When she  looks at Wade, it’s clear she, not he, most needs comfort. Wade pulls Vanessa close and strokes her hair with atrembling hand. Abe disappears. Wade watches with a newlydark look of suspicion.  Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 46. \\n25 INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY - PAST 25 \\nABE lies shirtless on an UNSANITARY operating table, a trayof RUSTY surgical KNIVES nearby. \\nA MAN with a pock-marked face stands over him in a white labcoat with blue-stitched cursive writing: ‘Dr. Delgado.’ \\nDOCTOR : \\nBuenos días, Señor Abe. \\n‘Doctor’ Delgado pokes and prods with his fingers, as ifAbe’s mid-section is Play-Doh. \\nDOCTOR (CONT’D) \\nVoy a llegar dentro de tu cuerpo. \\nABE : \\nI’m sorry. No hablo español, doc. \\nThe doctor’s other hand dips below the table, comes updripping with something bloody.

Señor Abe, you arecured. \\nThe doctor holds SMELLING SALTS under Abe’s nose. His closed  eyes jerk open to see the doctor’s gloved hand CLUTCHING ahuge, bloody ‘TUMOR.’ \\nAbe pushes himself up, peers down at his bloody abdomen with  awe. The doctor wipes the blood away and helps him up. \\nABE : \\n(tearing up) \\nThank you. I owe you my life. \\nAs Abe shuffles out, the doctor turns away to dump the‘tumor’ in the trash and wash his bloody hands in a basin. \\nDOCTOR : \\n(over his shoulder) \\n¡Proximo!

How... \\nlong... you standing there, Señor? \\nWade walks slowly TOWARD the doctor, who steps out nervouslyfrom BEHIND his table. The two stand face-to-face. Wade  \\nsmiles... angles his foot UNDER the OPERATING TABLE... \\n...and uses it to SLIDE something out from underneath thetable: a BUCKET of BLOODY CHICKEN GIZZARDS that double as  \\nremoved ‘tumors.’ Wade’s RAGE seems to grow by the INSTANT. \\nWADE : \\nLong enough... \\nDelgado senses he is suddenly in danger, picks up a rustySCALPEL from his tray. Wade moves toward him. DelgadoLUNGES, He STABS WADE in the shoulder, then RUNS. \\nWade TACKLES him. In Wade’s weakened state, the fightbecomes an intense STRUGGLE. The two FALL and WRESTLE. The  \\nBUCKET of GIZZARDS overturns. They roll around in slop. \\nThe doctor squirms out of Wade’s grasp and crawls into thehallway.

VANESSA smiles warmly/sadly at thelittle BOY, who is unwrapping his CHUPACHUP. \\nSuddenly... a SCREAM and cries for help in Spanish. The  \\nNURSE and an ALARMED VANESSA rush toward the shouting. \\n27 INT. HALLWAY - SUNSET - PAST 27 \\nAt last, WADE’s fury has overcome his physical weakness. He  straddles the DOCTOR’s CHEST. His expression is that of aman who’s LOSING his SHIT. \\nWade RAISES THE SCALPEL, SLASHES at the doctor’s throat, then  STABS him in the heart. The doctor writhes, spasms, gurgles, and falls still. \\nChest heaving, Wade raises his head to see... at the FAR ENDof the HALL: VANESSA - frozen, TERRIFIED. A blood-soaked Wade locks eyeswith her and swims back up into SANITY... ‘What have I done?’ \\nThis is a horrific glimpse into Wade’s murderous past... \\n...and the look on Vanessa’s face is one of HORROR and PAIN.

GUADALAJARA STREET - SUNSET - PAST 29 \\nWADE leans against a wall, gasping for breath. He looks back  toward her voice, face a mask of pain. Instead of seekingher... he melts into the busy street. \\n30 EXT. DEADPOOL’S LAIR - DAY 30 \\nDEADPOOL trudges to his FRONT DOOR. He speaks to theAUDIENCE: \\nDEADPOOL: \\nSome kind of anger can’t be managed. \\nLike the kind where your year-long plan \\nends with the wrong guy getting \\ndismembered! That said... when it comes \\nPage 50/119\\ntime to licking wounds... there’s no \\nplace like home, and I share that home \\nwith someone you met, the old blind lady \\nfrom the laundromat, Al.

Or animated. \\nPage 51/119\\nRECRUITER : \\nI hope you enjoy your stay. \\nThe ‘Workshop,’ as this old warehouse is affectionatelycalled, has been converted into a working LABORATORY. \\nWade is wheeled through a vast room containing rows ofindividual ‘tents,’ each containing a SUBJECT. Wade’s eyesDART to helpless SILHOUETTES. We hear WHISPERS, WHIMPERS, MOANS. \\nA FELLOW PATIENT, a pathetic, terrified little man namedCUNNINGHAM, is wheeled past Wade, restrained on anotherSTRETCHER. Cunningham briefly locks eyes with Wade, but  \\nquickly moves on by. \\nWade can’t help but be alarmed by the TERROR in Cunningham’s  eyes. \\nThe tents are illuminated by BLINDING overhead lights. Wade  spies GRUESOMELY INTIMIDATING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. \\nWade is wheeled into the tent that’s his new home. The  \\nFIGURE who was pushing Wade DUMPS him onto a CHROME OPERATINGTABLE and roughly STRAPS him down. \\n(CONTINUED) \\n Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 50. \\n31 CONTINUED: \\nWADE : \\nUm. My first request? A warmer table.  \\n(shivers) \\nAnd warmer hands. \\nWade DOUBLE-TAKES at the sight of the figure above him: \\nANGEL DUST - thirties, female, tall, sexy, athletic - anAmazonian warrior in another age. \\nAngel Dust wheels over a high-tech I.V. DRIP, complete withglass cylindrical tanks housing a glowing, viscous LIQUID. \\nThen she roughly straps Wade’s NECK to the table. Wade  \\nnearly GASPS, the color now officially drained from his face. WADE (CONT’D) \\nEasy! Aren’t you a little strong for alady? I’m calling wang. \\nANGEL DUST : \\nYou’d like that, huh. Welcome to our  \\nlittle hospital. \\nWADE : \\nIt doesn’t look like a hospital. It  \\nPage 52/119\\nlooks like Chlamydia holding still. \\nAn UNLIT MATCHSTICK protrudes from Angel Dust’s teeth - heridea of a TOOTHPICK. \\nWADE (CONT’D) \\nOral fixation? \\nANGEL DUST : \\nShut. The fuck. Up. \\nAngel Dust places a FINGER on Wade’s FOREHEAD and SHOVES hishead back against the table - BANG - pinning it there. \\nAJAX (O.S.) \\nPatience, Angel. All in good time. \\nEnter AJAX, whom we know as the PRISONER from the RAFT with  whom we’ve seen Deadpool tangle in the PRESENT. This is the  first Ajax and Wade have met. \\nWADE : \\nCan I expect turndown serv-? \\nAjax nods to Angel Dust. BOOM! She GAGS Wade with SURGICAL  TUBING, then wraps it around the TABLE, immobilizing hishead. (CONTINUED) \\n Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 51. \\n31 CONTINUED: \\nAJAX : \\nYou’re a talker. \\nWade’s eyes are wider than ever. WTF? \\nAJAX (CONT’D) \\n(disarmingly matter-of-fact) \\nMr. Wilson, my name is Ajax. I managethe Workshop. My ‘welcome’ speech usedto be full of euphemisms like ‘You mayfeel some discomfort.’ But I’ve grownblunt. \\nAjax unsheathes an I.V. NEEDLE. Angel Dust up-tilts thetable 45 degrees, then readies a holographic monitor. \\nAJAX (CONT’D) \\nThe Workshop is not a government program. \\nIt’s a private institution tasked withturning reclamation projects likeyourself into men of extraordinaryabilities. I’m about to remake yourlife. But if you think cancer curespainlessly, you’re wrong. If you thinksuper-human powers are acquiredpainlessly, you’re wrong. Ajax touches Wade with the I.V. NEEDLE, pressing here andthere, not QUITE hard enough to break skin. At last, he  \\nlocates the subclavian vein. Wade flinches. \\nPage 53/119\\nAJAX (CONT’D) \\nWe’re injecting you with a serum thatactivates mutant genes. For it to work,  \\nwe need to subject you to extreme stress. \\nThe liquid glows FLUORESCENT through Wade’s white skin as itpumps into the pulmonary highway. \\nAJAX (CONT’D) \\nYou’ve heard the whole make-an-omelette,  \\nbreak-some-eggs bit? \\n(Wade blinks) \\nI’m about to hurt you, Wade. The kind of  \\nhurt I can’t describe and you can’tprepare for. It’s cruel stuff. And  there’s no way out for you. No secret  \\nyou can tell me. No soft spot in me toappeal to. \\nWade stares at them in shock. \\n(CONTINUED) \\n Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 52. \\n31 CONTINUED: \\nANGEL DUST : \\nWhat, you expected Weapon X? \\nAjax starts to TURN AWAY, but stops. \\nAJAX : \\nOne more thing. What’s the ad? ‘I’m not  \\njust the president. I’m a client?’ I’ve  \\nbeen through this procedure myself. It  \\nmade me stronger. It also scorched mynerve endings. So I no longer feel pain. \\nIn fact... \\n(smiles) \\nI no longer feel anything. \\nWade reacts by SAYING something - made UNINTELLIGIBLE by thesurgical tubing. Ajax nods to Angel Dust, who slices theSURGICAL TUBING, SNAPPING it away and FREEING Wade to TALK. \\nWADE : \\nSomething in your teeth. \\nAjax smiles WITHOUT opening his mouth, signals Angel Dust. She slams Wade’s head back again as he turns to leave. \\nBefore he exits, Ajax hesitates, can’t help but check histeeth in one of the surgical mirrors. \\nWADE (O.S.) (CONT’D) \\nPage 54/119\\nMade you look! Hey, is Ajax your realname? ‘Cause it sounds suspiciously made  \\nup. What’s it really? Steve? Mark?  \\nTrevor? Kyle? \\n(E.T. voice) \\nElliot?  \\nWe hear LAUGHS from nearby tents. Wade is now playing for anaudience. \\nAJAX : \\nJoke away. The one thing that neversurvives this place is a sense of humor. \\nWADE : \\nWe’ll see! \\nAJAX : \\n(to Angel Dust) \\nAll yours. \\nWe re-take WADE’S P.O.V. as Angel Dust, chewing her  \\nmatchstick, re-enters frame above him, smiles, then puncheshim in the face.

Here’s the  \\nproblem with round-the-clock torture. \\nYou can’t really step it up from there. \\nAJAX : \\nIs that what you think? \\nWADE : \\nYeah. Francis.

Wade is BOUND to  \\na HOSPITAL BED that’s ENCASED in a large CAPSULE ofPLEXIGLAS. Page 58/119\\nThe top half of the capsule is hinged to one side, OPEN, allowing Angel Dust access to Wade. \\nAjax sits eating a meal from some Tupperware in a nearbychair. \\nAJAX : \\nSeems your genes are as stubborn as you. \\nBut we can still increase your suffering. \\nWe don’t even have a name for this next  \\ntoy. \\nVarious WIRES and TUBES run out of the capsule, connected toOXYGEN TANKS, DIALS, and a MONITOR tracking BRAIN and HEART. \\nAJAX (CONT’D) \\nWe reduce the oxygen in the air to theexact point you feel like you’re  suffocating. \\n(MORE) \\n(CONTINUED) \\n Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 57. \\n35 CONTINUED: \\nAJAX (CONT’D) \\nIf you start to pass out, and your brainwaves slow, we turn up the O2.

This device prolongs that  \\nstress.

You still think we’re  \\nmaking you a super-hero. You.  \\nDishonorable discharge. Beating up pizza  \\nPage 59/119\\nguys. Hip deep in hookers. You’re  \\nnothing. I’d call you an asshole, butI’d have to answer to assholes. Little \\nsecret, Wade. The Workshop doesn’t makesuper-heroes. It makes super-slaves. We’re gonna fit you for a control collarand auction you to the highest bidder. \\n(finishes meal, gets up) \\nWho knows what they’ll force you to do. \\nPut down freedom fighters. Murder  \\ninnocents. Or maybe just mow a lawn or  \\ntwo. \\nANGEL DUST : \\nThere’s a brave face. \\nAjax goes to close the lid. \\nWADE : \\nSeriously. Now you do have something inyour teeth. \\nAJAX : \\nEnjoy the weekend! \\n(CONTINUED) \\n Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 58. \\n35 CONTINUED: \\nAjax swings the capsule CLOSED and LOCKS it. The sound leaks  away until all that’s left is a HISSING SOUND as AJAX hitsBUTTONS to lower O2 LEVELS. \\nWade’s voice drops out as his breathing suddenly grows SHORTand SHALLOW. The oxygen dials fall. His HEART-RATE SOARS. \\nANGEL DUST : \\n(chuckles) \\nHe looks like a turd in a punch-bowl. \\nAJAX : \\n(bright idea) \\nThe ‘Punch-Bowl!’ \\nWade fights off panic. His breaths become desperate GASPS. There’s not enough air to talk, or even SCREAM. \\nDISSOLVE TO: \\n35A INT. WORKSHOP TENT - LATER 35A \\nNight.

Two MEN enter the tent and stand over the PUNCH-BOWL. \\nCLICK. One of the men turns on a surgical light overhead, revealing himself to be a KINDLY-looking DOCTOR, avuncular, thick glasses. Next to him is an ORDERLY. The doctor peersthrough the Punch-Bowl’s lid. He is SURPRISED by what he  \\nsees. He nods to the orderly: ‘Go on, hurry.’ \\nThe orderly quickly unlocks and unlatches the lid, thenswings it OPEN. Air RUSHES INTO the PUNCH-BOWL. The orderlysteps away, leaving the doctor alone in the room. \\nWADE, hidden in darkness, gasps as though surfacing afterbeing held underwater. \\nThe doctor casts a SHADOW over WADE’s face inside. The  \\ndoctor is FASCINATED, ENLIVENED. \\nDOCTOR: \\nMr. Wilson... these results are \\nremarkable. \\nWade takes deep LUNGS-FUL of AIR. \\n(CONTINUED) \\n Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 59. \\n35A CONTINUED: \\nDOCTOR (CONT’D) \\nYour cancer cells are more aggressivethan ever.

They’re no longer destructive, but productive, selectively targeting andreplacing damaged tissue. \\nWADE : \\nThat was a lot of... what’s the word...  \\nsyllables. Are you saying I’m better? \\nDOCTOR : \\nBetter than better. A miracle. \\nWADE : \\nPage 61/119\\n(weak smile) \\nMy Mom used to call me that. \\n(ALT: \\nMe and Jesus.  \\n(beat, to doctor) \\nThank you. I owe you my life. \\nWade grows choked up. The doctor is taken with empathy andaffection. He tenderly brushes the hair off Wade’s forehead, \\nof which the camera catches the tiniest glimpse. Wade’s skin  is not RIGHT somehow. \\nDOCTOR : \\nThere. There. Your journey’s been longand difficult. But you’ve becomesomething extraordinary. Just rest now.  \\nRest. \\nThe doctor slowly exits.

You may be cured, but youstill need to learn to be a better man.  \\nPolite. Respectful. What better way toteach you than to close this lid... andkeep torturing you stupid. \\nAjax SLAMS the lid shut, LATCHES and LOCKS it. The hissing  resumes. Wade’s eyes grow wide. He starts to slip-slidetoward absolute ANGUISH. \\nDEADPOOL (V.O.) \\nPage 62/119\\nIf you think I’m losing my marbles ‘causeI can’t breathe. You’re only half right. \\nAjax appears to be looking in at Wade.

Through a fog of miseryWade sees Ajax staring down, watching him, drinking in hispain. \\n41 INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT - PAST 41 \\nBack in the Punch-Bowl, Wade OPENS his MOUTH... within which  he was HIDING a SINGLE MATCHSTICK, clenched carefully - dryly -between his teeth.  \\nHe inhales... then SPITS OUT the match into his waiting PALM. Finally, he STRIKES it against the side of the Punch Bowl. Wade aims the now FLAMING match toward the tiny HOLE throughwhich OXYGEN flows. The match is quickly burning down. Will  \\nit reach the hole before it snuffs out? \\nAt the last possible moment... \\n...the flame COMBUSTS the stream of oxygen, IGNITING it...

Then the TANK EXPLODES. \\nThe BLOWS APART. The hospital bed SNAPS in TWO. \\nOut in the ward, the FIREBALL curls outward, spreading fromTENT to TENT. BOOM! BOOM! Other flammable tanks DETONATE.  \\nThe tents GO UP like ROMAN CANDLES. It’s now MASS CHAOS.  ALARMS BLARE. Flames LEAP. Smoke BILLOWS. Patients FLEE.  A CURTAIN of FIRE suddenly DISPERSES, replaced by billowy WHITE SMOKE from an OVER-SIZED CHROME FIRE EXTINGUISHER... \\n...held by AJAX, who STRIDES grimly toward Wade’s tent. He  throws back the burning fabric...  \\n...and nearly EATS an OXYGEN TANK. He BLOCKS it at the last moment with his FIRE EXTINGUISHER. CLANG. \\nOn the other end of the oxygen tank, WIND-MILLING it withunbridled FEROCITY, is WADE.  \\nPage 70/119\\nWADE and AJAX SWING the oxygen tank and fire extinguisher like modern day CLUBS, trying to take off each other’s heads.  CLANG! BANG! BAM! The tanks COLLIDE in mid-air.  \\nAjax’s fingers CRUNCH between metal. He doesn’t even feel it. \\nWade grabs the HOSE of Ajax’s fire extinguisher, angles itup, and gets his finger on the TRIGGER.  \\nThe extinguisher BLASTS. Ajax is momentarily BLINDED.  \\nWade brings the oxygen tank down like a LUMBERJACK’S AXE. Ajax BLOCKS it, but is driven to his KNEES.  \\nWade’s eyes are lit with fire. DOWN the tank COMES, again and AGAIN. Ajax takes his own fire extinguisher to the CHIN. Then catches a BLOW from the oxygen TANK to his TEMPLE.  \\nThe extinguisher goes FLYING. Wade swings the OXYGEN TANK AGAIN, but against all odds, AJAX CATCHES it and SLAMS itback into Wade’s NOSE. CRUNCH. \\n(CONTINUED) \\n Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 69. \\n41 CONTINUED: \\nAjax rises to his feet, and the two grip OPPOSITE SIDES ofthe OXYGEN TANK, GRAPPLING with every ounce of strength. \\nWade sweeps Ajax’s feet and he topples over backwards, Wadeon top of him. Wade lifts the heavy tank and slams it intohis face. Once. Twice. Three times. CRACK. \\nAs he’s about to finish the job Ajax smiles, blood bubblingfrom his smashed lips. \\nAJAX : \\nYou can’t kill me, Wade. I’m the onlyone who can fix that ugly mug. Wade looks torn as his rage gives way to something like hope. He tosses the tank away. \\nWADE : \\nThen time to make me me again. \\nA scream of terror behind Wade makes Wade turn. \\nCUNNINGHAM (O.S.)  \\nWade! Help! Wade! \\nWade looks through the smoke and flame and spies a helplessCunningham lying in the flaming wreckage. \\nWADE : \\nFuck! \\nWade drops Ajax and SPRINTS to Cunningham, starts dragging atthe WRECKAGE Page 71/119\\ntrapping him, when... SLICE! A long piece ofsheared REBAR THRUSTS CLEAN THROUGH his CHEST from BEHIND.  \\nThe force sends the spear DEEP into the wooden floor beams, pinning Wade like an insect in an entomologist’s display. In a grand display of strength, AJAX BENDS the end of therebar to keep Wade pinned... then walks around and squatsdown into Wade’s eye line, wearing a triumphant sneer. \\nAJAX : \\nSay it. ‘Francis.’ \\nBlood dribbles from Wade’s mouth as he tries in vain to pushhimself off the bloody spike of metal. Ajax rises, scans theburning workshop with a scowl - clearly a lost cause - andturns to leave. \\nCunningham screams again as the flames near him. Gruntingwith the pain and effort Wade tries to push himself off thespike. \\n(CONTINUED) \\n Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 70. \\n41 CONTINUED: \\nHis hands slip on the blood-slick metal, and he cannot freehimself. His VOLTRON RING lies on the floor next to him. \\nWade and Cunningham share a last look. Cunningham clamps his  jaws shut, fighting the agony. \\nCREAK... CRACKLE... the ROOF COLLAPSES, BURYING BOTH OF THEM.  And we... CUT TO BLACK. \\nFADE UP ON: \\n42 INT. WORKSHOP - DAY 42 \\nMorning’s first sunlight. WADE’s VOLTRON RING lies  \\nCOMPLETELY MELTED in the DEBRIS. The camera follows it to  Wade’s hand... then up his arm to his FACE. \\nWADE’s eyelids flutter, and he COMES TO. He is naked, his  hospital gown burned away. We see BLACKENED SLUDGE, SOOT,  charred remains. The melted and scorched metal rod next to  him. \\nWade slowly realizes where he is and what happened. He  \\nreaches down to his stomach wound... WHICH HAS MIRACULOUSLY  HEALED. Wade sits up, stunned. \\nDEADPOOL (V.O.) \\nI didn’t just get the cure to El Cáncer. \\nI got the cure to everything. \\nV43 EXT.

Among them, we REVEAL: WADE, dressed in ill-fitting pants and a hoodie. He is a  TRAIN-WRECK, scarred face on display to the world for thefirst time. He looks purposeful, but tentative, walking behind Vanessa, GAINING on her. \\nANGLE ON: \\nA BOY goes by on his bike, trying hard not to gape.

Wade stops, too, suddenly paralyzed, as the moment to face Vanessa arrives. \\nAs he hesitates, torn with anguish, the WHISPERS seem togrow, rising in volume until they become deafening: \\nWHISPER 2 (O.S.) \\nOh, my, god, that is so fucking gnarly. \\nWHISPER 3 (O.S.) \\nI just lost my appetite. \\nWade spins, trying to see where the voices are coming from. Nowhere... everywhere. The WHISPERS crescendo, now more in  Wade’s mind than in reality. \\nHe turns back to Vanessa, his face a mask of fear and pain... just as she disappears into her apartment building. The  closing glass door reveals his own HIDEOUS REFLECTION STARINGBACK AT HIM. \\nDEADPOOL: \\nIn the whole wide world, there’s nothing \\nas ugly... \\n(beat) \\n...as fear. \\nHe gives up on his mission, backing away from his reflection, Vanessa, his old life.

Cassian Andor appears from behind a wall and approaches the meeting. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nSENATOR MON MOTHMA: This is Captain Cassian Andor, Rebel Intelligence. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nfather? \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nImperial war machine? \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nagree to meet you, if you came as a friend. \\nGENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: We’re up against the clock here, girl, so if there’s Page 7/56\\nnothing to talk about, we’ll just put you back where we found you. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nBut I’ve no idea where he is. I haven’t seen him in years. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nwe need is someone who gets us through the door without being killed. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nSENATOR MON MOTHMA: Yes, but Saw Gerrera’s an extremist. He’s been fighting on his own since he broke with the Rebellion. His militancy has caused the Alliance a great many problems. We have no choice now but to try to mend that broken trust. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nbeing held by Saw Gerrera. He’s claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon with the power to destroy entire planets. The pilot says he was sent by your father. \\nSENATOR MON MOTHMA: We need to stop this weapon before it is finished. GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Captain Andor’s mission is to authenticate the pilot’s story and then, if possible, find your father. \\nSENATOR MON MOTHMA: It appears he is critical to the development of this superweapon. Given the gravity of the situation and your history with Saw,we’re hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the Senate for testimony. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nSENATOR MON MOTHMA: We’ll make sure you go free. \\nEXT. MASSASSII REBEL BASE (Outside the temple) \\nJyn and Cassian approach a vessel stationed on a landing pad. General Draven calls out to Cassian from a distance. \\nGENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Captain Andor! \\nCassian approaches him, leaving Jyn behind. She climbs into a U-Wing sitting on the landing pad and sees the droid she\\'s been rescued by. INT. U-WING (Inside a U-Wing) \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I’m K-2SO. I’m a reprogrammed Imperial droid. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I see the Council is sending you with us to Jedha. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: That is a bad idea. I think so, and so does Cassian. Page 8/56\\nWhat do I know? My specialty is just strategic analysis. \\nOutside the ship, Draven confronts Cassian while Jyn isn\\'t there. GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Galen Erso is vital to the Empire’s weapon program. Forget what you heard in there, there will be no extraction. You find him, you kill him. Then and there. \\nINT. U-WING (Inside the U-Wing) \\nCassian climbs inside the U-Wing and looks at its passengers. CASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nIt’s a by-product of the reprogram. \\nJyn loads a blaster and spins it in her hands. K-2SO looks at her, alarmed. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Why does she get a blaster, and I don’t? Cassian turns around sharply. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I find that answer vague and unconvincing. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCassian sighs and hops into the pilot seat. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: You’re letting her keep it? Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you? It’s high. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: It’s very high. \\nThe U-Wing takes off and leaves Yavin 4. \\nPARTISAN BASE ON JEDHA \\nThe camera slowly moves up to reveal Saw Gerrera, a man-machine with a respirator and a prosthetic leg. Bodhi is brought before him and he still has the sack on his head. \\nPage 9/56\\nSAW GERRERA: \\npilot. Local boy, huh? \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nEdrio passes Saw a holopad that had been taken from Bodhi earlier. EDRIO TWO TUBES: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nmyself. I defected, I defected. \\nSAW GERRERA: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nhave time for this! I have to speak to Saw Gerrera before it’s too late. The sack is pulled off of Bodhi’s head. He shakes his head and blinks at the sight of Saw. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\ngave it to them, they did not find it! I gave it to them. Galen Erso. He told me to find you. \\nSAW GERRERA: \\nSaw nods to Edrio and Bodhi visibly begins panicking, \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nHis voice is muffled and confused as the sack is pulled over his head again and he is dragged away. \\nSTAR DESTROYER \"EXECUTRIX\" (A Star Destroyer overlooking the construction of the Death Star) \\nA TIE fighter flies towards what looks like the stars but reveals itself as an Imperial Star Destroyer. Behind the ISD, an even more massive structure emerges from the darkness - the Death Star. \\nImperial officers sit in command pits on both sides of the bridge. Director Krennic approaches Grand Moff Tarkin who is standing with his back to the camera as he watches the construction of the Death Star. Tarkin turns around to face the camera. \\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedha, Director Krennic. After so many setbacks and delays, and now this. We’ve heard word of rumors circulating through the city. Apparently you’ve lost a rather talkative cargo pilot. If the Senate gets wind of our project, countless systems will flock to the Rebellion. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: When the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin, the Senate will be of little concern. \\nPage 10/56\\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: When has become now, Director Krennic. The Emperor will tolerate no further delay, you have made time an ally of the Rebellion. I suggest, we solve both problems simultaneously with an immediate test of the weapon. Failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: I will not fail. \\nKrennic turns around and signals to his bodyguards to flank him as he leaves. Tarkin watches the superlaser being set into place, completing the Death Star. \\nInside Jyn’s dream, she sees herself as a little girl. Her father is still an Imperial officer on Coruscant. He is drinking and laughing together with a younger Krennic. She is peering into the room and her father walks over to her and picks her up, placing her in bed. There are blurred visions of her mother, Lyra. \\nGALEN ERSO: \\nalways protect you. Stardust. Don’t ever change. \\nLYRA ERSO: \\nLYRA ERSO: \\nJyn wakes up inside the U-Wing and blinks as Cassian speaks up. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThe U-Wing lands in front of a view of the Holy City of Jedha with a Star Destroyer hovering in the sky just above it. Multiple smaller shuttles and TIE fighters are going back and forth between the destroyer and the city. The two rebels and the droid disembark and get on the ground to look at the city through binoculars. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nfind your father. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nbeen attacking the cargo shipments. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nthey can get. We wondered why they were stripping the temple, now we know.It’s the fuel for the weapon. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO], coming out of the U-Wing: The weapon your father’s Page 11/56\\nbuilding. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Are you talking about me? \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I can blend in. I’m an Imperial droid. This city is under Imperial occupation. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nwant to put a hole in your head. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I’m surprised you’re so concerned with my safety. Jyn walks past him, slamming a bag into his hands as she walks by. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nK-2SO drops the bag on the ground as they leave. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Doesn’t sound so bad to me. \\nINT. PARTISAN BASE (In the Partisan base.) \\nBodhi is strapped to a chair. A strange bloblike alien with long tentacles emerges from the darkness. Bodhi shivers and tries moving back, but fails. He watches in horror as the alien approaches. \\nSAW GERRERA: \\nhave you really brought me, cargo pilot? Bor Gullet will know the truth. The unfortunate side effect, is that one tends to lose one’s mind. Bor Gullet’s tentacles begin to wrap around Bodhi and stroke his head, reaching into his thoughts. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\n(In the Holy City of Jedha) \\nCassian and Jyn walk through a crowd in a narrow street. Jyn accidentally bumps into Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba, who turn to them, annoyed. DR. CORNELIUS EVAZAN: Hey, you just watch yourself. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCome on. Come on. \\nA squad of stormtroopers is seen distributing holopads with the face of Bodhi Rook on them and questioning citizens. \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\ninformation of the location of this missing cargo pilot. A reward of 600 credits for the information shall be awarded. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nPage 12/56\\ngone missing. His sister will be looking for him. The temple’s been destroyed but she’ll be there waiting. We’ll give her your name and hope that gets us a meeting with Saw. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThe squad of stormtroopers approaches a citizen and is about to search their house. The citizen protests inaudibly in an alien language. \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nsome identification. Check inside. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nShe notices Chirrut Imwe, blind and dressed in monk-like robes, sitting beside the street. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nothers be with you. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCassian walks off, leaving Jyn standing there. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nothers be with you. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nfuture? (Jyn turns around and comes closer, alarmed and interested). Yes, I’m speaking to you. I am Chirrut Îmwe. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nkyber crystals? \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCassian returns and finds her talking to Chirrut. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nCassian pulls Jyn away as Chirrut speaks. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nPage 13/56\\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nTemple. But there’s nothing left to protect, so now they’re just causing trouble for everybody. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCassian and Jyn push quickly throught the crowd when they notice a heavily guarded Imperial transport move along the street. Jyn looks up to see armed people waiting on the roofs and several more hiding in the pathways next to the main street. She looks at Cassian nervously. \\nSTORMTROOPER 1: \\nA partisan throws a thermal detonator underneath the tank accompanying the transport. The tank explodes and Partisans begin fighting the stormtroopers. Chaos begins as people run away and firing begins. Jyn and Cassian hide behind a wall, blasters ready. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nSTORMTROOPER 1: \\nSTORMTROOPER 2: \\nSTORMTROOPER 1: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nJyn sees a small child standing under a tall tower, crying. She runs to save her and covers her with her body as the two fall to the ground. A partisan shoots the stormtroopers from the top of the tower. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThe child’s mother quickly arrives and takes her daughter. MOTHER: \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nCITIZEN: \\nA stormtrooper aims a rocket at the tower and fires. Jyn barely makes it out and runs to cover. Next to the ruins of the tank, partisans gather to \\nPage 14/56\\ntake out something from the transport. \\nPARTISAN: \\nkyber. Come on! \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThey are surprised by an Imperial droid that looks exactly like K-2SO. Jyn shoots it and it falls to the ground. K-2SO walks out from behind it. K-2SO looks startled. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Did you know that wasn’t me? \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: You did, but I thought it was boring, and you were in trouble. There are a lot of explosions for two people blending in. A grenade sails towards K-2SO, but he catches it without looking and throws it backwards towards a group of stormtroopers. \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nThe grenade explodes, killing the entire squad of stormtroopers. Jyn and Cassian exchange looks. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: You’re right, I should just wait on the ship. Cassian, Jyn and K-2SO walk into a clearing with multiple stormtroopers. \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: These are prisoners. \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I am taking them... to imprison them. In prison. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO slaps Cassian. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Quiet! And there’s a fresh one if you mouth off again! \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: That’s okay. If you could just point me in the right direction, I can take them, I’m sure. I’ve taken them this far… The stormtroopers grab Jyn and Cassian and cuff them to take them away. The two struggle to break free. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nPage 15/56\\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Wait! \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nWe need to check your diagnostics. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Diagnostics? I’m capable of running my own diagnostics, thank you very much. \\nChirrut emerges from a doorway, drawing the attention of stormtroopers, and walks towards them, tapping his staff on the ground. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nForce is with me, and I am with the Force. And I fear nothing, for all is as the Force wills it. \\nSTORMTROOPER 1: \\nSTORMTROOPER 2: \\nSTORMTROOPER 1: \\nSTORMTROOPER 2: \\nChirrut stops, listening closely to the stormtroopers’ movements. As they begin firing, he waits for the right moment and springs into action, easily beating up the stormtroopers. He is impossible to hit and dodges every shot directed at him, covering himself with other \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nChirrut knocks down the last stormtrooper, but many more surround him. Suddenly, rapid blaster fire kills all the stormtroopers. It has come from Chirrut’s friend, Baze Malbus. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCassian, Jyn and K-2SO emerge from a hiding spot. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Clear of hostiles! \\nBaze aims his blaster at K-2SO at the sight of an Imperial droid. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: One hostile! \\nJyn jumps out in front of K-2SO with her arms in the air. JYN ERSO: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nPage 16/56\\nK-2SO removes their handcuffs. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Cassian, I’m sorry about the slap. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO leaves obediently. Cassian turns to Baze, rubbing his wrists.  CASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nfool. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nBAZE ÎMWE: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nThe Partisans suddenly surround the group. The rebels are disarmed and handcuffed again. \\nEDRIO TWO TUBES: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nGerrera. \\nEDRIO TWO TUBES: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nEDRIO TWO TUBES: \\nSacks are put over everyone’s heads. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nINT. PARTISAN BASE (Inside the prison cells in the Partisan base.) Chirrut, Baze and Cassian are thrown into a cell all together. In the next cell is Bodhi Rook, silently staring into space. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\none with the Force and the Force is with me. \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nPage 17/56\\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nMalbus was once the most devoted Guardian of us all. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\npriorities. \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\none. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nsense that you carry yours wherever you go. \\nOutside of the prison, Jyn is taken to meet Saw Gerrera in his command room. \\nSAW GERRERA: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nSAW GERRERA: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nblaster and told me to wait in a bunker until daylight.

Did you come here to kill me? There’s not much of me left. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nmessage about a weapon. I guess they think by sending me you might actually help them out. \\nSAW GERRERA: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nThe rest of you can do what you want. \\nSAW GERRERA: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nWhatever it is you’re calling yourself these days? All it’s ever brought me is pain. \\nSAW GERRERA: \\ngalaxy? \\nJYN ERSO: \\nSAW GERRERA: \\nThe two walk towards a holopad lying on the floor. \\nSwitches to shot of Jedha City. The Star Destroyer is seen leaving the city, followed by numerous TIE fighters and smaller craft. The citizens look up in surprise as they hear its engines whirring to life. INT. DEATH STAR (On the Death Star) \\nGrand Moff Tarkin and Director Krennic stand in the control room in front of a giant screen with the city of Jedha pictured on it. \\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: The Emperor is awaiting my report. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: One had hoped that he and Lord Vader might have been here for such an occasion. \\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: And I thought it prudent to save you from any Page 19/56\\npotential embarrassment. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Your concern is hardly warranted. GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: If saying it would only make it so. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: All Imperial forces have been evacuated, and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon. \\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: That won’t be necessary. We need a statement, not a manifesto. The Holy City will be enough for the day. \\nKRENNIC: \\nGunners get in their positions and prepare to fire. \\nCAPTAIN DUNSTIG PTERRO: Sir, we’re in position, ready to... DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Fire! \\nPterro walks off to give the command to his officers. \\nCAPTAIN DUNSTIG PTERRO: Commence primary ignition. \\nINT. PARTISAN BASE (In the Partisan prison) \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBaze looks through the hole in the wall and sees Bodhi. BAZE MALBUS: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nBaze starts trying to break the bars separating the two cells. CASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCassian tries to talk to Bodhi in a calmer voice, but Bodhi keeps staring into space and mumbling. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nshuttle pilot?

A gunner raises his hand and drops it as a signal. A bright array of lights comes on across the control panel. The Death Star eclipses the sun over Jedha. A blinding green ray emerges from the reactor as two gunners manning it turn away to cover their eyes. \\nINT. PARTISAN BASE (In the Partisan base) \\nSAW GERRERA: \\nThe holoprojector lights up and a hologram of Galen Erso appears. \\nGALEN ERSO: \\nchance to save the Alliance. Perhaps there’s a chance to explain myself and, though I don’t dare hope for too much, a chance for Jyn, if she’s alive, if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately I’ve missed her. Jyn, my Stardust, I can’t imagine what you think of me. When I was taken, I faced some bitter truths. I was told that, soon enough, Krennic would have you as well. As time went by, I knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you. I knew if I refused to work, if I took my own life, it would only be a matter of time before Krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project. So I did the one thing that nobody expected: I lied. I learned to lie. I played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work. I made myself indispensable, and all the while I laid the groundwork of my revenge. We call it the Death Star. There is no better name. And the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed. I’ve placed a weakness deep within the system. A flaw so small and powerful, they’ll never find it. But, Jyn. Jyn, if you’re listening My beloved, so much of my life has been wasted. I try to think of you only in the moments when I’m strong, because the pain of not having you with me Your mother. Our family. The pain of that loss is so overwhelming I risk failing even now. It’s just so hard not to think of you. Think of where you are. My Stardust. Saw, the reactor module, that’s the key. That’s the place I’ve laid my trap. It’s well hidden and unstable, one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station. \\nPage 21/56\\nThe Death Star blasts the Holy City of Jedha, vaporising it in an instant. \\nGALEN ERSO: \\nDeath Star to find the reactor. I know there’s a complete engineering archive in the data vault at the Citadel Tower on Scarif. Any pressurized explosion to the reactor module will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the entire station... \\nThe hologram cuts off because of the earthquake going through the Partisan base due to the Death Star’s fire. Jyn falls to her knees, crying. The partisans guarding the cells scream and scatter, leaving the prisoners behind. The three manage to break the lock and free themselves. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCassian screams into his comlink. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThe camera reveals K-2SO in the U-Wing, staring at the explosion of Jedha. A huge earthquake is lifting rubble high into the air and the shockwave is coming closer to his location. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: There you are. I’m standing by as you requested. Although there’s a problem on the horizon. There is no horizon. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCassian breaks off from the group and runs off. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nBaze walks up to Bodhi\\'s cell. \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nHe aims his blaster at Bodhi. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nHe fires but the blaster hits the cell door, freeing Bodhi. \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCassian finds Jyn with Saw in the control room.

Saw limps over to the window, rips his oxygen mask off and silently watches the shockwave. \\nINT. DEATH STAR (On the Death Star) \\nThe staff and officers watch the giant screen in the control room as it shows them the destruction of Jedha City. Krennic looks up in awe with a distant smile. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Oh. It’s beautiful. \\nEXT. PARTISAN BASE (Outside the Partisan base) \\nPartisans are seen running off and screaming as the shockwave comes closer. BAZE MALBUS: \\nCASSIAN: \\nThey all pile into the U-Wing. Bodhi barely makes it on board as they close the door. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO is at the controls, starting the hyperdrive. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I’m not very optimistic about our odds. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I haven’t completed my calculations. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCassian grabs the hyperdrive lever and pulls it sharply. The U-Wing shifts into hyperspace and zips away from Jedha seconds before the rubble from the shockwave destroys the mountain. \\nINT. DEATH STAR (On the Death Star) \\nThe officers talk quietly amongst themselves. Krennic walks by Tarkin, intentionally shoving him in the shoulder. \\nPage 23/56\\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I believe I owe you an apology, Director Krennic. Your work exceeds all expectations. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: And you’ll tell the Emperor as much? GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: That was only an inkling of its destructive potential. \\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I will tell him that I will be taking control over the weapon I first spoke of years ago, effective immediately. Krennic\\'s face turns into a grimace. He starts yelling at Tarkin. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: We stand here amid my achievement, not yours! GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I’m afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: The breaches have been filled, Jedha has been silenced. \\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: You think this pilot acted alone? He was dispatched from the installation on Eadu. Galen Erso’s facility. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: We’ll see about this. \\nKrennic walks off angrily, flanked by his death troopers. Tarkin turns away and pulls a smile. \\nINT. MASSASSII REBEL BASE (In the Rebel base on Yavin 4) \\nRebel communication experts sit at a control panel when one of them receives a message. He turns to General Draven. \\nREBEL: \\nJedha destroyed. Mission target located on Eadu. Please advise. GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Destroyed? Proceed. Tell him my orders still stand.

A ridge separates them from the bright lights of the Imperial facility. \\nINT. MASSASSII REBEL BASE (On Yavin 4) \\nDraven and a rebel try to contact Cassian, but there\\'s no signal. Draven slaps his hand on the table impatiently. \\nGENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Try them again. \\nREBEL: \\nGENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Squadron up, target Eadu. \\nEADU (On Eadu) \\nThe group is trying to fix the U-WIng and get it back in the air, but nothing seems to work. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nare sure of that? \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nleft to steal. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nup and keeps us hidden down here.

We’ll go up Page 27/56\\nthe ridge and check it out. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nthe messenger. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nknows it. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: One blast to the reactor module and the whole system goes down. That’s how you said it. The whole system goes down. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nnow is get a handle on what we’re up against.So, we’re going to go very small and very carefully up the rise and see what’s what. Let’s get out of here. \\nCassian pulls up his hood and disappears in the rain. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nkiller? \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nkill. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: His weapon was in the sniper configuration. Jyn goes pale and dashes off into the rain. \\nEXT. ROCKY RIDGE (On a rocky ridge.) \\nBODHI ROOK: \\ndown there. This way. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThe two go over the ridge overlooking the Imperial facility and Cassian looks for a good spot. \\nINT. U-WING (In the crashed U-Wing.) \\nChirrut is about to climb out of the craft when Baze stops him.

IMPERIAL RESEARCH FACILITY - RIDGE OVERLOOK (On a ridge overlooking the Imperial Research Facility.) \\nCassian and Bodhi finally settle on the ridge and look at the facility through binoculars. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nSwitches to Baze and Chirrut climbing the rocks somewhere in the area. BAZE MALBUS: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nBodhi spots \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nA shuttle zooms overhead, showering water over the two. They duck to avoid being caught in its headlights. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nEXT. IMPERIAL RESEARCH FACILITY - LANDING PLATFORM (On the landing platform in front of the research facility.) \\nKrennic’s shuttle lands and he walks out, flanked by deathtroopers, heading towards a group of stormtroopers and engineers. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Excellent news, Galen. The battle station is complete. You must be very proud. \\nGALEN ERSO: \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Gather your engineers, I have an announcement. Page 29/56\\nSwitches to a shot of Jyn running across the ridge to the giant staircase that goes up to the facility. Back on top, a group of engineers steps forward nervously. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Is that all of them? \\nGALEN ERSO: \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Gentlemen. One of you betrayed the Empire. One of you has conspired with a pilot to send messages to the Rebellion. And I urge that traitor step forward. \\nThe engineers whisper and murmur amongst themselves. Krennic waits. Seeing that no one replies, he gestures to his troopers. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Very well, I’ll consider it a group effort, then. Ready! \\nThe deathtroopers raise their blasters. \\nENGINEER 1: \\nENGINEER 2: \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Aim... and... \\nThe troopers stand with their rifles aimed. \\nENGINEER: \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Fire! \\nJust before the shooting begins, Galen jumps in front of his engineers to stop him. Cassian watches through the scope, aiming at Galen\\'s head, but doesn\\'t shoot. \\nGALEN ERSO: \\nhave nothing to do with it. Spare them. \\nKrennic pauses, looking at him, then turns to his troopers. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Fire! \\nThe engineers scream and fall under the fire. Krennic slaps Galen across the face and he falls to the ground. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: How do I know the weapon is complete? \\nGALEN ERSO: \\nJyn climbs the onto the platform using the ladder and throws a stormtrooper down into the abyss. Cassian watches the scene through his scope and notices her when K-2SO comes in over the comlink. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Cassian. Cassian, can you hear me? \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Affirmative yes, although we have a problem! There’s an Alliance squadron approaching. \\nPage 30/56\\nSwitches to a shot of the canyon, then pans to show an X-WIng squadron approaching the facility. \\nREBEL PILOT: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nplatform! \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Jedha. Saw Gerrera. His band of fanatics. Their Holy City. The last reminder of the Jedi. Gone. \\nGALEN ERSO: \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Now where have I heard that before? K-2SO attempts to reach the rebel base to delay the attack. On Yavin 4, a rebel comms expert calls General Draven to come over. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Relay from Captain Andor. \\nREBEL: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support. Alliance forces onsite. Please confirm. \\nGENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Get the squadron leader on, get him on now! REBEL: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThe rebel squadron begins shooting at the platform and there are several explosions. Baze stares at the attack in horror. On the platform, Krennic and his troops take cover. Jyn sneaks by, unnoticed, and hides behind a container. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Return fire! To your stations! Get our fighters in the air now! \\nIn the chaos, Galen gets up and Jyn runs out towards him. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nKrennic and Galen hear her at the same time and turn around. Krennic pulls out his blaster but before he can shoot, an explosion rocks the platform, knocking all three to the ground. TIE fighters burst out of hangars and engage the X-Wings. There are instantly several casualties on both sides. A few Imperial gunners are seen in an ion cannon as they shoot down a rebel craft. \\nSTORMTROOPER 1: \\nSTORMTROOPER 2: \\nCaptain Pterro runs up to Krennic and helps him up. They begin hurrying to Page 31/56\\nthe shuttle, guarded by death troopers. Switches to Chirrut Îmwe, who breathes in his hand, then pulls a bow off his shoulder, aims and fires blindly at a TIE fighter, shooting it down and directing the falling fighter at the ion cannon, which explodes in flames. \\nCAPTAIN DUNSTIG PTERRO: Director, we need to evacuate. \\nJyn gets up slowly and runs across the burning platform to her father, who has been wounded in the explosion. She kneels by his side, but Krennic\\'s shuttle takes off and pours water all over her. She loses her balance and slides across the platform, almost falling into a hole made by the explosions. She crawls back up and runs to her father, kneeling by his side. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nGALEN ERSO: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nGALEN ERSO: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nGALEN ERSO: \\nHe goes silent and his hand falls from hers as he closes his eyes. Jyn\\'s eyes fill with tears. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nStormtroopers emerge from the facility and are about to begin shooting. \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nCassian\\'s shots take the troopers down and he runs over to Jyn to take her away. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCome on. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nMore stormtroopers appear and the pair ducks into cover as the Page 32/56\\nstormtroopers are mowed down by Baze. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nCassian and Jyn make their way to the stolen Imperial cargo shuttle that hovers in the air, taking down the stormtroopers chasing them. In the cabin, K-2SO and Bodhi pilot the shuttle. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well done. You’re a Rebel now. \\nAll the rebels get into the shuttle and Bodhi helps them up the ramp. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nget out of here. Move, move, move. Okay, K-2, let’s go. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Copy that. \\nThe shuttles takes off as the Imperial facility bursts into flames in the background. It shakes violently in the storm raging over Eadu. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Understood. \\nJyn walks over to Cassian inside the shuttle and confronts him. JYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nI’ve seen it before. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nand you lied about why you went up alone. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nDid I? \\nJYN ERSO: \\nput him at risk. Those were Alliance bombs that killed him! CASSIAN ANDOR: \\nPage 33/56\\nwouldn’t understand that. \\nJYN ERSO: \\na stormtrooper. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\ndeciding when and where we want to care about something. Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you? Some of us live it. I’ve been in this fight since I was 6 years old. You’re not the only one who lost everything. Some of us just decided to do something about it. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nwe’re coming in with a stolen ship. Anybody else? \\nSwitches to a shot of the planet Mustafar, following Krennic\\'s shuttle that is heading to a pyramid-shaped building standing on the edge of a cliff with lava streaming down it. The shuttle lands on a landing platform and the camera switches to a blast door in front of which a hooded man stands. The door slides open and the man walks in to a dark room with Royal Guards by the door and a bacta tank in the center. The man, who is Vader\\'s servant Vanee, kneels down in front of the tank. \\nVANEE: \\nThe bacta fluid level drops and the camera reveals Vader\\'s body suspended in the tank. Vanee turns away as Vader begins breathing. Switches to a grand hallway in the castle. Krennic waits anxiously as the sliding door opens and Vader walks out to meet him. \\nDARTH VADER: \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Lord Vader. \\nDARTH VADER: \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: No. Just pressed for time. There’re a great many things to attend to. \\nDARTH VADER: \\nexplain. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: I’ve delivered the weapon the Emperor requested. I deserve an audience to make certain he understands its remarkable… potential. \\nDARTH VADER: \\nconfirmed. A city destroyed. An Imperial facility openly attacked. Page 34/56\\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: It was Governor Tarkin that suggested the test. \\nDARTH VADER: \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: No, it’s... \\nDARTH VADER: \\nthat Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Yes, my lord. \\nDARTH VADER: \\nEmperor that Galen Erso has not compromised this weapon in any way. Vader starts walking away. Krennic takes a small pause. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: So I’m still in command? You’ll speak to the Emperor about… \\nHe stops abruptly, grabs himself by the collar and falls to his knees, choking. Vader extends a hand and turns around. \\nDARTH VADER: \\nYAVIN 4 \\nThe Rebellion\\'s war council is gathered at a large table in the command centre. Rebel senators and leaders argue while pilot squads and technicians crowd around, murmuring nervously. \\nSENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: We must scatter the fleet. We have no recourse but to surrender. \\nBAIL ORGANA: \\nwe’ve worked so hard to create? \\nADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nSENATOR VASP VASPAR: We joined an Alliance, not a suicide pact! \\nBAIL ORGANA: \\nSENATOR NOWER JEBEL: Gather our forces? General Draven’s already blown up an Imperial base! \\nGENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: A decision needed to be made. \\nSENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: If it’s war you want, you’ll fight alone! SENATOR VASP VASPAR: If that’s the way it’s going, why have an Alliance at all? \\nADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nSENATOR MON MOTHMA: Councilors, please! \\nANTOC MERRICK: \\ndestruction. The Rebellion does not. \\nPage 35/56\\nSENATOR NOWER JEBEL: A Death Star, this is nonsense. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nwould it bring him? \\nGENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: To lure our forces into a final battle. To destroy us once and for all. \\nSENATOR VASP VASPAR: To risk everything, based on what? The testimony of a criminal? The dying words of her father, an Imperial scientist? SENATOR NOWER JEBEL: Don’t forget the Imperial pilot. \\nJYN ERSO: \\ndefeat this. \\nGENERAL JAN DODONNA: So you’ve told us. \\nSENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: If the Empire has this kind of power, what chance do we have? \\nJYN ERSO: \\nRun? Hide? Plead for mercy? Scatter your forces? You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission. The time to fight is now! \\nREBEL 1: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nof Jedha. \\nREBEL 1: \\nREBEL 2: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nfleet if you have to. We need to capture the Death Star plans if there is any hope of destroying it. \\nSENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: You’re asking us to invade an Imperial installation based on nothing but hope? \\nJyn\\'s voice trembles and she looks like she\\'s about to shed a tear. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nSENATOR VASP VASPAR: There is no hope! \\nADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nSENATOR NOWER JEBEL: I say the Rebellion is finished! \\nSENATOR MON MOTHMA: I’m sorry, Jyn. Without the full support of the council, the odds are too great. \\nPage 36/56\\nThe councilors whisper inaudibly. Bail Organa looks defeated. Jyn pushes through the crowd and leaves, followed by glances. After a momentary pause, Bodhi rushes after her. The meeting scatters, murmuring in disapproval. In the main hangar, Jyn makes her way to Baze and Chirrut, looking angry. \\nDISTANT PA: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCassian appears from behind her with a group of about thirty rebels. CASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nof us... ... most of us, we’ve done terrible things on behalf of the Rebellion. We’re spies. Saboteurs. Assassins. Everything I did, I did for the Rebellion. And every time I walked away from something I wanted to forget I told myself it was for a cause that I believed in. A cause that was worth it. Without that, we’re lost. Everything we’ve done would have been for nothing. I couldn’t face myself if I gave up now. None of us could. It won’t be comfortable. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nGo, go, go! \\nThe rebels scatter to gather weapons and supplies. Jyn stands still with a Page 37/56\\nweak smile on her face. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Jyn. I’ll be there for you. \\nShe smiles at him. K-2SO looks as displeased as a droid can be. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Cassian said I had to. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJyn and Cassian return to the Imperial shuttle they had arrived on. \\nDISTANT PA: \\nmission report. \\nOnce they\\'re inside, the assembled rebel screw stands up to greet them \\nJYN ERSO: \\nThere are several cheers and small applause from the team. The shuttle door closes. \\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER: Cargo shuttle, read back, please. What’s going on out there? That ship’s off limits. No one is suppose to be on board until farther instructions. \\nJyn sits next to Bodhi, concerned and nudging him to talk to the controller. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER: That’s an impounded Imperial ship. What’s your call sign, pilot? \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nJyn looks up at him and mouths, \\nJYN ERSO: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER: Rogue One? There is no Rogue One. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well, there is now. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Pulling away. \\nThe shuttle takes off and leaves Yavin 4. Switches to a brief shot of the flight control tower with a rebel officer watching them leave. The gas \\nPage 38/56\\ngiant Yavin is seen in the background. Switches to a shot of Mon Mothma and Bail Organa walking through the HQ. \\nSENATOR MON MOTHMA: Despite what the others say, war is inevitable. \\nBAIL ORGANA: \\npeople that there will be no peace. We will need every advantage. SENATOR MON MOTHMA: Your friend, the Jedi. \\nBAIL ORGANA: \\nin hiding since the Emperor’s purge. Yes, I will send for him. SENATOR MON MOTHMA: You’ll need someone you can trust. \\nBAIL ORGANA: \\nHe turns around and leaves, greeting captain Antilles on his way. \\nBAIL ORGANA: \\nCAPTAIN RAYMUS ANTILLES: Senator. \\nThe shuttle sails through hyperspace with engines whooshing loudly. It jumps out of hyperspace and the camera pans to follow it across the surface of the large tropical planet of Scarif. A blockade of two Star Destroyers and a defensive shield hangs above the surface. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nshield with a single main entry gate. This shuttle should be equipped with an access code that allows us through. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Assuming, the Empire hasn’t logged it as overdue. BODHI ROOK: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nthe cold, dark vacuum of space. \\nThe shuttle passes under the massive hull of a Star Destroyer. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Not me, I can survive in space. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nHe contacts the shield gate via comms. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nSHIELD GATE OFFICER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608, you’re not listed on the arrival schedule. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nPage 39/56\\nFlight Station. Transmitting clearance code now. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Transmitting. \\nThere is a tense silence as they wait for clearance. Jyn pulls out the necklace her mother gave her, smiles and closes her eyes. Cassian climbs up the ladder and looks anxiously at Bodhi. \\nSHIELD GATE OFFICER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608? You are cleared for entry. Bodhi immediately lets out a relieved cry. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Impressive. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nShe goes down the ladder as Bodhi pilots the shuttle through the shield gate. There is an announcement of a tractor beam test in the background as they descend. \\nFLIGHT CONTROLLER: SW-0608 clear for landing pad 9. Acknowledge, please. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nThe shuttle gets closer to the surface and a tall pyramidal tower with a dish at the top comes into view. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nstructure archives in there. If the plans are anywhere, they’ll be there. CASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nfiles out. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Landing track engaged. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nDownstairs, Jyn notices the rebels silently sitting in the hold of the shuttle, all looking tense and worried. She catches Baze\\'s eye as Cassian climbs down to make an announcement. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJyn gets up, swallows, and starts speaking to lift the morale. As she begins, rebels lift their heads to listen. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nPage 40/56\\nand nothing left to lose can take the day. They have no idea we’re coming. They have no reason to expect us. If we can make it to the ground, we’ll take the next chance. And the next. On and on until we win... or the chances are spent. The Death Star plans are down there. Cassian, K2, and I will find them. We’ll find a way to find them. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nmove east and get wide of the ship. Find a position between here and the tower. Once you get to the best spot, light the place up. Make ten men feel like a hundred. \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nhere. \\nThe shuttle finally lands on LP 9 and an inspection team of an officer, flight controller and two stormtroopers walks out to meet them. LANDING PAD OFFICER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608, be prepared to receive inspection team. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nBodhi opens the door to the shuttle and the inspection team sees nothing but an empty cargo hold. \\nLANDING PAD OFFICER: Hello. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nLANDING PAD OFFICER: That would be helpful. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nBodhi smiles and points to the ladder leading downstairs. At the same time, Krennic\\'s shuttle emerges from hyperspace and descends into the shield gate. Krennic is on board with his bodyguards. \\nPILOT: \\nGeneral Ramda has been informed of your arrival. \\nOn Scarif, two rebels are seen dragging the body of a stormtrooper into the shuttle. Jyn and Cassian are putting on their disguise uniforms. Once they\\'re done, Jyn walks out to say goodbye to the crew. She holds Chirrut\\'s hands and he smiles. Baze puts a gentle hand on her shoulder. \\nPage 41/56\\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nThey both smile softly. Cuts to Bodhi watching a few Imperials outside the shuttle. Once they turn away, he yells downstairs to the rebel crew. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nSERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: All right, let’s go! Come on. Move, move, move! The rebels open a hatch at the bottom of the shuttle and jump onto the ground, scattering in their assigned positions. In turn, Jyn and Cassian in Imperial disguise and K-2SO walk out of the shuttle and head towards the elevator that will take them to the facility. As the rebels disappear into the tropical forest, K-2SO, Jyn and Cassian walk into the elevator and watch the doors close. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I have a bad feeling about… \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: What? \\nThe doors close, cutting them off. The elevator slides towards the tower at the same time as Krennic\\'s shuttle lands right next to it. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well, I’m sure there’s one just lying about. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThe elevator door opens and they walk out into a hallway of the facility, full of Imperial officers and stormtroopers. On their way they pass a droid identical to K-2SO and exchange glances when he walks by. Meanwhile, the rebel assault team is giving out thermal detonators as they watch an Imperial hangar in the distance. \\nSERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: One per pad. Pick your spot. We want to draw them out. I’ll call the timing. Go! \\nStormtroopers walk across the hangar, chatting peacefully. STORMTROOPER 1: \\nSTORMTROOPER 2: \\nSTORMTROOPER 1: \\nSTORMTROOPER 2: \\nThey don\\'t even have time to react when Chirrut jumps out of the bushes and knocks them out with his staff, then disappears just as quickly. The rebel forces run by, unnoticed. Another stormtrooper hears someone coughing \\nPage 42/56\\nbehind him and turns around to see Baze just before he is dropped to the ground. Rebels plant their detonators on the landing pads and scatter. \\nSTORMTROOPER 1: \\nSTORMTROOPER 2: \\nThe stormtrooper is electrocuted to the neck by Baze. Cuts to Krennic walking across the command centre of the tower followed by General Ramda. GENERAL SOTORUS RAMDA: Director, what brings you to Scarif? DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Galen Erso, I want every dispatch, every transmission he has ever sent called up for inspection. \\nGENERAL SOTORUS RAMDA: All of them? \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Yes. All of them. Get started. \\nIn the hallways of the facility, Jyn, Cassian and K-2SO are hiding in a small nook while K-2SO hacks into the Imperial droid they had noticed before. Both the droids\\' eyes start blinking. Cuts to the rebel group taking positions in front of the elevator entrance. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Our optimal route to the data vault places only 89 stormtroopers in our path. We will make it no more than 33% of the way before we are killed. \\nJyn looks up at Cassian, worried. He pulls out a comlink and contacts Melshi. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nSERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Ready, ready. Standing by. \\nCassian looks at Jyn and she nods from behind her helmet. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThe rebels set off their detonators and a chain reaction of explosions goes off. Stormtroopers walking by are killed instantly. Krennic, standing in the command centre, overhears the blasts and looks out the window. The officers gather around to look. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Are we blind?! Deploy the garrison! Move! Krennic swallows nervously. Cuts to Jyn, Cassian and K-2 walk across a corridor when a battallion of stormtroopers runs past them and they move aside, realising the distraction worked. Inside the Rogue One shuttle, rebels spot the stormtroopers. \\nCORPORAL STORDAN TONC: Troopers! Troopers! Troopers on the left. Get in! Get in! \\nThe rebels hide in the depths of the shuttle and stay hidden. The ones in cover emerge from behind the containers and start shooting the stormtroopers. \\nPage 43/56\\nInt. DEATH STAR - Control Room \\nGrand Moff Tarkin stands in front of the large screen when General Romodi walks up. \\nGENERAL HURST ROMODI: Sir? Scarif base, they’re reporting a rebel incursion. \\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I want to speak to Director Krennic. GENERAL HURST ROMODI: He’s there, sir. On Scarif. \\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: The original plans for this station are kept there, are they not? \\nGENERAL HURST ROMODI: They are. \\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: Prepare for the jump to hyperspace and inform Lord Vader. \\nTarkin pulls a smirk. \\nBack in the facility, the trio walks into a room where an officer is at a control panel next to the archives entrance. \\nOFFICER: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: That won’t be necessary. \\nK-2SO slams the officer on the head and takes control of the panel. On Yavin 4, a rebel private runs across the whole HQ to reach Mon Mothma, Merrick and Draven, yelling. \\nREBEL: \\nMerrick grabs the soldier and stops him from reaching Mon. GENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Stop right there, Private! \\nSENATOR MON MOTHMA: Let him speak. \\nREBEL: \\nSENATOR MON MOTHMA: I need to speak to Admiral Raddus. \\nREBEL: \\nBack on Scarif, the rebels are engaging Imperial forces in a fierce battle. It is unclear who\\'s winning. A rebel screams as he gets shot. \\nREBEL: \\nOn Yavin 4, rebel crews are hurrying to their ships as an announcement rings across the PA. R2D2 and C3PO watch from the shadows of the hangar. \\nPA: \\nimmediately. Attention all flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately. We have been redirected to Scarif. Pilots, you’ll be briefed by your squadron leaders on route. May the Force be with you. C-3PO [SEE-THREEPIO]: Scarif? They’re going to Scarif? Why does nobody ever tell me anything, Artoo? \\nPage 44/56\\nR2-D2 [ARTOO-DETOO]: [beeps] \\nMelshi and his crew are still engaged in the battle. \\nMove, move, move! \\nSERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Forward! Forward! \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nIn the control room in the tower, Imperials are panicking as they contact their landing pads. Krennic looks desperate. \\nIMPERIAL 1: \\noutnumbered. \\nIMPERIAL 2: \\nAll Pads report in immediately. \\nIMPERIAL 1: \\nIMPERIAL 2: \\nBodhi takes the opportunity and directs the Imperials away with an announcement of his own. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nPad 2. Get on there, tell him pinned down by rebels on Pad 5. CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: This is Pad 5, we’re being overrun. Help us! \\nIMPERIAL: \\nGet reinforcements down to Pad 5 immediately! \\nCassian, Jyn and K-2SO are busy trying to open the archive door. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Right hand. \\nJyn grabs Cassian\\'s hand and presses it to the scanner. Immediately the door slides open. Back on the beach, Chirrut overhears a thumping noise and feels the ground shaking. He yells at Baze to turn around and he sees a massive AT-ACT emerging from the jungle and shooting at the rebel forces. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nPAO: \\nPage 45/56\\nREBEL: \\nThe rebels scatter, may falling under fire. At the same time the Rebel fleet emerges out of space over the defensive shield. \\nADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nSquadron leaders report in. \\nGENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by. JON VANDER (GOLD LEADER): This is Gold Leader, standing by. GARVEN DREIS (RED LEADER): This is Red Leader, standing by. An Imperial shield crew member alerts his commander of the rebel fleet. IMPERIAL CREW MEMBER: Sir, those are rebel ships. \\nIMPERIAL LIEUTENANT: Get Admiral Gorin, immediately! \\nDown on Scarif, Krennic has been alerted too. \\nLIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: Director, the rebel fleet, it’s amassing outside the shield. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Lock down the base. Lock down. \\nLIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: And close the shield? \\nLIEUTENANT ORSON KRENNIC: Do it! \\nIn the air, the rebels are getting into formations to attack the shield and get past the blockade. \\nADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nfleet. Blue squadron, get to the surface before they closed that gate. GENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Copy, your Admiral. Blue squadron, on me. BARION RANER (BLUE FOUR): Copy, Blue Leader. \\nFARNS MONSBEE (BLUE FIVE): Copy, Blue Leader. \\nHEFF TOBBER (BLUE EIGHT): We won’t have long. \\nAboard the shield gate, officers are hurrying to lock down the base. An officer pushes a button and the gate slowly closes. \\nSHIELD GATE OFFICER: Close the field aperture now. Close it! Rebel pilots racing towards the shield pull up in panic, but not all of them manage to. A few ships crash onto the surface of the shield and explode. \\nVANGOS GREK (BLUE SIX): Come on, come on, come on! \\nBARION RANER (BLUE FOUR): Pull up! \\nBack on Scarif, K-2SO calls out to Jyn as he intercepts transmissions. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Rebel fleet has arrived. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: There’s fighting on the beach, they’ve locked down the base, they’ve closed the shield gate. \\nJyn runs over to him and Cassian. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nPage 46/56\\nCassian gives her a grim look, and she nods solemnly. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: We could transmit the plans to the rebel fleet. We’d have to get a signal out to tell them it’s coming. It’s the size of the data files. That’s the problem.They’ll never get through. Someone has to take that shield gate down. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nout there. Bodhi! \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nfighting, the base is on lockdown! \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nYou’ve got to tell them to blow a hole in the shield gate so we can transmit the plans. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nnot tied in. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nFind a way! Cover our backs. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Your behavior, Jyn Erso, is continually unexpected. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThe AT-ACT is preparing to fire at the remaining few rebels. \\nAT-AT PILOT: \\nBaze loads a rocket launcher and fires at the neck of the AT-ACT, but the walker only flinches and lifts its head back up. However, it\\'s instantly shot by an X-Wing coming out of nowhere with a few more following it. The rebels erupt in cheers. \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nInside the shuttle, Bodhi prepares to make a run for it. Another rebel stops him. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nREBEL: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nrebel fleet is pulling in.We just have to get a signal strong enough to get Page 47/56\\nthrough to them and let them know we’re trapped down here. For that, we have to connect to the communications tower. Now, I can patch us in over here, the landing pad but you have to get on the radio, get one of the guys out there to find a master switch. Get them to activate the connection between us and that comm tower. \\nREBEL: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nRaddus and his crew sit aboard the Mon Calamari cruiser bridge. ADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nLIEUTENANT: \\nare blocked. \\nADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nstart probing that shield. \\nLIEUTENANT: \\nThe Red squadron pilots are busy shooting at the shield gate and dodging shots from cannons built on top of it. An X-Wing is hit and goes down in flames. \\nGARVEN DREIS (RED LEADER): We’re going in! Stay with me. \\nJyn and Cassian are in a small control room in the archive tower, searching for the location of the plans. K-2SO is outside by the control panel. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Schematics bank, Data tower two. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Searching. I can locate the tape, but you’ll need the handles for extraction. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThey turn around to see the vault door closing. K-2SO is surrounded by stormtroopers and tries to point them away. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well, finally. \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nThe trooper notices the officer on the floor. \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: The rebels! They went over there. \\nCassian speaks into the comlink, revealing himself. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBefore the stormtroopers can shoot, K-2 reacts. \\nPage 48/56\\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: There’s one. Oh well. \\nHe beats up the troopers easily. Up in the sky, the bombers are preparing to attack. Just as they start the attack run, TIE fighters come in from the shield and swarm the rebel fleet. \\nJON VANDER (GOLD LEADER): Red Leader, this is Gold Leader, we’re starting our attack run on the shield gate. Keep it tight and watch out for those towers. \\nGOLD PILOT: \\nREBEL LIEUTENANT: Sir, enemy fighters coming in. \\nThe TIEs zoom past the Mon Cala cruiser bridge. \\nCORPORAL STORDAN TONC: Melshi. Melshi, come in, are you there? Bodhi will send a signal from here. He’s patching us in. But you guys have to open up a line for the tower. \\nSERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: How? Please advise. \\nCORPORAL STORDAN TONC: There’s a master switch to the base of the Comm tower. \\nSERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Master switch, describe, what are we looking for? CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: What does it look like? The master switch? Where is it? \\nMerrick leads his Blue Squadron into attack, covering the rebels on the beach. \\nGENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Two wings, reinforce those troops on the beach. All fighters, on me. We have to shield them from air attack. \\nLAREN JOMA (BLUE ELEVEN): Troop reinforcements. Here we go! A craft full of reinforcements lands and disembarks on the beach with a war cry, attacking the stormtroopers. \\nREBEL MARINE: \\nMARINE: \\nThe rebels attempting to take down the shield are having no effect on it and are still pressed by TIE fighters. \\nRED PILOT: \\nBLUE PILOT: \\nGARVEN DREIS (RED LEADER): Stick close, Red 5, where are you going? PEDRIN GUAL (RED FIVE): I’m trying to lose them. This is Red 5, I need help! \\nRed Five is caught in the scopes of a TIE pilot and goes down in flames. Up in the tower, Jyn and Cassian are going through archive after archive. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nPage 49/56\\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Two screens down. Structural engineering, open that one! \\nA stormtrooper walks in and K-2 shoots him without even looking his way. Up in the air, the battle rages on. The more advanced TIE Strikers are now chasing down the rebels. \\nBLUE PILOT: \\nBLUE TWO: \\nBodhi connects the cable to the radio while Jyn keeps rummaging through Engineering files. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nWar-Mantle. Cluster-Prism. Black-Saber. \\nShe stops dead in her tracks. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nBodhi is fiddling with wires when he is surprised by a stormtrooper aiming at him. \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nSTORMTROOPER: \\nThe trooper yells at his colleague but is shot down instantly by the rebels. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Stardust. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Climb. Climb. You can still send the plans to the fleet. If they open the shield gate, you can broadcast from the tower! Locking the vault door now. \\nHis voice gets high-pitched and he starts closing the door hurriedly as a Page 50/56\\nsquad of stormtroopers bursts into the room shooting at him. With his last effort he punches the vault door shut. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nK-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Good bye. \\nK-2SO\\'s eyes go dark. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nKrennic is standing at the window nervously when news arrives. LIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: Sir, unauthorized access at the data vault. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: What?  \\nLIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: It’s just come in, sir. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Send my guard squadron into battle! Two men with me now! Get that beach under control! \\nCassian calls out to Bodhi via comlink. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nshield’s open, we can send the plans! \\nMerrick is hit by a TIE Striker shot and goes down just as a Blue pilot warns him. \\nBLUE: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nJyn shoots a hole through the glass in the control room, opening up an alternative exit. A TIE fighter hits the wing of Blue Eleven and the pilot screams. \\nBLUE ELEVEN: \\nThe beach battle rages on. No side seems to be winning so far, but a squad of death troopers arrives. Inside the tower, Jyn takes off her uniform jacket and climbs out the window. They jump over from the wall to the archives at a dazzling height. \\nREBEL: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nSERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: I’m tied in at my end, I just need an open line. Hang on. The master switch, it’s over at that console. \\nPage 51/56\\nREBEL: \\nHe peeks out, but is instantly shot by a sniper death trooper. Jyn, in turn, almost drops the data disc, but grabs it in the last moment and straps it onto her belt. Krennic is seen walking rapidly towards an elevator. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThe master switch remains untouched. Chirrut emerges from his cover and walks across the battlefield, immune to all shots, as he mumbles his words like a mantra. \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\none with the Force and the Force is with me. \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\none with the Force and the Force is with me. I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me. I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me. I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me. I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me. \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nChirrut ignores it and pulls the master switch blindly. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJyn keeps climbing up to the exit hatch. Krennic emerges from an elevator door and, after a brief exchange, shoots Cassian and he falls off the tower onto one of the bars below. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nChirrut is hit by an explosion, and Baze runs to him in slow motion. BAZE MALBUS: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nPage 52/56\\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nCHIRRUT ÎMWE: \\nI’m one with the Force. The Force is with me. I’m one with the Force. The Force is with me. \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nThe rebel cruiser is taking heavy damage. \\nLIEUTENTANT: \\ndamage. \\nADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nattack. \\nGOLD LEADER: \\nGOLD NINE: \\nThe Gold squadron launches torpedoes at the ISD and power goes out on the massive vessel. \\nSTAR DESTROYER CAPTAIN: What’s happening? \\nIMPERIAL CREW MEMBER: We’ve lost engine power, sir. \\nADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nhear me! Is there anybody up there? This is Rogue One! Come in, over. ADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nhave to transmit them from the communications tower! You have to take down the shield gate. It’s the only way to going to get them through! \\nADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nStandby, Rogue One, we’re on it. \\nBODHI ROOK: \\nBAZE MALBUS: \\nA Hammerhead corvette is seen speeding towards the disabled ISD at full power. The crew braces for impact. \\nHAMMERHEAD CAPTAIN: Corvette 5, locked on target. Prepare for impact. Page 53/56\\nHAMMERHEAD CAPTAIN: Sublight thrusters, full power! \\nThe corvette crashes into the side of the disabled ISD, bringing it towards the second Destroyer. A horrible collision forces the Destroyers to fall slowly towards the shield gate, breaking it in half. Imperial crew members scream in pain as the ships go down, exploding. Jyn climbs out of the hatch, avoiding its sharp edges, and races to the antenna to send off the plans, but encounters a problem. \\nCOMPUTER: \\nantenna alignment. Reset antenna alignment. \\nJyn looks over to the side of the tower where there is another control panel, but a TIE Striker almost shoots her off the edge. She barely makes it up and fixes the antenna. \\nADMIRAL GORIN: \\nCOMPUTER: \\nJyn turns away to hear the click of a blaster and Krennic aiming said blaster at her. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Who are you? \\nJYN ERSO: \\nLyra. You’ve lost. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Oh, I have, have I? \\nJYN ERSO: \\nput a fuse in the middle of your machine and I’ve just told the entire galaxy how to light it. \\nDIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: The shield is up, your signal will never reach the rebel base. All the ships in here will be destroyed. I lose nothing but time. YOU, on the other hand die with the Rebellion. \\nHe never finishes, as Cassian shoots him in the shoulder and Jyn sends off the plans in a hurry. \\nCOMPUTER: \\nREBEL LIEUTENANT: Admiral, receiving transmission from Scarif. Jyn rushed to the unconscious Krennic to kill him, but Cassian drags her away. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\ngo. \\nCOMPUTER: \\nPage 54/56\\nLIEUTENANT: \\nADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nIn the elevator back to the landing pad, Cassian and Jyn smile at each other weakly. \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nJYN ERSO: \\nThe Mon Cala cruiser has received the transmissions, but someone catches a massive object on the horizon. It\\'s the Death Star. Krennic opens his eyes, and a look of horror flashes on his face as he sees it too. \\nLIEUTENANT: \\nhyperspace. \\nAboard the Death Sta stand Tarkin and Romodi, ready to give the command to fire. \\nGENERAL HURST ROMODI: Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet? GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: Lord Vader will handle the fleet. Target the base at Scarif. Single reactor ignition. \\nGENERAL HURST ROMODI: Yes, sir. \\nGRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: You may fire when ready. \\nGENERAL HURST ROMODI: Commence primary ignition. \\nThe Death Star control panels are ignited and the same green ray emerges from the reactor. Krennic watches silently as it fires, destroying the antenna and hitting the ocean, where a giant wave rises from the impact. Raddus watches the destruction from above. \\nADMIRAL RADDUS: \\nprepare for jump to hyperspace! \\nJust before the fleet can make the jump, The Devastator jumps out of hyperspace, and Darth Vader stands on the bridge as his ISD destroys the remnants of the rebel fleet. On the beach, Jyn and Cassian hug as they fall ont othe sand and watch the wave come toward them. \\nJYN ERSO: \\nCASSIAN ANDOR: \\nThe music intensifies and the two watch the wave with tears in their eyes as it engulfs them. Everything goes silent. On board the Devastator, Vader is preparing to board the cruiser. \\nCAPTAIN SHAEF CORSSIN: The rebel flag ship is disabled, my lord, but has received transmission from the surface. \\nPage 55/56\\nDARTH VADER: \\nCAPTAIN SHAEF CORSSIN: Yes, my lord. \\nOn the cruiser, the rebels barely get the plans onto a hard drive and race to the escape pods, but some of them are cut off by a locked door. \\nREBEL: \\nREBEL 2: \\nREBEL 1: \\nREBEL: \\nREBEL: \\nREBEL: \\nThe music stops, and only the sirens blare in the darkness. Then someone starts breathing, and a crimson lightsaber ignites, revealing Darth Vader himself. \\nREBEL: \\nREBEL: \\nREBEL: \\nVader slaughters the rebels easily and cold bloodedly, despite all their efforts. Someone manages to pass on the plans to the outside before being impaled by his saber. The survivors run to the Tantive IV that\\'s docked to the cruiser. \\nREBEL: \\nREBEL: \\nREBEL: \\nThe smaller ship launches the second Vader makes his way to it. He stands on the side of the cruiser, watching the Tantive leave. On board the smaller ship, captain Antilles finds Princess Leia of Alderaan. CAPTAIN RAYMUS ANTILLES: Make sure you secure the airlock. And prepare the escape pods. \\nCAPTAIN RAYMUS ANTILLES: Your Highness. The transmission we received. What is it they’ve sent us? \\nLeia smiles. \\nPRINCESS LEIA ORGANA: Hope. \\nPage 56/56\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScripts.com \\nSing \\nBy Garth Jennings Page 1/52\\n1 \\nWhoops. \\nPlaces, everyone. \\nThis was it. \\nThe moment it all began. \\nThe moment an ordinary \\nlittle guy \\nfell in love with the theater.

Witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles? Don\\'t forget about \\nthe joker\\'s girlfriend. \\nThese are villains, Amanda. \\nWhat makes you think \\nyou can control them? \\nBecause getting people to act \\nagainst their own self-interests...

Strictly need to know. And if they get caught, \\nwe throw them under the bus. \\nThe next war will be fought \\nwith these metahumans. \\nOurs, or theirs. \\nWe\\'re not the only ones \\nkicking up rocks looking for them. You know we can\\'t \\ncontrol these people. \\nJune, be strong. \\nDr. Moone. \\nEnchantress. \\nMeet the enchantress. \\nEverything we know about her, \\nis in your briefing packs. \\nShe\\'s walked this earth \\nfor a very long time \\nand will likely be here \\nwhen we\\'re long gone. \\nThis meeting is \\nis now a magic show? \\nPage 12/51\\nMagic or not, this girl can do some pretty incredible things.

You hate mankind much? \\nLet me guess. \\nMommy didn\\'t take you to \\nPage 32/51\\nChuck E. Cheese on your 6th birthday. I can recommend a good therapist. Why? \\nBecause I\\'m bored. \\nI need a victim, a mind to \\npry apart and spit in. \\nYou just leave it, mate. \\nShe\\'s a rabbit hole, don\\'t fall in.

Please. \\nGod, you\\'re so... \\nGood. \\nOh, relax. \\nIt\\'s just me. \\nYou ever been in love? \\nNah, never. \\nPage 35/51\\nBullshit. \\nYou don\\'t kill as many people as I\\'ve killed and still sleep like a kitten if you feel shit like love. \\nAnother textbook sociopath. \\nClear. \\nClear. \\n- Nice. \\n- Clear the roof. \\nSweep for shooters so we can \\nbring in our aviation assets. \\nGo to the roof. \\nJust oh... \\nWait here. \\nPlease. \\nI don\\'t wanna gave this dude \\na heart attack, okay? \\nAww. \\nHe\\'s embarrassed of us. \\nHey, Flag. \\nThis dude better cure cancer \\nafter all of this shit. \\nYou ready? \\nLet\\'s go. \\nYou wouldn\\'t have made it \\nwithout them. \\nWe got lucky. I don\\'t do luck. \\nI do planning and precision. \\nAdmit it, Rick. \\nI was right. \\nYeah, I told you to get on \\nthe damn truck. \\nWhy did you stay? \\nI was studying your girlfriend. She takes an average person... \\nA yoga mom, an elderly retiree \\nand she turns them into a soldier who can take a headshot \\nand still fight. \\nIt\\'s an instant army. \\nHow\\'d she do it, Flag? \\nHow\\'d she game the system \\nwith you watching her every move? I\\'ll accept the consequences \\nPage 36/51\\nI am your consequence. \\nYou might need to be careful. \\nThey think we\\'re rescuing Nelson mandela. I can take care of myself. \\n- Shut it down, wipe the drivers. - Yes, ma\\'am. \\nCopy that. \\nHey man, \\nI know you can\\'t hear me \\n\\'cause you\\'re trapped in your \\ntemple of soldierly self-righteousness. But a two-faced dude like you \\nwouldn\\'t survive a second on the street. Oh, says the guy \\nwho shoots people for money. \\nMy cards is on the table, man. \\nIt got done, didn\\'t it? \\nDamn. \\nThat is just... \\nA mean lady. \\nYeah, you\\'ll get used to it. \\nAnd I\\'m the bad guy? \\nThat\\'s gangsta. \\nWhat? \\nThey weren\\'t cleared \\nfor any of this, any of it. \\nI\\'m not judging. \\nI\\'ve buried a lot of mistakes too. No way. \\nLet\\'s go home. \\nYeah, let\\'s go home. \\nThat sounds good. \\nYou guys wanna go home? \\nOr you wanna go back to prison? I\\'m not going back to prison. \\nWhat I\\'m saying is... \\nWe kill the pair of \\'em now \\nbefore they kill us. \\nI got this. \\nYou all made it this far. \\nDon\\'t get high-spirited on me \\nand ruin a good thing. \\nI like her. \\nSavior 1-0, this is ground element. Page 37/51\\nSavior 1-0, \\nhow copy? \\nSavior 1-0, the LZ\\'s clear. \\nBoss, they\\'re not talking to me. Our bird\\'s been jacked. \\nLight it up! \\nWhat? \\nI got a hickey or something? \\nProfessor, could you pick up the pace? Disarmed \\nNow! \\nHarley! \\nHello, baby. \\nKill her! \\nFail - safe mode \\nHer nanite\\'s disarmed! \\nCome on, baby. \\nDeadshot... \\nShoot that woman, right now! \\nShe ain\\'t do shit to me. \\nYou\\'re a hitman, right? \\nI got a contract. \\nKill Harley Quinn. \\nDo it your freedom and your kid. Now she dead. \\nI missed. \\nGood one, mate. \\nIt\\'s Waller. \\nSavior 1-0\\'s been hijaked. \\nShoot it down. \\nRager that, ma\\'am. \\nGoing hot. \\nPuddin\\'! \\nYou got all dressed up for me? Oh, you know I\\'d do \\nanything for you. \\nBy the way... \\nI\\'ve got some grape soda on ice, and a bear skin rug waiting. \\nYeah? \\nBoss, we got a problem! \\n- This bird is baked. \\n- No. \\nOkay, honey. \\nPage 38/51\\nIt\\'s me and you. \\nLet\\'s do it. \\nTarget destroyed, ma\\'am \\nthank you. \\nNow get me off this roof. \\nYes, ma\\'am. \\nWe\\'re inbound. \\nThe joker and Harley Quinn are no more. You couldn\\'t save her. \\nRoger, I see you. \\nWatch your step, ma\\'am. \\nStandby, I\\'ll send another helo! Waller\\'s down. \\nIt\\'s over. \\nOps just confirmed. \\nShe\\'s down, 1k west. \\nLet\\'s go get her. \\nThe mission\\'s not over. \\nNah, it is for me. \\nWe had a deal. \\nWithout Waller, you got nothing. Hey, guys. \\nI\\'m back! \\nI missed you all so much. \\nWe\\'re glad you could make it. \\nHey, craziness. \\nWith my heart returned, \\nI can finish my weapon. \\nNow tell me how to \\ndestroy your armies. \\nDo your worst, bitch! \\nSo, let me guess. \\nWe\\'re going to the swirling \\nring of trash in the sky. \\nYou know, \\'cause why wouldn\\'t we? When does this end, Flag? \\nLoad up. \\nWe\\'re in for a fight. \\nTop secret \\nYou tell everybody, everything. Or me and you are \\ngonna go right now. \\n3 days ago, \\na non-human entity \\nPage 39/51\\nappeared in the subway station. Waller, we\\'re almost there. \\nSo Waller sent me and \\na woman with incredibles abilities. Enchantress \\na witch. \\nSee, nobody could get near this thing, but... \\nThe witch could. \\nBomb\\'s ready. \\nSet for two seconds. \\nYou just press the \\nbutton and drop it. \\nNeedless to say \\nthe whole thing was a bad idea. She bolted! \\nShit! \\nAnd that\\'s how \\nshe escaped from Waller. \\nSo now you know. \\nYou can just kill me right now but... \\nI\\'m going to have a drink. \\nHey, Deadshot, \\nI need your help. \\nNo, sir. \\nYou need a miracle. \\nWhat\\'s you having, KC? \\nBloody mary, right? \\nRick goes to mind. \\nKC, it\\'s the end of the world. Have a drink with us. \\nBeer. \\nThere he is. \\nGive the man a \"B\". \\nHow about you, hot stuff? \\nWater. \\nThat\\'s a good idea, honey. \\nNinja, you want some sake? \\nWhisky. \\nWhat am I, twelve? \\nHere\\'s to honor among thieves \\nI\\'m not a thief. \\nOh. \\nPage 40/51\\nShe\\'s not a thief. \\nI actually prefer to think of myself as an asset relocation specialist. Well, we almost pulled it off. Despite what everybody thought. We weren\\'t picked to succeed, \\nyou know that, right? \\nWe were all chosen to fail. \\nYeah, I know that. \\nWorst part of it is, they\\'re gonna blame us for the whole thing. \\nAnd they can\\'t have people \\nknowing the truth. \\nWe\\'re the patsies. \\nThe cover-up. \\nDon\\'t forget, we\\'re the bad guys. So, you\\'re going to tell us now what your big deal with Flag was. Same thing Waller offered me, \\nto kill you. \\nChance to be a father. \\nChance to have a life \\noutside the shadows. \\nI trusted Flag. \\nFlag had you chasing \\na carrot on a stick, homie, \\nyou don\\'t know that? \\nI love this guy. \\nYou played yourself, dog. \\nBitch, I\\'m having a drink. \\nI\\'m... breathing fresh air. \\nFor 2 sweet seconds... \\nI had hope. \\nYou had hope, huh? \\nHope don\\'t stop the wheel \\nfrom turning, my brother. \\nYou preaching? \\nIt\\'s coming back around for you. How many people you killed, man? You don\\'t ask nobody \\nno question like that, ese. \\nYou ain\\'t ever \\nwhacked down no women. \\nNo kids. \\nPage 41/51\\nI don\\'t kill women or children. I do. \\nSee, I was born with the devil\\'s gift. I kept it hidden most of my life, but... The older I got, \\nthe stronger I got. \\nSo I started using it. \\nFor business, you know, \\nthe more power \\non the street I got, \\nthe more firepower I got. \\nLike that shit \\nwent hand in hand. \\nYou know, one was feeding the other. Ain\\'t nobody tell me no. \\nExcept my old lady. \\nYou know, she used to pray for me. You\\'re welcome. \\nEven when I didn\\'t want it. \\nSix die in arson fire. \\nGod didn\\'t give me this. \\nWhy should he take it away? \\nHey. \\nThis is our home. \\nYou put that back \\nwhere you found it. \\nI\\'m taking my kids to mom\\'s. \\nYou ain\\'t taking my kids nowhere! See, when I get mad, \\nI lose control. \\nYou know, I just... \\nI don\\'t know what I do... \\nTill it\\'s done. \\nAnd the kids? \\nHe killed them. \\nDidn\\'t you? \\nOwn that shit. \\nOwn it! \\nWhat\\'d you think was \\ngonna happen, huh? \\nHey, Harley. \\nCome on. \\nWhat you were just... \\nThinking you can have a happy family... Page 42/51\\nAnd coach little leagues \\nand make car payments? \\nNormal is a setting on the dryer. People like us, we don\\'t get normal! Why is it always a knife fight every single time \\nyou open your mouth? \\nYou know, outside you\\'re amazing. But inside, you\\'re ugly. \\nWe all are. \\nWe all are! \\nExcept for him. \\nHe\\'s ugly on the outside, too. Not me, shorty. \\nI\\'m beautiful. \\nYeah, you are. \\nWe don\\'t want you here. \\nYou get to the part in that binder saying I was sleeping with her? Yeah. \\nI never been with a witch before. What\\'s that like? \\nApparently that\\'s why the creatures chase him all the time. \\n\\'Cause the witch is scared of him. The only woman I ever cared about... Is trapped inside that monster. If I don\\'t stop the witch, it\\'s over. Everything is over. \\nEverything. \\nYou\\'re free to go. \\nYour daughter writes you everyday. Every single day. \\nYou had these the whole time? \\nYou had letters from my daughter the whole time? \\nI\\'m gonna get you there. \\nAnd you\\'re gonna end this. \\nI\\'m gonna carry your ass \\nif I have to. \\n\\'Cause this shit is gonna be \\nlike a chapter in the Bible. \\nEverybody\\'s gonna know what we did. And my daughter is gonna know \\nPage 43/51\\nthat her Daddy \\nis not a piece of shit. \\nI\\'ll come. \\nWhat? \\nYou got something better to do? Come on! \\nPussies. \\nWe think that thing\\'s a weapon. Here, lower. \\nWe gotta take out the big one. I left a big ass demo charge \\ndown there in that subway. \\nThere\\'s a flooded tunnel... \\nLeads right underneath that building. Seals, they can recover the charge, swim underneath that thing\\'s feet. We get in it\\'s face and distract the hell out of that son of a bitch so the swimmers can blow the bomb. That\\'s how we take it out. \\nI\\'m going with you. \\nWe got this. \\nI\\'m not asking, bro. \\nI live underground. \\nY\\'all are just tourists. \\nThe man who killed her husband used that sword. \\nHis soul\\'s trapped inside of it. She talks to him. \\nHey. \\nWell... \\nYou know what they say \\nabout the crazy ones. \\nHuh? \\nLet\\'s do this. \\nYou must really love this girl. And I thought love was bullshit, getting serious. \\nDesire, mutual benefit whatever. I mean, I get that, \\nbut... actual love? \\nI mean, I rated that with UFOs. A lot of believers, no proof. \\nAnd then I met June. \\nPage 44/51\\nDo what you got to do. \\nI got your back. \\nYou gonna fight with us? \\nWhat if I lose control? \\nThen maybe we\\'ll have a chance. Duck in. \\nHey, everyone can see \\nall this trippy magic stuff right? Yeah, why? \\nI\\'m off my meds. \\nThat\\'s your old lady, huh? \\nYeah. \\nWell, you need to handle \\nthis shit, alll right? \\nGet up there, smack on her ass, tell her knock this shit off. \\nI do not think that\\'d be wise. I\\'m gonna draw out the big one. My boys will detonate \\nthe bomb underneath him. \\nYou know, we should \\nget a drink sometime. \\nI\\'ve been waiting for you all night. Step out of the shadows. \\nI won\\'t bite. \\nWhat the hell? \\nGrab her. \\nWhy are you here? \\nBecause the soldier led you? \\nAnd all for Waller? \\nWhy do you serve those who cage you? I am your ally. \\nAnd I know what you want. \\nExactly what you want. \\nNormal \\nnormal \\nBaby. \\nBaby. \\nIt\\'s just a nightmare. \\nIt\\'s just a bad dream. \\nI\\'m here. \\nMiss me? \\nI\\'ll put the kids to sleep and then... Maybe we can kick it? \\nPage 45/51\\nYeah? \\nI can\\'t change what I did. \\nAnd neither can you! \\nHe married me. \\nIt\\'s not real. \\nI killed the bat. \\nNo, homie, you don\\'t want that. What? \\nI want that. \\nShe\\'s trying to play games with you, man. It\\'s not real! \\nHe\\'s right. \\nIt\\'s not real. \\nHow long have you been \\nable to see? \\nMy whole life. \\nYou can\\'t have them. \\nThese are my people right here. But it is our time. \\nThe sun is setting \\nand the magic rises. \\nThe metahumans are a sign of change. Lady... \\nYou are evil! \\nOh, wow! \\nUh-oh. \\nWho is this? \\nIt\\'s gonna be bad! \\nWe should run. \\nGq, come in. \\nWe\\'re in position. \\nWe gotta get him in that corner. That\\'s where the bomb will be. \\nI\\'ll do it! \\nI\\'ll get him there! \\nI lost one family. \\nI ain\\'t gonaa lose one another. Look, think it through. \\nI got this. \\nLet me show you \\nwhat I really am. \\nOver here! \\nGo! \\nRick, in position. \\nPage 46/51\\nStanding by. \\nDiablo, drive him into the corner! - Get him mate. \\n- Come on. \\nYeah, do it! \\nDiablo, get clear! \\nGet out of there! \\nBlow it! \\nBlow it. \\nNow GQ, now. \\nNo! \\nEverybody down! \\nYou next. \\nMy spell is complete. \\nOnce you and armies are gone, \\nmy darkness will spread across this world. And it would be mine to rule. \\nThat was our main satellite uplink. How did this witch even know \\nhow to target this thing? \\nIt\\'s a secret facility. \\nYou got a move here, Flag? \\nWe gotta cut her heart out! \\nWhere is she? \\nI can\\'t see her! \\nWhile we\\'re fighting, \\nthat thing is laying waste \\nto the whole damn world. \\nWhere is she? \\nI don\\'t know. \\nHey. \\nOh shit. \\nLook out, look out! \\nUh-oh. \\nSorry. \\nFlag! \\nEnough! \\nOf all who have faced me... \\nYou have earned mercy. \\nFor the last time... \\nJoin me... \\nOr die. \\nI\\'m not much of a joiner but... \\nMaybe we should. \\nPage 47/51\\nHey. \\nShe\\'s trying to take over the world. So? \\nWhat\\'s the world ever \\ndone for us anyway? \\nIt hates us. \\nHey. \\nHarley. \\nHey, lady? \\nI lost my puddin\\'. \\nBut you can get him back, right? I can, my dear. \\nAnything you want. \\nYou promise? \\nYes, child. \\nYou need only bow... \\nAnd serve beneath my feet. \\nI like what you\\'re selling, lady. There\\'s only one teeny problem. You messed with my friends. \\nHer heart\\'s out! \\nWe can ends this. \\nHey, Croc! \\nHarley! \\nPlease, Daddy. \\nDon\\'t do it. \\nThe only way for us to be together is if you don\\'t pull the trigger. Daddy, I love you. \\nPlease, don\\'t do this. \\nThat was a great shot, man. \\nHey, I don\\'t do hugs. \\nI\\'m not a hugger. \\nI\\'m not a hugger. \\nAll right? \\nLet me join my brother. \\nKatana, no! \\nGive me that. \\nYou bring June back. \\nYou bring her back. \\nShe\\'s not coming back. \\nI\\'ll crush this. \\nDo you hear me? \\nYou bring June back \\nPage 48/51\\nor I\\'ll crush this! \\nGo ahead. \\nYou don\\'t have the balls. \\nHey, Flag. \\nJune. \\nShe\\'s gone. \\nI thought I killed you. \\nI thought I killed you. \\nY\\'all don\\'t mind. \\nI got me a sewer to crawl back into. Yeah, and I got some business \\nto handle back in Gotham. \\nI\\'m going to hotwire a car, \\nneed a ride? \\nYour ass is not driving. \\nWhy not? \\nHow are you not dead? \\nWe-we just saved the world. \\nA \"thank you\" would be nice. \\nThank you. \\nYou\\'re welcome. \\nSo, we did all of this \\nand we don\\'t get shit? \\n10 years off you prison sentences. Nah, that\\'s not enough. \\nI\\'m seeing my daughter. \\nThat can be arranged. \\nAn other requests? \\nAn Espresso machine. \\nBET. \\n10 years off a triple life sentence? Darling, I\\'m walking out of here a free man. \\nOr we\\'re to start having \\nsome real fun. \\nWhy don\\'t have some fun? \\nYou\\'re trying to figure out this length. That\\'s the hypotenuse. \\nSo you have to know this angle. Okay. \\nSo, if you\\'re up here... \\n- Like an a building. \\n- Mm. \\nAnd you shoot a man down here \\nPage 49/51\\non the street... \\nThat\\'s how far \\nthe bullet actually goes? \\nYeah. \\nThat\\'s-that\\'s right! \\nYou are so smart. \\nRight. \\nThe hypotenuse, good one. \\nSo that would make you \\nhave to know the angle \\nbetween the building \\nand the sidewalk. \\nYou got to know that angle. \\nYou know, I mean, in real life \\nyou got-you got variables. \\nYou know, you got rifling twist.

You must be the very \\nworst wolf I\\'ve ever seen. \\nYeah, but if that branch didn\\'t break, i would\\'ve made it. \\nCrossing upwind, \\nbreaking from your numbers. \\nIf you can\\'t learn to run with the pack... One of these days, \\nyou\\'ll be someone\\'s dinner. \\n- How\\'d we do? \\n- Not mowgli, again. \\n- He\\'s never gonna make the council. - Let\\'s go! \\nRace you to the top! \\nIt was higher ground. \\nWolves don\\'t hide in trees. \\nI can\\'t keep up with them, bagheera. I tried. I just picked the wrong tree. It was a dead tree. \\nHow was I supposed to know \\nit was dead? \\nIt had a fig vine. \\nAny tree girdled by a creeper \\nis either dead or close to it. \\n- These are things a wolf must know. - Yeah. \\nBut if the branch didn\\'t break, \\ni would\\'ve made it. \\nI realise you weren\\'t born a wolf... But couldn\\'t you at least act like one? Bagheera\\'. When I found him... \\nMany years ago... \\nHe was just an infant, \\nabandoned in the woods. \\nGet the deer! \\nIf he \\nwas going to survive... \\nI knew he needed a people. \\nA people to protect him. \\nPage 2/36\\nThat\\'s why I entrusted him \\nto the wolves. \\nLook well, wolves. \\nAkela was \\na just and noble leader. \\nHe allowed mowgli to dwell \\namong them, all those years. \\nThe trouble was, wolves grew so fast... And mowgli... \\nLet\\'s just say he liked to take his time. Mowgli, pick me up high! \\n- My turn! \\n- Stop. Not now. \\nIt was raksha \\nwho raised him. \\nShe was the only mother he ever knew. - Come on, let\\'s play! \\n- I don\\'t feel like playing, gray. Come on, you\\'re my brother. \\nYou have to play with me. \\nLet\\'s go chase some mice. \\nHow did it go? \\nCaught me again. \\nIf it\\'s meant to be... \\nIt will be. \\nLet me hear the law. \\n\"This is the law of the jungle... \"As old and as true as the sky. \\n\"The wolf that keeps it will prosper... \"But the wolf that breaks it will die. \"Like the creeper that girdles \\nthe tree trunk... \\n\"The law runneth over and back. \\n\"For the strength of the pack \\nis the wolf... \\n\"And the strength of the wolf \\nis the pack.\" \\nSoon, \\nthe rain ceased to fall \\nand the dry season arrived. \\nHeat crept through the jungle... Turning it yellow... \\nThen brown... \\nThen black. \\nPage 3/36\\nBut that year... \\nWas the driest season \\nthat anyone could remember. \\nEven the mohwa didn\\'t flower. \\nMy leaf. \\nThis is mine. Mine, mine, mine. There\\'s a rock. That\\'s mud. That\\'s mud. There\\'s a rock. That\\'s my rock. That\\'s my rock. \\nNobody touches my rock. \\nThere\\'s another rock. \\nTwo rocks. Three rocks. \\nPeace rock? Peace rock! \\nIt\\'s the truce! The water truce! It\\'s the water truce! \\nIt had been \\nmany, many years \\nsince the peace rock was revealed... And the water truce was called. Hunting at the riverbank \\n- was now forbidden... \\nBecause, by law of the jungle, drinking comes before eating. \\nSo, you could come to the peace rock, on a day like this... \\nAnd find all people side-by-side. Don\\'t forget. \\nNo hunting. \\nPlaying ony \\nplaying, only. I got it, ami. \\nAnd remember... \\nNot everyone here has seen \\na man-cub in the jungle before. So, behave yourself. \\nOkay, can I go now? \\nTake the pups with you. \\nWait for me! \\nCome on, gray! \\nOh, take a look at this guy. \\nExcuse me. \\nSorry. \\n- He\\'s walking on two legs. \\n- Don\\'t stare. \\nHey, look. A wild boar. \\nPage 4/36\\n- And a rhino. \\n- And a mongoose. \\nEverybody\\'s here. \\nLs that a peacock? \\n- Ooh, a stick! \\n-Lkkl: \\n- I like this stick. \\n- Seriously, that\\'s my stick. \\n- This is my stick. \\n- No, that\\'s my stick! \\n- Let go of my stick! \\n-Lt\\'s a water truce! \\nIt\\'s a water truce! \\nSorry. \\nMy bad! It\\'s involuntary. \\nLkkl: \\nWatch yourself, please. \\nDad, what is that? \\nI think that\\'s a man-cub. \\nWhat\\'s a man-cub doing here? \\nWhoa. Don\\'t forget the truce. \\nI know the law, bucks. \\nWhat is that? \\n- Weird. \\n- That\\'s weird. \\nAkelai mowgli. \\nWhat was the rule about your tricks? It\\'s not the wolf way. \\nNo more tricks. \\nChin up, little one. \\nWe\\'ll make you a fine wolf, yet. What about me? \\nAm I gonna be a fine wolf? \\nLook at me howl! \\nIn some packs, the runt gets eaten. Oh... \\nMowgli, behind me. \\nDon\\'t leave my side. \\nEveryone comes to peace rock. \\nSo many smells to catch up on. But, um... \\nI can\\'t help but notice... \\nPage 5/36\\nThere\\'s this strange odour today. What is it, this scent that I\\'m on? I almost... \\nI almost think it was some kind of... Man-cub. \\nMowgli belongs \\nto my pack, shere Khan. \\nMowgli? \\nThey\\'ve given it a name. \\nWhen was it we came to adopt \\nman into the jungle? \\nHe\\'s just a cub. \\nDoes my face not remind you \\nof what a grown man can do? \\nShift your hunting ground \\nfor a few years... \\nAnd everyone forgets \\nhow the law works. \\nWell, let me remind you. \\nA man-cub becomes man... \\nAnd man is forbidden! \\n- What do you know about law? \\n- Raksha. \\nHunting for pleasure. Killing for power. You\\'ve never known law. \\nThe cub is mine! \\nMine to me. \\nSo, go back to where you came from, you burned beast! \\nThe tiger knows who rules \\nthis part of the jungle. \\nI\\'m sure he doesn\\'t mean to come here and make threats. \\nEspecially during a water truce. No, I\\'m deeply respectful of these laws that keep us safe. \\nSo, here\\'s my promise. \\nNothing lasts forever. \\nThe rains will return \\nand the river will rise. \\nAnd when this rock disappears, \\nthat truce will end. \\nYou want to protect him, fine. \\nBut ask yourselves, \\nPage 6/36\\nhow many lives is a man-cub worth? Bagheera\". How many lives? \\nWho could answer that question? - The rain! \\n- Rain! \\n- Rain! \\n- The rain! \\nKeep it dry, keep it dry, keep it dry. These quills \\nget stuck on everything! \\nBagheera\". When the rains returned... It was a question \\nthe council had to face. \\nThey deliberated and they argued... For many days. \\nWhat do you think they\\'re talking about? No one had ever \\ncome between the pack before. \\nBut shere Khan\\'s threat... \\nWas not to be ignored. \\nMowgli, you\\'re not supposed \\nto go up there! \\nHe\\'s got to go. \\nLook at the skies. \\nShere Khan may be heading here \\nas we speak. \\nPlease! \\nI\\'m leaving. \\nI don\\'t want to see anyone get hurt. Mowgli, go back to the den! \\nA man-cub belongs with man. \\nWe raised him as one of our own! - He\\'ll have the boy, either way. - Akela. \\nMaybe I can be of help. \\nThe boy\\'s right. \\nMaybe it\\'s time he found another people. - No. \\n-L\\'m the one who brought him to you. And now I\\'ll return him \\nto where he belongs. \\nI won\\'t let you. \\nHe\\'s my cub! \\nWe knew this day would come. \\nPage 7/36\\nWe are the only family he\\'s ever known! Raksha. \\nIt\\'s the only place he\\'ll be safe. It\\'s okay, ami. \\nI won\\'t go far. \\nI\\'ll come back and visit. \\nNever forget this... \\nYou\\'re mine. \\nMine to me. \\nNo matter where you go, \\nor what they may call you... \\nYou will always be... \\nMy son. \\nI wish I could tell you... \\nThat the wolves \\ncould\\'ve fought shere Khan. \\nBut this is not that kind of a tale. The turtles like me. \\nMaybe the crocodiles. \\nWhat about the rhinos? \\nThey always let me hang around. \\nOf course, the rhinos sleep standing up. I don\\'t think I\\'d be very good at that. It\\'s either the turtles or the crocodiles. Which one do you think is better? Bagheerai neither. \\nWhat do you mean? \\nI\\'m bringing you to the man village. What? \\nBagheera, I don\\'t know man. \\nYou will. \\nYou always said \\nwe\\'re not supposed \\nto go near a man village. \\nThat was different. \\nWhy is it different? \\nYou always said, \"stay away \\nfrom the man village... \\n\"Because you might fall in a trap... \"Or get eaten, \\nor get hurt by flying rocks.\" \\nI know what I said. \\nWhoa. Elephants. \\n- Bow your head. \\nPage 8/36\\n- Why? \\nShow them respect. \\nThe elephants \\ncreated this jungle. \\nWhere they made furrows \\nwith their tusks, \\nthe rivers ran. \\nWhere they blew with \\ntheir trunks, the leaves fell. They made all that belongs. \\nThe mountains, the trees... \\nThe birds in the trees. \\nBut they did not make you. \\nThat is why you must go. \\nWhat if I live with the nilgai? No. \\nOr the mongoose? \\nThis is not a discussion. \\nBut this is my home! \\nI don\\'t even know what man\\'s like. You\\'ll learn. \\nBut I wanna stay in the jungle. Why do I have to go there? \\nBecause the jungle \\nis no longer safe for you. \\nYou\\'re being hunted... \\nB\\'! 8 get. \\nOnly man can protect you now. \\nWhoa! \\nThis isn\\'t fair. \\nYou\\'re not giving me a choice. There\\'s a lot of stuff \\nyou\\'re not telling me, too. \\nDon\\'t think I didn\\'t notice. \\nYou say you\\'re taking me \\nwhere I came from... \\nBut you found me in the jungle. Are you bringing me back \\nto the jungle? No. \\nWhy are you bringing me \\nto the man village \\nif you found me in the jungle? And why does the tiger \\nhate me so much? \\nPage 9/36\\nDoes he know me? \\nSure seems like he knows me. \\nDown. \\nWhat? Now we have to bow \\nto the buffalo, too? \\nListen to me. This is not a game. You\\'re gonna run to that ravine. What are you talking about? \\nGo to the north, \\nwhere the sky glows at night. \\nI\\'ll find you on that path. \\nBagheera, I\\'m not taking one \\nmore step until you tell me... Bagheerai run, mowgli! \\nRun! \\nGray, what\\'s wrong? \\nWhy don\\'t you come outside and play? What is that? \\nWhy did he have to leave? \\nGray. \\nWe could\\'ve protected him. \\nWe shouldn\\'t have let him go. \\nI miss him, too. \\nWhat\\'s important is, he\\'s safe now. Get inside. \\nI suppose you know why I\\'ve come. The man-cub has left the jungle. I thought I made myself clear. I wanted him turned over to me. We no longer harbour him. \\nHe has left the pack. \\nAnd where, may I ask, has he gone? He\\'s with his own kind now. \\nSo, the man-cub has left the jungle. Akelai that\\'s right. \\nYou and I no longer have a quarrel. And, most importantly... \\nWe have peace. \\nI guess it\\'s done, then. \\nUnless I can draw him... \\nBack out! \\nAkela! \\nHave I got your attention now? I didn\\'t want it to be this way. \\nPage 10/36\\nI made it so simple. \\nAll I asked for was one thing, and you denied me! \\nThat ends now. \\nSpread the word. \\nUntil I have the man-cub, \\nthese hills are my hills. \\nYou did not respond to reason! So now, you will know fear. \\nBagheera? \\nHmm? \\nHey, there. \\nDo you have a language? \\nYou\\'re kind of cute, I guess. \\nYou want a bite? \\nCome on. \\nCome here. Come on, it\\'s all right. Don\\'t be afraid. \\nCome on. \\nHey, those are mine! \\nHey, come back! \\nThose are mine! \\nDrop it! \\nHello? \\nWho\\'s out there? \\nKaai hi, little cub. \\nOh, no. Don\\'t be scared. \\nI\\'m not gonna hurt you. \\nI was just passing through. \\nI don\\'t want any trouble. \\nThere\\'s no trouble. \\nAre you alone out here? \\nMmm. That\\'s not good. \\nWe should never be alone. \\nI\\'m waiting for a friend. \\nHe should be here soon. \\nI can stay with you, \\nuntil he gets here. \\nWould that be all right? \\nI\\'ll keep you safe. \\nJust you and me, sweet thing. \\nWho are you? \\nKaa. \\nPoor, sweet little cub. \\nPage 11/36\\nWhat are you doing \\nso deep in the jungle? \\nThis is my home. \\nDon\\'t you know what you are? \\nI know what you are. \\nI know where you came from. \\nYou do? \\nYes. \\nWould you like to see? \\nYeah. \\nKaa\". Mostly, men stay in their village... Far from the dark of the jungle. But sometimes... \\nThey travel. \\nAnd when they do... \\nTheir caves breathe in the dark. They call it... \\nThe red flower. \\nMan\\'s creation. \\nIt brings warmth and light... \\nAnd destruction to all that it touches. Who is that? \\nThe traveller, protecting his cub. Shere Khan ended \\nthe man\\'s life that night. \\nBut not before he was burned \\nby the red flower\\'s touch. \\nHe ran so fast, he didn\\'t \\nnotice the cub he left behind. \\nAnd that cub... \\nWas you. \\nThe panther found you. \\nOh, you poor, sweet thing. \\nYou want to stay in the jungle? \\nYou can be with me, if you want. I\\'ll keep you close. \\nLet go of your fear, now. \\nTrust... \\nIn me. \\nRelax, kid. \\nNo need to get worked up. Okay? \\n- Where am I? \\n- Uh... \\nThis is a cave. It\\'s my cave. \\nPage 12/36\\nYou don\\'t remember \\nwhat happened, do you? \\n- No. \\n- I saved your life. \\nYeah, I snatched you \\nfrom the jaws of death. \\nThe coils of death, if you will. And lucky for you... \\nYour new favourite hero, \\nold baloo, here... \\nJust happened to be passing by. Uh, no big deal. \\nJust tell me this. \\nCan you... \\nClimb? \\nYeah. \\nThen let\\'s quit wasting time \\nand get on with it. \\nGet on with what? \\nPayback, kid. Payback. \\nWhat do you mean \"payback\"? \\nPayback for what? \\nYou owe me, kid. \\nYou owe me. You owe me. \\nSlow down. \\n- And you\\'re gonna pay back. \\n- But, but... \\nBecause that\\'s right. \\nYou\\'re gonna do the right thing. That\\'s the right thing to do. \\nYou\\'re gonna pay me back, \\nbecause you owe me. \\nYou got it? \\nOkay, here\\'s our little task. \\nYou see that golden stuff, \\ndripping down there? \\nThat\\'s called \"honey.\" \\nAll you need to do, little one... For payback purposes... \\nIs to just shimmy on up there... And get me that thing up there that\\'s making that funny noise... And bring it back down. \\nYou\\'re kidding me, right? \\nPage 13/36\\nNo, not really. \\nI can get killed \\ngoing up there. \\nKid! \\nKid, kid, kid. Try to understand this. I\\'m a bear. \\nIt means that I have to eat my weight... Every day... \\nFor hibernation purposes. \\nI know I\\'m asking for a lot... \\nBut I don\\'t climb and you do. \\nLook, I really need your help. \\nWinter\\'s coming. \\nYou don\\'t want me to go to sleep... And never wake up. \\nThere are a lot of bees up here. Yeah, some. \\nBut don\\'t worry. These ones don\\'t sting. Attaboy! \\nOw! I\\'m getting stung! \\nOkay \\nI would\\'ve done this myself, \\nbut I\\'m afraid of heights. \\nOh, boy. Here we go again. \\nWhy don\\'t you mind your own business? You can do it! \\n- He\\'s just gonna run away. \\n- Not this one. \\nAs soon as the monkeys get \\nstung, they always run away. \\n- He\\'s not a monkey. A man-cub. - What is he? \\nA man-cub? \\nYeah! Could you keep your voice down? I\\'m trying to concentrate. \\n- Everything going a-okay up there? - Ow! \\nOh, boy. Looks like you got another one. - Buzz off. \\n-Lt\\'s a man-cub. \\n- A man-cub? \\n- Yeah, it\\'s a man-cub. \\n- It\\'s not a monkey? \\n- No, it\\'s a man-cub! \\nPage 14/36\\nYou have never been \\na more endangered species... \\nThan you are at this moment. \\nYou\\'re doing an amazing job! \\nI\\'m getting stung! \\nOh, boy. Here we go again. \\n-It\\'s not a monkey, Fred. \\n-Lt\\'s a man-cub. \\n- A man-cub? \\n- Yeah, it\\'s a man-cub. \\n- Can you believe it? \\n- Are you sure? \\nWould you please shut up? \\nHe)\\', up there! \\nEverything is \\ngoing fantastically, I see. \\nOw! \\nYou got it! \\nBelieve in yourself! \\n-There you go! \\n- Ow! \\nCome on! Almost! \\nYeah! \\nYeah! \\nOh. Yeah! \\nUh-oh. \\nFred? \\nOh, yeah, exfoliate me. \\nYou said they didn\\'t sting. \\nWhat do you call this? \\nHow the heck did you do that? \\nOh, those must have been females! They look like males \\nfrom down here. \\nFemales do sting. \\nJust put some honey on those. \\n- Honey? Really? \\n- Yeah. \\nYou put it on, you lick it off. You feel much better. \\nIt\\'s nature\\'s ointment. \\nI put it everywhere. \\nThanks. \\nOkay, so, we\\'re even now! \\nPage 15/36\\nHold on a minute. \\nWhat\\'s your name anyway? \\nWe were never properly introduced. - Mowgli. \\n- Mowgli? \\nMowgli is a terrific name. \\nI bet you got that one \\nall to yourself, too. \\nHey! \\nMowgli, look... \\nI got a lot of gathering to do \\nthese next couple of weeks... \\nOn account of the hibernation. \\nI could really use your help. \\nYou know, if you stuck around... I can\\'t. I have to go to the man village. Uh... \\nFor what reason, man village? \\nI don\\'t have a choice. \\nThere\\'s a tiger hunting me. \\nReally? Why a tiger? \\nBecause I\\'m a man-cub, all right? Just leave me alone. \\nHey! Mowgli, my friend, \\nmy buddy, my pal. \\nSlow down a second, handsome. \\nBagheera said I have to go \\nto the man village. \\nOh, bagheera! I know him. Sure. You know what his problem is? \\nHe always plays by the rules. \\nAnd, sometimes rules \\nwere meant to be... \\nWell, not necessarily broken, \\nbut certainly bent. \\nAnd definitely reinterpreted. \\nDon\\'t you think? \\nHe told me to go to the man village, so, that\\'s where I\\'m gonna go! \\nOkay, fine. \\nYou wanna go to the man village, have it your way. \\nIn fact, I\\'ll do you one better. I\\'ll take you there myself. \\nPage 16/36\\nCome on, let\\'s go. It\\'s getting late. Bare necessities \\nforget about \\nyour worries and your strife \\nI mean the bare necessities \\nwhat\\'s that? \\nThat\\'s a song about the good life. What\\'s a song? \\nYou never \\nheard a song before? \\nEveryone\\'s got a song. \\nDidn\\'t the wolves ever sing? \\nI don\\'t know. \\nUh... oh... \\nWe recited the law of the jungle. \"This is the law of the jungle... \"As old and as true as the sky. \\n\"The wolf that keeps it may prosper... \"But the wolf that breaks it will die.\" Kid, that\\'s not a song. \\nThat\\'s propaganda. \\nWhat\\'s propaganda? \\nJust a little farther. \\nThat\\'s the man village? \\nYep. You can always \\ntell by the red flower. \\nThey do love their red flower. \\nThe red flower doesn\\'t seem so bad. Yeah. \\nLet it loose, and it destroys \\neverything it touches. \\nDon\\'t ever play with it. \\nYou got that? \\nYeah, I got it. \\nGood. \\nDo you think that\\'s where I\\'m from? Could be. \\nI don\\'t know, kid. Does it look familiar? I don\\'t remember it. \\nAll I remember is living with the wolves. Why do you wanna go there? \\nBagheera said I need a people. \\nAgain, with the listening to bagheera. Hey, he\\'s my friend, okay? \\nPage 17/36\\nNow I don\\'t even know where he is. I can\\'t believe I\\'m leaving \\nthe jungle for good. \\nMay I say just one thing? \\nWhat I saw you do today, \\nI\\'ve never seen anything like it. I\\'ve been trying to get \\nthat honey for years. \\nBut I used my tricks. \\nWhat tricks? \\nYou know... \\nEverything that I built. \\nIt\\'s not the wolf way. \\nWho cares? \"The wolf way.\" \\nThat\\'s the mowgli way. \\nThat\\'s the baloo way. \\nThat\\'s our way. \\nThat\\'s how we get things done. \\nI can\\'t even imagine what kind \\nof potential you\\'d have... \\nIf you had somebody like me \\nhelping you out. \\nYou say you want to go \\nto the man village. \\nI say, you could be a man right here. I\\'ll tell you what. \\nNow you know where the man village is. You can always go down there, \\nwhenever you want. \\nBut I would personally appreciate it... As a personal favour to me, personally... If we just worked together, \\njust us, tricks and all. \\nI think it would be interesting to see... Just how much honey \\nwe could accumulate... \\nBefore winter. \\nWhatever I could do to make \\nyour trickiness happen... \\nL will do. \\nAnd if it turns out to \\nnot be fun for you... \\nI will walk you right down \\nto that man village myself. \\nPage 18/36\\nIs that a deal? \\nJust till winter. \\nJust till winter. \\nAmi, wake up. \\nPups? \\nThey\\'re up there. \\nThe deer, of course, \\ntake comfort in numbers. \\nThey lack defences \\nmost animals will have. \\nAnd if we\\'re being honest... \\nThey\\'re not very smart either. \\nUnlike the mother crocodile, \\nwho is a good deal more clever. But the one you have to watch out for... Is the cuckoo bird. \\nDo you know \\nhow the cuckoo bird survives? \\nBy preying on a mother\\'s weakness. The cuckoo bird is too clever \\nto raise its young. \\nInstead, it sneaks... \\nIts eggs into the nests of simpler birds. So, when they hatch... \\nThe mother bird is fooled. \\nShe feeds them, nurtures them. \\nAnd do you know what happens \\nto her own chicks? \\nThey starve... \\nAnd die... \\nFrom neglect. \\nAll because a mother loved a chick... That wasn\\'t her own. \\nCome now, time for sleep. \\nI think they like me. \\nWhy are you doing this? \\nHe\\'s gone. \\nIsn\\'t that what you wanted? \\nI want him dead. \\nOnce he gets word \\nof what happened here... \\nHe\\'ll come back. \\nAnd I\\'ll be waiting. \\n- That\\'s the first mark. \\nPage 19/36\\n- Got it. \\n- That\\'s the first mark! \\n- Got it! \\nThat\\'s the first mark! \\nMowglii got it! \\nWhoo! \\nYeah, I got it! \\n- Tell him to go to the second mark! - Got it! \\n- Go to the second mark! \\n- Got it. \\nGot it. \\nLook for the \\nbare necessities \\nthe simple bare necessities \\nforget about your worries \\nand your strife \\nI mean the bare necessities \\nold mother nature\\'s recipes \\nthat bring the bare \\nnecessities of life \\nwherever I wander \\nwherever I roam \\nI couldn\\'t be fonder \\nof my big home \\nthe bees are buzzing \\nin the tree \\nto make some honey just for me when you look under \\nthe rocks and plants \\nand take a glance at them fancy ants and then maybe try a few \\nthe bare necessities of life \\nthey\\'ll come to you! \\nWherever! Wander \\nwherever I roam \\nI couldn\\'t be fonder \\nof my big home \\nthe bees are buzzing in the tree to make some honey just for me when you look \\nunder the rocks and plants \\nand then take a glance \\nat them fancy ants \\nPage 20/36\\nand then maybe try a few \\nmmm! Mmm! \\nThe bare necessities of life \\nthey\\'ll come to you \\nthey will come to you \\nyeah, they\\'ll come to you! \\nCome to you! \\nBaloo, baloo, baloo... look. \\nStay low on my back. \\nCome on out and show yourself. Bagheera! Ah! \\nBagheerai mowgli. \\nOh, I was looking everywhere for you! I thought you were gone! \\n- Are you all right? \\n- Yeah! \\nI can\\'t believe you found me! \\nI was so worried about you. \\nI was lost, and I didn\\'t know \\nwhat happened... \\nBut then I met baloo. \\nAnd then he saved me \\nfrom a giant snake! \\nAnd now we\\'re working together! Really? \\nThat\\'s a new wrinkle. \\nI didn\\'t know sloth bears worked. Come on, mowgli, let\\'s be on our way. Wait! \\nYeah, go on ahead. I\\'ll catch up. Don\\'t be mad, okay? \\nWhy would I be mad? \\nBecause you\\'re always mad \\nwhen I do stuff. \\nYou gotta promise \\nnot to be mad this time. \\nShow me, then I\\'ll decide. \\nCome on, check it out! \\nThese are vines I use on the cliff. I twirl them together to make \\nthem longer and stronger. \\nSee how strong they are? \\nYou wanna see the really cool part? It\\'s inside. Come on, let\\'s go! \\nPage 21/36\\nCome on! \\nIt\\'s the honey stash for winter! Have you lost your mind? \\nYou said you wouldn\\'t get mad. Did you listen to anything \\nakela taught you? \\nThere\\'s no place... \\nIn the jungle for these... \\nTricks! \\nYou want to do this, \\nyou do this in the man village. But I\\'m helping baloo \\nget ready for hibernation. \\nBears don\\'t hibernate in a jungle. What are you teaching him? \\nNot full hibernation, but I nap a lot. Listen to me, you con artist! \\nHe may not know your game, but I do. - He\\'s leaving now. \\n- But I don\\'t wanna leave! \\nYou don\\'t have a choice! \\nWhy don\\'t we all just \\nsettle down for a minute. \\nLook, it\\'s gotten late. \\nToo late to travel. \\nSo, why don\\'t we all \\njust have a little honey... \\nI don\\'t eat honey. \\nNo problem. I\\'ll eat the honey. Let\\'s all get a good night\\'s sleep... And we can talk about this \\nin the morning. \\nFine. But we\\'re leaving, first thing. Bagheerai mowgli. \\nWhere is he? \\n- In the pit. \\n- In the what? \\n- Is this your teaching? \\n- Oh, come on! \\nYou know I\\'d never teach him \\nto mess around with elephants. Hey, guys. \\nWhat\\'d I tell you? He\\'s special. I know he\\'s special. \\nPage 22/36\\nI raised him. \\nThen don\\'t make him leave, bagheera! You gotta let him be what he is. You don\\'t understand. \\nThe boy\\'s in danger. \\nI know, he told me. \\nHe\\'s being hunted by a tiger. \\nNot any get. Share Khan. \\nShere Khan\\'s hunting him? \\nOh. \\nBut if you send him back \\nto the man village, \\nthey\\'ll ruin him. \\nThey\\'ll make a man out of him. We should send him back \\nto the wolf pack. \\nWho\\'s their Alpha? \\nAkela, he can protect him. \\nAkela is dead. \\n- What? \\n- Shere Khan killed him. \\nHe will stop at nothing \\nuntil he has this boy. \\nNothing. \\nThe only way we can save him... Is if he goes to that man village. Please, baloo. \\nYou\\'re the only one he\\'ll listen to. Hey, kid. \\nHey. \\nThat was pretty cool, \\nwhat you did back there. \\nBagheera didn\\'t think so. \\nOh, no, I talked to him. \\nHe was very impressed. \\nHe was? \\nWe both were. Yeah. \\nI\\'ve never seen anyone get \\nthat close to an elephant before. So, listen, kid. \\nI gotta talk to you about something. What do you wanna talk about? \\nI\\'ve been thinking. \\nNow that your friend has shown up... Page 23/36\\nMaybe it\\'s time... \\nFor you two to just mosey along. Now it\\'s winter... \\nAnd it\\'s really time for you to go. But I wanna stay here with you. We\\'re buddies, aren\\'t we? \\nHuh? No, we were never friends. I certainly never thought \\nof you as my friend. \\nYou helped me get honey \\nand I don\\'t really need you any more... Do I have to spell this out? \\nI don\\'t want you around any more. I did it. \\nAnd that\\'s about the hardest thing I\\'ve ever done. \\nI know. \\nGo away. \\nGet away from me. \\nStop it. \\nGet away from me! \\nBagheera! \\nMowgli! \\nMowgli, hold on! \\nBagheera! \\nWhat was that? \\nWhere are they taking him? \\nBagheerai this way. \\nMowglii ahh! Ah! \\nWhoa! \\nWe see you! We see you! \\nCome on, jump! \\nAnd watch the claws. \\nGah! \\nUh... \\nI\\'ll take it from here. \\nNo, I\\'m coming. \\nIt\\'s doable... \\nIf I don\\'t have to go too high. Good. Let\\'s get going. \\nAll right. \\nA bird. That can\\'t be a good sign. Baloo. \\nLook at me. Look at nothing but me. Page 24/36\\n- Hmm? \\n- You\\'re doing fine. \\nJust keep your eyes up high. \\nAll right. I\\'m coming. I\\'m coming. What part of the jungle you from? You, man-cub. \\nYou come from the south, the north? What part of the jungle? \\nThe south, I guess. \\nSouthern jungle, the seeonee. \\nBeautiful, I hear. \\nI never been there myself. \\nSo, tell me, you ever had \\na taste of the pawpaw fruit... Down there in the seeonee? \\nSome people call it the... \\nWhat\\'s the word? \\nPapaya. Stolen words. \\nI say pawpaw. \\nGoes to the sound it makes \\nwhen it tumbles to the jungle floor. Try it. \\nGo ahead. \\nIt\\'s good. \\nYou know who I am? \\nNo. \\nI am the king of the bandar-log. Call me Louie. \\nI did it! \\nWell done, old chap. \\nHe must be in there. \\nFollow me. \\nNo, no. \\nWe\\'re on level ground here. \\nI\\'m in charge. \\nAnd I\\'ve got a plan. \\nYou are a man-cub \\nwho wants to live in the jungle. How do you know that? \\nKid... \\nI got ears. My ears got ears. \\nYou wanna live here? \\nYou need a people to protect you. Only I can protect you... \\nPage 25/36\\nAnd I will, for a price. \\nI don\\'t have anything to give you. I think you do. \\nWhat? \\nLook around, man-cub. \\nI got everything. \\nI have plentiful food... \\nEndless treasure... \\nCommand vast legions. \\nBut there\\'s one thing I don\\'t have... And that\\'s the one thing... \\nYou can give me. \\nThe red flower. \\nI don\\'t have that! \\nYou\\'re a man, aren\\'t you? \\nThat\\'s what makes you a man. \\nYou can summon the red flower... And control it. \\nThey told me not to go near \\nthe red flower. \\nYou know why they tell you that? Because once you have it, \\nyou rise to the top of the food chain. Nothing in this jungle can stand up... To the red flower. \\nPlease, I just wanna go. \\nNow, don\\'t try to kid me, man-cub I\\'ll make a deal with you \\nwhat I desire is man\\'s red fire to make my dream come true \\nnow give me the secret, man-cub come on! \\nClue me what to do \\ngive me the power \\nof man\\'s red flower \\nso I can be like you \\noh, ooo-be do \\nI wanna be like you-oo-oo \\nI wanna walk like you, \\ntalk like you too-oo-oo \\nyou\\'ll see it\\'s true-oo-oo, \\nsomeone like me-ee-ee \\ncan learn to be \\nlike someone like you-oo-oo \\nPage 26/36\\nnow you might think \\nit\\'s ridiculous that me \\na gigantopithecus, \\nwould ever dream \\nI\\'d like to team with \\nthe likes of you, man-cub \\nbut together we\\'d have powers \\nall the jungle\\'s treasures, ours I got desire, you got the fire but the dream I dream takes two so, 00-00-00 \\nI wanna be like you-oo-oo \\nI wanna use that flame \\njust the same as you can do \\noh, how magnificus it would be a gigantopithecus like me \\ncould learn to do \\nlike you humans do-oo-oo \\njust one thing we need... \\nTo reach our full potential. \\nBring me that red flower... \\nAnd we will rule this jungle. \\nI will protect you. \\nAnd you will want for nothing, ever again. \\nI can\\'t! \\nYou can\\'t or you won\\'t? \\nI can\\'t! \\nYou will! \\nExcuse me! \\nAnybody? \\nExcuse me... \\nAm I in the right monkey temple? Oh, my gosh. \\nIs that king Louie? \\nThis is so exciting. \\nThe legends do you no justice, sir. You are truly enormous. \\nIn the best way. \\nLook at all of that flesh... \\nJust squatting there... \\nOn an ancient throne. \\nHow majestic. \\nSeize him. \\nPage 27/36\\nHey, hang on. \\nCan you just hang on? \\nI climbed a mountain to see you, and I\\'m not a climber. \\nJust to be in your presence. \\nFor me, this is a dream come true. Oh... Throw him off the cliff. \\nWait, wait, wait. \\nI have no problem with that. \\nI don\\'t have any problem with that. I came up here without an invitation. It was extremely presumptuous of me. Let me interrupt myself. \\nI just gotta say... \\nYou guys are so much handsomer \\nin person than anyone knows. \\nNo one ever gets up close to you. Why? \\nBecause of the smell. \\nThe smell is rough. \\nBut it\\'s not just, \"oh, look at me.\" It\\'s, \"i got the brains.\" \\nYou guys got the know-how. \\nYou got the noggin. \\nYou came up with this stuff, \\nwith the thumb. \\nCome on, show me. \\nHow do you do that? I can\\'t do that. Look, I scratch, I rub, I can grab a fish. But I was hoping, and you may \\nnot be open to this at all... \\nBut I was hoping, \\nand once again, it\\'s a dream... \\nBut I was hoping that I might become... A bandar-log myself. \\nGosh, I wanna be like you. \\nI am hitching my wagon to your star. No one leaves! \\nI can show myself out. Thanks. Bye-bye! We\\'ll try to hold them off. \\nWhere you going, man-cub? \\nStay away from me! \\nYou don\\'t have anyone now. \\nI\\'m your only hope. \\nPage 28/36\\nI can make it real good for you here. Where else you gonna go? \\nI\\'ll go back to the pack! \\nI\\'ll go back to akela! \\nAkela? \\nOh. \\nYou didn\\'t hear? \\nShere Khan killed him. \\nMust\\'ve been on account of you. No! You\\'re lying! \\nDon\\'t run away... \\nFrom who you are! \\nYou hear me? \\nThink about it, man-cub. \\nWe can rule this jungle. \\nNo... \\nListen to reason. \\nGotcha! \\nMowgli! \\nIf anything happens to that kid... I\\'ll never forgive myself. \\n- Bagheera! \\n- Mowgli? \\nStay there. \\nWe\\'ll come around to you. \\nIs it true? \\nWhat? \\nIs akela dead? \\nWe were going to tell you. \\nYou knew! \\nYou both knew! \\nAnd nobody did anything about it! Kid, just hold on. \\nSomeone\\'s gotta do something! \\nWlowgn! \\nThere\\'s no trace of him. \\nWhere could he have gone? \\nCome on! \\nIt\\'s man. \\nHe\\'s come to the jungle. \\nAmi, what\\'s happening? \\nThe red flower. \\nEverybody, get to the river! \\nRed flower. \\nPage 29/36\\nPups, come on. Stay close. \\nLs that mowgli? \\nShere Khan! \\nShere Khan! \\nI\\'m not afraid of you! \\nNo one has to be afraid of you any more! No... \\nI think they\\'re afraid \\nof something else now. \\nThe man-cub is now a man. \\nGray... \\nAlways a proud day... \\nWhen they come of age. \\nYou can fool them, but you can\\'t fool me. I\\'m the one who saw your future. I saw what you\\'d become. \\nCome now, use the red flower. \\nUse it on me like your father did. Show everyone what you really are!

Did you think I would let you grow old? Either I\\'ll devour you \\nor the red flower will. \\nIt\\'s just a matter of time. \\nHow long did you really think \\nyou\\'d survive against me? \\nLonger than your father did? \\nLonger than... akela? \\nI\\'m not afraid of you! \\nDo you hear me? \\nI\\'m done running from you! \\nYou stood your ground, old boy. You stood your ground. \\nAmi, ami! \\nMy son. \\nMowgli! \\n- Lt\\'s mowgli! \\nMowgli. \\nWill you look at that? \\nAnd where they made \\nfurrows in the ground with their tusks...

And \\nnow you\\'re gonna burn. \\nNo! Stop! \\nWho you calling \"pets\"? \\nI ain\\'t no pet! \\nYou got it all wrong! \\nWe\\'re just like you guys. \\nWe hate humans. \\nYeah! That\\'s right! \\nHate them. \\nOh, man, don\\'t get me started on people. Am I right, Duke? \\nYeah, that\\'s why we \\nburned our collars, man! \\nWe burned them \\nto the ground! \\nAnd killed our owners! \\nYeah...

I didn\\'t say that. \\nI said \"friend.\" \\nI meant food... \\nFf lend. \\nYou know what I meant. \\nI\\'m sure lucky \\nI found you, uh... \\nTiberius. \\nAnd, yes, this is \\na very good thing for you, \\nthis whole \\n\"meeting me\" thing. \\nTake off my hood. \\nAh! \\nThe chain! \\nOh! You tried \\nto eat me! \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nYou should be sorry. You \\ndeserve to be locked up. \\nYou\\'re a bad, \\nbad bird. \\nI can\\'t help it. I was born \\nwith killer instincts. \\nThat is just \\nno excuse. \\nYou\\'re right. Even for a \\npredator, I\\'m selfish. \\nI\\'m a selfish predator. \\nIt\\'s no wonder \\nI have no friends. \\nNobody. \\nThis is hopeless. \\nOh, don\\'t... There\\'s \\nno need to cry. \\nPage 19/45\\nI\\'m sorry that I \\nyelled at you before. \\nPlease, take off \\nthe chain. \\nThis time I\\'ll help \\nyou. I promise. \\nTiberius... \\nThis is gonna sound completely horrible, but, um... \\nI don\\'t fully \\ntrust you. \\nOh, no, no, no... \\nBut, I guess everyone \\ndeserves a second chance. \\nAnd you are just \\na lonely, old bird. \\nAnd you do have \\nweird manners \\nbecause you live in a \\nweird shed on a roof. \\nSo, I\\'ll tell you what. \\nIf you find Max... \\nI\\'ll be your \\nbest friend. \\nBest friend? \\nYou and me? \\nWhoa! \\nWhoo! \\nYes! \\nThat sounds nice. \\nLet\\'s do this. \\nOkay. \\nAh... \\nSo, what does \\nthis Max look like? \\nBrown and white. \\nHe\\'s a short-hair, \\nroguishly handsome. \\nHe\\'s got a sparkle \\nin his eye. \\nHe sounds dreamy. \\nYou have no idea. \\nI mean, what? \\nWhatever. Shut up. \\nPage 20/45\\nMmm-mmm. \\nIf my owner comes \\nput on the hood and \\npretend to be me. \\nOkay, thank you! \\nUgh! \\nThe smell is disgusting... \\n...ly good. \\nThis is all so great. \\nLove it here. \\nWhat\\'s... \\nThe... \\nPass... \\nWord\\'? \\nPassword? \\nLook! Look at me. \\nI am your leader. \\nThe leader does not \\nrecite the password. \\nThe leader makes up \\nthe password, idiots. \\nEverybody, I\\'m making up \\na new password right now. \\nThe new password is... \\n\"Don\\'t ask the leader \\nfor the password!\" \\nFollow me. \\nWelcome to the \\nunderbelly, brothers. \\nHome of the Flushed Pets. \\nBrothers and \\nsisters! \\nAs you see, \\nI\\'ve returned from the surface with two new recruits. \\nThese guys are \\nowner-killers! \\nHey, hey! \\nSettle down! \\nGuys, I want you to tell \\nthem how you did it. \\nGo ahead.

Table! \\nIt\\'s flat. \\nToaster! \\nAnd then round on \\njust the end of it. \\nA Spoon? \\nYes, a spoon! \\nExactly. \\nYou can\\'t hurt \\nsomeone with a spoon. \\nYou scoop with a spoon. \\nHow many people \\nwanna know \\nhow to kill somebody \\nwith a spoon? \\nI do! Oh, yeah! \\nOkay. Uh, well... \\nWe used the spoon... \\nHit a button on the \\nmachine on the counter... \\nRight, and it\\'s got those... \\nPage 22/45\\nThe, uh, you know. \\nThose blades. \\nThe, uh... It\\'s got blades! \\nWas it a blender? \\nYou blended somebody? \\nHe talking about \\nthe blender, guys. \\nOh, please, tell me \\nit was a blender! \\nHey,buddy,I don\\'t ask what it\\'s called, we just kill with it. \\nBut it was a blender. \\nWhoo! Do y\\'all hear this? \\nYou know who was \\nlike this? Ricky! \\nRest in peace! \\nRicky was the \\nonly soldier I had \\nthat was ready to \\nkill humans on sight. \\nEverybody else \\nneed a pep talk. \\nNot these two brothers. \\nSee, all of us have suffered \\nat the hands of man. \\nI mean, take me for instance. \\nI was a magician\\'s rabbit \\nfor kids\\' parties. \\nBut then bunny tricks \\nwent out of style. \\nSo, what did \\nmy owner do? \\nMy owner went and \\nleft magic behind \\nand made me disappear... \\nFrom his life! \\nUh-huh. \\nI lived \\nin a tattoo parlor! \\nThe trainees used \\nto practice on me! \\nUntil they ran out \\nof space! \\nI mean, yes, \\nPage 23/45\\nhumans say they love us. \\nBut then they turn around \\nand throw us out like garbage. Ain\\'t that right, \\nSea-Monkeys? \\nIt\\'s not our fault we \\ndon\\'t look like the ad! \\nYeah! \\nAll right, you guys \\nare joining the brotherhood. \\nIt\\'s initiation time! \\nOh, yeah! \\nThe what? I\\'m sorry, what time? Summon the Viper! \\nUh, is this \\nViper poisonous? \\nBecause I should warn you, \\nI\\'m very allergic to poison! \\nOw! \\nAll right. \\nShow her! \\nMax\\'s collar! \\nWhere is he? \\nWhat happened to him? \\nI ain\\'t saying \\nnothing! \\nYou\\'re gonna tell \\nus where Max is. \\nAnd you\\'re gonna \\ntell us now! \\nIs this supposed \\nto scare me? \\nI\\'m a cat. \\nI land on my feet. \\nDoes it always happen? \\nBecause your head looks like \\nit\\'s taken a lot of landings. \\nDo you want me \\nto cut you? \\nBeoause I\\'ll cut you this way and that. You\\'ll look like a waffle. \\nOkay. \\nHe\\'s too stupid to talk, \\nand too ugly to eat. \\nPage 24/45\\nI\\'m done \\nplaying nice! \\nWhere is Max? \\nOW. \\nTell me! \\nOoh! \\nLet me finish... Ow! \\nHelp me! Ow! \\nDon\\'t look at him. Look at me. Nobody can help you! \\nWhere is Max? \\nOkay! Okay! \\nHe\\'s in the sewers! \\nHe got taken! \\nPlease!

Okay, \\nhere\\'s the thing, though. \\nTiny Dog \\nCan I call you \\n\"Tiny Dog\"? \\nIt fits you. \\nLet\\'s admit that. \\nLook. \\nBetween you and the fat \\ndog, I like you the best. \\nOh, thank you! \\nTiny Dog\\'s gonna go first. \\nEverybody, \\nTD\\'s going first! \\nNo,no,no. \\nTiny Dog does not want to go first. Page 25/45\\nTake the fat dog! \\nSnake bite! \\nNo, no, no. \\nStop! \\nSnake bite! Snake bite! \\nSnake bite! \\nNo,no,no,no. \\nStop! \\nWhat are you doing initiating \\na couple domestics? \\nDomestics? \\nYeah. We just jumped \\nthose two in the alley. \\nSlashed off their collars. \\nNo,no,no. \\nThat\\'s not true. \\nYou said you \\nburned your collars. \\nWell, \"burned,\" \"lost,\" \\n\"had them stolen by cats.\" \\nIt\\'s all just words, \\nreally, isn\\'t it? \\nYou don\\'t deserve to \\nbe marked by the Viper. \\nOh, no. We\\'ll just \\nshow ourselves out. \\nYou deserve \\nto be eaten \\nby the Viper. \\nGet those leash lovers! \\nHold on. \\nGo get them, \\nDuke. Whoa! \\non... \\nUh, fellas, that \\nwas an accident. \\nYou squished \\nthe sacred Viper! \\nHe\\'s a flapjack. \\nOh, Viper! \\nViper, you in a better place! \\nYou and Ricky! \\nYou ain\\'t never did \\nnothing to nobody! \\nPage 26/45\\nWell, you bit a lot \\nof people, Viper. \\nSo, technically, you might \\nactually deserve this. \\nThis might be something \\nthat was long overdue. \\nBut it shouldn\\'t have came like this. Not on my watch. \\nGet them! \\nOh, no! \\nCome on! \\nAh! Wait up, Duke! \\nHyah! \\nWe\\'re sorry. Can this be \\nover now? \\nWe\\'ve got a problem. \\nWe have so \\nmany problems. \\nWhich one do you \\nmean at this moment? \\nStop running, dummies! \\nStop it right now! \\nHold your breath! \\nHold my breath? Ah! \\nGet them! \\nThis is my least favorite part of this whole thing so far! \\nFriends! \\nI am afraid that I have \\nsome terrible news. \\nThe squirrels are gonna \\ntake over the world! \\nI knew it! \\nI always said, squirrels are \\nlittle shifty little guys. \\nNo. We\\'re not doing the squirrel thing right now. That\\'s not... No! \\nMax is missing! \\nHe\\'s out there somewhere. \\nLost. Scared. \\nSo, so handsome. \\nWe have got to find him \\nand bring him home! \\nPage 27/45\\nBut the outside world \\nis loud and scary. \\nOoh! Is that a hawk? \\nThis is my friend, Tiberius. \\nHe\\'s going to help us. \\nHe\\'s not going to eat us. \\nWe\\'ve already been over it. \\nCome on, Gidget. We go out \\nthere without a leash... \\nWe\\'ll get \\ncaught by a net. \\nOr something worse! \\nYeah, like a hawk! \\nWe\\'re wasting time! \\nMax needs us! \\nCome on, girl, Max doesn\\'t \\neven know you\\'re alive. \\nWell, I don\\'t care! \\nI love him! I love him \\nwith all of my heart! \\nAnd I\\'m gonna go look for Max, no matter who\\'s with me. \\nSo... \\nWho\\'s with me? \\nAll right, fine. Fine. \\nOh, come on, guys. \\nI can\\'t believe you. \\nWhen I got my claws \\ncaught in the curtains \\nwho pulled me down? \\nMax did. \\nBuddy, Mel. \\nWhen you were fixed, who taught you to sit the comfortable way? Max did! \\nMax did! \\nMax did. \\nHe did it! \\nAnd when that random cat \\ntried to eat Sweetpea \\nwho saved him? \\nIt wasn\\'t a random cat. \\nIt was you. \\nThe identity of the random \\nPage 28/45\\ncat is not the point. \\nWe\\'re talking \\nabout who saved him! \\nMax did! \\nWe gotta save him. We \\ngotta go save Max! Yeah! \\nYeah! Let\\'s go \\nsave Max! \\nUh, which one \\nis Max, again? \\nUm... \\nTiberius! \\nNo! Bad, bad bird. \\nNice little guy. \\nNice little guy. \\nI like this bird. \\nCrazy bird. \\nCome on! \\nWe gotta get to shore. \\nI only know the doggy paddle! \\nAnd I don\\'t know it well! \\nSwim, Tiny Dog. Swim! \\nDuke! \\nHelp! \\nMax, grab the ring! \\nI can\\'t! \\nKeep it up, Max! \\nYou\\'re doing... \\nWell, you\\'re not \\ndoing great. \\nBut you\\'re not drowning, \\nand that\\'s something! \\nYou\\'re almost there! \\nThanks, Duke. \\nNo problem. \\nFinally. \\nI\\'m going home. \\nOh. \\nIsn\\'t home that way? \\nAh! Seriously? \\nThey\\'re going \\nto Brooklyn. \\nThey say everyone\\'s going \\nto Brooklyn these days. \\nPage 29/45\\nIt\\'s making \\na real comeback. \\nI\\'m not talking about \\nhipster real estate trends. \\nI\\'m talking about \\nvengeance,Tattoo! \\nDeath is coming \\nto Brooklyn. \\nAnd it\\'s got buck teeth \\nand a cotton tail. \\nLet\\'s go! \\nWhee! \\nHi, how are you? \\nChug! Chug! Chug! \\nWhat is this crazy joint? \\nThis is Pops\\' place. \\nHis owner is never home, \\nso it\\'s kind of a hot spot. \\nPops knows everyone \\nin this city. \\nIf he agrees to help us, \\nMax is as good as found. \\nCool! \\nFabulous! \\nTell me \\nyou got that! \\nOh, heck yes, I did. \\nWhat\\'s up, Peanut? \\nHey, Buddy. \\nYou see Pops \\naround here? \\nYeah, he\\'s over there. \\nHey, Pops. \\nMud and sweet potatoes. \\nPops! \\nWho\\'s that? What? \\nOh, \\nhey, Buddy. \\nHow you been, \\nold-timer? \\nParalyzed. \\nGreat! Listen, \\nMr. Pops, \\nour friend Max \\nPage 30/45\\nwas taken. \\nLast we heard, \\nhe was lost in the sewers. \\nBuddy said that maybe \\nyou could help us. \\nYou know, I do know \\na guy in the sewers, \\nbut, ah, \\nI don\\'t \\ngo out anymore. \\nWhat a waste of time. \\nWho said that? \\nOh, I said it. \\nBy the way, I meant \\nno offense, I just... \\nHave you seen yourself? \\nWelly-well, \\nwell, well... \\nLooky what we \\napparently have here. \\nMeezy would like \\nto have a look-see. \\nMyron! Brows! \\nOh, no. \\nOh, yes. \\nMe like what me see. \\nWell, what me can see. \\nIt\\'s all \\nan attractive blur. \\nUh.

Time \\nto work the gift. \\nPage 31/45\\nNo, no, no! \\nOkay, this\\'ll be fine. \\nWe\\'re fine. \\nWe can find our way home. \\nWe are descended \\nfrom the mighty wolf! \\nWe have raw, primal instincts \\nthat are mere \\nmoments away \\nfrom kicking in \\nand leading us home! \\nI cannot wait! \\nHere it comes! \\nAnything? \\nNo. \\nWait! Oh, I... \\nNo. \\nI don\\'t \\nknow, Duke. \\nMaybe the legend of dogs coming from wolves is just wrong. \\nMaybe one puppy asked his mom, \"Where did we come from?\" \\nAnd the mom said, \\n\"Woof.\" \\nAnd the kid was \\nlike \"Oh, wolves?\" \\nAnd she was like, \\n\"Yeah, fine.\" \\nSausage. \\nHuh? \\nYou smell that? \\nOh, man, it is. \\nSausage! \\nWell, then, \\nwhat are we waiting for? \\nWe\\'re coming \\nfor you, baby! \\nLower the ramp, \\ndummy. \\nWho are they? \\nThis is Puffball, \\nSquash-Face, \\nWeiner Dog, \\nPage 32/45\\nYellow Bird, \\nEagle-Eye, \\nGuinea Pig Joe. \\nAnd, of course, \\nmy girlfriend Rhonda. \\n100% wrong. \\nGood enough. \\nCome on! Let\\'s go! \\nMove it or lose it! \\nEvery bird instinct \\nI have says \\ndon\\'t follow a dog \\non wheels. \\nUm, Mr. Pops, sir. \\nShouldn\\'t we be \\nheading to the sewers? \\nNow, if we take \\nthe human route, \\ngetting there is \\ngonna take days. \\nYou may have lots of time, \\nbut for me every breath \\nis a cliffhanger. \\nSo, we gotta take \\nthe secret route. \\nOkay.

Just ignore what \\njust happened. Okay? \\nYes! \\nYou know what? \\nThis may be the \\nsausage talking, \\nbut you\\'re okay. \\nRight back \\nat you, man. \\nWhen I met you, \\nI was all like, \\n\"I don\\'t know \\nif I like him.\" \\nBut now that \\nI know you, I\\'m like, \\n\"I like him.\" \\nYou know, I saw this \\nplace from the outside \\nmany times. \\nPage 36/45\\nHad I known what treasures \\nawaited within these walls, \\nI would\\'ve \\nbroke down that door \\na long time ago, \\nI\\'ll tell you! \\nWhat are you \\ntalking about? \\nMy old owner and I \\nused to live around here. \\nDuke, man, wait. \\nDid you used \\nto have an owner? \\nWell, it was \\na long time ago. \\nI don\\'t want \\nto talk about it. \\nYes, you do. \\nCome on. \\nI don\\'t know. \\nBut you know what? \\nHe was so cool. \\nYeah? \\nYeah. \\nHe was the best. \\nMan, we had fun. \\nWe\\'d play fetch. \\nWe\\'d go for walks. \\nWe\\'d take naps. \\nWe were both big nappers. \\nI got out one night, chasing \\na butterfly, or a car. \\nBy the time I had caught \\nup with it and ate it... \\nProbably a butterfly, \\nthen. \\n...I realized I was so \\nfar away from my home \\nI couldn\\'t find it. \\nA few days later, I was \\npicked up by Animal Control. \\nI had \\na great thing going. \\nBut I had to go \\nPage 37/45\\nand mess it up. \\nDuke, we gotta go \\nto your house. \\nNah. \\nYour owner\\'s gonna \\nbe relieved! \\nWill he? \\nYeah, but... \\nBut he never \\ncame for me. \\nMaybe he... \\nMaybe he didn\\'t like me. \\nOf course he liked you. \\nHe was your owner. \\nI mean, he\\'s probably \\nworried sick! \\nI don\\'t know. \\nWell, I do know \\nand we\\'re going! \\nYour owner\\'s \\ngonna freak! \\nI\\'m freaking out \\njust thinking about it. \\nOkay. \\nLet\\'s do it! \\nThere they are! \\nAll right, doggy, \\ncome on. \\nHey, hey, hey! \\nWhere do \\nyou think you\\'re going? \\nCome back here, you dogs! \\nThat rabbit... \\nHe had crazy eyes. \\nThere ain\\'t no curing what\\'s \\nwrong with that thing! \\nGidget, \\nhere\\'s an idea. \\nMaybe there\\'s a dog in the \\nneighborhood that looks like Max. Start hanging out with him. \\nAfter a while, \\nyou\\'ll think it\\'s him \\nyou\\'ll be done. \\nPage 38/45\\nWe are not \\njust giving up! \\nWe\\'re dedicated. \\nWe\\'re loyal. \\nWe\\'re easily the \\ngreatest pet ever. \\nWe\\'re dogs! \\nCat. \\nHawk. \\nWell, congratulations! \\nToday you\\'re dogs, whether \\nyou like it or not! \\nSweet. \\nNow let\\'s find Max \\nbefore that rabbit does! \\nBreak! We\\'re dogs! \\nOh. \\nI don\\'t like it. \\nSassafras... \\nYep, they were here. \\nExcellent \\nWe\\'re closing in! \\nThis is groundbreaking \\nevil behavior, people. \\nGroundbreaking! \\nOh! \\nA light bulb just \\nwent off in my brain. \\nThe bunny has an idea. \\nOkay, so, uh, \\nhow do I look? \\nYou look great. \\nHow do I smell? \\nLike a dog, Duke. \\nRelax, man. \\nThere it is. \\nWell, go on up. \\nGo scratch \\nat that door. \\nRemember that sausage factory? That was fun, huh? \\nAre you stalling? \\nNo. Why do you \\nthink that? \\nPage 39/45\\nLet\\'s have a long talk about \\nwhy you think I\\'m stalling. \\nDuke, you have nothing \\nto be nervous about. \\nYour owner is going to \\nbe thrilled to see you. \\nOkay. \\nHuh. That car is new. \\nCan I help you? \\nNo. We\\'re good, thanks. \\nYou\\'re not good. \\nYou look dirty. \\nAnd I\\'m gonna have to ask \\nyou to get off my lawn \\nbefore I get, um, \\nwhat you have. \\nThis is my lawn. \\nDuke, maybe \\nwe should go. \\nAnd why would \\nFred get a cat? \\nHe hates cats. \\nThat\\'s one of the things \\nI love about him. \\nFred? The old guy? \\nHe, um... \\nHe died. \\nDuke, maybe I made a mistake, \\nsaying we should come here. \\nLet\\'s go. \\nYou\\'re a liar! \\nMax, cats lie \\nall the time. \\nDon\\'t fall for it! \\nWho are they? \\nHey, this is my home. \\nGo away! \\nDuke, it\\'s time \\nto go. \\nDuke, let\\'s go! \\nCome on! \\nThis isn\\'t your home \\nanymore. \\nWhy did you \\nPage 40/45\\nbring me here, Max? \\nWait a minute. \\nThis is my fault? \\nI was trying \\nto help you! \\nYou were trying \\nto get rid of me! \\nYou know what, Duke? \\nI don\\'t need this. \\nI\\'ll see you later. \\nGotcha! \\nCome on, settle down! \\nGo home, Max! \\nHey, help me out, here! \\nHold on! \\nI\\'m coming! \\nLet\\'s go. \\nFinally \\ngot you, big fella. \\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. \\nCome on. \\nThis is it for you. \\nDuke! \\nAw. \\nKoochi koochi koo! \\nTiny Dog! \\nAh, are you kidding me? \\nYou thought \\nthis was over, Tiny Dog? \\nStop! \\nHuh? \\nJab, jab, jab! \\nBody blow!

Yes, yes, fine. \\nJust keep your eyes on the road. You\\'re driving like an animal! Whoo-hoo! \\nWhat was that? \\nOh, that was a pothole. \\nYou\\'re hitting \\nthings on purpose! \\nHeh.

I guess what I\\'m \\ntrying to say is... \\nIf you ever wanna... \\nPage 43/45\\nOkay \\nOh, great. \\nYou\\'re in love. \\nHow gross for everyone. \\nNow move it! \\nGood-bye! See you later! \\nGood-bye! \\nDoes anyone know \\nwhere we are? \\nBye, Max. \\nBye, Gidget. \\nOkay, bye-bye! \\nSee you guys. \\nMan, I feel sorry \\nfor them. \\nGotta run home \\nto their owners. \\nNot us. \\nNow, it\\'s back to \\nour primary mission. \\nThe downfall of \\nthe human race! \\nIt is on, humans! \\nIt is on! \\nYeah! \\nMommy! Can I have a bunny? \\nAnd a pig and a \\ncrocodile and a lizard? \\nUh-oh. \\nYay, bunny! \\nJab, jab, jab! \\nBody blow! Body blow! Break-away move. Aww... \\nWhat\\'s going on? \\nWhat\\'s she doing? \\nBunny, I\\'m gonna love you \\nforever and ever and ever. \\nAww.

Wait... \\nPage 44/45\\nYeah, that\\'s her. \\nThat\\'s her. \\nKatie! \\nThere they are! \\nMax and Duke, \\nDuke and Max! Aw! \\nMy boys! \\nSo, how\\'d it go? \\nGreat, right? I... \\nUh... \\nSo, maybe a few bumps. \\nBut I knew this \\nwas gonna work out. \\nSo, who\\'s hungry? \\nWelcome home, Duke. \\nThanks, Max. \\nCome on, man. \\nHurry it up. \\nOkay. \\nI\\'m coming, \\nI\\'m coming. \\nSheesh! \\nWelcome, my dogs. \\nOh, you guys \\nlook weird. \\nHurry up, come on in. \\nYou said it was \\na costume party. \\nWhy do you \\nlisten to me? \\nI\\'m home, Leonard. \\nWere you \\na good boy, Leonard? \\nAll right, party\\'s over. \\nPage 45/45\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScripts.com \\nZootopia By Jared Bush \\nPage 1/11\\nFADE IN: \\nEXT. RABBITON, USA \\nYOUNG BUNNIFER GOODWIN is starring in an elementary school production of “How to Exposit the Premise of Your Entire Universe Without Really Trying”. CGI YOUNG BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nMany years ago, predator animals had a nasty habit of killing and devouring us prey animals, which kind of prevented us from getting along. But we were able to get past all that once predators adapted to, I dunno, absorb nutrients from the atmosphere or something? \\n(shrugs) \\nSo since then we’ve had an alternate evolutionary history where we were the ones to develop human intellect, language and technology. We even had the foresight to develop the opposable digits necessary to use that technology, instead of bumbling around trying to work stuff with our mouths like certain Good Dinosaurs we could name. \\n(snorts) \\nAnyway, in this advanced animal civilization, it’s my dream to grow up to be a police officer! \\nCGI ASSHOLE FOX KID \\nHur hur, a rabbit cop? Don’t you go gettin’ ideas above yer station, you uppity lagomoron! \\nCGI YOUNG BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nThat’s the kind of bigoted thinking civilization needs to rise above! Animals should be judged not by the diet of their species, but by the content of their character! #bunnylivesmatter \\n(pause) \\nOh. So that’s what kind of movie this is. \\nCGI ASSHOLE FOX KID \\nYup! And just to remove any lingerin’ threat of subtlety, they’ve given me the only redneck accent in town, a-HYUCK! Or in other words, we’re protestin’ ethnic stereotypes by usin’ a whole ’nother ethnic stereotype. CGI YOUNG BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nSpeaking of annoying one-dimensional cartoons: to the police academy! EXT. POLICE ACADEMY \\nYears later, BUNNIFER trains at the POLICE ACADEMY for one twenty-second throwaway montage, before graduating top of her class and preparing to move to ZOOTOPIA to be a POLICE OFFICER. \\nCGI BUNNY HUNT: \\nHave fun in the big city, sweetheart! But also be careful. You should take this canister of fox repellent, which is a product that in this world ought to be about as legal as a real-life can of “Mexican-B-Gone”. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nPage 2/11\\nHold on, at the police academy most of the prejudice seemed to be that I was too small and weak to be taken seriously as a candidate. And now when I go off to the big city you’re giving me some mace to protect myself against “predators”. \\n(examines canister) \\nPINK mace! Is this movie trying to make a point about race politics, or gender politics? \\nCGI BUNNY HUNT: \\nIt’s making whatever point you want it to make! Rule number one about putting social commentary into your family movie: maximum vagueness equals maximum deniability. \\nEXT. ZOOTOPIA \\nBUNNIFER moves to ZOOTOPIA, a huge multi-ecosystem city where many species intermingle. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nBoy, this place is such a melting pot! Isn’t it beautiful that, in this world so full of prejudice and hate, there can be a place where all the different species come together like this? \\n(pause) \\nWell, all the MAMMALS, of course. All those gross non-mammal species can go fuck themselves. Fuckin’ lizards and birds and shit. \\n(shudders) \\nShe goes to her first day at the POLICE STATION, where she serves under POLICE CHIEF IDRIS ELBUFFALO. \\nCGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO \\nThere’s been a rash of disappearances, all predators. This is our number one priority, people! By which I mean our only priority. I’m assigning every officer to this case, every last one of them, so I guess for the time being all other criminals can just go nuts. \\n(pause) \\nOh, except for those heinous parking violators! Bunnifer, I’m putting you on parking duty. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nSure, okay. I guess since it’s my first day ever on any form of active duty it stands to reason that the most menial assignment would fall to me. You’re only being reasonable here. \\nCGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO \\nHa, what movie do you think you’re watching? I’m being super duper racist, of course! \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nOh, well in that case this is BULLSHIT! That’s it, I’m gonna be unforgivingly militant in handing out tickets the split second any meter expires anywhere in the city, and thus prove myself good enough to escape \\nPage 3/11\\nthe career purgatory that is parking duty! \\nCGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO \\nBoy, this explains SO MUCH about parking inspectors. \\nBUNNIFER goes and hands out A HUNDRED BAJILLION PARKING TICKETS. While out she sees JASON BATEFOX being refused service at an ELEPHANT ICE CREAM STORE. \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\nCome onnn, sell me one of your giant elephant-sized ice pops! It’s a birthday treat for my son here. Kindly fail to notice his distinctive giant ears which ought to make it obvious to anybody that he isn’t even the same species as me. \\nCGI ELEPHANT: \\nMeh, all you foxes look the same. But either way, fuck off, I’m not selling you anything. \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\nI don’t suppose that would be out of legitimate concern about me giving my supposed toddler twenty times his own body weight in sugar? \\nCGI ELEPHANT: \\nNope, it’s just another fun fun fun case of rrracism! \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nNot so fast! I’ll step in and force you to serve these guys or else I’ll file charges against you for health code violations! Rather than, say, breaking anti-discrimination laws, which I guess don’t exist here?? BUNNIFER pays for JASON’S ICE POP. \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\nHeh heh heh, SUCKER! Now I’m gonna melt this thing down into many tiny ice pops, then sell them to lemmings, who would regard them as full size and thus pay full price! ...Which kind of raises the question of how the hell you could even have a functioning economy when some citizens require literally hundreds of times as much nutrition, space, energy and general resources as others. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nWell I guess you could just pay the smaller animals less money for equal work OH GOD IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE. \\n(shakes fist) \\nAnyway, curse you, you vulpine stereotype, you’ve disillusioned me with your slightly dishonest and vaguely unethical pseudo-scam! She goes home feeling DEPRESSED and ANGRY and JADED ABOUT ALL DAMN CIVILIZATION, which, once again, really clears up a whole bunch about PARKING INSPECTORS. But on her next shift she espies a thief on the lam! CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nAha, a chance to thwart an actual crime! I’ll just chase him into a Page 4/11\\nminiature rodent town where I’ll stomp around like a kaiju, causing massive property damage and risking the life and limb of countless civilians. PROTECT AND SERVE! \\n(charges through tiny traffic, nearly kills a thousand people) CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO \\nDamnit Bunnifer, I racistly, but also kinda legitimately, won’t stand for your reckless heroics! You’re through! Turn in your badge and - well, this entire police force seems weirdly devoid of guns, but turn in your badge at least. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nTurn in my badge? Crap, you just awakened Bigyellinchief, the god of police chief clichés! \\nCGI JENNY UNGUSLATE \\n(pokes head in) \\nSay Idris, as the sheep assistant mayor, I just wanted to know that as of RIGHT NOW the mayor is breathing down your neck about letting Bunnifer help find one of those missing predators. \\nCGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO \\nAw damnit. Well if I’m stuck with police chief clichés I might as well go all out. YOU HAVE FORTY-EIGHT HOURS TO SOLVE THE CASE! \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nOoh, that one’s a cherry. \\nBUNNIFER looks at the LAST KNOWN PHOTO of a MISSING OTTER and discovers that he was eating one of JASON’S FRAUDULENT CONFECTIONS. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nSo the last random shot of this otter tells me he’d moments earlier spoken to the ONE civilian from this entire giant metropolis who I’ve had a meaningful encounter with? I smell a Mystery Full of Big Convenient Coincidences in the offing! \\nEXT. STREET \\nBUNNIFER goes and blackmails JASON. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nI have here in my hand a recording that incriminates you, so help me find the otter! Funny how nonchalantly I’m threatening you when you’re a predator twice my size and I’ve been raised to believe your kind are all violent murderers. \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\nDamnit, while it would be both extremely easy and entirely in character for me to just grab the recording device you\\'re waving under my nose and hurl it into a storm drain, I guess I\\'ll cave and work with you instead. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nGreat! We\\'re gonna be such a comically mismatched odd couple! You, a fox, which folklore has always characterized as a quick-witted troublemaker, your textbook trickster archetype; and me, a rabbit, which folklore has \\nPage 5/11\\nalways characterized as a quick-witted troublemaker, your textbook trickster - hey wait a minute. \\nThey go to the NUDIST COLONY where the OTTER was headed, where they learn about him getting into a LIMO. \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\nWell that’s all the intel I had, can I go now? \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nWait! I don’t have access to motor vehicle records, so instead of asking any of my fellow cops to look up that limo’s details I’ll get you to use your contact at the DMV! \\nThey go and do that SLOTH TRAILER at the DMV. \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\nWell now I’m REALLY out of useful information, can I go NOW? CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nWait! I need to use you as a flimsy justification for breaking into a parking lot! \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\n(sighs) \\nSo we’re just gonna keep scrounging up increasingly strained reasons to keep me around until I stop hating you, huh. \\nThe LIMO turns out to belong to a MOB KINGPIN called “MR. BIG”, by whose GUARDS they are suddenly SEIZED. \\nINT. UNCLEVER GODFATHER PARODY \\nBUNNIFER and JASON are brought before MR. BIG, who turns out to be MAURICE LaSHREW. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nHaw, a shrew! He’s called “Mr. Big” and he has a big car and a big office and his henchmen are giant polar bears, but then AW SNAP it turns out he’s actually the SMALLEST of all mammals! What a funny twist! CGI JASON BATEFOX \\nIndeed! And now I’ll make a joke about selling him a rug made entirely from the hair from a single skunk’s butt, oh wait I already made that joke ages ago and ruined the whole “he’s tiny” punchline ooops. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nAnyway, you don\\'t scare me, Maurice! You can\\'t stop me from finding out what happened to that otter! \\nCGI MAURICE LASHREW \\nWell I wasn\\'t involved, so what do I care. In fact, the otter was a friend of mine, so presumably I\\'d WANT this matter cleared up. With all that in mind, I think the most logical course of action would be to have you, a police officer, murdered. I am a smart mobster. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nShit, I need another absurdly convenient coincidence to save my ass. Maybe I could just borrow that horrible one from Training Day? \\nPage 6/11\\nIt suddenly turns out that some RANDOM WOMAN whose LIFE BUNNIFER SAVED earlier in the movie is an IMMEDIATE RELATIVE of the GANGSTER who is now about to MURDER HER. \\nCGI MAURICE LASHREW \\nAll is conveniently forgiven! As for that otter, I don’t know where he is. He ran off after he mysteriously went berserk and attacked my driver. One moment he was an ordinary decent mob-connected nudist otter, the next he was like a snarling beast! \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nAll right then, since you care about the otter and the clock is ticking on my investigation, I’m sure you’ll agree I should go talk to that driver immediately \\nCGI MAURICE LASHREW \\nOr you could waste several hours attending the wedding of a stranger. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nOr that could happen, sure. \\nEXT. RAINFORESTTOWN \\nEventually BUNNIFER and JASON go to talk to the JAGUAR LIMO DRIVER (a LIMO DRIVER who is a JAGUAR, not the driver of a JAGUAR LIMO), but HE TOO has gone FERAL and tries to KILL THEM! They manage to RESTRAIN HIM and call in REINFORCEMENTS, but by the time IDRIS and the other COPS arrive, the DRIVER has disappeared. \\nCGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO \\nBunnifer, you ass! Clearly this whole tale of a jaguar gone savage is the product of your malfunctioning bunny imagination! \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nWell you could always go and see his smashed-up house if you want proof. It’s like two minute’s walk from here. The door’s open and everything. CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO \\nEnough of your nonsense! Your forty-eight hours are up, hand in your CGI JASON BATEFOX \\nHold it! I’d like to point out that the thirty-eight hours she’s had so far is LESS than forty-eight, because of how numbers work. \\nCGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO \\nCurse you and your technicalities! Fine, I’ll give you the remaining ten hours. Plus like ten more, I guess, seeings it’s nighttime again by the time you actually solve the case. \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\nAll right Bunnifer, I suggest we track what happened to that driver by using traffic cameras, which monitor every square foot of every street throughout all of Zootopia, even in deserted little backwaters like this one. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nThen how the hell was that picture from the otter’s file the “last known Page 7/11\\nimage” of him? Considering everything we wind up learning about the case, shouldn’t the cops have been able to track his every move from the get-go and solved this thing in under an hour? \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\nLuckily for you, it would seem not! \\nEXT. CREEPY ABANDONED HOSPITAL \\nBUNNIFER and JASON track the DRIVER to some LAB which is guarded by an army of WOLVES. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nWolves? Right before he went nuts, the otter was heard ranting about \"night howlers\". Wolves howl at night! That\\'s what he must have meant! CGI JASON BATEFOX \\nThen why wasn\\'t he ranting about, you know, \"wolves\"? That\\'s the word most people use for wolves. If he\\'d been attacked by camels would he have been yelling about \"desert walkers\"? Seriously, it\\'s a good thing this revelation turns out to be a red herring, because it\\'s fucking stupid. They sneak into the LAB, where it turns out all the MISSING PREDATORS are being kept captive by MAYOR OF ZOOTOPIA J.K. LIONS. \\nCGI J.K. LIONS \\nAnother one! For the fifteenth time, a predator has flipped out and gone feral! Why is this happening? And how have we been able to find out about each incident and kidnap the subject before they were able to hurt anybody or be seen or leave any evidence whatsoever? None of it makes any sense! CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nHoly crap! This is a conspiracy that goes all the way to the mayor, who happens to be a huge intimidating lion! It’s going to be a real challenge for me, a bunny rabbit nobody takes seriously, to bring down INT. PRESS CONFERENCE \\nThe MAYOR has been ARRESTED and BUNNIFER is a HERO. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nOh. Well that was really, really easy. \\nCGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO \\nGo on, Bunnifer, talk to the press. Since this is a potential PR disaster involving corrupt politicians, controversial police officers and some kind of unexplained plague, normally we’d coach you on what you should and shouldn’t say, but pfffft, that sounds like hard work, just wing it. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nAll right, I think I can do this. \\n(to press) \\nWell clearly predators are all just vicious, mindless monsters at heart, and now their thin veneer of civilization is finally falling away to reveal the slavering beasts within, and we can’t trust a damn one of these ticking time bombs of violence. Nailed it! \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\nPage 8/11\\nWHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?! \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nAw, I wasnt’ talking about you! You’re one of the good ones! ...Okay, you know what, now I hear it. \\nJASON STORMS OFF and ZOOTOPIA promptly descends into ANTI-PREDATOR BIGOTRY. CGI SNOW LEOPARD NEWS ANCHOR \\nThis just in, predators continue to go unpredictably bonkers, with numerous incidents of huge strong animals with claws and sharp teeth suddenly trying to murder unsuspecting pedestrians. But nobody\\'s died yet and let\\'s just all pretend that\\'s plausible, okay? \\nCGI MOOSE NEWS ANCHOR, OR SOME OTHER LOCALIZED ANIMAL STEREOTYPE DEPENDING WHERE YOU LIVE \\nThis has resulted in similarly non-violent prejudice against predators. So now I guess we’re making some comment about how bigotry is a two-way street and even the racial majority can be the victim of racist attitudes? CGI SNOW LEOPARD ANCHOR \\nMaybe? But “violence in the blood” is traditionally a racist attitude that has been held against black people in real life, so maybe predators are just another minority. So this movie has been a parallel for, I don’t know, black-vs-hispanic racism the whole time? \\nCGI MOOSE NEWS ANCHOR \\nCome to think of it, who ISN’T a minority around here? Prey are discriminated against for being small and vulnerable, predators are discriminated against for being former carnivores. And animals like foxes and sloths face more specific prejudice because of specific stereotypes and limitations of their species. Is it even possible to avoid ticking some box or other in this crazy pan-racist town? \\nCGI SNOW LEOPARD ANCHOR \\nI suppose if you’re a big, powerful herbivore whose race doesn’t have any kind of a questionable reputation. Which would make the only character in this movie who doesn’t suffer from any kind of race prejudice... the one played by Idris Elba? \\nCGI MOOSE NEWS ANCHOR \\nThis is giving me a headache. \\nINT. MAYOR’S OFFICE \\nBUNNIFER is meeting with NEW MAYOR JENNY UNGUSLATE. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nI know you want me to be the new face of the police force, but I fucked this town up pretty badly, so now I should use my newfound fame to speak out against racism and help defuse this atmosphere of hatred slink off back to my home town and wallow in self-pity. I’m turning in my badge. CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO \\nWait, you didn’t let me say it! Come on! \\nEXT. RABBITON, USA \\nPage 9/11\\nBUNNIFER returns home to sell CARROTS for a living. \\nCGI BUNNY HUNT: \\nSorry about everything that happened, honey. Maybe another convenient coincidence would cheer you up? Look what we have growing on our farm even though we know they’re really dangerous: night howlers! \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nGasp! Night howlers are FLOWERS! Somebody must have DRUGGED those predators! Oh, and I know how to find out who! Remember that robber I chased, when I nearly destroyed Rodent Town? \\nCGI BUNNY HUNT: \\nYou mean the one other crime you ever investigated during your entire cop career? \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nYes, the single solitary criminal I ever arrested before getting involved with the missing predator case, was stealing bulbs for these flowers and was clearly heavily involved in the missing predator case! Now THAT is a convenient coincidence, right there. \\nCGI BUNNY HUNT: \\nIt\\'s also convenient that you had enough expertise in that flower to instantly recognize its bulb and rattle off its botanical classification and Latin name, while at the same time you didn\\'t know its regular name or the fact that it makes people go crazy. \\nBUNNIFER hurries back to ZOOTOPIA and meets up with JASON. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nHey Jason, sorry for being all racist and stuff. You gotta help me find out who’s behind all this. \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\nUm, shouldn’t you be taking this information to Idris instead so he can use the full might of the police force to investigate this? Hell, shouldn’t you have just called him on the phone? In the time it took you to get here some panther might have flipped out and bitten a gopher’s head off or something. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nThis isn’t about public safety, it’s about me getting redemption, damnit! BUNNIFER and JASON question the FLOWER THIEF and wind up tracking down the CRIMINAL MASTERMIND at a NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, who turns out to be... CGI JENNY UNGUSLATE \\nThat’s right, it was I, the new mayor, the only person to actually have benefited from all these goings-on, who’d’ve guessed! \\nShe shoots JASON with an INSANITY PELLET and he goes to TEAR OUT BUNNIFER’S THROAT. \\nCGI JENNY UNGUSLATE \\nPage 10/11\\nMwa ha ha, and now to simply leave and let this grisly scene be discovered in the morning whilst keeping my name completely out of it. OR: (calls cops) \\nHelp, police! I, the mayor, happened to be taking a midnight stroll through the natural history museum with a few thuggish minions, when by total chance I stumbled across Jason murdering Bunnifer! Please get every single officer in the precinct to this location within the next three minutes! (hangs up) \\nAnd now, whilst I should probably do something about the highly incriminating weapon that\\'s currently in my hand before the cops get here, I will instead take this opportunity to declare aloud that I was entirely behind all these predators going crazy, that it was a deliberate crime that I planned and executed, signed Mayor Jenny Unguslate. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nGOTCHA! We were faking the whole attack and recorded your confession. We swapped out your crazy juice pellets for harmless blueberries! CGI JENNY UNGUSLATE \\nWait, seriously? You’re saying that you just happened to be carrying on you a liquid-filled sphere the exact color and dimensions of my psycho-balls? CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nIndeed we were! CONVENIENT COINCIDENCES FOR THE WIN! \\nJENNY is ARRESTED and ZOOTOPIA, having lost TWO CRIMINAL MAYORS in RAPID SUCCESSION and unearthed a RACIST PLOT to cause RACISM, naturally goes right back to being COMPLETELY STABLE. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\nAnd now Jason’s become my cop partner, so our hamfistedly metaphorical relationship is healed and we’re closer than ever, yay! \\n(pause) \\nAlthough in defiance of how almost any other version of this story would go, it’s still purely platonic. Because in a somewhat injudicious move, Disney’s put out a movie about racial tolerance where “interracial” couples are absolutely off the table. \\nCGI JASON BATEFOX \\nI can guarantee that won’t stop the furry community. \\nCGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN \\n...Oh dear GOD. They’re going to write ALL THE PORN, aren’t they? Just ALL OF IT. EWWWWWWW . \\nEND. \\nPage 11/11\\n'"
