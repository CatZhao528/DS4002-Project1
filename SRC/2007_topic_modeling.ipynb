discarded.\\n\\n\\n  \\nFrom the time he could stand,\\nhe was baptized in the fire of combat.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTaught never to retreat,\\nnever to surrender.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTaught that death on the battlefield\\nin service to Sparta...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... was the greatest glory\\nhe could achieve in his life.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAt age 7, as is customary in Sparta...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... the boy was taken from his mother\\nand plunged into a world of violence.\\n\\n\\n  \\nManufactured by 300 years\\nof Spartan warrior society...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... to create the finest soldiers\\nthe world has ever known.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe agoge, as it\\'s called,\\nforces the boy to fight.\\n\\n\\n  \\nStarves them, forces them to steal...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... and if necessary, to kill.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBy rod and lash the boy was punished...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... taught to show no pain, no mercy.\\n\\n\\n  \\nConstantly tested, tossed into the wild.\\n\\n\\n  \\nLeft to pit his wits and will\\nagainst nature\\'s fury.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt was his initiation...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... his time in the wild...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... for he would return to his people\\na Spartan...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... or not at all.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe wolf begins to circle the boy.\\n\\n\\n  \\nClaws of black steel...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... fur as dark night.\\n\\n\\n  \\nEyes glowing red...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... jewels from the pit of hell itself.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe giant wolf sniffing...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... savoring the scent of the meal to come.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s not fear that grips him...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... only a heightened sense of things.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe cold air in his lungs.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWindswept pines\\nmoving against the coming night.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHis hands are steady.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHis form...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... perfect.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd so the boy, given up for dead...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... returns to his people,\\nto sacred Sparta, a king!\\n\\n\\n  \\nOur king, Leonidas!\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s been more than 30 years\\nsince the wolf and the winter cold.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd now, as then, a beast approaches.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPatient and confident,\\nsavoring the meal to come.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut this beast\\nis made of men and horses...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...swords and spears.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAn army of slaves, vast beyond imagining,\\nready to devour tiny Greece.\\n\\n\\n  \\nReady to snuff out the world\\'s\\none hope for reason and justice.\\n\\n\\n  \\nA beast approaches...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...and it was King Leonidas himself\\nwho provoked it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, the more you sweat here,\\nthe less you\\'ll bleed in battle.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMy father taught me...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...that fear is always a constant.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut accepting it...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...makes you stronger.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMy queen.\\n\\n\\n  \\nA Persian emissary awaits Leonidas.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn the end...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...a Spartan\\'s true strength\\nis the warrior next to him.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSo give respect and honor to him,\\nand it will be returned to you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nFirst...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...you fight with your head.\\n- Then you fight with your heart.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat is it?\\n\\n\\n  \\nA Persian messenger awaits you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDo not forget today\\'s lesson.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Respect and honor.\\n- Respect and honor.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCouncilman Theron.\\nYou found yourself needed, for once.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMy king and queen,\\nI was just entertaining your guests.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m sure.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBefore you speak, Persian...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...know that in Sparta everyone,\\neven a king\\'s messenger...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...is held accountable\\nfor the words of his voice.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, what message do you bring?\\n\\n\\n  \\nEarth and water.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou rode all the way from Persia\\nfor earth and water?\\n\\n\\n  \\nDo not be coy or stupid, Persian.\\nYou can afford neither in Sparta.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat makes this woman\\nthink she can speak among men?\\n\\n\\n  \\nBecause only Spartan women\\ngive birth to

conquers and controls\\neverything he rests his eyes upon.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe leads an army so massive,\\nit shakes the ground with its march.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSo vast, it drinks the rivers dry.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAll the God-King Xerxes requires is this:\\n\\n\\n  \\nA simple offering of earth and water...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...a token of Sparta\\'s submission\\nto the will of Xerxes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSubmission.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, that\\'s a bit of a problem.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSee, rumor has it...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...the Athenians\\nhave already turned you down.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd if those philosophers and

And it\\'s going to get even worse. Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius... that\\'s the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100. So, please, remember to cover up and stay cool... with the hottest hits on your FM dial. Come on, guys, time to go home. Come on, love, off you get. Do we have to? Yes, we do. I\\'ll make you your favorite dinner to compensate. He squealed like a pig, didn\\'t he? Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D. Did you see his face? Hey, Big D. Beat up another. This one deserved it. Yeah. Five against one, very brave. Well, you\\'re one to talk. Moaning in your sleep every night? At least I\\'m not afraid of my pillow. \"Don\\'t kill Cedric.\" Who\\'s Cedric, your boyfriend? Shut up. \"He\\'s going to kill me, Mum.\" Where is your mum? Where is your mum, Potter? She dead? Is she dead? Is she a dead Pott...? Dudley. Dudley, let\\'s go. What\\'s going on? What are you doing? I\\'m not doing anything. We\\'re getting out of here, Dudley. Come on, Dudley, hurry up. Dudley, run. Expecto Patronum. Mrs. Figg. Don\\'t put away your wand, Harry. They might come back. Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next? Whole world\\'s gone topsy-turvy. - I don\\'t understand. How do you know...? Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you. Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore? After You-Know-Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year... did you expect him to let you go wandering on your own? Good Lord, boy. They told me you were intelligent. Now, get inside and stay there. Expect someone will be in touch soon. Whatever happens, don\\'t leave the house. It is hot. That\\'s right, hot everywhere. There\\'s sweat. There\\'s stifling. Diddykins? Is that you? Duddy. Vernon, come quick. We\\'re going to have to take him to a hospital. Who did this to you, boy? Happy, are we, now? You\\'ve finally done it. You\\'ve finally driven him loopy. Vernon, don\\'t say that. Well, just look at him, Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy. I\\'ve reached my limit, do you hear? This is the last I\\'m gonna take of you and your nonsense. Dear Mr. Potter. What? The Ministry has received intelligence that at 6:23 this evening... you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle. As a clear violation... of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery... you are hereby expelled... from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk. Justice. He\\'s not very well. Sorry, Hedwig. Very clean, these Muggles. Tonks, for God\\'s sake. Unnatural. Professor Moody. What are you doing here? Rescuing you, of course. But where are we going? The letter said I\\'ve been expelled. You haven\\'t been. Not yet. Kingsley, you take point. But the letter said... Dumbledore persuaded the minister to suspend your expulsion... pending a formal hearing. A hearing? Don\\'t worry. We\\'ll explain everything when we get back to headquarters. Not here, Nymphadora. Don\\'t call me Nymphadora. Stay in formation, everyone. Don\\'t break ranks if one of us is killed. Come on, you, around the corner. Come on. In you go, son. There\\'ve been no sightings. No deaths. No proof. He almost killed Harry. If that isn\\'t proof enough... Yes, but guarding you-know-what is the most important... We must trust Dumbledore on this. Was he able to protect Harry last year? Well, tonight I say it\\'s time to take action. Cornelius Fudge is a politician first and a wizard second. His instinct would be to ignore it... Keep your voices down. He\\'s getting stronger and stronger by the minute. We have to act now. Harry. Mrs. Weasley. Heavens, you\\'re all right. Bit peaky, but I\\'m afraid dinner will wait until after the meeting\\'s finished. Nope. No time to explain. Straight upstairs, first door on the left. Yeah. Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves. If my poor mistress knew the scum they let into her house... what would she say to old Kreacher? Oh, the shame. Freaks. There, there, mistress. Scum of the earth. Not like it was in the days of my fathers. Kreacher is here. Oh, Harry. Are you all right? We overheard them talking about the Dementor attack. You must tell us everything. Let the man breathe, Hermione. And this hearing at the Ministry. It\\'s just outrageous. I\\'ve looked it up. They simply can\\'t expel you. It\\'s completely unfair. Yeah. There\\'s a lot of that going round at the moment. So, what is this place? It\\'s headquarters. Of the Order of the Phoenix. It\\'s a secret society. Dumbledore formed it back when they fought You-Know-Who. Couldn\\'t have put any of this in a letter, I suppose? I\\'ve gone all summer without a scrap of news. We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did. Only... Only what? Only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything. Dumbledore said that? But why would he keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help. I\\'m the one who saw Voldemort return... the one who fought him, who saw Cedric Diggory get killed. Harry. Thought we heard your dulcet tones. Don\\'t bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out. If you\\'re all done shouting... Do you wanna hear something a little more interesting? If anyone has a right to know, it\\'s Harry. If it wasn\\'t for Harry... we wouldn\\'t even know Voldemort was back. He\\'s not a child, Molly. But he\\'s not an adult either. He\\'s not James, Sirius. Well, he\\'s not your son. He\\'s as good as. Who else has he got? Hey, Ginny. He\\'s got me. How touchingly paternal, Black. Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather. Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus. Snape\\'s part of the Order? Git. ...about your supposed reformation. I know better. So why don\\'t you tell him? Get off it. Quick. Get it up. Crookshanks. Stop it. Get off, you bloody cat. Crookshanks. Leave it alone. Get it up. Hermione, I hate your cat. Bad Crookshanks. Well, we\\'ll be eating down in the kitchen. Just because you\\'re allowed to use magic now... does not mean you have to whip your wands out for everything. Hi, Mum. You hungry, Harry? You sure you\\'re all right, Harry? Gave us quite a turn. Harry Potter. Sirius. This is very, very peculiar. It seems your hearing in the Ministry is to be before the entire Wizengamot. I don\\'t understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me? Show him. He\\'ll find out soon enough. He\\'s been attacking Dumbledore as well. Fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet... to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned. Why? He thinks Dumbledore\\'s after his job. No one in their right mind could believe that... Exactly the point. Fudge isn\\'t in his right mind. It\\'s been twisted and warped by fear. Now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry. The last time Voldemort gained power... he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. Now he\\'s returned, and I\\'m afraid the minister will do almost anything... to avoid facing that terrifying truth. We think Voldemort wants to build up his army again. Fourteen years ago, he had huge numbers at his command. And not just witches and wizards, but all manner of dark creatures. He\\'s been recruiting heavily, and we\\'ve been attempting to do the same. But gathering followers isn\\'t the only thing he\\'s interested in. We believe... Voldemort may be after something. Sirius. Something he didn\\'t have last time. You mean like a weapon? No. That\\'s enough. He\\'s just a boy. You say more and you might as well induct him into the Order. Good. I want to join. If Voldemort\\'s raising an army, then I want to fight. Harry. You are hereby expelled. Before the entire Wizengamot. Trains. Underground. Ingenious, these Muggles. Here we are. I\\'ve never used the visitors\\' entrance before. Should be fun. Right. Good. I\\'ll just get my Muggle money. Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons trading on the potions market. Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet? Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous? Morning, Arthur. Morning, Bob. Interdepartmental memos. We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable. Merlin\\'s beard. Thank you, Kingsley. They\\'ve changed the time of your hearing. When is it? In five minutes. Department of Mysteries. And I\\'m confident, minister, that you will do the right thing. Yes, but we must be... Remember, during the hearing, speak only when you\\'re spoken to. Keep calm. You\\'ve done nothing wrong. As the Muggles say, truth will out. Yes? I\\'m not allowed in, I\\'m afraid. Good luck, Harry. Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August... into offenses committed by Harry James Potter... resident at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag... Witness for the defense. Albus Percival Wulfric... Brian Dumbledore. You got our message that the time and place of the hearing... had been changed, did you? I must have missed it. But by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. The charges? The charges against the accused are as follows: \"That he did knowingly... and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions... produce a Patronus Charm... in the presence of a Muggle.\" Do you deny producing said Patronus? No, but... And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school... while under the age of 17? Yes, I was, but... Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot... I was only doing it because of the Dementors. Dementors? In Little Whinging? That\\'s quite clever. Muggles can\\'t see Dementors, can they, boy? Highly convenient. I\\'m not lying. There were two of them, and if I hadn\\'t... Enough. I\\'m sorry to interrupt what I\\'m sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story... but since you can produce no witnesses of the event... Pardon me, minister, but as it happens, we can. Please describe the attack. What did they look like? Well, one of them was very large and the other rather skinny. Not the boys. The Dementors. Oh, right, right. Well, big. Cloaked. Then everything went cold... as though all the happiness had gone from the world. Now, look here. Dementors don\\'t just wander into a Muggle suburb... and happen across a wizard. The odds are astronomical. I don\\'t think anyone would believe... the Dementors were there by coincidence, minister. I\\'m sure I must have misunderstood you, professor. Dementors are, after all, under the control of the Ministry of Magic. And it\\'s so silly of me, but it sounded for a moment as though... you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy. That would be disturbing indeed, Madam Undersecretary... which is why I\\'m sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry... into why the two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban... and why they mounted an attack without authorization. Of course, there is someone... who might be behind the attack. Cornelius, I implore you to see reason. The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontrovertible. He is not back. In the matter of Harry Potter... the law clearly states... that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations. Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore. Clearly. Has it become practice to hold a full criminal trial... to deal with a simple matter of underage magic? Those in favor of conviction? Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges? Cleared of all charges. Professor. Padfoot. Are you barking mad? You\\'ll blow the entire operation. Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you... I had to see you off, didn\\'t I? What\\'s life without a little risk? I don\\'t wanna see you get chucked back in Azkaban. Don\\'t worry about me. Anyway, I wanted you to have this. Original Order of the Phoenix. Marlene McKinnon. She was killed two weeks after this was taken. Voldemort wiped out her entire family. Frank and Alice Longbottom. Neville\\'s parents. They suffered a fate worse than death, you ask me. It\\'s been 14 years. And still a day doesn\\'t go by I don\\'t miss your dad. Do you really think there\\'s going to be a war, Sirius? It feels like it did before. You keep it. Anyway, I suppose you\\'re the young ones now. I\\'ll see you at the train. Bye-bye, darling. I love you. Hold my hand, lovey. There they are. They\\'re in the far carriage. Bye. I\\'m surprised the Ministry\\'s still letting you walk around free. Better enjoy it while you can. I expect there\\'s a cell in Azkaban with your name on it. What\\'d I tell you? Complete nutter. Just stay away from me! It\\'s only Malfoy. What\\'d you expect? Hi, guys. Hey, Neville. Hey there, Neville. What is it? What\\'s what? That. Pulling the carriage. Nothing\\'s pulling the carriage, Harry. It\\'s pulling itself, like always. You\\'re not going mad. I can see them too. You\\'re just as sane as I am. Everyone, this is Loony Love... Luna Lovegood. What an interesting necklace. It\\'s a charm, actually. Keeps away the Nargles. Hungry. I hope there\\'s pudding. What\\'s a Nargle? No idea. Good evening, children. Now, we have two changes in staffing this year. We\\'re pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank... who\\'ll be taking Care of Magical Creatures... while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave. We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... Professor Dolores Umbridge. And I\\'m sure you\\'ll all join me in wishing the professor good luck. Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you... She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge. Thank you, headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. And how lovely to see all your bright... happy faces smiling up at me. I\\'m sure we\\'re all going to be very good friends. That\\'s likely. That\\'s likely. The Ministry of Magic has always considered... the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. Although each headmaster... has brought something new to this historic school... progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged. Let us preserve what must be preserved... perfect what can be perfected... and prune practices that ought to be prohibited. Thank you, Professor Umbridge. That really was most illuminating. Illuminating? What a load of waffle. What\\'s it mean? Magic is forbidden in the corridors... It means the Ministry\\'s interfering at Hogwarts. Dean, Seamus. Good holiday? All right. Better than Seamus\\', anyway. Me mum didn\\'t want me to come back this year. Why not? Let me see. Because of you. The Daily Prophet\\'s been saying a lot of things about you and Dumbledore. What, your mum believes them? Nobody was there the night Cedric died. I guess you should read the Prophet, then, like your stupid mother. Don\\'t talk about my mother. I\\'ll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar. What\\'s going on? He\\'s mad, is what\\'s going on. Do you believe the rubbish he\\'s come out with about You-Know-Who? Yeah. I do. Has anyone else got a problem with Harry? You all right? Fine. Seamus was bang out of order, mate. But he\\'ll come through, you\\'ll see. I said, I\\'m fine, Ron. Right. I\\'ll just leave you to your thoughts, then. Harry. Bring it over here. Over here. Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it. Good morning, children. Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations. O-W-Ls. More commonly known as OWLs. Study hard and you will be rewarded. Fail to do so, and the consequences may be severe. Your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly uneven. But you\\'ll be pleased to know, from now on... you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved... course of defensive magic. Yes? There\\'s nothing in here about using defensive spells? Using spells? Well, I can\\'t imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom. We\\'re not gonna use magic? You\\'ll be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way. What use is that? If we\\'re attacked, it won\\'t be risk-free. Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class. It is the view of the Ministry... that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient... to get you through your examinations... which, after all, is what school is all about. And how\\'s theory supposed to prepare us for what\\'s out there? There is nothing out there, dear. Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourself? Oh, I don\\'t know. Maybe Lord Voldemort. Now, let me make this quite plain. You have been told... that a certain dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie. It\\'s not a lie. I saw him. I fought him. Detention, Mr. Potter. Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord? Cedric Diggory\\'s death was a tragic accident. It was murder. Voldemort killed him. Enough! Enough. See me later, Mr. Potter. My office. Come in. Good evening, Mr. Potter. Sit. You\\'re going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter. No, not with your quill. Going to be using a rather special one of mine. Now... I want you to write, \"I must not tell lies.\" How many times? Well, let\\'s say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in. You haven\\'t given me any ink. Oh, you won\\'t need any ink. Yes? Nothing. That\\'s right. Because you know, deep down... you deserve to be punished. Don\\'t you, Mr. Potter? Go on. Skiving Snackboxes. Sweets that make you ill. Get out of class whenever you like. Obtain hours of pleasure from unprofitable boredom. Care for another? I\\'m not asking you to write all of it for me. I\\'ve been busy studying for these stupid OWL exams. I\\'ll do the introduction. That\\'s all. Hermione, you\\'re honestly the most wonderful person I\\'ve ever met. And if I\\'m ever rude to you again... I\\'ll know you\\'ve gone back to normal. What\\'s wrong with your hand? Nothing. The other hand. You\\'ve got to tell Dumbledore. No. Dumbledore\\'s got enough on his mind right now. I don\\'t want to give Umbridge the satisfaction. Bloody hell, Harry. The woman\\'s torturing you. If the parents knew about this... I haven\\'t got any of those, have I, Ron? Harry, you\\'ve got to report this. It\\'s perfectly simple. You\\'re being... No, it\\'s not. Hermione, whatever this is, it\\'s not simple. You don\\'t understand. Then help us to. Dear Padfoot... I hope you\\'re all right. It\\'s starting to get colder here. Winter is definitely on the way. In spite of being back at Hogwarts, I feel more alone than ever. I know you, of all people, will understand. Hello, Harry Potter. Your feet. Aren \\' t they cold? Bit. Unfortunately, all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared. I suspect Nargles are behind it. What are they? They\\'re called Thestrals. They\\'re quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they\\'re a bit... Different. But why can\\'t the others see them? They can only be seen by people who\\'ve seen death. So you\\'ve known someone who\\'s died, then? My mum. She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment... and one day, one of her spells went badly wrong. I was 9. I\\'m sorry. Yes, it was rather horrible. I do feel very sad about it sometimes, but I\\'ve got Dad. We both believe you, by the way. That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and you fought him... and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you. Thanks. It seems you\\'re about the only ones that do. I don\\'t think that\\'s true. But I suppose that\\'s how he wants you to feel. What do you mean? Well, if I were You-Know-Who... I\\'d want you to feel cut off from everyone else... because if it\\'s just you alone... you\\'re not as much of a threat. Do you ever stop eating? What? I\\'m hungry. Harry. Can I join you? Pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating? I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students... you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices. So silly of me, but it sounds... as if you\\'re questioning my authority in my own classroom... Minerva. Not at all, Dolores, merely your medieval methods. I am sorry, dear. But to question my practices is to question the Ministry... and by extension, the minister himself. I am a tolerant woman... but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty. Disloyalty. Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared. Cornelius will want to take immediate action. What\\'s happened to Dumbledore? Having already revolutionized... the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts... Dolores Umbridge will, as high inquisitor, have powers... to address the seriously falling standards at Hogwarts School. Just one question, dear. You\\'ve been in this post how long, exactly? You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct? Yes. But you were unsuccessful? Obviously. Could you please predict something for me? I\\'m sorry? Move those mouths. One teensy little prophecy? Pity. No, wait. Wait, no. I think I do see something. Yes, I do. Something dark. You are in grave danger. Lovely. Cho. What\\'s going on? It\\'s Professor Trelawney. Sixteen years I\\'ve lived and taught here. Hogwarts is my home. You can\\'t do this. Actually, I can. Something you\\'d like to say? Oh, there are several things I would like to say. There... Professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside? Sybil, dear. This way. Thank you. Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms... of Educational Decree Number You have the right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds. That power remains with the headmaster. For now. Don\\'t you all have studying to do? Professor. Professor? Professor Dumbledore. Professor! Professor Dumbledore. That foul, evil, old gargoyle. We\\'re not learning how to defend ourselves. We\\'re not learning how to pass our OWLs. She\\'s taking over the entire school. Security has been and will remain the Ministry\\'s top priority. Furthermore, we have convincing evidence... that these disappearances are the work... of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black. Harry. Sirius. What are you doing here? Answering your letter. You said you were worried about Umbridge. What\\'s she doing? Training you to kill half-breeds? She\\'s not letting us use magic at all. Well, I\\'m not surprised. The latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn\\'t want you trained in combat. Combat? What does he think, we\\'re forming some sort of wizard army? That\\'s exactly what he thinks. That Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry. He\\'s becoming more paranoid by the minute. The others wouldn\\'t want me telling you this, Harry... but things aren\\'t going at all well with the Order. Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn... and these disappearances are just how it started before. Voldemort is on the move. Well, what can we do? Someone\\'s coming. I\\'m sorry I can\\'t be of more help. But for now, at least, it looks like you\\'re on your own. He really is out there, isn\\'t he? We\\'ve got to be able to defend ourselves. And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will. Harry. This is mad. Who\\'d wanna be taught by me? I\\'m a nutter, remember? Look on the bright side: you can\\'t be any worse than old toad face. Thanks, Ron. I\\'m here for you, mate. Who\\'s supposed to be meeting us, then? Just a couple of people. Lovely spot. Thought it would be safer off the beaten track. Matey, come back here. Hi. So you all know why we\\'re here. We need a teacher. A proper teacher. One who\\'s had experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts. Why? Why? Because You-Know-Who\\'s back, you tosspot. So he says. So Dumbledore says. So Dumbledore says because he says. The point is, where\\'s the proof? If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed... I\\'m not gonna talk about Cedric, so if that\\'s why you\\'re here, clear out now. Come on, Hermione. They\\'re here because they think I\\'m some sort of freak. Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm? Yes. I\\'ve seen it. Blimey, Harry. I didn\\'t know you could do that. And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore\\'s office. It\\'s true. Third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once. Last year, he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh. Wait. Look, it all sounds great when you say it like that... but the truth is, most of that was just luck. I didn\\'t know what I was doing half the time. I nearly always had help. He\\'s just being modest. No, Hermione, I\\'m not. Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow. But out there... when you\\'re a second away from being murdered... or watching a friend die right before your eyes... You don\\'t know what that\\'s like. You\\'re right, Harry, we don\\'t. That\\'s why we need your help. Because if we\\'re going to have any chance at beating... Voldemort... He\\'s really back. Right. First we need to find a place to practice... where Umbridge won\\'t find out. The Shrieking Shack. It\\'s too small. Forbidden Forest? Not bloody likely. Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out? Who cares? I mean, it\\'s sort of exciting, isn\\'t it, breaking the rules? Who are you and what have you done with Hermione? Anyway, at least we know one positive thing that came from today. What\\'s that? Cho couldn\\'t take her eyes off you, could she? Right. Over the next few days, we should each come up... with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice. We\\'ve got to make sure, wherever it is, there\\'s no chance she can find us. Will do, Harry. All student organizations are henceforth disbanded. Any student in noncompliance will be expelled. Watch where you\\'re going, Longbottom. You\\'ve done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement. The what? It\\'s also known as the Come and Go Room. The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it. And it\\'s always equipped for the seeker\\'s needs. So say you really needed the toilet... Charming, Ronald. But, yes, that is the general idea. It\\'s brilliant. It\\'s like Hogwarts wants us to fight back. Expelliarmus. I\\'m hopeless. You\\'re just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus. You will please copy the approved text four times... to ensure maximum retention. There will be no need to talk. No need to think\\'s more like it. Expelliarmus. Wands away. Stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal. It\\'s a wizard\\'s bread and butter, really. So come on, then, Nigel. Give it your best shot. Stupefy! Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done. Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll go easy on you. Thanks, Ronald. Come on, Ron. Come on, Ron. You can do it. Come on, Ron. One Sickle. You\\'re on. Stupefy. Thank you. Shut up. I let her do that. It\\'s good manners, isn\\'t it? It was completely intentional. Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea? Now, focus on a fixed point and try again. Expelliarmus. Very good. Keep your concentration. Great. A little higher. I\\'m okay. I\\'m okay. Stupefy. Stupefy. Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... may sign up in the high inquisitor\\'s office. Diminuendo. Working hard is important, but there\\'s something that matters even more: Believing in yourself. Expelliarmus. Levicorpus. Got it. Think of it this way. Every great wizard in history has started out... as nothing more than what we are now: students. If they can do it, why not us? Stupefy. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Reducto. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man. So that\\'s it for this lesson. Now, we\\' re not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays. So just keep practicing on your own as best you can. And well done, everyone. Great, great work. Well done, mate. Thanks. See you after Christmas. See you in the Common Room, Harry. Thanks a lot, Harry. No worries. Thank you so much. Not at all. Merry Christmas. Thank you, Harry. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Have a good Christmas. Have a great Christmas, Luna. We\\'ve been thinking. We could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles. Or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus-filled boils... Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me? Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day. Yeah. I\\'m okay. Anyway, it\\'s worth it. It\\'s just, learning all this... makes me wonder whether, if he\\'d known it... Cedric did know this stuff. He was really good. It\\'s just, Voldemort was better. You\\'re a really good teacher, Harry. I\\'ve never been able to stun anything before. Mistletoe. Probably full of Nargles, though. What are Nargles? No idea. Well, how was it? Wet. I mean, she was sort of crying. That bad at it, are you? I\\'m sure Harry\\'s kissing was more than satisfactory. Cho spends half her time crying these days. You\\'d think a bit of snogging would cheer her up. Don\\'t you understand how she must be feeling? Well, obviously she\\'s feeling sad about Cedric... and confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him... conflicted because Umbridge might sack her mum from the Ministry... and frightened of failing her OWLs because she\\'s worrying about everything. One person couldn\\'t feel all that. They\\'d explode. Just because you\\'ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon... Harry. Voldemort may be after something. Something he didn\\'t have last time. Harry. Harry. In the dream, were you standing next to the victim... or looking down at the scene? Neither. It was like I... Will you please just tell me what\\'s happening? Everard, Arthur\\'s on guard duty tonight. Make sure he\\'s found by the right people. Sir. Phineas. You must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured... and his children will be arriving there soon by Portkey. They\\'ve got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he\\'ll make it. What\\'s more, the Dark Lord failed to acquire it. Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to... Look at me! What\\'s happening to me? You wished to see me, headmaster? Oh, Severus. I\\'m afraid we can\\'t wait. Not even till the morning. Otherwise, we\\'ll all be vulnerable. It appears there\\'s a connection... between the Dark Lord\\'s mind and your own. Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear. Pray he remains ignorant. You mean, if he knows about it, then... he\\'ll be able to read my mind? Read it, control it... unhinge it. In the past, it was often the Dark Lord\\'s pleasure... to invade the minds of his victims... creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony... only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally... kill them. Used properly, the power of Occlumency... will help shield you from access or influence. In these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind. You will attempt to resist. Prepare yourself. Legilimens. Concentrate, Potter. Focus. hо, hо, hо. Merry Christmas. Here we go. Daddy\\'s back. Sit down, everybody, sit down. That\\'s it. Now, presents. And a nice big box for Ron. Big box for you. And... Fred and George. Come on, open up. I want to see your faces. Yes. Try it on. Thanks, Mum. It\\'s perfect. Just what he wanted, actually. Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum. Come on, then, everybody. Let\\'s clear this away. Oh, Harry, Harry. There you are. Happy Christmas. Thank you. Lovely to have you with us. Thank you. Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy. Thank you. Has everybody got? Fred? George? Hermione. A Christmas toast. To Mr. Harry Potter... without whom I would not be here. Harry. Harry. Harry. That is delicious. I shall be needing some more of that. Daddy, don\\'t forget last Christmas. I can\\'t understand why you don\\'t want to wear it, Ronald. I look like a bloody idiot, that\\'s why. No more than usual, Ron. I don\\'t know why... Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass. Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord. Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike. If my poor mistress only knew... Kreacher! That\\'s enough of your bile. Away with you! Of course, master. Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black. Sorry about that. He never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy. Not to me, anyway. What, you grew up here? This is my parents\\' house. I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order. About the only useful thing I\\'ve been able to do. This is the Black family tree. My deranged cousin. I hated the lot of them. My parents with their pure-blood mania. My mother did that after I ran away. Charming woman. I was 16. Where did you go? Round your dad\\'s. I was always welcome at the Potters\\'. I see him so much in you, Harry. You are so very much alike. I\\'m not so sure. Sirius, when I was... When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn\\'t just watching. I was the snake. And afterwards, in Dumbledore\\'s office... there was a moment when I wanted to... This connection between me and Voldemort. What if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him? I just feel so angry all the time. And what if, after everything that I\\'ve been through... something\\'s gone wrong inside me? What if I\\'m becoming bad? I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You\\'re not a bad person. You\\'re a very good person who bad things have happened to. You understand? Besides, the world isn\\'t split into good people and Death Eaters. We\\'ve all got both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That\\'s who we really are. Harry, time to go. When all this is over, we\\'ll be a proper family. You\\'ll see. Come on. Really? Harry. Harry. Hagrid\\'s back. I\\'m sorry. I will say this one last time. I\\'m ordering you to tell me where you\\'ve been. I told you. I\\'ve been away for me health. Your health? Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know. Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh air must be difficult to come by. If I were you, I shouldn\\'t get too used to being back. In fact, I mightn\\'t bother unpacking at all. This is top-secret, right? Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants. Giants? You found them? Well, they\\'re not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They\\'re so big, see? I tried to convince them to join the cause. But I wasn\\'t the only one that was trying to win them over. Death Eaters? Yes. Trying to persuade them to join You-Know-Who. Did they? I gave them Dumbledore\\'s message. Suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose. And they did this to you? Not exactly, no. Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog. It\\'s changing out there. Just like last time. There\\'s a storm coming, Harry. We\\'d all best be ready when she does. We have confirmed that 10 high-security prisoners... in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape. And of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger. We strongly suspect... that the breakout was engineered... by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban... notorious mass murderer Sirius Black... cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange. Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen. He\\'s gonna get us all killed just because he can\\'t face the truth. Harry. I wanted to apologize. Now even me mum says the Prophet\\'s version of things don\\'t add up. So, what I\\'m really trying to say is that I believe you. Neville? Fourteen years ago... a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange... used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She tortured them for information... but they never gave in. I\\'m quite proud to be their son. But I\\'m not sure I\\'m ready for everyone to know just yet. We\\'re gonna make them proud, Neville. That\\'s a promise. Make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember. Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus. George, your turn now. Expecto Patronum. A full-bodied Patronus is the most difficult to produce... but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents. Wow, that was really good. Fantastic, Ginny. Just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused. So focus, Luna. Think of the happiest thing you can. Expecto Patronum. I\\'m trying. I know. It\\'s good. This is really advanced stuff, guys. You\\'re doing so well. Expecto Patronum. I\\'ll make short work of this. Bombarda Maxima. Get them. Been watching them for weeks. And see, \" Dumbledore\\'s Army\"... proof of what I\\'ve been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius. All your fear-mongering about You-Know-Who... never fooled us for a minute. We saw your lies for what they were: A smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry. Naturally. No, professor. He had nothing to do with it. It was me. Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out... the parchment clearly says \"Dumbledore\\'s Army,\" not \"Potter\\'s.\" I instructed Harry to form this organization. And I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities. Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet. If we hurry, we should still make the morning edition. Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore... to Azkaban... to await trial for conspiracy and sedition. I thought we might hit this little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I\\'m going to... What was the phrase? ...come quietly. Well, I can tell you this: I have no intention of going to Azkaban. Enough of this. Take him. Well, you may not like him, minister... but you can\\'t deny... Dumbledore has got style. Boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other. Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... Students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities. Any student in noncompliance will be expelled. Harry. You did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag. Even Dumbledore didn\\'t see this coming. Harry, if it\\'s anyone\\'s fault, it\\'s ours. Yeah, we talked you into it. Yeah, but I agreed. I tried so hard to help, and all it\\'s done is make things worse. Anyway, that doesn\\'t matter anymore. Because I don\\'t want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much. And the more you care, the more you have to lose. So maybe it\\'s just better to... To what? To go it alone. Hagrid. Any idea where he\\'s taking us? Hagrid, why can\\'t you just tell us? I\\'ve never seen the centaurs so riled. And they\\'re dangerous at the best of times. The Ministry restricts their territory much more... they\\'ll have a full uprising on their hands. Hagrid, what\\'s going on? I\\'m sorry to be so mysterious, you three. I wouldn\\'t be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone... I\\'ll likely be getting the sack any day now. And I just couldn\\'t leave without telling someone about him. Grawpy. Down here, you great buffoon. Grawpy. Brought you some company. I couldn\\'t just leave him, because... Because he\\'s my brother. Blimey. Well, half brother, really. He\\'s completely harmless, just like I said. Little high-spirited, is all. Grawpy, that is not polite. Hagrid, do something. We talked about this. You do not grab, do you? That\\'s your new friend, Hermione. Grawpy. Grawp. Put me down. Now. You all right? Fine. Just needs a firm hand, is all. I think you\\'ve got an admirer. You just stay away from her, all right? He gets his own food and all. It\\'s company he\\'ll be needing when I\\'m gone. You will look after him, won\\'t you? I\\'m the only family he\\'s got. Feeling sentimental? That\\'s private. Not to me. And not to the Dark Lord, if you don\\'t improve. Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you. You won\\'t last two seconds if he invades your mind. You\\'re just like your father. Lazy, arrogant. Don\\'t say a word against my father. Weak. I\\'m not weak. Then prove it. Control your emotions. Discipline your mind. Legilimens. Harry. Sirius. I may vomit. Stop it. Is this what you call control? We\\'ve been at it for hours. If I could just rest. The Dark Lord isn\\'t resting. You and Black, you\\'re two of a kind. Sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been. Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn\\'t fair. Your blessed father knew that. In fact, he frequently saw to it. My father was a great man. Your father was a swine. Legilimens. Protego. Come on, Moony, Padfoot. Snape. Expelliarmus. Nice one, James. Dad. Impedimenta. Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy. Right. Who wants to see me take off Snivelly\\'s trousers? Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy. Enough. Enough. Your lessons are at an end. I... Get out. What\\'s your name? Michael. Your hand\\'s gonna be fine, Michael. Yeah. It\\'s not as bad as it seems. See? It\\'s fading already. You can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while. As I told you once before, Mr. Potter... naughty children deserve to be punished. You know, George... I\\'ve always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement. Fred, I\\'ve been thinking exactly the same thing. All right, professor! Here you go. Ready when you are. I need that prophecy. You\\'ll have to kill me. Oh, I will. But first, you will fetch it for me. Crucio. Crucio. Sirius. Harry, are you sure? I saw it. It\\'s just like with Mr. Weasley. It\\'s the door I\\'ve been dreaming about. I couldn\\'t remember where I\\'d seen it before. Sirius said Voldemort was after something. Something he didn\\'t have the last time, in the Department of Mysteries. Harry, please, just listen. What if Voldemort meant for you to see this? What if he\\'s only hurting Sirius because he\\'s trying to get to you? What if he is? I\\'m supposed to just let him die? Hermione, he\\'s the only family I\\'ve got left. What do we do? We\\'ll have to use the Floo Network. Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance. Not all of them. Alohomora. Alert the Order if you can. Are you mental? We\\'re going with you. It\\'s too dangerous. When are you going to get it into your head? We\\'re in this together. That you are. Caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl. You were going to Dumbledore, weren\\'t you? No. Liar. You sent for me, headmistress? Snape, yes. The time has come for answers, whether he wants to give them to me or not. Have you brought the Veritaserum? I\\'m afraid you\\'ve used up all my stores interrogating students. The last of it on Miss Chang. Unless you wish to poison him... And I assure you, I would have the greatest sympathy if you did. ...I cannot help you. He\\'s got Padfoot. He\\'s got Padfoot at the place where it\\'s hidden. Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What is he talking about, Snape? No idea. Very well. You give me no choice, Potter. As this is an issue of Ministry security... you leave me with... no alternative. The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue. That\\'s illegal. What Cornelius doesn\\'t know won\\'t hurt him. Tell her, Harry! Tell me what? Well, if you won\\'t tell her where it is... I will. Where what is? Dumbledore\\'s secret weapon. How much further? Not far. It had to be somewhere students wouldn\\'t find it accidentally. What are you doing? Improvising. Well? Where is this weapon? There isn\\'t one, is there? You were trying to trick me. You know... I really hate children. You have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter. Lower your weapons. I warn you, under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence... Protego. How dare you? Filthy half-breed. Incarcerous. Please. Please stop it. Please. Now, enough. I will have order. You filthy animal. Do you know who I am? Leave him alone. It\\'s not his fault. No, he doesn\\'t understand. Potter, do something. Tell them I mean no harm. I\\'m sorry, professor. But I must not tell lies. What are you doing? I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge. Let me go! Thank you, Grawp. Hermione. Hermione, Sirius. How\\'d you get away? Puking Pastilles. It wasn\\'t pretty. Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets. They told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves. That was clever, Ron. Has been known to happen. It was brilliant. So how are we getting to London? Look, it\\'s not that I don\\'t appreciate everything you\\'ve done, all of you... but I\\'ve got you into enough trouble as it is. Dumbledore\\'s Army\\'s supposed to be about doing something real. Or was that all just words to you? Maybe you don\\'t have to do this all by yourself, mate. So how are we going to get to London? We fly, of course. Department of Mysteries. This is it. Ninety-two. Ninety-three. Ninety-four. Ninety-five. He should be here. Harry. It\\'s got your name on it. The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal... but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not. For neither can live while the other survives. Harry. Where\\'s Sirius? You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams... and reality. You saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now, hand me the prophecy. If you do anything to us, I\\'ll break it. He knows how to play. Itty, bitty baby. Potter. Bellatrix Lestrange. Neville Longbottom, is it? How\\'s Mum and Dad? Better, now they\\'re about to be avenged. Now, let\\'s everybody just calm down... shall we? All we want is that prophecy. Why did Voldemort need me to come and get this? You dare speak his name? You filthy half-blood! It\\'s all right. He\\'s just a curious lad, aren\\'t you? Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made. Which is lucky for you, really. Haven\\'t you always wondered... what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord? Why he was unable to kill you... when you were just an infant? Don\\'t you want to know the secret of your scar? All the answers are there, Potter, in your hand. All you have to do... is give it to me. Then I can show you everything. I\\'ve waited 14 years. I know. I guess I can wait a little longer. Now. Stupefy. Stupefy. Levicorpus. Petrificus Totalus. Well done, Neville. Stupefy. Stupefy. Stupefy. Stupefy. Reducto. Get back to the door. Department of Mysteries. They got that bit right, didn\\'t they? The voices. Can you tell what they\\'re saying? There aren\\'t any voices, Harry. Let\\'s get out of here. I hear them too. Harry, it\\'s just an empty archway. Please, Harry. Get behind me. Did you actually believe... or were you truly naive enough to think... that children stood a chance against us? I\\'ll make this simple for you, Potter. Give me the prophecy now... or watch your friends die. Don\\'t give it to him, Harry. Get away from my godson. Now, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here. What? No, I\\'m staying with you. You\\'ve done beautifully. Now, let me take it from here. Black. Expelliarmus! Nice one, James. Avada Kedavra. No. No. I killed Sirius Black. You coming to get me? Crucio. You\\'ve got to mean it, Harry. She killed him. She deserves it. You know the spell, Harry. Do it. So weak. It was foolish of you to come here tonight, T om. The Aurors are on their way. By which time I shall be gone, and you... shall be dead. You\\'ve lost, old man. Harry. So weak. So vulnerable. Look at me. Harry, it isn\\'t how you are alike. It\\'s how you are not. Harry? You\\'re the weak one... and you\\'ll never know love or friendship. And I feel sorry for you. You\\'re a fool, Harry Potter. And you will lose everything. He\\'s back. I know how you feel, Harry. No, you don\\'t. It\\'s my fault. No, the fault is mine. I knew it was only a matter of time... before Voldemort made the connection between you. I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year... he\\'d be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected. The prophecy said: \"Neither one can live while the other one survives.\" It means one of us is gonna have to kill the other, in the end. Yes. Why didn\\'t you tell me? For the same reason you tried to save Sirius. The same reason your friends saved you. After all these years, after all you\\'ve suffered... I didn\\'t want to cause you any more pain. I cared too much about you. How come you\\'re not at the feast? Lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them. That\\'s awful. Oh, it\\'s all good fun. But as it\\'s the last night, I really do need them back. Do you want any help finding them? I\\'m sorry about your godfather, Harry. Are you sure you don\\'t want any help looking? That\\'s all right. Anyway, my mum always said... the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I\\'ll just go have some pudding. I\\'ve been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me. What\\'s that? That even though we\\'ve got a fight ahead of us... we\\'ve got one thing that Voldemort doesn\\'t have. Yeah? Something worth fighting for.\\n\\n... spring training camp and\\nhe\\'s definitely got the inside track.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWord is that they\\'re having\\nsome problems with injuries.\\n\\n\\n  \\nReally?

Thanks, Dave.\\nThanks for nothing, Eddie.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThank you, guys. That\\'s not all we\\'re\\nfollowing. Here\\'s Karen at the Health Desk.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe world of medicine\\nhas seen its share of miracle cures...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...from the polio vaccine\\nto heart transplants...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...but all past achievements may pale in\\ncomparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThank you for joining us this morning.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Not at all.\\n- So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWell, the premise is quite simple.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTake something designed by nature\\nand reprogram it...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...to make it work for the body\\nrather than against it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- We\\'re talking about a virus?\\n- Yes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn this case, the measles virus...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...which has been engineered at a genetic\\nlevel to be helpful rather than harmful.\\n\\n\\n  \\nUm, I\\'m not... I find the best way\\nto describe it is...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...if you can imagine your body\\nas a highway...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...and you picture the virus as a very fast\\ncar being driven by a very bad man...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...imagine the damage that\\nthat car could cause.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut then if you replace that man\\nwith a cop...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...the picture changes. And that\\'s\\nessentially what we\\'ve done.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, how many people\\nhave you treated so far?\\n\\n\\n  \\nWell, we\\'ve had 10,009 clinical trials\\nin humans so far.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- And how many are cancer-free?\\n- Ten thousand and nine.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSo you have actually cured cancer?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYes, yes. Yes, we have.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat you see? What you see?\\n\\n\\n  \\nDamn.\\n\\n\\n  \\nLet\\'s go, Sam.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCome on.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGood morning, Matt.\\nIt\\'s looking great, I\\'ll tell you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNot only was this the biggest\\nsnowstorm in New York City history...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... it had to be one of the prettiest.\\nImagine waking up on Sunday...\\n\\n\\n  \\n... to 26.9 inches of snow\\nin New York City.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHere you go. Just the way you like it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDisgusting.\\n\\n\\n  \\nExcuse me, excuse me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAll right. Come on, relax.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHowever, it did strand\\nplanes, trains and automobiles.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThere was a report, a Turkish Airlines\\nflight skidded off the runway at JFK.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNo one was injured,\\nbut for the most part, Matt...\\n\\n\\n  \\nThere you go.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m gonna show you, attempting\\nthe Bob Hager rule of thumb here.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd I\\'m gonna plug my ruler in.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn New York, in 30 Rock,\\nwe have 16 inches of snow, Matt.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBack to you, Matt and Katie.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGosh. All right, it looks great. It\\'ll be\\nbeautiful for the next day, at least.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- And then it turns brown.\\nIf that.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnyway, Ann, thanks so much.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t just push them around, eat them.\\nI\\'m not playing.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGood morning. This morning,\\nall up the East Coast...\\n\\n\\n  \\nOkay. You gonna eat your vegetables.\\nWe will sit down here all night.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe biggest challenge\\nis getting back to work.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat are you whining about?\\nWhy didn\\'t you just eat your vegetables?\\n\\n\\n  \\nHey. All right, here\\'s the deal.\\nLook. Look.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re gonna eat twice as many vegetables\\ntomorrow night. All right?\\n\\n\\n  \\nDeal? Deal?\\n\\n\\n  \\nCome on.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t worry\\nAbout a thing\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\'Cause every little thing\\nGonna be all right\\n\\n\\n  \\nI know that feels good.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSmiled with the rising sun\\nThree little birds\\n\\n\\n  \\nAh, Sam.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSingin\\' sweet songs\\nOf melody...\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m all right.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m all right, it\\'s all right.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat\\'s happening? I tried to reach you\\non your cell. I get a recording.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Cell service is down.\\n- Where are we going?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Can\\'t get used to the new regs.\\nGoing to Aunt Sara\\'s.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ma! No! Why?\\n- Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWe\\'re at 30 minutes, colonel.\\n- Copy.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Thirty minutes to what?\\n- They\\'re sealing off the island.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Seal off the island? This island?\\n- But I don\\'t wanna go to Aunt Sara\\'s.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDid you bring all the money?\\nYeah.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHow much?\\nSix hundred.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy did you say, \"You\\'re going\"?\\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s not enough.\\n- Robert.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou said, \"You\\'re going,\"\\nnot, \"We\\'re going.\"\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhen you get across, I need you to get\\nto the ATM. Get as much cash as you can.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTake Sara\\'s car, go upstate.\\nI\\'ll meet you at the farm.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBring enough food for two weeks.\\n\\n\\n  \\nJesus, Robert, did it jump?\\n\\n\\n  \\nIs it airborne?\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut we only go to Aunt Sara\\'s\\nin the summer.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It may be.\\n- Oh, my God.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s Christmas.

Finally, the Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World\\'s End script is here for all you fans of the Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley movie. This puppy is a transcript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of the movie to get the dialogue. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast names in there and all that jazz, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. At least you\\'ll have some Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World\\'s End quotes (or even a monologue or two) to annoy your coworkers with in the meantime, right?\\nAnd swing on back to Drew\\'s Script-O-Rama afterwards -- because reading is good for your noodle.

Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me. \\nNow... \\n- Wow, look, it\\'s Spider-Man! \\npeople really like me. \\nHey, stick around! It\\'s gonna start again in a couple minutes. - Yeah... - That\\'s OK. \\nThe city is safe and sound. \\nGuess I\\'ve had something to do with that. \\nMy uncle Ben would be proud. \\nI still go to school, \\ntop of my class. \\nNow, the Hamiltonian shows us \\nthat the energy levels are perturbed by the electric field. From the form of this matrix, \\nwe can see...? \\nMiss Stacey? \\n- That only the m=0 quantum states are affected. \\nCorrect! Good work, Miss Stacey. \\nParker. \\nYou got something to add? \\nNo, sir. \\nAnd I\\'m in love \\nwith the girl of my dreams. \\nHi. Um, Miss Watson left a ticket for me? \\nPeter Parker. \\nExcuse me. Sorry. Thank you. \\nIt\\'s my girlfriend! \\nHarry! \\nI need to talk to you. \\nExplain things. \\nTell it to my father. \\nRaise him from the dead. \\nI\\'m your friend, Harry. \\nI cared about your father. \\nMJ. \\nPeter. \\nWas I good? \\n- Good? \\nYou were great. You were... \\n- You say great? \\nI love my flowers. They\\'re beautiful. \\nPage 2/32\\nAnd those are from Harry. \\nWas he here tonight? \\n- Yeah, I ran into him outside. \\nWhat\\'s with you guys anyway? \\nIt\\'s complicated. \\nTell me again, was I really good? \\nI was so nervous. \\nMy knees were shaking. \\nYour knees were fine. \\n- The applause was not very loud. \\nYes, it was. \\nIt\\'s the acoustics. \\nIt\\'s all about diffusion. \\nIt keeps the sound waves from grouping. \\nYou see, when the sound waves, they propagate, then it\\'s like an... - You are such a nerd. \\nDid you see that one? \\nYou know what? \\nI\\'d like to sing on stage for the rest of my life \\nwith you in the first row. \\nI\\'ll be there. \\nTell me you love me. \\nI love you. \\nI love you so much. \\nI always have. \\nYou can\\'t hide here, Flint. \\nI\\'m just here to see my daughter. \\nYou are an escaped convict. \\nThe cops are looking for you. \\nYou\\'re not getting near her. \\nYou\\'re nothing but a common thief. \\nYou maybe even killed a man. \\nIt wasn\\'t even like that. \\nWasn\\'t. \\nI had good reason for what I was doing. \\nAnd that\\'s the truth. \\nYou and the truth, sitting in prison, having three meals a day together. I live in a prison. It\\'s a great truth. \\nAnd that is the truth that you left behind. \\nRight there in that bedrooom. \\nI missed you. \\nI missed you too, Daddy. \\nI promise \\nI\\'ll make you healthy again. \\nPage 3/32\\nWhatever it takes. \\nI\\'ll get the money. \\n- You get out of here. \\nNow. \\nI\\'m not a bad person. \\nJust had bad luck. \\nPeter, what is it? \\nIt\\'s MJ... \\nI\\'m gonna ask her to marry me! \\nOh, Peter! Oh! \\nThe day that uncle Ben asked me to marry him, \\nhe was so scared and excited. \\nAnd very young. \\nAnd I loved him so fiercely. \\nThen you said yes, right? \\nNo. I wanted to say yes, but I said no. \\nI wasn\\'t ready, \\nneither was he. \\nSo we took our time. \\nLooked forward to it. \\nDidn\\'t want to run into something with nothing to count on but love. A man has to be understanding \\nand put his wife before himself. \\nCan you do that, Peter? \\nYeah. I think I can. \\nThen you have my blessing. \\nI hope you\\'ve considered a proper proposal. \\nYour uncle had it all planned. \\nHe took me to the beach one Sunday. \\nHe was a knockout in his bathing suit. \\nAnd I, I didn\\'t look too bad myself. \\nWe were very good swimmers. \\nIt was a beautiful day, \\nand he said: \\nAnd at the island, \\nwe found a perfect spot by an old tree, \\nand we lay down and looked up at the sky. \\nAnd then he said, \"Close your eyes, May.\" \\nAnd I did. And then he said, \"Open them.\" \\nAnd I did. \\nAnd he was holding this ring. \\nDazzling, in front of me. \\nI thought it was the sun. \\nPage 4/32\\nWe\\'d be married 50 years \\ncome August... if... \\nSo. \\nI hope you make it very special \\nfor Mary Jane. \\nDo something she\\'ll never forget. \\nGive her this. \\nCome on. \\nTake it. \\nHarry. \\n- You knew this was coming, Pete. \\nListen to me! I didn\\'t kill your father! \\nHe was trying to kill me. He killed himself. Shut up! \\nI\\'m still here, Peter! \\nHate those things. \\nHarry. \\nHarry. \\nHarry! \\nOh my God. \\nHarry! \\nCome on! \\nGod! \\n- And clear! \\nNo response. \\n- Recharge. Let\\'s go again. \\nClear! \\nNo response. \\nWe charge it one more time. And clear! \\nCaptain Stacey. \\nWhat\\'s this? \\n- Flint Marko, the guy we tied to the Ben Paker homicide.

Hey! \\nYou know I can\\'t open the door. \\nIt\\'s stuck again? \\nCome on and help me. \\nI\\'m coming. \\nThe review. \\n- Oh! \\nThe hated it.

All cars in the vicinity of 54th and 6th Ave, please report. Crane out of control. Approach with caution. \\nGo get \\'em, tiger. \\nPage 7/32\\nSorry. \\nOh my God. \\nSeven Atom to central. That crane . \\nIt\\'s bigger than we thought. We\\'re gonna need a major mobilization right away. \\nJust gotta douse the accelerator! Now! \\nOK, Gwen. \\nI\\'ve got a secret. It\\'s my call for ya. \\nWhat is that thing doing in my background? \\nCaptain Stacey, the guys look out of shot of it. \\nThey can\\'t shut down the crane. \\nGet Edison on the phone. \\nHave them kill the power of the whole block. \\nAre you all right? \\nIt\\'s coming back! \\nOh my God. It\\'s Gwen! \\nWhat? \\nWhat\\'s she doing up there? \\nI don\\'t know. I just saw her last night. She said she had a modeling gig. Who are you? \\n- It\\'s Brock, sir. \\nEddie Brock, jr. \\nI work at the Daily Bugle. \\nAnd I\\'m dating your daughter. \\nYou OK? \\n- Yeah. \\nI\\'m fine. \\nThank you. \\nHey, Spidey, hold on. Bugle needs a photo. \\nThank God you\\'re OK. \\n- Daddy! \\nHey. I\\'m the new guy. \\n- New guy? \\nFrom now on, I\\'m gonna be taking shots of you for the Bugle. So-- smile! Are you smiling? \\nWhere\\'s the other guy? \\n- Peter Parker? \\nYeah, um, look, between you and me-- \\nThe guy\\'s kind of an amateur. \\nHave you noticed, his stuff makes you look a little... bloated. Just a little chunky. \\n- OK... \\nDon\\'t have to worry about that anymore, buddy. \\nDazzeling. \\nPage 8/32\\nJust a little something the boys in the ad department and I whipped up. As you know, circulation of the Bugle has been pretty good. Though not as good as the New York Times \\nor the Daily News \\nor the Post or several other smaller... \\n- Get on with it, moron! \\nWhat? \\n- Your blood pressure, Mr Jameson. \\nYour wife told me to tell you to watch the anger. \\n- You tell my wife... \\nThank you. \\nSo, I propose this campaign: \\n\"DAILY BUGLE\" -- that\\'s obvious. \\n\"IT\\'S HIP, IT\\'S NOW\" -- I came up with that one. \\n\"IT\\'S WOW\" -- that\\'s actually Eric\\'s. \\n\"AND HOW!\" -- that\\'s me again. \\nTime to take your pill. \\nNot that one. \\nNot that one. \\nDrink plenty of water. \\nThank you. \\nContinue. \\nHe\\'s busy. \\nOh, no, I\\'m just here to talk to you, babe. \\n(- What\\'s that smell?) \\nThat\\'s a little something called \\n\"Nice \\'n\\' Easy\". \\nWhat\\'s on you? \\n- It\\'s called \"Go Away\". \\nThat is the dumbest idea you\\'ve ever had. You have had some daunting... - Blood pressure. \\nHey, where are you going? \\nWho are you? \\n- You hired him last week. \\nFreelance. \\n- I did? What\\'s that smell? \\nBrock, sir. Edward Brock junior. \\nWow, I really like that shirt. \\nHere. It\\'s a crane accident. Check out the light source. He likes my shirt. \\nHey, Betty. \\n- Hey, Pete. You better get in there. \\nA new guy. He\\'s trying to sell some Spidey photos. \\nUh. Thanks. \\nPage 9/32\\nParker! You\\'re late! Maybe too late. Bruckner here beat ya to it. It\\'s Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior. \\n- I got you this. \\nBut he got me this. \\nWait. How\\'d you get that? I didn\\'t see you. \\n- How\\'d you get that high? \\nClimbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole. \\nA flagpole? \\nWhich one do we use? \\n- I like Bernstein\\'s. \\nIt\\'s better. \\n- Cheaper, too. \\nCongratulations, son. We\\'ll use your shot and pay you 50 bucks. Uh-- all right, JJ. I\\'m your man. \\nI know more about what makes a good picture \\nthan any photographer in this town. \\nSee, photography, it\\'s not just about \\n-- no offense -- flagpoles. Whatever. \\nIt\\'s about lighting. Composition. Drama. \\nI want a staff job, sir. \\nI have a girl that I intend to marry, and-- \\nI have this stupid little dream of-- working with one of the greatest newspaper editors of our time. \\nJ. Jonah Jameson. \\nWell, we do have an opening. \\nJohnson quit, remember? \\n- You fired him. \\n- Whatever. \\nWait a minute. I know what makes a good picture, \\nand I\\'ve been here for a long time. If there\\'s a staff job, Mr Jameson, I think I deserve it. \\nHe\\'s right, Jonah. Peter\\'s been with us for years. \\nHe\\'s done a great job. \\nYou want a staff job, and you want a staff job. \\nAnybody care about what I want? \\nI do. \\n- Shut up. Get out. \\nI want the public to see Spider-Man for the two-bit criminal he really is. He\\'s a fake. He\\'s full of stickum. \\nCatch him in the act. \\n\"Spider-Man with his hand in the cookie jar\". \\nWhoever brings me that photo gets the job. \\nWhat are you waiting for, Chinese New Year? Go, go, go! \\nI\\'m on it, boss. \\nPage 10/32\\nYou\\'ll never get that shot. \\nWe\\'ll see. \\nYou know, \\nI guess one person can make a difference. \\n\\'Nuff said. \\nWelcome home, Harry. \\nThank God you\\'re all right. \\nThanks, Bernard. \\nAperitif? \\n- Sure. \\nGot you a little homecoming present. \\nWha-- It\\'s your old ball! \\n- Yeah. \\nThanks, buddy. \\nWe were pretty good in the backyard, weren\\'t we? We were terrible. And we tried out for the varsity team. Yeah, for the cheerleaders. \\n- Right. \\nHey, do I have any girlfriends? \\nI don\\'t know. \\n- You don\\'t? \\nHey Bernard, do I have any girlfriends? \\n- Not that I know of, sir. \\nThat\\'s a pretty cool pass, huh? \\nIt\\'s OK. \\nLooks like I\\'m not worrying for money. \\nNo. \\nWell, I bet I can turn this little girlfriend thing around. You know, \\nhe always appreciated how you helped me through high school. I just wish I could remember more about him. \\nHe loved you. \\nThat\\'s the main thing. \\nHey, let\\'s watch the game in the kitchen. \\nGet something to eat. \\n- OK. \\nWhoa, catch that! \\nDid you see that? \\nStill got the moves. \\nYeah! \\nWhy are you stopping? \\nWhat is she doing here? \\nGary, you were supposed to call her agent. \\nHi, honey. \\nPage 11/32\\nWe tried to reach you. \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nOne critic? \\n- No, all the papers, dear. \\nMary Jane, honey. Sit down. Let\\'s explain it to you. - If you like, we could say you became ill. That was so poorly handled. \\n- Yeah. Let\\'s just rehearse. \\nAll right, Spidey! \\nExcuse me, miss. Let me see that gorgeous smile. Hi, Eddie. \\nYou\\'re so beautiful. \\nThis is front page stuff. \\nI\\'ve got to practice. I\\'ll see you later, OK? How about tonight? \\n- Not tonight. \\nWhy not? \\nThink of that amazing-- night that we had. We had a coffee, Eddie. \\nHey, beautiful. \\nOne more. \\nEverything OK? \\n- Yeah. I\\'m fine. \\nYou\\'re not still mad at me, are you? \\nNo, Peter. I\\'m proud of you. \\nHey. I\\'m gonna be swingin\\' it from over there. So you know where to look. \\nGive \\'em a good show. \\nDon\\'t worry about that review. \\nWe\\'re gonna be laughing about it tomorrow night. Promise. \\n- Yeah. \\nIsn\\'t that that guy from that prison break? He fits. \\nHey you! Halt! \\nCover the back! \\nFire! \\nPeople of the city of New York, I am here today because I fell 62 storeys \\nand someone caught me. \\nSomeone who never asks for anything in return. Someone who doesn\\'t even want us to know who he is. Hey, MJ. \\n- Harry. \\nPage 12/32\\nWhere is Pete? \\nUm-- taking somebody\\'s picture, I guess. \\nI\\'m so happy to see you. You look so good. \\nI\\'ve never felt better. \\nIt\\'s a weird feeling, not knowing New York. \\nBump on the head, I\\'m just free as a bird. \\nWill you bump me on the head? \\n- Bop. \\nHey, Pete said you\\'re in a play. \\nYou came. You sent me flowers. \\nI did? \\nI\\'ll come again tonight. \\nYou can\\'t. \\nI--I was let go. \\nWhat happened. \\nI wasn\\'t very good. \\nYou know, this is embarrassing, but... \\nI once wrote you a play in high school. \\nYou wrote me a play? \\nYeah. \\n- Harry, that\\'s the sweetest thing. \\nI ask you: \\nor your store\\'s being robbed \\nor your house is on fire, \\nwho is it that brakes your fall, puts out the flames and saves your children? \\nSpider-Man! \\nThey love me! \\nThen let\\'s hear it! For your one and only friendly neighborhood... Spider-Man! \\nKiss him! \\nKiss him! \\nGo ahead, lay it right on me. \\nReally? \\n- Yeah, they\\'ll love it. \\nKiss him! Kiss him! \\n- No, Spider-Man, no! \\nRight... \\nHope Pete\\'s getting a shot of this. \\nHey, are you OK? \\n- Yes, I\\'m fine. \\nJig\\'s up, pal. \\nI don\\'t want to hurt you. \\nPage 13/32\\nLeave now. \\n- I guess you haven\\'t heard? \\nI\\'m the sheriff \\'round these parts. \\nOK. \\nWhere do all these guys come from? \\nBonsoir. Le monsieur a-t-il un \"reservation\"? \\nI\\'m sorry, I don\\'t speak... \\n- But this is a French restaurant, non? \\nOui. \\nName, please? \\n- Parker, Peter. \\nAh. Here we are. \\nTable for two. Pekar. \\nParker. \\n- That is what I said. \\nPekar. \\nUm, I have a request. \\nMy girlfriend will be coming, \\nand I have this ring. \\nAh. All. \\nOh, so you want to pop the question tonight, hein? Yes, and I want to do something very special. \\nI love it. \\nRomance. \\nI am French. \\nWhen I signal you, if you\\'d bring some champagne with the ring... In ze bottom of her glass? \\nPerfect. \\n- Magnifique. \\nAlso I thought, at the same time \\ncould the musicians \\nplay this song? \\nTheir favorite. \\nAnd take good care of the ring. \\nAh oui, with my life, monsieur. \\n- S\\'il vous plat. \\n- Oui. \\nI like you. \\nThank you. \\n\"Bon\" chance. \\nBonne chance. \\nOK, so... How would you like some champagne? \\nHow\\'d that get in there? \\nAw, don\\'t cry. \\nPage 14/32\\nLook at you, wow! Beautiful. \\n- Thanks. \\nIs this place in your budget? \\nOh, it\\'s a special occasion. \\nYou\\'re on Broadway. \\nI don\\'t feel like much of a star tonight. \\nWell, you are a star. \\nAnd you\\'ve earned it. \\nPeter, you have no idea how I feel right now. \\nOh no, I know exactly how you feel. \\nListen. \\nI have been through this. \\nHappens to me all the time. \\nI see Spider-Man posters in the window. \\nKids running around with me on their sweaters. \\nBig Hallowe\\'en item. \\nI don\\'t know, I guess I\\'ve become something of an icon. Like yesterday. \\nThey keep screaming: \"Spider-Man! Spider-Man!\" \\nI don\\'t know, I mean, \\nI\\'m thinking to myself, \\n\"I\\'m just a nerdy kid from Queens. Do I deserve this?\" \\nHi, Pete. \\n- Hi. \\nHi. My parents and I are just having dinner here. \\nHello. \\nI\\'m Gwen Stacey. \\nThis is Mary Jane Watson. \\nOh, it\\'s so nice to finally meet you. Pete talks about you all the time. Gwen is my lab partner in Dr Connor\\'s class. \\nPete\\'s something of a genius. I\\'d be completely lost without him. Which actually reminds me-- \\nPete, if you got a picture of my kiss with Spider-Man, \\ncould you bring it to class? \\nI\\'d really love it. \\nFor my portfolio. \\nAfter all, who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right? \\nI can\\'t imagine. \\nWell, it was lovely to meet you. \\nGood night. \\n- Good night. \\nUh, she\\'s in my science class. It\\'s not her best subject. What? \\nHow come you never mentioned her? \\nPage 15/32\\nShe\\'s your lab partner, \\nyou saved her life, \\nshe thinks you\\'re a genius and she had her polished fingernails all over you? \\nOr didn\\'t you notice? \\nAnd she gave Spider-Man the key to the city. \\nI\\'ll never forget that. \\nShe\\'s just a girl in my class. \\n- Let me ask you something. \\nWhen you kissed her, \\nwho was kissing her? \\nSpider-Man or Peter? \\nWhat do you mean? \\n- You know exactly what I mean. \\nThat was our kiss. \\nWhy would you do that? \\nYou must have known how it made me feel. \\nDo you want to push me away? \\nPush you away? \\nWhy would I want to push you away? I love you. \\nYou\\'re my girlfriend. She\\'s a girl in my class, MJ. \\nI don\\'t feel very well. I\\'m sorry. I have to go. \\nWhere are you going? \\n- Please don\\'t follow me. \\nHere we are. \\nHi, it\\'s MJ. Sing a song at the beep. Beep! \\nHello. Uh... \\nI wish you\\'d pick up the phone. \\nI don\\'t know what\\'s going on. \\nI don\\'t know if you got the messages, or what. \\nBut... \\nI just want to talk to you. \\nOK. Call me, all right? \\nHallo? \\n- Mr Parker? \\nYeah? \\n- This is Detective Neil Garettfrom the 2nd precinct. \\nI\\'m calling on behalf of Captain Stacey. \\nHe would like you to come down to the station to speak with him. Originally we thought that this man, Dennis Carradine, \\nwas your husband\\'s killer. \\nWe were wrong. \\nWhat? \\n- Turns out Mr Carradine was only an accomplice. \\nPage 16/32\\nThe actual killer is still at large. \\nWhat are you talking about? \\nThis is the man who killed your husband. \\nHis name is Flint Marko. \\nHe\\'s a small-time crook who\\'s been in and out of prison. You got this wrong. \\nTwo days ago, he escaped. \\nEvidently, he confessed his guilt to a cellmate. \\nAnd we have a couple of witnesses who corroborate the story. No, wait, sir. You don\\'t want to do this. \\nGet in! What are you doing? \\nWould you put these photos away, please? \\nI\\'m sorry, Mrs Parker. I know this isn\\'t easy, \\nbut please be patient with us. \\nWe\\'re doing our job. We will catch him. \\nNo, you\\'re not doing your job. \\nI watched my uncle die. \\nWe chased down the wrong man. \\nNow you\\'re telling me there\\'s suspicions for two years? Witnesses? Why weren\\'t we told about this? \\n- Settle down, sir. \\nNo, I have no intention of settling down! \\nThis man killed my uncle, \\nand he\\'s still out there! \\nL-20 Parkway, all officers in the vicinity please report. We have an abandoned vehicle and an abandoned man in the middle of the street. \\nSorry, Wabash Avenue. \\nPeter, it\\'s MJ. \\nI\\'m not here about what happened at dinner. Just please open up. Aunt May called me. She told me about what happened. \\nShe\\'s worried about you. \\nI\\'m worried about you. \\nDon\\'t be. I\\'m fine. \\nI don\\'t want you to do something stupid. \\nLike try to find my uncle\\'s killer? \\nAnd do something you\\'ll regret. \\nLike... \\nwith that other guy. \\nHe had a gun on me. \\nI made a move, and he fell. I told you that. \\n- I\\'m not accusing you of anything. \\nC-22, auto at 566, 9th Avenue... \\n- Will you turn that thing off? \\nPage 17/32\\nPeter, I\\'m here because I care about you. \\nAnd I know that you made a mistake and that you feel guilty, but-- I want to be here for you. \\n- OK. \\nI get it. Thank you. \\nBut, uh, I\\'m fine. \\nI don\\'t need your help. \\nEverybody needs help sometimes, Peter. \\nEven Spider-Man. \\n90 - X-ray - 98. \\n10-31 at 642, Madison Av... \\n1-3-Tom has responded 10-20 at 540, East 107... \\nmale inside apartment B on first floor... \\n310-11 of a residence, 738... \\nDon\\'t hurt me! Just give me a chance! \\n- What about my uncle? \\nDid you give him a chance? \\nDid you? \\nWhere am I? \\nWhat is this? \\nI feel... \\nWow. \\nThis feels good. \\nThis is something else. \\nWhat do you think? \\nI\\'ve never seen anything like it. \\nI\\'m a physicist, not a biologist, but... \\nI\\'ll look at it in the morning, run some tests. \\n- Can we do that now? \\nIt seems to like you. \\nDon\\'t let any of that get on you. \\n- Why not? \\nIt has the characteristics of a symbiote, \\nwhich needs to bond to a host to survive. \\nAnd sometimes, these things in nature, when they bind, they can be hard to unbind. \\nBank robbery in progress, First Eastern Bank Bismarck. Another sand storm is reported in the vicinity. All cars, proceed with caution. \\nMarko. \\nBuddy, love the new outfit. \\nThis is exactly what I need to scoop, partner. Give me some of that web action. \\nSee you, chum. \\nPage 18/32\\nWhat the hell? \\nFlint Marko? \\nWhat do you want from me? \\nRemember Ben Parker? \\nThe old man you shot down in cold blood? \\nWhat does it matter to you anyway? \\nEverything! \\nIt\\'s time to pay, Marko. \\nGood riddance. \\nRe-ent! \\nNot now. \\nThis is a free country. It\\'s not a rent-free country. \\nLeave me alone. \\nGive me rent. \\nYou\\'ll get your rent when you fix this damn door! \\nThat wasn\\'t cool. \\nHe is good boy. \\nHe must be in some kind of trouble. \\nFlint Marko, the man who killed uncle Ben-- \\nhe was killed last night. \\nO my-- \\nWhat happened? \\nSpider-Man killed him. \\nSpider-Man? \\nI don\\'t understand. \\nSpider-Man doesn\\'t kill people. \\nWhat happened? \\nI... He was... \\nI thought that you\\'d feel... \\nHe deserved it, didn\\'t he? \\nI don\\'t think it\\'s for us to say whether a person deserves to live or die. Aunt May, he killed uncle Ben. \\nUncle Ben meant the world to us. \\nBut he wouldn\\'t want us living one second with revenge in our hearts. It\\'s like a poison. \\nIt can take you over. \\nBefore you know it, \\nturn us into something ugly. \\nHello. \\nHey, Harry, it\\'s MJ. \\nHi. \\n- I need some company. \\nAre you doing anything? Can I stop by? \\nYeah, sure. Come on over. \\nPage 19/32\\nOK. Are you sure it\\'s OK? \\nI\\'m not doing anything. \\nPlease, come over. \\nOK, I\\'ll see you soon. \\nGreat. \\n- Bye. \\nBernard? \\n- Yes, Mr Osborn? \\nWe\\'re having a guest. Can you get some food? \\nA guest? \\n- Yeah, a guest. \\nA guest guest? \\nWill you just get some food? \\nRightaway, sir. \\nHey, Mr Ditkovitch. \\nAn orange? \\nNo, thanks. \\nListen-- \\nI\\'m really sorry for what happened earlier. \\nI shouldn\\'t have yelled about that door. It was nothing to be angry about. Ah, it\\'s not big deal. \\nBut if you feel that bad about it, \\nyou can buy me pizza some time. \\nToday\\'s good. \\nOK. \\nHave problem with the phone? \\nNo, no, I was just-- was trying to figure out what to say. If it\\'s a woman you\\'re calling, \\nthen you say: \\n\"I\\'m good man.\" \\nHi, Pete. \\n- Hi. \\nHe\\'s calling a woman. \\n- Are you calling Mary Jane? \\nI think that would be so good... \\n- It\\'s none of your business. \\nGo! Go. \\nGive her a call. \\n- Thanks. \\nBye. \\n- Bye. \\nYou hungry? \\nYeah. \\nPage 20/32\\nCome in. \\nHope you like peppers. \\nI love \\'em. \\nOh, the butter! \\nWell, we can use that part. \\n\"You\\'ve been dreaming.\" \\n\"Nothing like a little self-deception to get you through the night.\" All right. \\n- When did you write that? \\n- It\\'s intense. \\nSo, do you want the part? \\nI\\'d love to be in your play. \\n- Cheers. \\nYou know, there\\'s not even a scar. \\nBarely. \\nSorry. \\n- Me too. \\nI didn\\'t mean to do that. \\n- No, it\\'s OK. Please. \\nForgive me. \\nMary Jane. \\nMary Jane. \\nMary Jane, please! \\n- I\\'m sorry. \\nYou\\'ve taken your eye off the ball. \\nWhat have you done? \\nAvenge me! \\nMy father-- he died, right? \\nYeah. \\nJust wish that I could remember more about him. \\nWell, he loved you. \\nThat\\'s the main thing. \\nI swear on my father\\'s grave: Spider-Man will pay. \\nHarry. \\nRemember me? \\nYes, father. \\nI remember. \\nI was right about her, \\nabout Peter, \\nabout everything. \\nYou know what you must do. \\nMake him suffer. Make him wish he were dead. \\nFirst we attack his heart. \\nHi, it\\'s me. Sing your song at the beep. \\nPage 21/32\\nHey, MJ. \\nIt\\'s Peter. \\nI want to talk to you about last night. I don\\'t know what I was thinking. I know you were just there to help, and-- I, uh-- I don\\'t know, I want to see you. If you want Peter to live, \\nyou\\'re gonna do something for me. Yeah? \\n- It\\'s Ursula. \\nCome in. \\nHi, Pete. \\n- Hi. \\nThere\\'s a phone call for you. \\nIt\\'s Mary Jane, she called back! \\nReally? \\n- Yeah! \\nI put the phone on top of the thing. Thanks. OK. \\nHey. \\n- Hi. \\nI was so glad you called. \\nI\\'ve been-- trying to-- \\n- Can you meet me? \\nYou bet. \\n- Now? \\nOK. Where? \\nAt the bridge, in the park. \\nOn my way. \\nHey. I love you. \\nYou look beautiful. \\nPeonies. \\nYou OK? \\nNo. \\nThere\\'s something I have to tell you, Pete. - OK. \\nIt\\'s not working. \\nYou and me. \\nWhat? \\nI don\\'t want to see you anymore. \\nWhat are you talking about? \\nI don\\'t know. \\nI\\'m lonely. \\nYou aren\\'t there for me. \\nPage 22/32\\nI can\\'t do this. \\nIt\\'s over. \\n- No. Please. \\nPlease don\\'t say that. \\nI know, I\\'ve been selfish. \\nBut I can do better. I can change. \\n- It\\'s not that simple. \\nWe love each other! I love you! \\nAnd we have problems. When people have problems, they work it out. They talk to each other. \\nLook, you see? \\nYou know what this is? \\nYou know what I want for us? \\n- There\\'s someone else. \\nI\\'ve fallen in love with someone else. \\nShe says that she\\'s lonely, \\nand that I\\'m not there for her. \\nThere\\'s another guy. \\nHow are you holding up? \\nNot good. \\nHarry, I was going to propose to her. \\nReally? \\nShe\\'s been going through a tough time lately. \\nCareer. \\nI mean, a singing waitress at a jazz club-- \\nthat\\'s not exactly what she had in mind for herself. A singing waitress? What are you talking about? \\nShe was fired from the show. \\nDidn\\'t she tell you? \\nShe was fired? \\nShe was fired and she told you? \\nShe didn\\'t tell me? \\nThat\\'s why I asked you here, Pete. \\nI\\'m the other guy. \\nWhat? \\nLook, she came to me one afternoon, troubled. \\nShe needed someone, and I was there for her. \\nI\\'ve always loved her, Pete. \\nYou know that. \\nIt just... \\nstarted. \\nI don\\'t believe this. \\nI don\\'t believe you. \\nI\\'m really sorry. \\nPage 23/32\\nI just thought you should know. \\nCan I warm you up? \\nYes, please. \\nHow\\'s the pie? \\nSo good. \\nWould you like a drink? \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nWhat was I thinking? Bad for the public image, right, Mr Key-to-the-city? What did you do to her? \\nI did what you failed to do. \\nI was there for her. \\nMary Jane and I, we understand each other. \\nShe doesn\\'t know what you are. \\nPeter. She knows me very well. \\nAnd when she kissed me, \\nit was just like she used to kiss me. \\nThat taste. \\nStrawberries. \\nHow d\\'ya like that, Spidey? \\nThat all you got? \\nStinks, doesn\\'t it? \\nI protected you in high school. Now I\\'m gonna kick your little ass. You gonna kill me like you killed my father? \\nI\\'m done trying to convince you. \\nYou took him from me. \\nHe loved me. \\nNo: \\nhe despised you. \\nYou were an embarrassment for him. \\nLook at that little Goblin junior. \\nGonna cry? \\n\"THIEF! Spider-Man shows his true colors\" \\n- Spider-Man used to make me feel safe. \\nNow I\\'m afraid to walk home from work. \\nMy son thought the world of this guy. \\nI have a 9 year old daughter, loves Spider-Man. \\nWho\\'s she supposed to look up to now? \\nThis is the guy they gave the key to the city to? \\nI\\'m gonna put some dirt in your eye. \\nCheers! New staff photographer! \\n- I just got lucky. \\nThis is so wonderful for you. \\nWell, you might wanna tell JJ to make a little more wall space. Page 24/32\\nGood morning. \\n- It\\'s a beautiful day, huh? \\nWhat was it you said, I\\'ll never get that picture? There\\'s your hero. \\nI never thought he\\'d really do that. \\nSee? Right there, \\nyou made a judgment call. \\nYou gotta see it as it is. \\nIt\\'s funny you should say that, \\n\\'cause I was looking through some old photos, and looks very, uh-- similar. \\nOK-- Well, I gotta get back to work. \\nYou\\'re trash, Brock. \\nExcuse me? \\nYour picture is a fake. \\nParker, you are such a boy scout. \\nWhen are you gonna give a guy a break? \\nYou want forgiveness? \\nGet religion. \\nWhat\\'s going on here? \\n- Are you guys all right? \\nYeah, no, we\\'re just horsin\\' around. \\nLook, I\\'m begging you. If you do this, \\nI will lose everything. \\nThere\\'s not a paper in town that will hire me. \\nYou should\\'ve thought of that earlier. \\nWhat are you doing, Peter? \\nShow this to the editor.

Early reports had believed him \\nto be the black-suited Spider-Man. But he is now been identified as something entirely different. \\nPage 28/32\\nThe hostage has been identified \\nas Mary Jane Watson, \\nan actrice recently seen in a brief stint on Broadway. \\nWe\\'re now going to take you live to the scene with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer? \\n- We\\'re only about 100 feet away now, Hal, and-- \\nWait. There seems to be some kind of activity in the web. It seems to be creating some kind of gigantic lettering. \"SPIDER-MAN, STOP US IF YOU CAN\" \\nApparently, Spider-Man is being challenged to some sort of confrontation. And that raises serious questions about what kind of chance he\\'d stand against such overwhelming... \\nHarry. \\nI need your help. \\nCan\\'t take them both. Not by myself. \\nYou don\\'t deserve my help. \\nHarry, \\nshe needs us. \\nGet out. \\nIf I may, Sir. \\nI\\'ve seen things in this house \\nI\\'ve never spoken of. \\nWhat are you trying to tell me? \\nThe night your father died \\nI cleaned his wound. \\nThe blade that pierced his body \\ncame from his glider. \\nI know \\nyou\\'re trying to defend your father\\'s honor, \\nbut there\\'s no question \\nthat he died by his own hand. \\nI loved your father. \\nAs I have loved you, Harry. \\nAs your friends love you. \\nLook! \\nHe seems to have come out of nowhere to answer the prayers of the city, just when all hope seemed to be lost. \\nPeter? \\nThey\\'re gonna kill us both. \\nI\\'m gonna get you out of this. \\nWatch out! \\nHey, Parker. \\nMy God. Eddie? \\nOh, my spider-sense is tickling. \\nPage 29/32\\nIf you know what I\\'m talking about. \\nWe can find a way to settle this. \\nYou\\'re so right. \\nI\\'m thinking-- humiliation. \\nKinda like you humiliated me. \\nDo you remember? \\nDo you remember what you did to me? \\nYou made me lose my girl. \\nNow I\\'m gonna make you lose yours. \\nHow\\'s that sound, tiger? \\nHold on, Mary Jane! \\nMary Jane. \\nIt\\'s hard to believe what\\'s happening. \\nThe brutality of it. \\nI don\\'t know how he can take any more. \\nThis can be a tragic day \\nfor the people of New York. \\nIt could be the end of Spider-Man. \\nAwesome! \\n- Wicked cool! \\nYou came. \\nLooks like just in the nick of time. \\nA couple of minutes ago wouldn\\'t have been so bad either. What\\'re you gonna do. \\nI\\'m needing some help over here. \\nI\\'m a little busy right now. \\nGive me your hand! \\nParker! \\nParker, where... \\nI need a photographer! \\nHey, kid. You want a job? \\nWhy would I want a job? \\nI\\'m just a kid. \\nAll right, how much for the camera? \\nOne hundred bucks. \\n- A hundred bucks? \\nAll right, you little prick. Here. \\nFilm\\'s extra. \\nGotcha. \\nPete, watch out! \\nYou still got any more? \\n- Hang on! \\nTo what? \\nGo, buddy! \\nPage 30/32\\n- Got her! \\nYou OK? \\nYeah. \\nGood. \\nHey, Pete. \\nAm I interrupting? \\nNever wound \\nwhat you can\\'t kill. \\nEddie-- this suit-- you gotta take it off! Oh, you\\'d like that, wouldn\\'t you? \\nI know what it feels like. \\nIt feels good. \\nThe power. Everything. \\nBut you\\'ll lose yourself. \\nLet it go. \\nI like being bad. \\nIt makes me happy. \\nHarry! \\nPeter, what are you doing? \\nNo! \\nEddie! \\nHarry? \\n- Mary Jane. \\nI\\'m going to get help. \\nStay. \\nI didn\\'t want this. \\nBut I had no choice. \\nWe always have a choice. \\nYou had a choice when you killed my uncle. My daughter was dying. \\nI needed money. \\nI was scared. \\nI told your uncle all I wanted was the car. What is it? \\n- I need your car. \\nHe said to me: \\n\"Why don\\'t you just put down the gun and go home?\" I realize now he was just trying to help me. Then I saw my partner running over with the cash, and the gun was in my hand. \\nDid a terrible thing to you. \\nI spent a lot of nights wishing I could take it back. I\\'m not asking you to forgive me. \\nPage 31/32\\nI just want you to understand. \\nI\\'ve done terrible things too. \\nYou didn\\'t choose to be this. \\nThe only thing left to me now \\nis my daughter. \\nI forgive you. \\nHey, pal. How are you doing? \\nBeen better. \\nWe\\'ll get you through this. \\nNo. \\nYou should never forgive... \\n...said those things. \\nNone of that matters, Peter. \\nYou\\'re my friend. \\nBest friend. \\nWhatever comes our way. \\nWhatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice. My friend Harry taught me that. \\nHe chose to be the best of himself. \\nIt\\'s the choices that make us who we are, \\nand we can always choose to do what\\'s right. \\nI\\'m through with love \\nI\\'ll never fall again \\nSaid adieu to love \\nDon\\'t ever call again \\nFor I must have you \\nOr no one \\nAnd so I\\'m through with love \\nI\\'ve locked my heart \\nI\\'ll keep my feelings there \\nI have stocked my heart \\nWith icy frigid air \\nAnd I mean to care \\nFor no one... \\nSubTitled by Asif2bd \\nVisit For Latest Software & Many More \\nDownloadBD.info \\nKeep A n Eye On Upcoming \\n\"HaveAllFree.com\" \\nPage 32/32\\n\\n\\n\\nNotice:\\n\\n\\nThis material is the property of Beach City Productions LLC\\n(A wholly owned subsidiary of Universal City Studios, Inc.)\\nand is intended and restricted solely for studio use by\\nstudio personnel.
