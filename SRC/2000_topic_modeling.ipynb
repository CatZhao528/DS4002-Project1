MARFA, TEXAS - 1993 - WIDE - DAY\\n\\nThe Texas plains, horizon to horizon, nothing but the browns\\nand ochres of earth and the blue and violet of the sky.  The\\nsheer scope of it sinks in:  the blank slate of nature, the\\nabsence of man.  On the screen superimpose:\\n\\n                    MARFA, TEXAS, 1993.\\n\\nCREDITS BEGIN.\\n\\nA plume of dust comes into frame.  The dust is from a TRUCK,\\norange and white and violet, with \"FedEx\" blazoned across the\\nside.\\n\\nThe truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II\\nera Quonset huts and outbuildings.  Around the outbuildings\\nare large sculptures of wood and metal.\\n\\nEXT.  QUONSET HUT - DAY\\n\\nThe door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.  Hair\\npulled back, casual, an artist.  She hands the DRIVER a FedEx\\nBOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS.\\nThe Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer\\ndangles from his belt.\\n\\nThe Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer,\\nprints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go.\\nBut something on the box catches her eye.  She wants it back.\\nHe glances at his watch.  She draws RINGS around the Wings,\\nuniting them.  She gives the box to the Driver, then hands\\nhim a cup of coffee.  They\\'ve done this before.\\n\\nHe takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.  He\\njumps in and heads back onto the plains.\\n\\nEXT.  FEDEX OFFICE - MIDLAND/ODESSA - NIGHT - HOURS LATER\\n\\nThe Driver jams the distinctive Angel Wing Box on top of a\\ndolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides.\\nA female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the\\ncontainer, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt\\nof rollers onto a larger truck.  The doors of the truck\\nclose.  The latch slams down.\\n\\nA forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737.\\n\\nEXT.  MEMPHIS AIRPORT SUPERHUB - NIGHT\\n\\nThe 737 lands.\\n\\nEXT.  SUPERHUB - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER\\n\\nOne of a seemingly endless line of FedEx planes, our 737\\ntaxis to a gate at the FedEx SUPERHUB.  The Hub is a vast\\nliving organism -- loud, complex, overwhelming, as much a\\nsymbol of modern life as was the factory in Modern Times.\\n\\nFive thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected\\nactivity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.  Hundreds of\\nforklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights\\ncrisscrossing like a laser show.\\n\\nLoaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT.\\n\\nINT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT\\n\\nThe forklift speeds inside one of the hangers to a LOADING\\nBELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of\\npackages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and\\nsizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical\\narms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of\\nstations.  The packages surge and move.\\n\\nThe Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts,\\nwhere they\\'re scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our\\nBox is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts.\\n\\nThe Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG.\\n\\nEXT.  MEMPHIS SUPERHUB - NIGHT\\n\\nA forklift lifts the Container to a door on a giant MD-11.\\n\\nINT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT\\n\\nA jumbled room jammed with computers and dominated by a HUGE\\nWALL GRAPHIC that charts hundreds of airplanes.  An Operator\\nmoves a yellow strip labeled Jumbo 12 across the board.\\n\\nEXT.  CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY\\n\\nSERIES OF SHOTS\\n\\nThe giant place touches down in Paris.  The Angel Wing Box\\nmoves quickly on another belt and disappears into another\\nCONTAINER, which is loaded onto still another AIRPLANE.\\n\\nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG AIRPORT, RUSSIA - NIGHT\\n\\nThe plane lands.  The container is unloaded down a belt.  We\\nsee our Angel Box.  Directly in front of it is a DENTED BOX.\\n\\nINT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE, RUSSIA\\n\\nSERIES OF SHOTS\\n\\nNight.  The manic activity has come to a dead stop.  Our two\\nBoxes sit on a table in a corner not far from a small\\nChristmas tree.\\n\\nDaylight now.  YURI, a Supervisor, saunters over, picks up\\nthe Angel Box, sees an attractive co-worker, puts it down.\\n\\nNight again.  A cat walks by the table where our two Boxes\\nhave come to rest.\\n\\nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICE - DAY\\n\\nA FedEx truck pulls out of the warehouse.  The walls of the\\nwarehouse are covered with graffiti.  The streets are slushy,\\nthe buildings blanketed in snow.\\n\\nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY\\n\\nThe Driver sits in the truck drinking tea.  He takes a last\\nsip, sighs, gets out with the Angel Box.  Walks slowly toward\\nan APARTMENT HOUSE.\\n\\nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nA beautiful young RUSSIAN WOMAN opens the door.  A young\\nAMERICAN MAN comes up behind her, signs the form and takes\\nthe Angel Box.  We see Christmas decorations inside.  The\\nwoman puts her arms around him as the door closes.\\n\\n                     RUSSIAN WOMAN (O.S.)\\n               (accented English)\\n          It\\'s pretty.  Who is it from?\\n\\n                     AMERICAN MAN (O.S.)\\n          My wife.\\n\\nWe stay with the Driver as he ambles back toward the truck.\\n\\nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nThe Driver has just delivered the Dented Box to ALEKSEI,\\nRussian Businessman, who closes the door of a Czarist-era\\nbuilding.  Aleksei checks his watch, picks up the phone.\\n\\nEXT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY\\n\\nCHUCK NOLAND, early thirties, walks along a line of brightly\\ncolored jitneys, each bearing the FedEx logo.  With him is a\\nFilipino FedEx SUPERVISOR wearing a guayabera.  Chuck\\nglistens with a thin layer of sweat.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          My guess is we\\'re talking fuel filters\\n          here, Fernando.  The gas is dirty, these\\n          jitneys get in the mountains, their\\n          engines cut out.\\n\\n                     FERNANDO\\n          That could lose us half an hour.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Easy.  Each way.\\n\\nHis beeper goes off.\\n\\nINT.  FEDEX OFFICES - MANILA - DAY - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck is on the phone.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          So it finally turned up...\\n\\nChuck hesitates for a moment, then looks at his watch.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          I\\'ll catch the sweep tonight.\\n\\nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT\\n\\nStrapped into the jump seat behind the pilots, Chuck sleeps\\nwith a mask over his eyes.  On his lap are some travel\\nbrochures.  We see sailboats, we see the Florida keys.\\n\\nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG FEDEX OFFICES - DAY\\n\\nChristmas in Russia.  Snow everywhere.  Brightly colored\\nlights.  Chucks gets out of a Volga with Aleksei.  He has a\\nbag over his shoulder, the dented package under one arm.\\n\\nINT.  FEDEX OFFICES - DAY\\n\\nThe staff has assembled near the loading dock.  Yuri the\\nstation manager stands in front, occasionally catching the\\neye of the attractive woman.  Chuck displays the FedEx box.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          It took this test package thirty-two\\n          hours to get from Seattle to St.\\n          Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand\\n          miles.  And then it took forty-one hours\\n          to get from our warehouse in St.\\n          Petersburg to here, a distance of,\\n          what --\\n\\n                     ALEKSEI\\n          Six kilometers.  Four miles.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          So how are we going to get this place\\n          shaped up?\\n\\nThere\\'s a muttered chorus of answers.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          There\\'s only one way.  We have to work\\n          together.  Every one of us depends on\\n          everyone else.  If one package is late,\\n          we are all late.  If one truck misses the\\n          deadline, we all miss the deadline.\\n          Let\\'s start by taking a look around.\\n\\nChuck leads his team through the sorting area.  Yuri squeezes\\nright next to him, ostentatiously carrying a clipboard.\\nChuck stops.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Here, this table is too far from the\\n          wall.  Packages can slip down...like...\\n               (pulls out a package from\\n                behind a table)\\n          ...this.\\n\\nHe hefts the package, as if trying to guess what\\'s inside.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          What could be in here?  Let\\'s say one of\\n          you sent it.  Could be the closing papers\\n          on your dacha, could be a toy for your\\n          grandson\\'s birthday, could be a kidney to\\n          keep your mother alive.  I don\\'t think\\n          you want your mother\\'s kidney to end up\\n          behind a table.\\n\\nThe Sorter shoves the table against the wall.  Yuri says\\nsomething to the Translator.\\n\\n                     TRANSLATOR\\n          He says they have been very busy.  It is\\n          hard to get good employees.  He is sure\\n          you understand.\\n\\nWrong answer:  Chuck glances sharply at Yuri.  Aleksei\\nappears with a cellular phone.\\n\\n                     ALEKSEI\\n          Phone call.  Malaysia.\\n\\nChuck takes the phone, opening his BAG as he does so.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Kamal?  Right.  I\\'m getting them.\\n\\nHe pulls out a set of blueprints and tacks them to a bulletin\\nboard as he talks.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          I\\'m looking at the blueprints of K.L.\\n          right now.  The belts are too small for\\n          the sorters.  Yeah, sometimes you never\\n          see what\\'s right in front of your face.\\n          Look, it\\'s --\\n\\nChuck keeps an eye on what is going on in the warehouse.\\nThen he notices something over by one of the trucks.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n               (to a loader)\\n          Hold it!  Hazardous material needs its\\n          own container!\\n               (back on the phone)\\n          -- three in the afternoon there, right?\\n          That gives you five hours until the sweep\\n          comes through.  Do the sort by hand\\n          tonight, then put in a new feeder belt,\\n          say a twenty-four incher.  Yes, overtime\\n          is authorized.\\n\\nHe hangs up the phone.  He turns to the crew.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          I\\'m going out on every route, I\\'m going\\n          to work every job here, until I know\\n          enough to help you.  That\\'s it.\\n\\nThe crew disperses back to work.  Chuck and Aleksei walk\\ntoward the office.  They\\'ve done this before.  Chuck lets a\\ncorner of his command persona slip.\\n\\n                     ALEKSEI\\n          It\\'s bad.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Worse than Warsaw.\\n\\n                     ALEKSEI\\n          Nobody remembers that.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          The failures they remember.  It\\'s the\\n          successes they forget.\\n\\nEXT.  ST. PETERSBURG - DAY - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nA FedEx truck pulls out of the FedEx office.  Chuck is\\ninside.  He notices the graffiti on the walls.\\n\\nINT.  TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck rides next to LEV, the driver, a serious sort.  The\\nTranslator squats on some boxes between them, trying to keep\\nhis balance.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          You sorted your packages before you left.\\n          None of the other drivers did.\\n\\nThe Translator and Lev exchange a few words.\\n\\n                     TRANSLATOR\\n          He says he wants to be organized.  Do\\n          packages in order.\\n\\nChuck looks at Lev with respect.  Right answer.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          So how come the other drivers haven\\'t\\n          left yet?\\n\\nThe Translator asks Lev, who looks at him as if he is crazy,\\nthen snorts an answer.  The Translator blushes.\\n\\n                     TRANSLATOR\\n          He says -- he is a very rude fellow --\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Tell me exactly what he said.\\n\\n                     TRANSLATOR\\n          He says why don\\'t his farts smell sweet?\\n\\nChuck grins.  Lev shrugs and says something else.\\n\\n                     TRANSLATOR\\n          He says that\\'s just the way it is.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Lev -- it\\'s Lev, right?  Listen, this is\\n          FedEx.  We don\\'t have to accept the way\\n          it is.\\n\\nEXT.  HOTEL - ST. PETERSBURG\\n\\nA weary Chuck enters the hotel.

For a moment everything is\\ndarkness.  Then a small light switches on.  Chuck has a\\nheadlamp on.\\n\\nHe gets up, heads into the bathroom.  We stay in the bedroom.\\nAfter only a moment, the light reemerges.  It heads over to\\nhis bag.  We go with it.\\n\\nChuck takes out a roll of toilet paper.  The guy is prepared\\nfor anything.  He goes into the bathroom, closes the door.\\n\\nThe lights come back on just as the phone rings.\\n\\nWe hear scuffling sounds on the other side of the door.\\nChuck charges out, holding up his pants.\\n\\nGrabs the phone.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Hello?

I\\'m\\n          going to be a little late.  Well, more\\n          than a little.  I had to go to Russia.\\n          Couldn\\'t be helped.  Could you call and\\n          cancel the trip?

John, aren\\'t you worried?\\n\\n                     JOHN\\n          I disconnected his controls.

FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT - HOURS LATER\\n\\nSettled into the jump seat, Chuck finishes up his notes on\\nhis PowerBook and begins his flight ritual.\\n\\nHe puts in his ear plugs and takes out his Valium.  He\\nswallows one, then thinks, and swallows two more.  Then he\\nturns on his Walkman to the Rolling Stones, puts the mask\\nover his eyes, and, as usual, goes to sleep.\\n\\n                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\\n\\nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT\\n\\nThe plane is SHAKING badly.  HEAR frantic, garbled radio\\ntalk.  Chuck stirs, struggles to his feet, drowsy and\\ndrugged.\\n\\nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK\\'S POV\\n\\nEverything is hazy, out of focus, as it was in his earlier\\ndrugged condition.  But this is real haze.  SMOKE.  And the\\ncabin also TWISTS and TILTS.\\n\\nChuck tries to steady himself against the wall.  This is\\nnightmarish.  Is this really happening?\\n\\nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - CHUCK\\'S POV - COCKPIT\\n\\nThe pilots wrestle with the controls.  They have their life\\njackets on.  John glances back at Chuck, his face floating in\\na cloud of fear.\\n\\nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck struggles to put on his life jacket.  The plane is\\nVIBRATING VIOLENTLY.  He can\\'t get the straps straight.  He\\nis KNOCKED against one wall, then another, then to the floor.\\n\\nChuck tries to blow on the mouth tubes for his life jacket.\\nCan\\'t do it!  Puff.  Puff.  Shit!  John motions frantically\\nfor Chuck to pull on the automatic inflators on his jacket.\\nChuck fumbles for them.\\n\\nHuge palettes shift and groan, one BREAKS FREE, banging\\nviolently against the side of the plane, spilling out its\\nboxes.  Then it swings and KNOCKS Chuck on the head!  He goes\\ndown!\\n\\nINT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nA CONTROLLER mans the global operations desk.  His SUPERVISOR\\nstands behind him, sipping some coffee.  The mood is eerily\\ncalm.  An assistant moves Plane Locator Cards on a giant\\nboard.\\n\\n                     CONTROLLER\\n          Jumbo 14 is overdue in Sector K.\\n\\n                     SUPERVISOR\\n          Where are they?\\n\\nAnother CONTROLLER tracks a giant computer screen.\\n\\n                     CONTROLLER 2\\n          Somewhere east of Port Moresby.

FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT\\n\\nThe giant plane PLUMMETS down from the sky.\\n\\nINT.  FEDEX PLANE - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck is semi-conscious and bleeding from the head.  John\\npulls the inflators on Chuck\\'s life jacket, which fills with\\na WHOOSH!, sending Chuck\\'s arms out to the sides.  Al\\nstruggles with the LIFE RAFT.  It\\'s all blurred, frantic,\\nterrifying.\\n\\nEXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nThe plane hits the ocean with a CRASH and a WAVE of water.\\n\\nINT.  GLOBAL OPERATIONS CENTER - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nThe Controller is speaking mechanically into the microphone.\\n\\n                     CONTROLLER\\n          Guam, I need a fix on Jumbo 14.\\n\\nEXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT\\n\\nShrouded with fog and surrounded by debris, the tail of the\\nbig plane slowly SINKS beneath the angry, storm-driven waves.\\n\\nEXT.  PACIFIC - DAY\\n\\nA life raft is tossed on dark, storm-driven seas.  Inside it,\\nsemi-conscious, Chuck hangs on.\\n\\nEXT.  PACIFIC - NIGHT\\n\\nWe catch glimpses of the yellow lift raft in the dark as the\\nstorm continues.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - EARLY MORNING\\n\\nThe storm has ended.  Waves lap gently on a beach cut like a\\nscallop out of a rocky shore.  On the beach we see scattered\\nFEDEX BOXES.  And we see, face-down, half-buried in sand, a\\nMAN IN A SUIT and a life jacket.\\n\\nChuck.\\n\\nThe tide gently rocks him, laps at his face.  He chokes.\\nSlowly he gets to his knees.  Vomits seawater, big heaves.\\nHe rolls over, sits down.  Dazed.  Still confused.  Where am\\nI?  What happened?\\n\\nChuck\\'s first instinct is to check the time.  He looks at his\\nwatch, taps it in frustration.\\n\\nThen he looks around, and we look with him.\\n\\nCHUCK\\'S POV - BEACH\\n\\nThe fog has thinned.  We can see palm groves and mangrove\\nthickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing\\nup a steep, rocky hillside.  The rocks on the opposite point\\nend in a barren ridge.  Clouds hide the top of the hill.\\n\\nON CHUCK\\n\\nas he takes in his surroundings.  He licks his lips.  He\\'s\\nthirsty.  But something he sees is even more important.  We\\nstay with him as he WALKS.  He comes to a FEDEX PACKAGE in\\nthe sand, picks it up, brushes off the sand, walks farther.\\nHe picks up another package.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - WIDE\\n\\nChuck walks down the beach, picking up FedEx packages,\\nleaving a trail of footprints in the sand.  Ahead of him we\\nnotice a package decorated with ANGEL WINGS.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT MORNING\\n\\nChuck has made a neat stack of FedEx boxes under some palm\\ntrees at the rim of the beach.  He examines the Angel Wing\\ndrawing with passing curiosity, then puts it on the stack.\\n\\nChuck takes off his life jacket, sits down in the shade,\\nmakes himself comfortable, and waits.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - SUNSET\\n\\nChuck is still waiting.  He\\'s a systems man, and the system\\nisn\\'t working.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          All right, guys.  I\\'m here.  Check the\\n          GPS, get moving.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\\n\\nThe full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach.  Trees\\ncast moon-shadows on the sand.  Chuck seems very, very alone.\\n\\nWe HEAR from the dark thickets a STRANGE NOISE.  Rustling in\\nthe leaves.  Something crashing in the trees, or is it a\\nwave?  A jolt of adrenaline courses through Chuck\\'s body.  He\\nlurches to his feet.\\n\\nWe HEAR the noises again.  Chuck edges toward the rocks at\\nthe barb of the hook.  Keeping his eye on the thicket, he\\nbends down and picks up a stone.  His first weapon.\\n\\nIn the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood.  He picks it up\\nin his other hand.  He backs between two rocks and stands\\nfacing the thicket, every sense alert.  A cloud passes over\\nthe moon.  The shadow streaks across Chuck\\'s anxious face.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - MORNING\\n\\nThe morning TIDE is coming in.  We follow the tide as it laps\\namidst the rocks and finds Chuck, staring out to sea.  The\\nempty sea.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Where the fuck are you?\\n\\nBut now he is really thirsty.  We WALK with Chuck up the\\nbeach.\\n\\nBeneath the palms he sees a couple of coconuts.  He picks one\\nof them up and studies it.  It\\'s heavy, almost the size of a\\nvolleyball.  How to get in it?\\n\\nHe throws it down on a rock.  The coconut just bounces off.\\nHe wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock\\ndown on it.  It bounces off.  He throws down a bigger rock.\\nIt smashes on the rocks and chips.  Chuck picks up the rock.\\nOW!  Where the rock had chipped the edge is sharp.  It cuts\\nhim.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Sonofabitch.\\n\\nThe blood stains the rock a bright red.  Chuck sucks on his\\nfinger, then he gets an idea -- the same idea primitive man\\nfirst got when he discovered stone tools.\\n\\nHe picks up the rock, test the edge.  Sharp -- really sharp.\\nHe throws another rock down, but it doesn\\'t break.  He picks\\nup another rock and strikes the first one.  Then again,\\nharder.  And again.  A large flake shoots off.  This edge is\\neven sharper.\\n\\nHe has a knife.\\n\\nOPENING THE COCONUT - SERIES OF SHOTS\\n\\nChuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut.  No luck.\\n\\nChuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock.\\n\\nChuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut,\\nbut the stick slides off, sending the coconut rolling away.\\n\\nChuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then\\nSLAMS the coconut down hard on it.  Success!  The green nut\\nof the coconut splits.  The brown inner nut is free!  He\\nsmashes the nut with a rock, but -- OW!  -- he hits his hand!\\nChuck licks his fingers, but he is so thirsty there\\'s no more\\nsaliva.  He smashes again.  The shell breaks to smithereens.\\nCoconut milk splashes everywhere.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          That was smart, really smart.\\n\\nRotating a nut along its axis and carefully moving his\\nfingers out of the way, he SMASHES the nut again.  The shell\\nsplits!  The precious liquid splashes out.  Left inside is a\\nswallow or two, which Chuck laps up eagerly.  The milky white\\nliquid dribbles down his face.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Ahhh.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - SUNRISE\\n\\nChuck squints at the ocean.  His sunburn is bad -- his lips\\nare cracked.  A stack of broken coconut shells is beside him.\\nNo one\\'s there -- again.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Maybe the GPS malfunctioned.  That Korean\\n          airliner did.\\n\\nClouds scud in front of the sun.  Beyond the reef the waves\\nare high and churning.  Chuck can see them pound onto the\\nreef.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Okay, do the math.  Maybe they know where\\n          you are within, say 500 miles.  That\\'s a\\n          circle with an area of, uh, pi r squared.\\n          So, uh, 250,000 times three point one\\n          four, that\\'s about 800,000 square miles.\\n          Three times the size of Texas.\\n\\nThis sinks in.  Then Chuck gets an idea.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          They could use a satellite.\\n\\nBut even that doesn\\'t give him much hope.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Say each satellite photo is 30 feet\\n          square, that\\'s uh...fuck it...billions\\n          and billions of photos.\\n\\nThat sinks in.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Aw, someone will come.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck sleeps by the coconuts.  The tide is coming in.  Chuck\\nstirs, gets up, staggers over to a palm tree to relieve\\nhimself.\\n\\nHe stares idly out at the moonlight on the waves.  Then not\\nso idly.  Something\\'s out there, something floating on the\\ntide.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          What the hell?\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck splashes into the gentle surf, reaches the dark object.\\n\\nIt\\'s a body.  Chuck turns it over.  It\\'s Al, one of the\\npilots, his face gray and waterlogged and very dead.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Oh Jesus.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck drags the body up on the beach and then collapses,\\nexhausted.  He sits by it, staring at it.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          I\\'m so sorry, Al.  So sorry.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - MORNING   \\n\\nChuck has almost finished a grave in the sand back of the\\npalm trees.  He\\'s been digging with a piece of driftwood\\nsharpened with his stone knife.\\n\\nHe drags the body into the pit.  Stares down at it.  That\\ncould be me.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Got to cover Al up.\\n\\nHe wants to say more, can\\'t.  He scoops some sand over the\\nbody.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Got to cover Al up.\\n\\nHe scoops in some more sand.  It\\'s eerily like burying the\\ntropical fish in his back yard.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER\\n\\nWith a rock Chuck hammers a crude driftwood marker into the\\nsand.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY\\n\\nAs Chuck sits on the beach, he half-sings, half-talks \"Yellow\\nSubmarine\" very quietly to himself.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow\\n          submarine...\\n\\nHe looks over at the deep woods and down to the rocky point.\\nComes to a decision.  He takes a drink of coconut, picks up\\nhis club and a coconut, sticks the stone knife in his pants.\\nHe\\'s ready to go.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck climbs over the rocks and disappears out of sight.\\nHe\\'s still half-singing to himself.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Yellow submarine.  We all live in a\\n          yellow submarine...\\n\\nEXT.  ISLAND - DAY - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck\\'s way is blocked by rocks and jungle.  He hesitates.\\nHe picks up a rock and THROWS IT to scare away all those bad\\nthings.  It crashes into the ferns and palm trees.  He takes\\na step into the jungle.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - MINUTES LATER\\n\\nChuck struggles through a dense thicket beneath a jungle\\ncanopy.  Vines and creepers reach out toward him.  There is\\nno path, nothing to show him where to go.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - HALF HOUR LATER\\n\\nChuck climbs through a tangle of vines and ferns.  He takes a\\ndrink from the coconut he is carrying.  The last drink.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Bad idea.  Should have saved some.\\n\\nHe throws away the husk.  He looks up, but the only sunlight\\nreaching him is dappled from the canopy above him.\\n\\nEXT.  ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck emerges onto a ridge that leads to a summit.  He climbs\\nacross a rocky lava field covered with scrub lichen and low\\nferns, soil dark as coffee beans, his way crossed by steep\\ngullies that cut like dark fingers into the lava.\\n\\nThe lava field narrows, forcing Chuck closer to the sea.  He\\npasses a series of CAVES, their mouths dark and mysterious\\nand scary.  He gives them a wide berth.\\n\\nEXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nThe land narrows to a ledge that stretches across a high\\ncliff perched over the ocean.  Beyond this rock bridge the\\npath smoothes out to a summit.\\n\\nChuck stares at the narrow bridge, then down at the waves\\nbreaking on the rocks far below.  To get any view, he will\\nhave to cross the bridge.  He\\'s thirsty.  The late afternoon\\nsun is hot.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did\\n          you enjoy the play?\\n\\nHugging the wall of the cliff, taking each step with great\\ncaution, he sets out across the bridge.\\n\\nEXT.  ISLAND - CLIFF\\n\\nStep by step, Chuck negotiates the narrow bridge.  He reaches\\na flume of polished basalt which cuts across the ledge like a\\nslide in a water park -- except this flume ends high above\\nthe waves.  Chuck tries to step across it, can\\'t quite, tries\\none foot first, then the other.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Shit!\\n\\nHe looks back, but that seems even scarier.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Got to get there.  Got to see.  C\\'mon...\\n          c\\'mon.  Don\\'t be such a wuss.  Be bold.\\n\\nHe looks down at the ocean beneath him, closes his eyes, and\\njumps.  It\\'s only a few feet, but he\\'s breathing hard when he\\nlands on the other side.  He hugs the rocks, getting his\\nbreath.\\n\\nEXT.  ISLAND SUMMIT - SUNSET - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck looks to each point on the compass.  He is on an\\nISLAND, small, inhospitable, without sign of habitation or\\nanything human.  On three sides the waves break against\\nsteep, hostile cliffs.  A reef encloses the cove where he\\ncame from.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          No way on.  No way off.\\n\\nChuck stares out to sea in every direction.  Nothing.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          This is bad.  Really, really bad.\\n\\nThe last rays of sun hit his face.  The ocean turns a deep\\nreddish gold.\\n\\nEXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nGoing down is even scarier.  It\\'s dusk and the light is flat\\nand gray.  Chuck stares at the ledge.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Come on.  Crawl if you have to.\\n\\nChuck crawls on his hands and knees across the rock bridge.\\n\\nEXT.  ROCKY SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck stumbles over the rocks.  The caves look ominous and\\nprimal.\\n\\nEXT.  EDGE OF JUNGLE - NIGHT\\n\\nIt\\'s getting dark now.  The jungle seems impenetrable, the\\ndark wood of fable.  Chuck hesitates, then plunges into it.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - NIGHT MINUTES LATER\\n\\nThe moon has just begun to rise, casting eerie light into the\\njungle.  The shadows reach out to grab Chuck, then real\\nbranches and vines tug at him.  He heads into thick\\nblackness.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER\\n\\nChuck emerges around the rocks.  He reaches the stack of\\nfamiliar FedEx boxes -- Ahh, home!  He\\'s breathing hard, from\\nboth fear and exertion.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Got to drink.  Got to drink something.\\n\\nWith his last strength he opens a coconut on the stick.  He\\nbangs hard on the shell and gulps down the milk.  He stares\\nat the stack of FedEx boxes.  What could be inside?  He\\nreaches out and touches one.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          They don\\'t belong to you.\\n\\nResponsibility gets the better of necessity, and he takes his\\nhand away.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - MORNING\\n\\nFace red from the sun, Chuck hacks at a palm frond with his\\nstone knife.  He saws the palm frond off near the base,\\nleaving it about a foot long.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Got to have shade.  Got to have a hat.\\n\\nHe ties the loose fibers into a sort of circle, then sets it\\nupon his head.  It looks amazingly like some sort of\\nprimitive cap.\\n\\nHe grabs a couple of FedEx boxes and heads for the beach.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER\\n\\nChuck finishes the P on H E L P, which he has spelled out\\nwith the FedEx boxes on the beach.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER\\n\\nChuck scrambles down a ravine.  He kneels down and feels the\\nground.  It is dry, completely dry.\\n\\nEXT.  LAVA SLOPE - DAY\\n\\nChuck traverses the slope, determined to find water.\\n\\nA FLAT ROCK - LATER\\n\\nWith a puddle of dirty water trapped in a tiny hollow.\\nSuddenly Chuck flops down into frame.  He tries to scoop up\\nsome water in his hands, but he just splashes it around.  He\\nlicks his fingers.  Then he gets down on his stomach and laps\\nup the water with his tongue.  Like an animal.\\n\\nIn the bottom of the small depression is some fine mud.  He\\nrubs it on his reddened face and across his burned lips.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Oh, God.  Thank you.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck lies in darkness, his eyes reflecting the moon.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY\\n\\nChuck is drenched in sweat.  He is at the bottom of a hole\\nsix feet deep.  He takes one last dig with the flat stick,\\nthen licks the moist clay that sticks to it.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\\n\\nChuck breaks open another coconut and gulps down the milky\\nliquid.  With a stone knife he digs in the shell for some of\\nthe meat, but it\\'s dry and chewy and fibrous.  He spits it\\nout, then lies back on the sand and stares at the first\\nstars.  Half sings to himself.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          You deserve a break today...\\n\\nHe is desperately thirsty.  Hunger gnaws at him.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY - LATER\\n\\nHolding a sharpened stick, Chuck wades in the shallows at low\\ntide, looking for fish.  It\\'s difficult to keep his balance.\\nSuddenly a shadow flashes by, glinting in the morning\\nsunlight.  Chuck hurls the spear, which ricochets off the\\nwater and floats away.\\n\\nChuck plunges into the water after the fish with his bare\\nhands.  The fish reverses direction.  Chuck leaps after it\\nand goes under.  He comes up spluttering, on his hands and\\nknees in the shallows.\\n\\nSuddenly a whole school of fish swims by him, moving in\\nunison, like one creature, splitting around Chuck like\\nmercury.  He grabs at them desperately.  Nothing.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Damn fish!\\n\\nOn some rocks he sees clusters of limpets.  He takes a rock\\nand tries to dislodge one, but it smashes into a soggy mess.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\\n\\nDiscouraged, he sits down on the beach and gets his breath.\\n\\nIdly, Chuck takes out his wallet.  The money is soaked.  He\\nlays it out to dry.  He finds a PHOTOGRAPH OF KELLY, soaked\\nand mushy.\\n\\nHe tries to smooth it out.  For a moment he is overcome.  His\\nface tightens, his eyes get moist.  He stares out to sea.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Wait a minute.  Wait just a minute.\\n\\nHe picks up his wallet again and takes out a credit card.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - MINUTES LATER\\n\\nChuck wades in the water, stops by a rock covered with\\nlimpets.  He uses a CREDIT CARD to scrape off a limpet.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Don\\'t leave home without it.\\n\\nWith his finger, he prods around in the mucous-like meat,\\nthen tilts up the shell and we see the gooey gray stuff slide\\noff the shell into his mouth.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Yuck.\\n\\nHe starts to spit it out.  Tries to make himself like it.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Yumm.\\n\\nAnd he swallow it.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - SUNSET\\n\\nChuck sits in the shade of a palm tree surrounded by a pile\\nof smashed coconut husks and a stack of limpet shells.  He\\nchecks his watch for a moment.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Got to get this fixed.\\n\\nBut what\\'s the point?  Everything that was so valuable before\\nis useless now.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - LATER\\n\\nChuck digs yet another hole.  He chants to himself, almost\\ndelusionally.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Water, water, everywhere, water, water\\n          everywhere...\\n\\nCovered in sweat, desperate and exhausted, he throws down his\\nwooden spade.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Where\\'s the water on this fucking island?\\n\\nHe lies on his back, breathing hard.  Pulls his hat over his\\neyes.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Just rest a minute.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER\\n\\nChuck is lying in the hole.  We find his feet.  Slowly water\\nis oozing out of the clay, a puddle is building around his\\ntoes.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY - LATER\\n\\nChuck\\'s eyes snap awake.  He looks down at his feet.  There\\'s\\na pool of muddy water there.  He dips his hand in it, touches\\na finger to his lips to be sure he\\'s not dreaming.\\n\\nHe grabs his sharpened stone, begins to attack the clay.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - SUNSET\\n\\nChuck carefully makes marks on a palm tree with his rock\\nknife.  One for each day.  Very neat.  Very precise.  Very\\nChuck.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Let\\'s see, I waited two days.\\n               (makes marks)\\n          Then I buried Al.\\n               (slowly makes another mark)\\n          Al.  You never made it home, buddy.  Then\\n          American Express got me those clam\\n          things...\\n               (makes another mark)\\n          I dug all those damn holes, the clouds\\n          over the moon...\\n               (makes more marks)\\n          And today, the historic discovery of H,\\n          Two, Oh.\\n               (makes a tenth mark and\\n                underlines it)\\n          Ten days.  Shit.\\n\\nFor a moment, he feels the weight of his isolation.  Then he\\nallows himself a deep breath.  There is order now, after all.\\nTime is under control.\\n\\nEXT.  CLIFF - DAY\\n\\nVery carefully, but standing this time, Chuck makes his way\\nacross the ledge.\\n\\nEXT.  SUMMIT - DAY\\n\\nHe emerges on the top, takes a drink from a hand-made\\ncanteen, and looks in all directions.  Again, he sees nothing\\nbut ocean.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\\n\\nHe resumes his efforts at fishing.  A shape scuttles raggedly\\nbeneath him.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          A crab, it\\'s a crab.\\n\\nHe freezes, holding his spear motionless.  Then he jabs at\\nthe crab -- misses!  The crab scurries away toward the rocks.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Dammit!\\n\\nChuck splashes after it, stabbing as he goes, falling,\\ngetting up, stabbing again.\\n\\nSuddenly one stab feels different.  Chuck carefully lifts up\\nthe spear.  On the end is a squirming crab.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          I did it.  I did it!\\n\\nHe walks carefully with it to the beach.  Lowering the spear,\\nhe lets the crab slip off.  It darts toward the water.  Chuck\\nheads it off, trying to avoid the snapping claws.\\n\\nHe kicks it back toward the beach, then slams a rock down on\\nit.  He twists off a crab claw, expecting to see flaky white\\nmeat.  But a crab has an exoskeleton.  The flesh simply pours\\nout, like mucous.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Jesus.\\n\\nThis is too much.  He needs the next step, from the raw to\\nthe cooked.  The crucial next step from primitive man to the\\nbeginnings of civilization.\\n\\nEXT.  PALM GROVE SERIES OF SHOTS - TRYING TO MAKE FIRE\\n\\nChuck rubs two sticks together.  Nothing.\\n\\nChuck positions a makeshift drill in a hole he has scooped\\nout in a piece of driftwood.  He spins the drill with great\\neffort.  Nothing.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Stupid fucking thing!\\n\\nHe quits, exhausted.  He looks at his hands.  They are raw\\nand blistered.  He feels like Job.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          I don\\'t know what I did, God, but\\n          whatever is was, I am really, really\\n          sorry.  You hear me?  Really sorry.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\\n\\nChuck emerges from the jungle and walks to the edge of the\\nocean.  He dips his blistered hands into the sea water, then\\nlooks over at the FedEx boxes that spell out H E L P.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Don\\'t have a choice, do I?\\n\\nHe walks over and picks a few boxes up from the P.\\n\\nEXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY\\n\\nWith his stone knife and spear to help him.  Chuck begins to\\nopen the FedEx boxes.  Chuck rips open the end of one box and\\nshakes it.  Out tumble some videotapes.  Chuck looks at them:\\nwhat good are they?\\n\\nChuck tears another box open.  Out slide some legal papers\\ncovered with Post-its.\\n\\nIn quick cuts, we see him dump out computer memory boards,\\nsome designer dresses, flowers, a pair of roller blades, a\\nscript with a red cover -- which he never reads.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER\\n\\nBy now he has taken all the boxes in the P.  Only H E L\\nremains.  He pauses to let the irony of that sink in, then\\ncollects more boxes.  He is even more exhausted.\\n\\nEXT.  PALM GROVE\\n\\nTwo boxes remain.  One is the box with Angel Wings.  Chuck\\nsets it aside.  He opens the other box.  Out tumbles a\\nDOCTOR\\'S BAG.  Chuck can\\'t believe it.  He opens the bag.\\nIt\\'s full of great stuff.  Medicine.  A scalpel.  A saw.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Okay.  Okay now.\\n\\nEXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER\\n\\nHands bandaged, Chuck tries to strike a spark on the roller\\nblade wheel housing.  Tries over and over.  Nothing.\\n\\nHe takes a long drink from his canteen, and flinches.  His\\ntooth is starting to hurt.  He fishes some Tylenol out of the\\nsurgeon\\'s bag and takes two.\\n\\nEXT.  OTHER SIDE OF ISLAND - DAY\\n\\nChuck picks some berries and gingerly tries them.  They\\'re\\nnot bad.  He eats more.  Then more.  What a relief.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck lies on his palm fronds, groaning and holding his\\nstomach.  He drags himself to his knees, crawls a few feet,\\nand throws up in great, violent heaves.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\\n\\nStill looking a little green, Chuck marks another day on his\\ntree calendar.\\n\\nEXT.  SUMMIT\\n\\nHe stares out to sea.  Nothing.\\n\\nEXT.  WELL - DAY\\n\\nChuck lies on his belly and drinks from the well, which has\\nfilled with water.  Then he washes his face and splashes\\nwater over his neck.  The surface of the well stills,\\nbringing CHUCK\\'S REFLECTION into focus.  He stares at\\nhimself.\\n\\nVery carefully Chuck shaves with the surgeon\\'s scalpel.\\n\\nChuck checks out his new appearance in the water.  Much\\nbetter.  A clean start now.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY\\n\\nHe sits in front of his failed efforts to make fire.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          You\\'re not getting it hot enough.  Got to\\n          hold the heat.  Got to hold the heat.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER\\n\\nChuck carefully shaves some tinder.  Puts it under a piece of\\nbamboo split lengthwise with a notch cut across it.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER\\n\\nChuck uses a bamboo stick to try to make friction in the\\nsplit half of the bamboo.  He saws back and forth with all\\nhis might, pressing it down in the groove.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER\\n\\nChuck gives one last saw with his bamboo and stops, utterly\\ndefeated.  It\\'s all too much.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Sonofabitch!\\n\\nHe starts to rub again.  He breathes hard, sweat pours off\\nhis face.  He is really going for it, what the hell!  A tiny\\nwisp of smoke appears!  Chuck saws with even more energy.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Come on.  Come on.\\n\\nThe smoke increases.  Chuck rips away the bamboo, grabs the\\nnest of shavings, and blows on it frantically.  The smoke\\nflickers and dies.  Chuck can\\'t believe it.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          No.  No.  No.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck lies in his bed of palm fronds, shivering.  He looks up\\nat the stars, which blaze furiously.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          That\\'s the big dipper...Orion...or is\\n          that the Southern Cross...?  Kelly would\\n          know.\\n\\nAnd he misses her so much.  A shower of meteors streaks\\nacross the sky, as if the very heavens are raining down on\\nChuck.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\\n\\nChuck readies his two sticks of bamboo again and begins\\nsawing with tremendous energy.  He smells something.  Is it\\nsmoke?  He pulls off the log and looks eagerly at the nest of\\ntinder.  There\\'s nothing there.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Dammit!\\n\\nHe replaces the log and starts wearily to saw again.\\n\\nTIME CUT\\n\\nThe sun has moved in the sky.  Chuck is still sawing.  Again\\nthe smoke appears.  Again sweat pours from his face.  The\\nsmoke increases.  He saws even harder.  His breath comes in\\nanguished gulps.  Smoke is curling up now.  Chuck tears away\\nthe bamboo, picks up the nest of kindling, and blows on it\\ngently.  The smoke increases.\\n\\nHe blows some more.  A fragile crimson spark appears.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Careful now, careful...\\n\\nHe gently places the nest of shavings in the kindling, then\\nblows on it with utmost care, as if he were holding life\\nitself.  He shreds his money and business cards over the tiny\\nflame.\\n\\nSuddenly, the evening breeze lifts the nest out of the\\nkindling.  Desperate, Chuck grabs it.  Trying to shield it\\nwith his body, he grabs some palm fronds and jams them into\\nthe sand, trying to make a windbreak.  They rustle and shake\\nand blow over.\\n\\nThe wind blows harder.  Chuck jams some rocks in a circle to\\nmake an eddy.  But the fire is out.  No words now, just a\\nloud, primal groan of pure despair.\\n\\nAnd then, into his vision floats...smoke.\\n\\nChuck looks down.  A wisp of smoke curls up from the nest of\\ntinder!  Chuck blows on it gently.  Suddenly a tiny tongue of\\nflame flickers and catches on the kindling!\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Yes!  Yes!  Yes!\\n\\nHe feeds in some more twigs, more tinder.  The flames lick\\nout, catch, grow.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          If I ever forgot to thank you God, and I\\n          am sure I did, thank you now.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - WIDE - NIGHT\\n\\nThe fire burns on the beach.  Chuck rushes about, piling on\\ndriftwood.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - CLOSER\\n\\nChuck darts into the jungle and returns dragging a huge log.\\nHe throws it on the fire.  We see his face in the light of\\nthe fire.  He is exultant.  He dances.  He sings at the top\\nof his lungs.  Papa-ooo-mow-mow!\\n\\nChuck throws another huge log on the fire.  Papa-papa-papa-\\noooo!  The log splutters and explodes, sending up a huge\\nshower of sparks that climb and sparkle in the\\ndarkness...until they merge with the stars.\\n\\nEXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING\\n\\nChuck makes a mark on the tree.  Around it he carves a flame\\n-- the day he mastered fire.\\n\\nEXT.  PALM GROVE - LATER THAT MORNING\\n\\nChuck sharpens his spear with his stone knife.  Then he\\nsticks it in the flame to harden it, pulls it out, checks it,\\nscrapes some more.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\\n\\nChuck wades in the water with his spear.  Suddenly he stabs\\nit down.  A crab is on the end.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - HALF HOUR LATER\\n\\nChuck removes a crab from out of the fire and breaks a\\nsteaming crab claw.  Chuck takes a bite of the flaky white\\nmeat.  Ahhh.  It tastes great.  He takes another bite -- and\\nflinches.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Damn tooth!\\n\\nHe fumbles for his Tylenol and takes two pills.\\n\\nEXT.  SUMMIT - SUNSET\\n\\nChuck stands on the summit, looking in all directions.  Then,\\nsomething on the island brings Chuck\\'s eyes back from their\\ndistant focus on the horizon.  From down on the beach,\\nbeneath the palm grove, there curls a thin column of smoke.\\nChuck lets a bit of pride creep into his face as he sees it.\\nHe kneels down and begins to build a signal fire.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT - LATER\\n\\nChuck curls up in his bed of palm fronds.  The fire burns.\\nAround it is a large stack of crab shells.  He stares into\\nthe fire.\\n\\nEXT.  PALM GROVE - MORNING\\n\\nChuck makes another mark on the tree.  He has circled the\\ntree with marks several times now.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\\n\\nUsing a safety pin and some suturing thread, Chuck fishes\\ncarefully.  Suddenly he jerks his hand back.  On the end is a\\nflopping fish.\\n\\nEXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY\\n\\nChuck takes a cooked fish off the fire and mixes it with some\\nbreadfruit.  He eats the soft mixture, chewing carefully, but\\nhis tooth hurts even worse.  There are only a few Tylenol\\ntablets left.  He carefully cuts one in half and swallows it.\\n\\nEXT.  SUMMIT - AFTERNOON\\n\\nChuck arrives with the wood for the night.  He stares out to\\nsea as usual, but this time he sees something different.\\n\\nWHALES.  He sees whales.  Leaping.  Broaching.  Spouting.\\nWater pouring off fins and flukes.  Moving.  Going somewhere.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Beautiful.  So beautiful.\\n\\nChuck stares at them, stares until the ocean darkens and he\\ncan see them no more.  It\\'s late now.\\n\\nLeaving, he takes one last look, as he always does.  And\\nanother remarkable sight greets his eyes.  There, on the\\nhorizon, just below the evening star, is a...LIGHT.  He\\nstares at it, fixed.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          A star.  It\\'s a star.\\n\\nBut then he stares at it really hard.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          It\\'s a ship.\\n\\nEXT.  WOODS - TREE - NEXT DAY\\n\\nA tree shakes and moves, quivers...\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Timberrr!\\n\\n...then slowly falls with a CRASH!\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          I heard that...\\n\\nChuck holds his surgeon\\'s saw over the stump.  He walks to\\nanother tree and begins to saw his way into the trunk.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - SERIES OF SHOTS\\n\\nUp above the high tide line, Chuck lashes a log to a row of\\nfive logs already joined with vines.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          No more waiting.  Take action.\\n\\nChuck sews several designer dresses together with needle and\\nsuturing thread for a sail.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          That\\'s right.  Take action.\\n\\nHe cuts bamboo for the mast.  He carves driftwood for an oar.\\n\\nHe fills gourds with water, stores breadfruit and coconut as\\nhe sings \"Fly Me to the Moon\" to himself.\\n\\nHe ties the sail to the mast and extends it with a bamboo\\nboom lashed on with palm fiber and video tape.  He ties on\\nthe doctor\\'s kit and the FedEx box with the angel wings.\\n\\nHe examines his handiwork:  a finished raft.\\n\\nHe brings out his old life preserver and puts it on, then\\ngrabs hold of one corner of the raft to pull it down to the\\nbeach.  It doesn\\'t budge.  He tries to pull it again.\\nNothing.  He leans his back into it and pushes with his legs.\\nNothing.  He collapses on the beach, his breath coming in\\nheaves.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          How could I be so stupid?\\n\\nHe bangs himself on the head, over and over.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Stupid, stupid, stupid.\\n\\nEXT.  PALM GROVE - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck throws new firewood on the dwindling fire.  It comes\\nback to life.  Meteors streak again across the sky.  He\\nstares at the indifferent stars.  The moon is almost full.\\nShadows of palm trees sway on the sand.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck stands by the edge of the water, which shimmers in the\\nreflected light of the fire.  A wave come in, licks at his\\ntoes.  Lifts up a coconut husk, sweeps it gently out.  Chuck\\nwatches, gets an idea.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\\n\\nHe begins to dig in the sand by the raft.  He grabs the oar\\nand digs faster, making a trench up to where the raft is.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - MORNING\\n\\nThe rising tide floods water into the trench.  Chuck rocks\\nthe raft back and forth.  It floats!  As the wave recedes, it\\ntakes the raft with it.  Chuck has to run beside it.\\n\\nCHUCK TRYING TO ESCAPE - MONTAGE\\n\\nOver and over, we see Chuck capsize at the reef.  The first\\ntime he has a bandage on his leg.  He tries everything --\\ndifferent rafts, different approaches, but each time the\\nocean spits him back.\\n\\nEXT.  LAGOON - DAY\\n\\nDefeated and utterly exhausted, Chuck swims back from his\\nlatest failure.  He wades back ashore with the FedEx box and\\nthrows it on the ground by the palm tree.  He has tried so\\nhard to escape, so incredibly hard, done everything humanly\\npossible and beyond.  He rips off his life preserver, throws\\nit into the underbrush, then collapses on the beach.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          You\\'re too low in the water.  Too damn\\n          low.\\n\\nChuck\\'s shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deep\\nsobs of despair.\\n\\nAnd then he throws his head back and lets forth, from deep\\ninside himself, a SCREAM of rage and anger and pain.  The\\nScream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island,\\nthe rustling of the breeze, the lulling rhythm of the waves.\\nIt is powerful, disturbing, primal.\\n\\nThe breeze picks up.  Behind Chuck, the palm trees begin to\\nsway.  The tide is reaching up toward the beach.  The waves\\ncrash louder.  The palm trees sway even more.\\n\\nChuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Dust thou art -- that\\'s for damned sure\\n          -- and unto dust shalt thou return.\\n\\nA few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall, splashing on Chuck and\\nsizzling in the fire.\\n\\nChuck looks up:  clouds have obscured the sun.  The wind\\nblows harder.  The rain falls harder, streaking the sand\\nChuck had rubbed on his body.  STEAM sizzles out of the fire.\\n\\nChuck looks up, disbelieving.  The bottom falls out of the\\nheavens -- monsoon rain, more rain than you have ever seen\\nbefore.  A long wave rolls up, its frothy fingers reaching\\nfor the fire.\\n\\nForget the raft!  Forget despair!  The fire could go out!\\nThis is disaster!\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Shit!\\n\\nHe springs into action.  Chuck grabs an empty FedEx box.\\nWith his wooden shovel he frantically SCOOPS SOME COALS out\\nof the fire as the rain HISSES and POUNDS at them.  He slides\\nthe coals into the FedEx box, grabs some sticks of driftwood\\nand sets off on a run.\\n\\nEXT.  WOODS - DAY\\n\\nChuck runs through the woods, slipping and stumbling.  Vines\\ngrab at him.  The rain is so thick he can hardly see.\\n\\nEXT.  WOODS - MINUTES LATER\\n\\nChuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field.  Smoke\\npours out of the FedEx box.  The coals are about to burn\\nthrough!\\n\\nEXT.  LAVA FIELD - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck stumbles up the slippery rocks, dragging the smoking\\nbox.  His face is drenched, desperate.\\n\\nEXT.

I need firewood.\\n\\nSERIES OF SHOTS\\n\\nOn the beach, Chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the\\ndriving monsoon.  He can barely see.  Driven by the storm,\\nthe waves are licking at the palm grove.\\n\\nHe runs through the woods.  Branches whip at his face.  Roots\\ntear at his feet, tripping him.\\n\\nHe stumbles up the lava field.  Sliding.  Struggling.  Barely\\nable to breathe, the rain is so strong.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - DAY\\n\\nHe dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave.  But where\\nthe fire had flickered, there is only a pile of wet black\\nashes.\\n\\nTHE FIRE IS OUT.\\n\\nINT.

CAVE - NEXT DAY\\n\\nChuck emerges from the cave.  The rain has stopped.  This is\\nthe absolute lowest.  His face reflects his pain and despair.\\nHe\\'s trapped.  It\\'s hopeless.  Everything he tried to build\\nis gone.\\n\\nEXT.  LEDGE - DAY\\n\\nChuck slowly walks out on the ledge.  He stares down at the\\nwaves breaking on the jagged rocks far below.\\n\\nHe lets go one hand.  Then lets go the other.  He is barely\\nbalanced.  It looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him\\nright off.  He slides one foot to the very lip of the\\nprecipice.\\n\\nSuddenly his foot slips!\\n\\nInstinctively he turns into the cliff, grabs for a hold!  One\\nhand reaches for a nubbing of rock, slips off!  The other\\ncloses, his fingers straining to hold him.\\n\\nHe breathes in deep gasps.  He had wanted to end it, come so\\nclose.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          What the fuck are you doing?\\n\\nHis deepest instinct was to survive.

BEACH - LATER\\n\\nChuck walks aimlessly down the beach, feeling the burden of\\nstarting over.  The beach is littered with seaweed and\\nflotsam, bits of rope, plastic bottles.  He picks up a\\nplastic bottle.  That will come in handy.\\n\\nThe Chuck sees a SOCCER BALL with \"Wilson\" stamped on it in\\nbig black letters.\\n\\nHe picks it up, holds it, tosses it up in the air.  Then he\\nkicks it, then kicks it again, then runs down the beach,\\ntrying to kick it and keep it out of the water.  Feeling joy\\nagain, even here.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - THAT DAY\\n\\nThe sun is setting on his darkened cave.  The soccer ball\\nsits in the corner by the black cold ashes of what was once\\nhis fire.\\n\\nChuck carves a bit of coconut meat, takes a bite and winces\\nas the meat hits his sore tooth.  He tosses the shell on a\\nsmall new pile of shells.\\n\\nChuck shakes out the last half Tylenol tablet.  He puts the\\ntablet in his mouth, then takes a sip out of his coconut\\ncanteen.  When the water hits his tooth that hurts too.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - MORNING\\n\\nChuck mixes a mash of breadfruit and coconut.  He tries to\\npack the tooth with the mash, but it\\'s so sensitive that even\\nthis hurts.  He pounds the floor of the cave in frustration.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - LATER\\n\\nChuck holds a stone chisel and his hammer stone.  He\\npositions the chisel against his inflamed tooth.  But the\\nthought of what he is about to do is too frightening.

He raises it\\nslowly to his mouth and picks up the hammer stone.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          No pain, no gain.\\n\\nHe brings the hammer down hard on the chisel!  The screen\\ngoes BLACK as Chuck\\'s SCREAM continues UNDER.\\n\\nFADE IN:\\n\\nEXT.  OCEAN - SUNRISE - THREE YEARS LATER\\n\\nThe sky takes on the first colors of the day.  The ocean is\\nstill dark, but a few waves catch the first light.  The\\nsunrise touches the summit, moves down the cliff, then lights\\nthe cove.  On the screen superimpose:\\n\\n                     \"1000 DAYS LATER\"\\n\\nREFLECTION - WATER\\n\\nA spear shimmers in the calm morning water.  Attached to the\\nspear is a man, standing completely still.\\n\\nON CHUCK\\n\\nWe move up out of the reflection to the real man.  His legs\\nare scarred.  The remnants of a dress wrap around his middle.\\nA stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt\\nmade of videotape and woven fiber.  Necklaces of shark\\'s\\nteeth and shells hang from his neck.  His hair is long.  A\\ncoconut frond hat is on his head.\\n\\nThe hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a\\nberry.  It holds the spear perfectly still.  The watch is\\ngone.\\n\\nWe come around slowly until we see Chuck\\'s face.  The eyes\\nsay it all.  They stare out with a survivor\\'s intensity,\\nstaring at the water, unblinking.  This is the man who used\\nto splash futilely about in the water trying to fish.\\n\\nThis is the FedEx man who was plugged into the tumult of\\nactivity and energy, surrounded by technology and human\\nactivity at its most intense, devoted to making seconds\\ncount.  Now he is utterly alone, and utterly still.\\n\\nAnd now he has all the time in the world.\\n\\nSuddenly, without an once of wasted motion, he shoots the\\nspear forward at a low angle.  It quivers, stuck on the\\nbottom.  He pulls it out with a practiced twist.  On the end\\nis a struggling fish.\\n\\nBut this isn\\'t a thrill anymore.  It\\'s another day at the\\noffice.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY\\n\\nChuck makes a mark on a palm tree.  He has completely covered\\nthree other trees with marks.  It sinks in how long he has\\nbeen here.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - LATER\\n\\nChuck carries the fish back from the beach.  Now there is a\\nwell-worn trail.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - THAT AFTERNOON\\n\\nChuck enters with the fish.  We are greeted with the well-\\nordered lair of a primitive stone-age man.\\n\\nClam shell spirals weave in and out around the fire hole.\\nStrips of eel jerky and fish hang drying from racks.\\n\\nTools are lined up neatly:  digging sticks, stone hammers and\\nsaws, spears neatly hafted onto shafts, drills, awls.  Bits\\nand pieces of feathers, skins, bones, rags, leaves -- are all\\nneatly arranged.  Strings and cords hang from hooks.  Coconut\\nbowls and cooking rocks form a small kitchen.  A raincoat and\\nrain-hat woven of palm fronds is neatly draped over a frame.\\n\\nEvocative pieces of driftwood decorate the room.  A wind\\nchime of obsidian flakes sways gently.  The watch hangs on a\\nstick.\\n\\nThe Angel Box has the place of honor on one side.  On the\\nother side the Wilson soccer ball rests on a throne of rocks.\\nSeaweed has been placed on the ball as hair.  Clam shells\\nhave been stuck on for eyes, other shells form a mouth.  A\\ntube shell and conch form a pipe.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - FIRE - NIGHT\\n\\nThe fish are being smoke under a palm frond.  Eel skins hang\\nfrom sticks, roasting.  Chuck sits by the fire, hafting a\\nstone knife onto a wooden haft.\\n\\nHe ties some fiber to a stick, then braids it into string,\\nusing both hands and his mouth for the three strands.\\n\\nHe ties the string tightly around the shaft.  He does his\\nwork automatically.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT - LATER\\n\\nChuck eats some fish and some mashed breadfruit.  He chews\\neach bite, his eyes in distant focus.  The firelight flickers\\non his face.\\n\\nEXT.  CLIFF - SUNRISE\\n\\nChuck carries firewood up to the summit.  He mechanically\\nadds wood to the fire.  As he does so, something out to sea\\ncatches his eye.  He stops and stands up.\\n\\nCHUCK\\'S POV - WHALES\\n\\nWHALES broach out past the rocky point.  Spouts of water\\nshoot into the air.\\n\\nON CHUCK\\n\\nAs he watches them, a light comes back into his eyes.  He\\ngrins.  There\\'s a big gap where his teeth had been.  He turns\\nand strides down the hill.\\n\\nEXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nHe heads across the rock bridge that once had so terrified\\nhim, without losing stride.  It\\'s second nature now.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck enters the cave, picks up the ball and heads out.\\n\\nEXT.  SUMMIT - EVENING\\n\\nThe signal fire burns.  A spectacular cloudy sunset lights up\\nthe sky.  Chuck sits with Wilson on the summit, a bowl of\\nmashed breadfruit in one hand, a bowl of roasted eel skin in\\nanother.\\n\\nAs Chuck watches the sunset unfold, watches the whales going\\nby in the darkened water, he takes some roasted eel chips,\\ndips them into the breadfruit paste, and offers one to\\nWilson.  His voice is flat, monotonal.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Chips?  Dip?\\n\\nBut Wilson declines.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          No?\\n\\nHe takes a big crunchy bite.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Another fucking day in paradise.\\n\\nPULL BACK as the sun goes down and Chuck reaches into the\\nbowl again and dips an eel skin chip in the dip.\\n\\nEXT.  ROCKY LEDGE - NIGHT - LATER\\n\\nTorch in one hand, Wilson in the other, Chuck walks across\\nthe rocky ledge.  He passes the flume without even noticing.\\n\\nSuddenly his shoe breaks!  It\\'s sandal made of woven yucca\\nleaves.\\n\\nHe bends down and fixes it, then heads on down the ledge.\\n\\nEXT.  LEDGE - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck makes a casual leap, a leap he has made hundreds of\\ntimes, but this time the sandal comes loose.  It catches on a\\nrock, and CHUCK FALLS!\\n\\nHis hands are cut and bruised.  He tries to get up, can\\'t.\\nChuck sits back and examines his foot.  His fingers come back\\ncovered with blood.  He reaches out to steady himself, and\\nleaves a HANDPRINT OF BLOOD on the rock.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - LATER\\n\\nChuck wraps his foot in bandages.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - LATER\\n\\nChuck\\'s face is sweaty.  He looks down at his foot.  It is\\nred, swollen, infected.  He stands up, tries to put some\\nweight on it.  The pain is intense.\\n\\nChuck sticks the scalpel onto some coals to sterilize it.  He\\nholds it over his foot, takes a breath, then jabs in into the\\nwound.  The pain is intense.  Chuck passes out.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck stirs, takes a drink, weakly tosses on another log, and\\ncollapses back on the floor.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - DAY\\n\\nChuck wakes up, trembling, shaking, wet with sweat.  He\\nstaggers up.  His shadow sways on the wall of the cave.  He\\nstruggles to get another log on the fire.  He squints at his\\nonly companion, the soccer ball.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Help me, Wilson...\\n\\nHe collapses again.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck stirs and squints his eyes.  He takes a drink of water.\\nHe is feeling better.  He puts another log on the fire and\\nslowly begins to chew on some breadfruit and dried fish.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER\\n\\nChuck slowly wades into the water, favoring his injured foot.\\nBut something feels different.  He glances around.  What is\\nit?  And then he sees something, perhaps the worst possible\\nsight.\\n\\nCHUCK\\'S POV - SAIL\\n\\nA SAIL is moving steadily away from the island.\\n\\nCHUCK\\n\\nThrows down the spear and waves his arms.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          No!  Wait!  Come back!\\n\\nHe runs into the water and starts to swim.  He is so weak,\\nhowever, he can only make a few strokes.  He tries to yell as\\nhe swims...\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Wait!  Wait!\\n\\nChoking and weak, he turns back and drags himself up on the\\nbeach.  In the b.g., the sail dwindles into the distance.\\n\\nEXT.  SUMMIT - LATER\\n\\nChuck struggles to the top of the hill.  His fire has been\\nextinguished by the rain.  In the distance, far against the\\nhorizon, he sees a sail -- or is it a cloud?  The whiteness\\nshimmers against the horizon.  Chuck squints.  Whatever it\\nwas, it is gone.  Above him some contrails from jets mark the\\nsky.\\n\\nFurious, he kicks his signal fire, scattering the burnt-out\\ncoals.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER THAT DAY\\n\\nChuck makes a new mark on his calendar tree.  Then he stops.\\nHe CUTS an angry big line under the last mark, then hacks\\naway at the palm tree, slashing it with the stone knife,\\nripping and marking through all his dates.  Finally the stone\\nknife breaks in two.  Chuck drops the broken half and catches\\nhis breath.\\n\\nEXT.  CAVE - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck enters the cave.  No signal fires burn.  The island is\\ndark.\\n\\nEXT.  SUMMIT - DAY\\n\\nChuck stands on the summit, staring out to sea.  Nothing, not\\neven a contrail, not even a whale spout.\\n\\nEXT.  CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nHe is on his way down, suddenly he sees something and stops.\\nIt\\'s the HANDPRINT, the bloody handprint, his own handprint.\\n\\nHe slowly extends his hand and covers it, then pulls it away.\\nTraces it with his fingers.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - DAYS LATER\\n\\nChuck has the beginnings of an artist\\'s studio.  Several\\nlarge clam shells hold paint.  A few egg shells are lined up.\\nBrushes have been made from roots and feathers.\\n\\nChuck covers his hand with paint and makes a handprint on the\\nwall of the cave.  He stands back and looks at it.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - DAY\\n\\nHe chews some berries, then holds his hand against the wall\\nof the cave and spits a dark blue mist around it.  When he\\ntakes his hand away, the silhouette of his handprint remains.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - DAY\\n\\nWith the Angel Wing Box as a model, Chuck dips one of his\\nfeather brushes in paint, and make a tentative line on the\\nwall of the cave.  He works hesitantly, rubs off a line,\\ntries again.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck is finishing his first figure, a crude portrait of a\\nman -- himself?  Hard to tell.  He examines his work.  He\\ntakes some shells and sticks them on as eyes.\\n\\nChuck picks up Wilson, thinks.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          You old airhead, you need a makeover.\\n\\nHe takes some charcoal out of his fire and draws eyebrows on\\nthe ball.  Then, he mashes some berries, dips his fingers in\\nthe juice, and makes lips.  He sticks shells on with clay for\\neyes.  Then he looks at the face.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Wilson, you bad!\\n\\nHe sits back and regards his companion.  He gestures around\\nthe cave at the new paintings.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          What do you think?\\n\\nBut Wilson doesn\\'t have an opinion.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          You don\\'t share much, do you?\\n\\nIdly Chuck takes down the Angel Box.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          I guess I know how Kelly felt.\\n\\nFor a long time he studies the wings on it.  With a stick, he\\ntries to draw a similar wing on the dusty floor of the cave.\\nDissatisfied, he wipes it away.  He looks at the Angel Box.\\n\\nCasually he reaches over and cuts it open with a stone knife.\\nInside he finds two bottles of green salsa.  And a letter.\\n\\nHe reads over it.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          You said our life was a prison.  Dull.\\n          Boring.  Empty.  I can\\'t begin to tell\\n          you how much that hurt.  I don\\'t want to\\n          lose you.  I\\'m enclosing some salsa, the\\n          verde you like.  Use it on your sticky\\n          rice and think of home.  Then come home\\n          -- to me.  We\\'ll find the spice in our\\n          lives again.  Together.  I love you.\\n          Always.  Bettina.\\n\\nVisibly moved, Chuck puts down the letter.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          He never got it.\\n\\nEXT.  ISLAND - DAY\\n\\nThe monsoon pours down.  Wind whips the palm trees.  The\\nwaves are gray and angry, tearing at the beach.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - DAY\\n\\nAs the rain pours down outside, Chuck studies the sodden,\\nruined photograph of Kelly, which is really only a gray mess.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          She\\'s probably found someone else.  I\\n          would have.\\n\\nChuck dips his finger into one of the bowls of colors and\\nstreaks it slowly across his face.  To exorcise his\\nloneliness, he will paint on the most expressive canvas there\\nis:  his own body.\\n\\nCHUCK PAINTING HIMSELF - MONTAGE\\n\\nClose-up on scarred fingers, as they paint on Chuck\\'s face\\nand body.  Color on skin.  Tight dramatic shots of Chuck\\nbeing transformed.\\n\\nChuck takes white paint and covers his hand.  Then he presses\\nit into his chest and makes a handprint.  He draws a yellow\\nspiral on his leg, then takes red and makes jagged lightning\\nbolts on his chest on either side of the hand.\\n\\nWATER\\n\\nShimmers in a gourd.  Chuck\\'s face swims into focus.  It has\\nbeen painted white.  Looking at himself in the reflection, he\\ndots on blue stars with dark blue from squid ink.\\n\\nEXT.  CAVE - LATER\\n\\nThe rains have stopped.  The island is washed bright and\\ngreen.\\n\\nON CHUCK\\n\\nAs he stands up in the cove.  His face is white with blue\\nstars.  Handprints circle his torso, flanked by red lightning\\nbolts.  Braided cords circle his biceps.  Bone necklaces hang\\nfrom his neck.  Feathers jut out from his hair.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY\\n\\nChuck goes from tree to tree, making handprints along his\\npath.  Chuck was here.  This is his mark.\\n\\nEXT.  PALM GROVE - DAY\\n\\nHe covers the calendar trees with handprints.  Then stops.\\nSees something.  Eyes fixed on the beach, he walks toward the\\nshoreline.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\\n\\nChuck emerges from the palm trees, and now we see what he had\\nseen.\\n\\nA FIFTY-FIVE GALLON OIL DRUM.\\n\\nAnd another one.  TWO.  Chuck stares at the barrels.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Hello.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER\\n\\nChuck sits staring at the oil drums.  It\\'s almost as if he is\\nhesitating to take advantage of them.  That he may not want,\\nreally, to leave now.\\n\\nThen his inner struggle ends.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          What the hell are you waiting for?\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER\\n\\nFilled with determination, Chuck rolls a barrel up the beach.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - LATER\\n\\nUsing a palm tree as a fulcrum, Chuck hauls hard on a rope\\nmade of vines, pulling the barrel up off the beach.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY\\n\\nChuck throws aside palm leaves, revealing...the remains of\\nhis raft.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck is drawing with a purpose now.  And we see what he is\\nworking on.  The plans for a raft.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck is making a list of what he needs.  He works intently.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Canteens.  Sea anchor.  Got to weave\\n          rope.  Spears.  A sail.\\n\\nEXT.  JUNGLE - DAY\\n\\nChuck lashes the barrels onto the raft.  Checks the knots.\\nLashes more rope.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT\\n\\nHe sews dresses together with handmade fiber string.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT\\n\\nHe weaves videotape together to form a sea anchor.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\\n\\nChuck digs a channel toward the raft.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - DAY\\n\\nChuck constructs a water collection device with some FedEx\\nboxes, some plastic weighted with a stone.  Explains it to\\nWilson.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Now I\\'m hoping that if this is airtight\\n          I\\'ll get condensation down here, a cup or\\n          so a day.  If I\\'m careful it should be\\n          enough.\\n\\nINT.  CAVE - NIGHT\\n\\nChuck writes on the wall.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          If I never return, know that here lived\\n          Chuck Noland for four years.  I drew\\n          these paintings.  I made these marks.\\n          And then I took my fate in my own hands\\n          and set forth to save myself, God\\n          willing.\\n\\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\\n\\nChuck loads the raft, which rocks gently in the cove.  He has\\na sail made of designer dresses sewn together with fiber\\nthread.  A sea anchor secured by videotape woven together\\ninto a rope.  Plastic bottles filled with water.  A signal\\nkite made of FedEx paper.\\n\\nThen comes the FedEx box with the angel wings.  Then Wilson.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Wilson, my main man.  Time to go.\\n\\nAnd he gently leads the raft into the lagoon.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Wonder what odds Stan would give me on\\n          this.  I\\'d say 90-10.  Against.\\n\\nHe jumps onto the raft, begins to paddle out toward where the\\nsurf crashes onto the reef.\\n\\nEXT.  LAGOON - DAY\\n\\nWaves break against the reef.  With his paddles Chuck\\nmaneuvers the raft toward the cut in the reef.  Boom!  The\\nwave crashes, the water surges through the cut, then recedes\\nwith a whoosh.\\n\\nChuck watches, times the waves, paddles like mad.  He\\'s\\ncommitted.  SCRAPE goes the first barrel, then the second,\\nriding the receding wave.  He\\'s out!\\n\\nBut the next wave is already surging forward.  It smashes the\\nraft against the reef!  Coconuts and foodstuffs hurtle off\\nthe raft!\\n\\nThe barrels cushion the impact.  The raft tilts, spins, but\\nstays outside the reef!  The ropes holding the jugs of water\\nbreak!  The water sweeps overboard!\\n\\nThe wave recedes again.  Chuck recovers, paddles with all his\\nstrength, and then he\\'s clear of the breakers!\\n\\nFor a long moment he floats on the rollers, getting his\\nbreath.\\n\\nThe water jugs float away, carried by the waves back into the\\nlagoon.  Chuck could go back and get them.  If he were being\\nprudent, he definitely would.\\n\\nBut he\\'s out.  He might never get back out again.\\n\\nHe stares at the lagoon and the receding water jugs.  Then he\\nstares at the island.  Goodbye to all that.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Wilson, we\\'re out of here.\\n\\nHe turns and begins raising the sail.\\n\\nEXT.  OCEAN - WIDE - MINUTES LATER\\n\\nPowered by its multicolored makeshift sail, trailing its\\ngently flapping signal kite of FedEx paper, the raft slowly\\nmoves away from the island, out toward the open ocean.\\n\\nAnd we pull back until the ocean swallows the tiny raft and\\nthen we TILT DOWN AND...\\n\\n                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\\n\\nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY - FOUR WEEKS LATER\\n\\nThe ocean again, low.  The raft floats into frame.  A trace\\nof a breeze flaps the signal kite, which barely stays aloft,\\nits rope frayed and tattered.  The still is set up in the\\nmiddle, plastic with a rock weighting down the center.\\n\\nChuck is gaunt, his clothes rotted.\\n\\nHe lies looking over the side of the raft, spear in one hand,\\nstaring intently at the water.\\n\\nDorados swim like specters, flashing and darting.  Chuck\\nstabs with his spear.  Stabs again.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Slow down, damn you!\\n\\nExhausted, he sinks back to the raft.  Two Dorados leap into\\nthe air ahead of him.\\n\\nChuck tries to stare again into the water.  He spots another\\nfish, a flash of silver under the surface.\\n\\nChuck struggles to his feet, raises his spear.  SPLAT!\\nSomething strikes him in the chest, almost knocking him into\\nthe water.\\n\\nOn the raft we see flashes of silver and green and blue.  A\\nFLYING FISH.  Chuck dives at it, catches it, loses it.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Catch it catch it catch it --\\n\\nHe catches it again just as it almost flops over the side.\\n\\nEXT.  RAFT - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nChuck sucks the juice out of the head.  He chews meat off the\\ntiny rib bones.\\n\\nChuck is in the stage of malnutrition, vitamin deprivation,\\nsalt insufficiency, and exposure where the personality splits\\nand becomes external.  Like all castaways, he has\\nconversations with the two sides of himself.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          Save some for tomorrow.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          Catch another fish tomorrow.\\n\\nBadChuck wins.  Chuck keeps eating.  He stares up at the sun,\\nwhich beats down unmercifully.\\n\\nEXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER\\n\\nThe raft drifts.  Chuck has taken down the sail and rigged it\\nas a canopy.  Drenched with sweat, Chuck lies on the raft,\\ntrying to sleep.  He dabs at some sores that are ulcerating\\nhis body and won\\'t let him get comfortable.  Plus, there\\'s a\\nchaffing, squeaking sound.  He looks around for the source.\\n\\nWe see it with him.  One of the ropes is frayed and about to\\nbreak.  If it does, the logs will come apart from the floats.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          Shit!  Shit!  Shit!\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          Stay calm, identify the problem.\\n          Problem, rope fraying.

Enough.\\n\\nThen another.\\n\\nEXT.  RAFT - DAY - LATER\\n\\nChuck works to braid a new rope.  He is focused,\\nconcentrating as hard as he can, but everything is slow and\\nhard and he\\'s weak and clumsy.  He tests the rope, but it\\ndoesn\\'t hold.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          Think.  Got to use something else.\\n\\nHe gets an idea, starts to pull the signal kite in.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          If they can\\'t see you, what\\'s the point?\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          Survive today, that\\'s the point.\\n\\nThe kite rope is much thinner than the rope he had used to\\ntie the logs, but it\\'s all he has.  He ties the log with the\\nkite rope.  Exhausted, he lies back down.\\n\\nEXT.  RAFT - NIGHT\\n\\nThe moon is full.  The waves cast off shadows on the ocean.\\nChuck is staring into the sky, trying to find a star to\\nnavigate by.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I\\'m too\\n          far south.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          You don\\'t know where you are.

RAFT - DAY\\n\\nChuck saws at the outer log with his stone knife.  Across the\\nwater comes a storm.  We can see it like a waterfall moving\\ntoward us.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          You\\'re putting off the inevitable.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          I\\'m putting it off.\\n\\nHe looks at the deteriorating rope, at the rotting sail.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          That\\'s what\\'s happening to you.\\n\\nChuck pushes the outer log away, then takes the loose rope\\nand begins to lash it around the center logs.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          You\\'re rotting away.\\n\\nThe raft is rocking.  The waves are stronger.  It\\'s hard to\\ntie the logs together.\\n\\nRain falls like a sheet on Chuck.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          Get water!\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          Fix raft first.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          Water water water --\\n\\nChuck works frantically in the rain, trying to tie the rope.\\nFinally he does.\\n\\nThen he scrambles for his water collecting funnel, struggles\\nto pull it up.  One corner is stuck and collapses.\\nDesperately he rights it, pulls the funnel up.\\n\\nDrops begin to run down the sides and collect in the jar.\\nSoaked, Chuck stares at the water as it rises.\\n\\nThen the rain stops.\\n\\nWe see the line of rain recede away from Chuck, spattering\\nthe ocean.  But all around him the ocean is calm again.\\n\\nAnd out comes the sun.\\n\\nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY\\n\\nThe raft floats on quiet seas.  The sky is blue, with few\\nhigh cirrus clouds so motionless they seem pasted on.\\n\\nChuck lies on the raft, sick and weak.\\n\\nSuddenly, from the depths beside him, silently rises a huge\\nshape.\\n\\nA SPERM WHALE, still mainly submerged.  The blow hole is near\\nChuck, wet and pulsing like giant lips.  The eye of the whale\\nis only a few feet away.  It looks upon Chuck out of an\\nintelligence deep and alien.\\n\\nHe slowly comes to his knees and stares at it.\\n\\nThe blow hole opens and WHOOSH, out shoots a geyser of fine\\nspray which settles on Chuck in a mist.\\n\\nThe whale rises farther, dwarfing the raft.  From the whale\\ncomes a deep sound like a foghorn.\\n\\nStartled, Chuck jumps back, rocking the raft.  He catches\\nhimself, slowly reaches out and touches the whale.\\n\\nThe whale blows again, drenching Chuck in more spray.\\n\\nChuck touches the whale again.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          You like that?\\n\\nVery slowly it drifts along with the raft.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          Lost your mate?\\n\\nWe look right into the whale\\'s eye.  Beneath the surface we\\ncan see the huge jaws open and close.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          You\\'re beautiful.  Marry me.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          You idiot, if he dives, he\\'ll capsize the\\n          raft.\\n\\nVery slowly the whale moves ahead of the raft, its vast body\\npassing Chuck.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          No, don\\'t go.  Look, I\\'ve got fish.\\n\\nChuck rips a fillet off the line and throws it in front of\\nthe whale, which ignores it.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          Please don\\'t dive.  Please.\\n\\nThe whale slowly sinks, then suddenly arches its huge back\\nand heads straight for the bottom.\\n\\nFor a moment, all that remains are the flukes, black and\\nvertical against the dark blue sky.  With one swoop, those\\nflukes could destroy Chuck and his raft.  But they don\\'t do\\nanything except slowly sink.\\n\\nThen it is gone.\\n\\nWe are on Chuck\\'s face as he stares at where the whale had\\nbeen, the surface marked only by a ring of concentric ripples\\nthat reach out and gently rock the raft.\\n\\nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY\\n\\nChuck checks the water.  It is green and full of floaties.\\nIt looks awful.  He takes the jug, puts it to his mouth, and\\ndrinks.  Instantly he throws up back into the jug, barely\\nkeeps from dropping it.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          Look what you\\'ve done.\\n\\nHe dips his hand into the ocean, splashes some sea water on\\nhis face, splutters it out, then licks his lips.  He is so\\nthirsty.\\n\\nHe looks at the water jug, full now with his own vomit, turns\\naway, begins to work on the sea anchor again.\\n\\nBut the work makes him even thirstier.  He looks at the jug\\nagain.\\n\\nPicks it up.  Takes a long drink.\\n\\nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY\\n\\nThe fish return.  Chuck gets up with his spear, then puts it\\ndown.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          What are you doing?\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          Can\\'t kill another one.  Can\\'t.  Can\\'t\\n          kill my friends anymore.\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or\\n          you die.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          Why do they have to die for me?\\n\\n                     BADCHUCK\\n          They\\'d eat you if they could.  They\\'re\\n          laughing at you.  Listen.\\n\\nChuck listens.  Doesn\\'t hear anything.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          Got to eat.\\n\\nChuck picks up the spear, stabs it, misses.\\n\\nSuddenly he has a fish on the end of the spear.  It\\nstruggles, he scoops it onto the raft, brutally pounds on its\\nhead, twists the stone knife into its spine.  The struggling\\nstops.\\n\\nChuck looks at the dead fish and begins to sob.\\n\\n                     GOODCHUCK\\n          I am so sorry.\\n\\nHe cries uncontrollably.  As he cries he cuts off the head,\\npulls out the eyeballs, and eats each one.  Then he sucks the\\nmarrow out of the head.\\n\\nThen takes the heart and eats that.  Then eats the liver.\\n\\nAs he is chewing, he cuts the meat into strips.\\n\\nWhen he is done, he takes the backbone, breaks it, and sucks\\non it.\\n\\nFish scales shine in his hair, blood covers his chest.\\n\\nEXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT\\n\\nThe raft rocks gently.  Chuck looks up.  The strips of fish\\nare glowing.  So is the deck where he killed the fish.\\n\\nHe reaches out to touch the fish strips.  His hand is glowing\\ntoo.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          I\\'m an angel.\\n\\nSuddenly he sees other lights.  A ship.  A ship is out there.\\nAnd he hears it, a humming in deep register.\\n\\nHe waves his hands.  He yells.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Here!  Here!\\n\\nHis voice cracks, we can barely hear it over the ocean.\\n\\nThe lights move on.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          No...no...no...\\n\\nHis raft is rocked by the wake, rocked hard.  Chuck is thrown\\ninto the water!\\n\\nHe comes to the surface, sputtering.  Where is the raft?\\n\\nHe looks one way, then another.  Darkness.\\n\\nThis is the worst.\\n\\nHe turns again in the water.  There, dimly, he can see the\\nglow from the fish he killed.  The glow saves his life.\\n\\nHe swims toward it.\\n\\nHe pulls himself back on the raft.\\n\\nHe lies there exhausted, the glow from the phosphorescence\\ncasting a greenish light on his face.\\n\\nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY\\n\\nClouds are building up.  In the distance lightning flashes.\\nThe clouds come closer.\\n\\nLittle bits of electricity jump off the mast.  Saint Elmos\\nfire jumps around Chuck\\'s hand.\\n\\nFascinated, he holds out his hand.  The fire jumps from his\\nhand to the mast.\\n\\nSuddenly lightning shoots from the sky and strikes the ocean!\\nA huge spout of water explodes like a depth charge.  The\\nCRACK is intense, then rolls away.\\n\\nChuck stares, then realizes the danger and throws himself\\ndown on the raft.  Suddenly a wall of rain sweeps over him\\nand the ocean begins to roll.  The thunder is deafening.\\nLightning flashes bursts through the rain.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Sea anchor!  Let out the sea anchor!\\n\\nFrantic, Chuck lets out the sea anchor as the raft scuds down\\na huge wave.  The anchor catches, slowing the raft so that it\\nrides the wave down.\\n\\nThe waves come at him high as houses.  The raft rides up one\\nside, then plunges down the next.\\n\\nAll Chuck can do is hold on.\\n\\nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY\\n\\nThe storm has passed.  The raft floats on big dark rollers.\\n\\nWe hear the chirping and squeaking of dolphins.  They come\\nclose to the raft.  Chuck watches them play.  Then realizes\\nthey are chasing his fish.  They drive them along, into the\\npath of another dolphin, who darts in and rips into the\\ndorado, turning the water around the raft into churning,\\nbloody foam.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Stop!\\n\\nHe takes his oar and begins beating the water.  The killing\\ncontinues.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          You fucking murderers!\\n\\nSuddenly the water is still.  One dolphin sticks its head out\\nof the water and stares at Chuck, squeaking.\\n\\nAnother dolphin lifts its head up, then another.  They squeak\\nto each other, clearly communicating and talking about Chuck.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          I know you\\'re talking about me!\\n\\nHe splashes the water with his oar.\\n\\nThey dive, then jump into the air, squeaking as they go.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n               (very softly)\\n          Take me with you.\\n\\nThey\\'re gone.\\n\\n                     CHUCK\\n          Why me?

OCEAN - DAY\\n\\nChuck tries to stretch with some simple yoga.  Each movement\\ntakes forever.\\n\\nHe rolls over onto his stomach and tries to do a pushup.  He\\ncan\\'t.

CAMP - DAY\\n\\n       UP ON the door of a weathered cattle car as a German\\n       soldier steps into frame wearing that familiar gray of\\n       the all-too familiar era.\\n\\n       He throws the door to reveal a mass of huddled and\\n       frightened people inside.\\n\\n       The words are not necessary.  The language is not ours\\n       and the images say enough.\\n\\n       Men, women and children are herded off the train like\\n       cattle toward a large open yard.  There they huddle until\\n       the Germans begin to shout and shove through the mob.\\n\\n       EXT. FENCE CORRIDOR - DAY\\n\\n       We are looking up at rows and rows of fences topped with\\n       barbed wire all designed to create a separator for the\\n       thousands of Jew who pour through each day.\\n\\n       Then we see the eyes themselves that look up at them.\\n\\n       A LITTLE BOY.  A boy who will not die this day.  A boy\\n       who will live to see the end of the war and the world of\\n       the future.\\n\\n       He stares at the metal wire with an unusual fascination.\\n\\n       The boy looks up at HIS WORRIED PARENTS - a sturdy-\\n       looking couple who try to smile and comfort him.\\n\\n       The corridor comes to a junction where it splits in\\n       several different directions.\\n\\n       Soldiers here push the mob using rifles as pikes,\\n       screaming and terrorizing the lot of them.  Suddenly it\\n       is clear what they are doing.  They are dividing the mob\\n       into smaller groups.\\n\\n       Soon, the groups themselves become evident.\\n\\n       Men from women.  Children from adults.\\n\\n       The family tries to stay together, clinging to one\\n       another dearly, until finally, they are put upon by a\\n       number of gray uniforms and pulled apart. The boy is\\n       dragged screaming his feet no longer touching the ground.\\n       Two soldiers carry him as they follow the back of a large\\n       column of children being led through a gate of barbed\\n       wire so dense, it resembles wool.\\n\\n       The gate closes and the boy looks back to see his parents\\n       - along with many others - being restrained by a number\\n       of soldiers.  The screaming is deafening.\\n\\n       And the boy\\'s can be heard above it all.  The soldiers\\n       seem to be having a hard time carrying such a frail\\n       child.  The farther they get from the fence, the heavier\\n       he seems to get, until they are literally pulling him as\\n       though he were anchored to something.\\n\\n       His outstretched fingers claw at the thin air and he\\n       screams until the blood in his face is blue.\\n\\n       The soldiers are literally pulled back a step and they\\n       begin to slip in the mud. They look at one another and\\n       then over their shoulders as they hear a sound.\\n\\n       A groaning, creaking sound.  And then the unmistakable\\n       twang of wire stretched to snapping.\\n\\n       ANGLE ON:\\n\\n       The fence.  The gate that separates the parents.  It bows\\n       toward them like iron filings to a magnet, and several of\\n       the strands of barbed wire have given way.\\n\\n       The boy continues to scream as all the other faces simply\\n       freeze and wonder.\\n\\n       One of the soldiers pulls a wooden baton from his belt\\n       and brains the boy violently.\\n\\n       He slumps and the soldiers carrying him spring forward as\\n       through a rope that was holding them back has been cut.\\n       They nearly fall, looking at one another with some\\n       concern, some confusion....\\n\\n       Then they follow the line of children that has gotten\\n       ahead of them.\\n\\n       ANGLE ON:\\n\\n       The boy\\'s parents watch him as he -- as they, are taken\\n       away.\\n\\n       The rest of their story is as you would expect.\\n\\n       EXT. SKY - DAY\\n\\n       Bright, bright blue framing a blinding white sun.\\n\\n       PAN DOWN AGAIN TO REVEAL:\\n\\n       The cracked, drought-stricken soil of nowhere.\\n\\n       TITLES:\\n\\n       KENYA - 1978\\n\\n       A group of children at play.  Tribal children who,\\n       without the help of the titles, could be from any age.\\n\\n       They run through a tiny village of tents, playing.  Every\\n       child holds a long reed-like stick and they chase each\\n       other playing their version of tag.\\n\\n       As each child is tapped, they chase the others.  Each\\n       trying to avoid being \"it\", though never going far enough\\n       away to miss the fun.\\n\\n       One girl in particular.  A PRETTY GIRL OF 12, with\\n       unusual white hair, is tagged and immediately shunned.\\n\\n       She chases kids this way and that, but to no avail.  She\\n       is not strong enough, nor agile enough, to win.\\n\\n       She tumbles and lands on her stick, snapping it.  She\\n       stands and, when the children see that her stick is\\n       broken, they begin to giggle.\\n\\n       The giggles become laughter and the laughter becomes a\\n       taunt, and before we even realize, the inherent cruelty\\n       of children let loose becomes evident.\\n\\n       They have now formed a circle, at first avoiding her\\n       touch with distance, but now growing tighter with menace.\\n       In the unspoken manner of children at prey, the group\\n       begins to chant in their native tongue - a song we have\\n       not heard but sung in a way none-too inviting.  They\\n       begin to poke at her with the reeds, driving her back.\\n\\n       The girl now moves to the center of the circle, no longer\\n       wishing to tag anyone.\\n\\n       ONE DEVIOUS CHILD seems to get an idea.  He takes his\\n       stick and smacks it across her shoulder.  She turns to\\n       face the child and another swings his stick across her\\n       back with a solid THWACK.  Before long, mob rule gives\\n       way and all the kids are swinging at her and laughing.\\n\\n       It grows to the brink of frenzy, the laughing and the\\n       shouting not too unlike the noise of the previous scene.\\n\\n       So much so, we may miss the first flake of snow.  The\\n       children certainly do.  It is snowing for a good ten\\n       seconds before the last of them stops.\\n\\n       By then, the snow is thick as flies and wafting down to\\n       melt instantly on the hot African soil that has never\\n       seen snow before.\\n\\n       ANGLE ON:\\n\\n       Adults come out of their huts and in from the fields and\\n       the whole of the village is soon gathered around the\\n       little girl, staring up from the clear blue sky and the\\n       snow that falls from nowhere.  From nothing.\\n\\n       One by one, all eyes fall on the little girl and the\\n       looks of curiosity become looks of fear.  Of\\n       superstition.\\n\\n       Punctuated by a solid thump.\\n\\n       And then another.\\n\\n       AN OLD MAN looks down at his feet and sees a tiny,\\n       misshapen ball of ice, no bigger than his eye.  He looks\\n       at it, bites it, then pops it in his mouth - breath\\n       turning to steam.\\n\\n       Another such chunk of ice pops him on the head.  THE\\n       CROWD LAUGHS.\\n\\n       They look up again and see that mixed with the snow are\\n       tiny pellets of hail, seeming to increase in number as\\n       the snow mysteriously wanes.\\n\\n       And the pellets are getting larger.  Until they land as\\n       hunks.\\n\\n       The white haired girl drops to the ground and covers her\\n       head as hailstones the size of baseballs plow into the\\n       Earth.\\n\\n       Before long, tents are collapsing and panic ensues.\\n\\n       And all along the white haired girl sits huddled in the\\n       dust, crying.\\n\\n       As hailstones fall in a circle around her, never coming\\n       closer than then a few feet or so.\\n\\n       INT.  HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT\\n\\n       ONE MORE SKY.  This one a backdrop.

A\\n       cosy little abode, showing signs of neglect, as though\\n       decorated with a gentler touch that passed not too long\\n       ago.\\n\\n       A large shelf replete with books.  An electric mix from\\n       Sun Tsuís The Art of War to Mark Twainís The Adventures\\n       of Huckleberry Finn.\\n\\n       A fire burns in the fireplace.  On the mantle sit a few\\n       old black and white photos of a slightly younger Logan\\n       posing with a group of HARD-CASE MILITARY TYPES in a\\n       heavily wooded area.  We can not tell if they are true\\n       Military or simply mercenaries.\\n\\n       In the wall above the mantle, a sketch of a beautiful\\n       woman.\\n\\n       And finally we come to the occupant of the house, sitting\\n       at the only table in the center of the room.  His back is\\n       to us.  His hair is coarse and black, sprouting wildly\\n       from his head.  He is LOGAN.  We will come to know him\\n       well.  As well as we can.\\n\\n       Despite the loud, pounding music, he is working with the\\n       meticulousness of a watch maker.  At the same time, he\\n       smokes a thick cigar.  A tall bottle of beer on the floor\\n       next to his chair.  A SINGLE, SILVER DOG TAG hangs from\\n       his neck from a battered chain.  As we get closer, we\\n       look over his shoulder and see what he is working on so\\n       intensely.\\n\\n       Pencil rubs against paper furiously.  He is sketching,\\n       what we cannot see.  But he is definitely caught up in\\n       his own minds eye.\\n\\n       HIS HEAD SUDDENLY TURNS.  He listens to something we\\n       cannot begin to hear.   A momentary pause, and he goes\\n       back to sketching.\\n\\n       Just as he seems to be settling back into the details\\n       again.\\n\\n       WHACK\\n\\n       He reaches over and shuts off the music coming from the\\n       box beside him.  He listens.\\n\\n       He stands, turning around slowly in a circle.

Past the fire which\\n       sounds suddenly like a blazing inferno, past the clock\\n       which ticks as loud as clapping hands, past the simmering\\n       tea-kettle which hisses like a seething cauldron.\\n       Finally, he glances at the cigar which we hear crackling\\n       nearly as loud as the fire.\\n\\n       Loganís senses are amplified many times more then ours,\\n       he walks to the door.\\n\\n       E.C.U.\\n\\n       His nostrils flare.\\n\\n       He raises his fist beside his face.  For a moment, it\\n       seems as if he is just chinking.  Then -- SHOOK - THREE\\n       STEELY CLAWS some nine inches long, emerge inexplicably\\n       from the skin just above Loganís knuckles.\\n\\n       Logan barley turns his head before.\\n\\n       BOOM\\n\\n       THE WINDOW EXPLODES, letting in freezing wind and\\n       billowing snow.\\n\\n       Logan is hit from behind.\\n\\n       The attack is so ferocious that we are unable to make out\\n       the attacker.  Whatever it is, it is HUGE.  We can hear\\n       it snarling and see flashes of its claws as it slams\\n       Logan back.\\n\\n       EXT. CABIN - DAY\\n\\n       The front door SMASHES OPEN.  The two combatants roll\\n       madly down the hill obscured by flying snow.\\n\\n       Finally, we see Logan separate from his attacker and\\n       CRASH THROUGH THE ICE of the frozen lake.\\n\\n       E.C.U. - A MASSIVE CLAW-LIKE HAND lifts into frame the\\n       SHINING DOG TAG hanging from it.

His\\n       skin goes pale.  He is drowning.\\n\\n       EXT. ABOVE ICE - DAY\\n\\n       We hear an angry grunt as the thing starts to hunt for\\n       Logan.  It stalks across the ice, searching.  We catch a\\n       glimpse of shoulder, a CLAWED FOOT, a MANE OF HAIR.\\n\\n       UNDER ICE\\n\\n       Loganís struggle has decreased somewhat as his strength\\n       wanes.\\n\\n       CRACK\\n\\n       The ice above Logan shatters as a clawed hand reaches\\n       through.\\n\\n       EXT. ABOVE ICE - DAY\\n\\n       A violent YANK.  The ice gives way to the soaked and half-\\n       frozen Logan.\\n\\n       The creature picks Logan up by his face, CUTTING DEEPLY\\n       into his cheek, and holds him up like a rag doll.  The\\n       two are face to face.  This is called SABRETOOTH.  The\\n       reasons are obvious.\\n\\n       Teeth like said animal and catís eyes to match.\\n\\n       A mutant, certainly a member of a class remote in the\\n       extreme.\\n\\n       And then it speaks.\\n\\n                           SABRETOOTH\\n                 Itís not gonna be that easy.\\n\\n       Logan, half-drowned, opens his eyes and looks right at\\n       Sabretooth as though heís going to say something.\\n       Instead, a LUNG-FULL OF WATER comes shooting out.\\n\\n       With that, Sabretooth ROARS, as he hoists Logan up and\\n       throws him.  Logan flies nearly ten yards.  He lands head\\n       first.\\n\\n       Sabretooth skulks over to him.\\n\\n       With the sound of Sabretoothís breathing comes the rising\\n       of the wind...\\n\\n       Snow from the ground begins to swirl in the bitter cold\\n       air.\\n\\n       Sabretooth is nearly upon Logan now and the wind rises\\n       further, until he must shield his eyes from the bitter\\n       icy air.\\n\\n       As he approaches, we see a fresh cut on Loganís face\\n       HEALING BEFORE OUR VERY EYES, leaving not so much as a\\n       scratch.\\n\\n       THEN:\\n\\n       A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHT\\n\\n       Lightning.  No.  Lightning is not red.\\n\\n       Sabretooth looks around, puzzled, then down at Loganís\\n       motionless body.  Then to his feet where a hole in the\\n       ice sprouts bubbling water.\\n\\n       The wind blows so violently now that he nearly misses two\\n       figures standing only a few yards away - mere silhouettes\\n       in the icy haze.\\n\\n       A closer look tells us it is a man and a woman, THEY WEAR\\n       STRANGE UNIFORMS of form-fitting material - the man wears\\n       a reflective visor that hides his eyes.  The womanís face\\n       is care revealing dark skin, penetrating eyes and unusual\\n       white hair.\\n\\n       ANOTHER FLASH - one that seems to come from the manís\\n       visor itself.  An intense beam of red light.\\n\\n       Sabretooth looks down and sees the ice at his feet has\\n       broken away.\\n\\n       He plunges through the ice like a mark in a carnival\\n       dunking tank.  His massive weight and hairy coat quickly\\n       suck him down.\\n\\n       The TWO FIGURES - CYCLOPS (Scott Summers) AND STORM\\n       (Ororo Munroe) - obviously two of the children we saw\\n       earlier now grown - move over the hole and calmly watch\\n       Sabretooth gather himself and swim back to the surface.\\n\\n       Storm looks down at the hole, concentrating her intense\\n       gaze.  The wind whips further and the water in the hole\\n       begins to freeze over.\\n\\n       UNDER THE ICE\\n\\n       Sabretooth wisely concedes.\\n\\n       With one last look at the two mysterious figures now\\n       nearly obscured by the ice, he turns his body and swims\\n       away with the same agility he had on land.\\n\\n       ABOVE THE ICE\\n\\n       THE SNOW AND WIND ARE NOW VIOLENTLY RAGING\\n\\n       Cyclops and Storm walk over to Logan and look down at him\\n       curiously.\\n\\n       LOGANíS P.O.V.\\n\\n       They look at one another, wondering.  Above them, a black\\n       shape looms into frame, bringing with it the whining of\\n       jet engines.\\n\\n       This is the X-JET and it is like no other plane we have\\n       seen before.\\n\\n       Loganís eyes begin to close as they obscure the last of\\n       all perceptible detail.\\n\\n       INT.

A chart made up of\\n       blocks depicting the elements and their chemical symbols.\\n\\n       Among the standards like Gold (Au) and Iron (I) and\\n       Oxygen (O2) is a new square on simple red construction\\n       paper tacked to the top.\\n\\n       It contains simply a large letter ìA.î\\n\\n       TRACKING SHOT THROUGH:\\n\\n       We are in a laboratory of sorts, quite different from any\\n       we have ever seen -- and so are its occupants.\\n\\n       MORTIMER TOYNBEE, a dim, loyal thug whose agile leaping\\n       ability and superhuman strength have earned him the name\\n       TOAD.\\n\\n       Across the room, JOHN ALLERDYCE, a wiry redhead whose\\n       ability to control fire with his fingers has earned him\\n       the name PYRO.\\n\\n       In the corner we see BLOB, no explanation needed,\\n       devouring a BUCKET of cereal, preariously balanced on his\\n       huge belly.\\n\\n       They are a bestial and sinister bunch.\\n\\n       Toad and Pyro are working on:\\n\\n       A MACHINE\\n\\n       A fantastic device which occupies a hallowed space in\\n       this lab.

He lights a\\n       lighter with the other, then drops it.  Strange thing --\\n       the flame remains hovering about his finger.  Quickly the\\n       flame intensifies and turns blue, melting the solder over\\n       a small circuit board.  Then, the flame is gone.\\n\\n       He sticks out his hand like a surgeon.\\n\\n                           PYRO\\n                 Hand me the dykes.\\n\\n       Toad, both hands occupied, flicks his long tongue and\\n       grabs a pair of pliers which he rests in Pyroís hand,\\n       leaving them slicked with SLIME.  The flame in his finger\\n       goes out.

CORRIDOR/OFFICE - NIGHT\\n\\n       WE MOVE through subterranean corridors and past dozens of\\n       projects that share some similarity to the machine we\\n       have seen, including crude designs that have been\\n       rejected or stripped of their good ideas.\\n\\n       FAINTLY we become aware of a clicking sound.  Almost like\\n       a stopwatch very far away, always growing louder.\\n\\n       The newscast has faded and another voice is getting\\n       closer from somewhere down the hall.\\n\\n       Sabretooth emerges around a corner heading towards us,\\n       turning just as we get to him.  The clicking is loud and\\n       clear now.\\n\\n       Sabretooth enters an office and we follow him.  Seated at\\n       a desk in the center of the room is MAX LENSHERR - age -\\n       somewhere after sixty, but strong and vital for his\\n       years.  He is more often called MAGNETO.\\n\\n       The clicking is from the sound of an executive pendulum\\n       thingy on his desk.  The six steel balls hang onto one\\n       another from string supports in formation depending on\\n       how many are let to fly from either end.  One ball\\n       strikes one and one ball swings out from the other.  Two\\n       balls and two, and so on.\\n\\n       Slight difference.  There are no strings supporting the\\n       balls, thus defying gravity.\\n\\n       A chess set - all of its pieces made of beautifully\\n       crafted iron - sits on the far end of the desk.\\n\\n       He is watching television, or more accurately listening -\\n       his eyes looking off into space, deep in thought.\\n\\n                           INTERVIEWER\\n                 ...and the leading voice in the call\\n                 for Mutant registration is Senator\\n                 Scott Frank Kelly, of Florida, who\\n                 claims to support the constitutional\\n                 rights of the genetically enhanced,\\n                 but whose crusade to register mutants\\n                 is gaining popularity.\\n\\n       Now Kelly is on the screen.

His\\n       look asks ìwhat happened?î\\n\\n       Sabretooth crosses the room and places the shining dog\\n       tag on the table.

That is all they know\\n                 because that is all you know.\\n\\n       Nothing odd about the tag at a glance, military dog tag,\\n       weathered and beaten, but certainly plain, Canadian\\n       Military, Loganís name, rank, and a faded serial number.\\n\\n       His thumb feels the indention of the word at the bottom\\n       of the tag that does not seem to fit here.\\n\\n       WOLVERINE\\n\\n       We hear the voice of Senator Kelly on the TV.  Kelly is\\n       on the screen giving good face.\\n\\n       As he turns up the television, and again, we donít see\\n       how, he places the dog tag on his desk, thinking.\\n\\n                           KELLY\\n                 I think the Presidentís pre-occupation\\n                 with international affairs has drawn\\n                 his attention away from this problem.\\n                 Americanís deserve the right to decide\\n                 whether they want their children to be\\n                 in school with mutants.  To be taught\\n                 by mutants.  They also have the right\\n                 to know the dangers.  Thatís the\\n                 purpose of registration.

The television\\n       shuts off and Magneto waves a hand as though beckoning\\n       someone to follow.  Or some thing.\\n\\n       He stops and looks back at the dog tag on the desk and\\n       waves again.  A paper clip just next to the dog tag skips\\n       off the desk and into Magnetoís hand.  He drops it,\\n       annoyed and tries again.\\n\\n       A slight rattle, then nothing more, as though the dog tag\\n       were held down by an unimaginable weight.\\n\\n       He walks over and picks up the dog tag, inspecting it,\\n       then trying to bend it.  Nothing.\\n\\n                           MAGNETO (contíd)\\n                 Can it be..?\\n\\n       He puts it back on the desk.  Now Magneto concentrates -\\n       sending a wave of magnetic force that ripples the air\\n       around it.\\n\\n       The tag trembles, but does not budge.  He looks at\\n       Sabretooth and smiles.\\n\\n                           SABRETOOTH\\n                 Is that what youíre looking for?\\n\\n                           MAGNETO\\n                 A piece.

Besides two\\n       arms and two legs, the only remotely human thing on his\\n       ape-like face is a pair of wire spectacles.  He addresses\\n       a class of kids between the ages of 16 and 17.\\n       Besides the occasional physical alterations, there is an\\n       overall oddness to the group, giving way to the fact that\\n       in some way or another these are all mutants.\\n\\n                           BEAST\\n                 So as their leaders went, so did\\n                 follow the hearts and minds of the\\n                 people of the Roman empire.  Which\\n                 made for some very happy Christians.\\n\\n       Now he sees Logan standing in the door, looking back at\\n       him in mute shock.\\n\\n                           BEAST (contíd)\\n                 Can I help you?\\n\\n       All the students turn to see Logan, standing in a\\n       hospital gown with a mean case of bed head.  They start\\n       to giggle.\\n\\n       Logan turns and heads down the hallway to the left.\\n\\n       INT. HALLWAY - DAY\\n\\n       Logan hears footsteps and quickly does a one eighty back\\n       down the hallway.  He turns a corner, hugging the wall.\\n       He halts.  A large oak door stands down the hall.  He\\n       smells something, taking in a deep breath, his head\\n       cocking to the side - listening.\\n\\n       He turns and looks behind him.  More foot steps.  Someone\\n       is about to enter the hall.\\n\\n       He turns again, ready to run the other way when he sees\\n       the SHADOWS of two more people coming from the other\\n       direction.  Logan is trapped.  He lunges for the large\\n       oak door and bursts through.\\n\\n       INT. XAVIERíS OFFICE - DAY\\n\\n       Logan shuts the door and leans his head back against it,\\n       exhausted.\\n\\n                           VOICE (O.S.)\\n                 Good morning, Logan.\\n\\n       Logan, still clutching his stolen clothes, opens his eyes\\n       and sees a man sitting behind a large mahogany desk --\\n       PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER, an intense and intelligent man\\n       just to look at him.\\n\\n                           XAVIER\\n                 Would you like some breakfast?\\n\\n       Logan, who was prepared for anything but this, just\\n       stares.\\n\\n                           XAVIER (contíd)\\n                 Iím sorry, allow me to formally\\n                 introduce myself -- I am Professor\\n                 Charles Xavier.

We realize Logan\\n       ìhearsî the voice in his head.  In addition, the voice is\\n       accompanied by the FAMILIAR SOUND OF FOOT STEPS\\n       indicating that perhaps Xavier had herded Logan through\\n       the mansion with his mind.  He does not like it.\\n\\n       Xavier comes out from behind his desk.  We see that he is\\n       in a MOTORED WHEELCHAIR.  Realizing that he is safe for\\n       the moment, Logan begins putting on his stolen clothes.\\n\\n                           LOGAN\\n                 What am I doing here?\\n\\n                           XAVIER\\n                 I brought you here so that you would\\n                 be safe from Magneto.\\n\\n                           LOGAN\\n                 Who?\\n\\n                           XAVIER\\n                 A very powerful mutant who for some\\n                 reason has taken an interest in you.\\n                 Iím not sure why, but until we find\\n                 out, I must ask you to stay.\\n\\n       Logan looks Xavier over.  He is obviously a kind man who\\n       is offering his help.  Logan is silent for a moment.\\n\\n                           LOGAN\\n                 No thanks.\\n\\n       Logan goes to the door.\\n\\n       Xavier, disappointed, just watches him go.\\n\\n       INT. FRONT HALL - DAY\\n\\n       Logan sees a grand entrance with two huge oak doors and\\n       brightly-polished steel knobs that scream ìexit.î  He\\n       starts in that direction when the doors begin to open.\\n\\n       A moment of traffic, laughing, chatter... then they are\\n       all gone.\\n\\n       He gets to the doors and pushes them open.  Bright white\\n       sunlight floods in, nearly blinding him.\\n\\n       EXT. MANSION - DAY\\n\\n       The first thing he sees through the haze is wings - GIANT\\n       WHITE, FEATHERY ANGEL WINGS.\\n\\n       A young boy, no more than fourteen, has them sprouting\\n       from his back.  He is stretching not only his limbs, but\\n       his unusual appendages in the morning breeze.\\n\\n       Sensing something - the boy turns, and sees this\\n       shambling ruin of a man in the doorway.\\n\\n       Off Loganís expression, we hear the flapping of wings and\\n       see his awestruck face following the boy onto the sky.\\n\\n       This only holds his attention for a moment.  Logan looks\\n       across an expanse of grounds that house the Mansion.  A\\n       high, wrought-iron gate surrounds the entire property.\\n\\n       He watches as several children play basketball across a\\n       large court.\\n\\n       Logan shakes his head and is out the closing door.\\n\\n       Xavier simply watches from his window.\\n\\n       EXT. MANSION - FRONT GATE - DAY\\n\\n       Logan heads for the gate.\\n\\n       SHOOK -- Logan pops his claws.\\n\\n       Suddenly, the gate slowly opens -- Inviting him to leave.\\n       He pauses, momentarily confused.  He takes one long look\\n       back at the mansion.  And then leaves.\\n\\n       Stay for a moment.  Watch him go.  Then pan across a sign\\n       which reads --\\n\\n           PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIERíS SCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED\\n\\n                        Westchester N.Y.\\n\\n       PANNING slowly across the road to the thick woods on the\\n       other side of the street.\\n\\n       SOMETHING MOVES in the trees, catching our eye.  Someone\\n       is watching.  It is Toad, camouflaged amidst the trees\\n       and branches.\\n\\n       EXT. SKY - DUSK\\n\\n       A helicopter streaks across the sky.\\n\\n       INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK\\n\\n       Kelly sleeps fitfully in the large seat.  A bump of\\n       turbulence.  He wakes suddenly and looks out the window\\n       seeing the ocean below.\\n\\n       Kelly looks out the window again and sees water.  They\\n       are flying low.\\n\\n       He looks at Guyrich, who sleeps as well.  He wakes him.\\n\\n                           KELLY\\n                 Where the hell are we?\\n\\n       Guyrich looks out the window and looks at Kelly, puzzled.\\n       He stands and goes to the door to the cabin of the\\n       helicopter.\\n\\n                           GUYRICH\\n                 Pilot?\\n\\n       No answer.

What\\n       is known is that the place is no pleasure resort.\\n\\n       It is in fact some sort of refurbished island fortress,\\n       complete with turrets, built right into the side of the\\n       cliffs.\\n\\n       EXT. ISLAND HELIPAD - DUSK\\n\\n       A clearing in the middle of a ring of trees at the base\\n       of a rocky rise.  The helicopter touches down.\\n\\n       THE PILOT, wrapped from head to toe in a flight suit and\\n       helmet, gets out and opens the side door, exposing Kelly\\n       and Guyrich to the intense wind of the rotors.  They\\n       cover their eyes, cowering.\\n\\n       KELLYíS P.O.V.\\n\\n       Two figures come out of a hole in the mountain.  One\\n       seems extremely larger than the other.\\n\\n       Guyrich and Kelly step out.  As they get closer he can\\n       make out Magneto and Sabretooth.\\n\\n                           KELLY\\n                 Dear God... Dear...

As Magneto nears, Guyrich\\n       steps forward to greet him, putting arms around Magnetoís\\n       neck and kissing him deeply.  Then Magneto looks deep and\\n       lovingly into Guyrichís eyes.\\n\\n       And with that GUY SHAPE SHIFTS into a beautiful woman who\\n       herefore will be known as MYSTIQUE.  Her body is covered\\n       in iridescent blue scales, which complement her lovely,\\n       solid yellow eyes.\\n\\n       Kelly, of course, is shocked.  Mystique shows a little\\n       hip, raising the scales at her mid-section mockingly, as\\n       the last of what we thought was Guyrich slips underneath.\\n\\n                           KELLY\\n                 You... wha...

A light\\n       that fills the room as it expands outward and engulfs\\n       everything in sight.\\n\\n       It is liquid light.  Creeping and unstoppable.\\n\\n       From outside the room, Pyro and Sabretooth watch through\\n       the window.

And this turns to dust in his fingers.\\n\\n       Magneto has amazed even himself this time.\\n\\n       The silence is shattered by a phone ringing.  Sabretooth\\n       picks it up.

They are drinking\\n       from beer cans in paper bags.\\n\\n       Across the aisle from them sits a lone oddly pretty\\n       twenty year old girl.  Her name is ROGUE -- a dark-eyed\\n       and somewhat distant creature.  From the shawl around her\\n       head to her boots, layers of odd clothing wrap every inch\\n       of her body, except her face and hands.  She looks worn,\\n       it is the face of a runaway.  Next to her, a dirty duffle\\n       bag.\\n\\n       The Brads are staring at Rogue, making lewd comments\\n       about her.  They have obviously been drinking for awhile.\\n\\n                           BRAD 1\\n                 Hey.\\n\\n       Rogue looks at him, then quickly looks away.\\n\\n                           BRAD 1 (contíd)\\n                 Hey... Hey Iím talking to you.\\n\\n       The Brads laugh amongst themselves at her reaction.\\n\\n                           BRAD 2\\n                     (looking at her duffle bag)\\n                 Where are you going?\\n\\n                           BRAD 1\\n                 Awww... look guys sheís shy.\\n\\n                           BRAD 3\\n                 Maybe thatís why sheís alone.  Is that\\n                 why youíre alone?\\n\\n       Brad 4, who is closest to Rogue, leans toward her.\\n\\n                           BRAD 4\\n                 Iíll keep you company.\\n\\n       Rogue is silent and turns her back on him, trying to\\n       ignore him.\\n\\n                           BRAD 4 (contíd)\\n                 Hey...  Iím talking to you.\\n\\n       Rogue continues to ignore him.  This gets Brad 4 angry.\\n       The other Brads watch his failure and laugh.\\n\\n                           BRAD 4 (contíd)\\n                     (louder)\\n                 I said Iím talking to you!\\n\\n       ANGLE ON: Logan, his ears picking up everything.\\n\\n       Rogue looks down trying not to look at them.\\n\\n       Brad 4 will not be ignored.  He reaches out to the one\\n       place which is not covered by clothing that he can reach -\\n       - Rogueís hand lying at her side.\\n\\n                           BRAD 4 (contíd)\\n                     (louder still)\\n                 I said...!\\n\\n       He grabs her hand.\\n\\n       Suddenly, Brad 4ís eyes open wide as if heís in shock, an\\n       instant later, he COLLAPSES.\\n\\n       Rogue reels back.\\n\\n       Bradís 1, 2, and 3 stand up, they are angry.\\n\\n                           BRAD 1\\n                 Hey, what did you do?\\n\\n                           ROGUE\\n                 Donít touch me.\\n\\n       Rogue stands, frightened and confused.  Brad blocks her\\n       in.\\n\\n                           BRAD 3\\n                 Hey Brad, sheís a mutant!\\n\\n       Rogue moves to get away, but Brad 1 shoves Rogue.  Rogue\\n       falls to the floor of the train, right next to Loganís\\n       feet.  Brad 1 moves toward her.\\n\\n       Suddenly, Logan steps in front of Brad 1.\\n\\n                           LOGAN\\n                 How about you sit down and leave the\\n                 kid alone, alright?\\n\\n                           BRAD 1\\n                 Sheís a mutant.\\n\\n                           LOGAN\\n                 Yeah, well, nobodyís perfect.\\n\\n       ANGLE ON: Rogue, she gets up and huddles toward the rear\\n       of the train.\\n\\n                           BRAD 1\\n                     (who is considerably larger\\n                      than Logan)\\n                 I think you should take a seat little\\n                 fella.\\n\\n       He shoves Logan backward.  Logan gathers himself.  Brad 4\\n       is very weak but regaining consciousness.\\n\\n       Brads 2 and 3 stand to back their friend against Logan.\\n       Itís now three against one.  All the passengers are\\n       watching --\\n\\n                           LOGAN\\n                 Listen -- I donít want any trouble.\\n\\n                           BRAD 1\\n                 Well you got trouble.\\n\\n       Brad 1 slams his fist into Loganís stomach.  Logan grabs\\n       the manís fist and lifts him up and over, slamming him\\n       into the train floor.\\n\\n       Brad 2 grabs a commuterís briefcase and smashes it on\\n       Loganís head.  Bursting open, its contents fly\\n       everywhere.\\n\\n       Logan turns.  Brad 2 stares wide-eyed as the gash on\\n       Loganís head starts to heal.\\n\\n       Suddenly, Brad 1 is up.  He grabs Logan around the neck\\n       from behind.  He holds Logan in his head lock while Brad\\n       2 and 3 start punching  him in the stomach and face.\\n       Logan is taking quite a beating and naturally the entire\\n       train of people are doing nothing.\\n\\n       ANGLE ON: Loganís eyes, his pupils are getting smaller.\\n       His brow furrows like a wolf.  A low guttural GROWL.\\n\\n       Suddenly rage -- PRIMAL RAGE\\n\\n       Loganís feet kick out, his left foot strikes Brad 1 in\\n       the face knocking him backward, while his right foot\\n       hooks around Brad 2ís head dragging him forward.  With\\n       his left hand Logan grabs Brad 2 by the throat, squeezing\\n       the esophagus.\\n\\n       Brad 2 is paralyzed.  His eyes roll up as the oxygen is\\n       cut off.  Brad 2 collapses.\\n\\n       ANGLE ON: Brad 3 running out of the car with the other\\n       passengers.  A TRANSIT COP pushes past the fleeing\\n       passengers, into the car.\\n\\n       Brad 1 still bear hugs Logan from behind.  Logan reaches\\n       pushing his knuckles against Brad 1ís leg.  Suddenly:\\n\\n       SHOOK -- the sound of metal extending.  Brad 1 howls in\\n       pain.  SHOOK -- the sound of metal retracting.\\n\\n       Brad 1 releases Logan and stares down at three punctured\\n       holes in his leg.  Logan wheels around, kicks him to the\\n       floor, and punches him.\\n\\n       All eyes in the train are on Logan, as he raises his\\n       fist.\\n\\n       SHOOK -- Logan extends his claws.\\n\\n       Logan is at the peak of his rage.  The passengers stare\\n       in disbelief.  Even Rogue is astonished.\\n\\n                           TRANSIT COP\\n                 Freeze... transit police.  Drop your\\n                 weapon.\\n\\n       Logan pauses, only for a second.  Brad 1 is wailing for\\n       his life.\\n\\n       But rage has taken over.  Logan raises his blades to\\n       finish what he started.\\n\\n       Suddenly, THE TRAIN LURCHES VIOLENTLY.  Logan goes flying\\n       backward.\\n\\n       EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT\\n\\n       The train has been brought to a sudden stop -- but the\\n       wheels are still turning.  Finally, they are shut down.\\n\\n       INT. TRAIN CAR - NIGHT\\n\\n       The lights are out.  Everyone gathers themselves.  Then\\n       comes a low grinding creak.  The sound of metal bending.\\n       Rivets popping.\\n\\n       EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT\\n\\n       Like the top of a sardine can, the entire side wall of\\n       the train car is peeled off.  Revealing the terrified\\n       passengers inside -- and Magneto, Sabretooth, Mystique\\n       Toad and Pyro on the outside.  With a final thrust, the\\n       air RIPPLES and Magneto tosses the car wall to the side.\\n\\n       Passengers from the other cars stare wide-eyed out their\\n       windows.  The train has stopped at a railroad crossing,\\n       the gates are down.\\n\\n                           MAGNETO\\n                 You can come out now, Logan.  Youíre\\n                 among friends.\\n\\n       The transit cop rises to his feet, brandishing his\\n       pistol.\\n\\n                           TRANSIT COP\\n                 Freeze!\\n\\n       With a turn of his finger, Magneto draws the pistol to\\n       him.  The cop holds tight and is yanked off the train,\\n       onto the ground.  With another twist of his hand, Magneto\\n       makes the gun leap from the copís grasp and HOVER,\\n       pointing at the copís head.\\n\\n                           MAGNETO\\n                 You Homo Sapiens and your guns.\\n\\n       The gun cocks.\\n\\n                           XAVIER (O.S.)\\n                 Thatís enough, Max!\\n\\n       All turn to see Xavier, seated in his wheelchair --\\n       flanked by Cyclops, Jean and Storm.

Cyclops steps\\n       forward.  Xavier need not turn to know help is coming.\\n\\n       Magneto sees and respects Cyclopsís power.  The chair\\n       stops moving.\\n\\n                           XAVIER\\n                     (to Cyclops)\\n                 Itís alright... itís alright.\\n\\n       Magneto glances at Storm, then Cyclops.\\n\\n                           MAGNETO\\n                 The two in Alaska.  Just how do you\\n                 people manage to be in the right place\\n                 at the right time?

Leave him to me.\\n\\n       Logan slowly rises from the huddled passengers.\\n       Sabretooth fighting the urge to move on him.

Suddenly, all\\n       the passengers except Rogue lay on the floor and seats\\n       and go to sleep.  A few of them even snore.\\n\\n                           XAVIER (contíd)\\n                 Now will you come back with us?\\n\\n       A look crosses Loganís face.

We see massive security measures, the likes of\\n       which have never been attempted, being prepared.\\n\\n       (Voice plays over the rest of the scene)\\n\\n                           NEWSCASTER (V.O.)\\n                 Is there such a thing as too much\\n                 security?  A possible complication\\n                 adding to the United Nations\\n                 Anniversary is the sheer number of\\n                 security personnel for what will be\\n                 the largest single summit in the\\n                 history of the planet.\\n\\n       He walks towards the cell and tries to look down the\\n       hall, pressing his face to the bars.\\n\\n                           NEWSCASTER (V.O.

He\\n       gasps in pain, but more from shock.  He pulls his head\\n       back with some difficulty and POP, it squeezes right back\\n       through.\\n\\n                           KELLY\\n                 What have you bastards done to me?\\n\\n       Kelly is horrified.  Disgusted.  He paces the cell,\\n       unable to comprehend what has happened to himself.\\n\\n       It is only when he hears the sound of a HELICOPTER IN THE\\n       DISTANCE that he reacts.  He starts to panic, then\\n       collects himself.  Then he goes over to the bars again.\\n       He pauses, afraid... then:\\n\\n       He pops his head through again.  He turns his shoulder\\n       toward the bars and begins to push.  His feet slip in the\\n       floor and his fingers stretch and crack inside, then his\\n       ribs begin to pop one by one with the brittleness of\\n       undercooked spaghetti.  It is agonizing, but Kelly\\n       finally manages to pull his horribly-altered body through\\n       the bars.\\n\\n       INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\\n\\n       Kellyís whole chest and pelvis are slightly flattened\\n       beneath his clothes, but with a hideous crunching sound,\\n       they seem to inflate again back to normal.\\n\\n       Kelly looks at his body with a mixture of fascination and\\n       disgust.\\n\\n                           VOICE\\n                 HEY.\\n\\n       Kelly turns and screams.  Blob has just walked into the\\n       room and lunges, grabbing him by the arms.  Kelly is\\n       enveloped in this fat, hulking mass.  He manages to keep\\n       one hand free and all he can do is push it against Blobís\\n       face.  It is futile.  Until...\\n\\n       Steam begins to come off Blobís face.

It is\\n       blistered and hideous.  Blob is gasping for air.\\n\\n       Magneto looks and sees the cell is empty.

MAGNETOíS LAIR - NIGHT\\n\\n       Kelly hits the fresh air, looking around wildly.  He runs\\n       for the edge of a cliff high over the ocean.\\n\\n       He raises his hands, we see his palms are covered with\\n       those wicked spines and they are dripping a venomous\\n       fluid not too different in color from the wound on Blobís\\n       face.\\n\\n       But then suddenly, something is wrong.  Kelly buckles,\\n       clutching his stomach again.  He squelches what would\\n       have been a scream of agony.\\n\\n       He looks at his palms and the spikes are gone.\\n\\n       Kelly hears footsteps.  Suddenly out of the darkness\\n       Sabretooth barrels toward him.\\n\\n       Kelly turns and LEAPS.  Sabretooth comes to the edge of\\n       the cliff.\\n\\n       When he looks over, Kellyís body has vanished.  Swallowed\\n       by the sea.\\n\\n       Only his clothes remain on the rocks below.\\n\\n       INT.

It is\\n       as if she has taken in his trait of berserker rage.  Soon\\n       she is smashing things all around her.  One hand rakes\\n       the wallpaper like claws.\\n\\n       Finally, she gets a hold of herself, becoming the\\n       introverted Rogue we all know so well.\\n\\n       Then she stands slowly, looks at the others.\\n\\n       And she runs from the room.  Storm runs after her.\\n\\n       The rest turn to Logan, who lays on the floor,\\n       convulsing.\\n\\n       Jean goes to help him.  She looks back at Cyclops.

Logan turns into frame, he is wearing a\\n       dark blue MASK.\\n\\n       It fits his head neatly.  The sides arch up shadowing his\\n       ears, giving him a wolf or fox-like appearance.

Everyone can see him now.\\n       Before Xavier can finish his sentence he is interrupted\\n       by --\\n\\n       APPLAUSE -- simple, genuine, applause.\\n\\n       Students slowly stand up.  Proud of Logan.  For he is one\\n       of them.  He is a mutant.  And he is a hero.\\n\\n       As the unconditional applause echoes around him, Logan\\n       seems sincerely touched by their spontaneous outpouring.\\n       He is almost choked up -- almost.\\n\\n       The applause quiet.\\n\\n                           XAVIER (contíd)\\n                 Well, Logan.\\n\\n       All eyes are on Logan.

He walks over to the\\n       table with Storm, Cyclops and Jean.  Jean smiles at him,\\n       so does Cyclops -- his arm around the back of her chair.\\n\\n       Logan sees them together, they are happy, and finally he\\n       offers a smile.\\n\\n       Xavier holds for a moment at the door.  A look of pride\\n       on his face, the pride a father has for his children.\\n\\n       INT. PLASTIC PRISON - DAY\\n\\n       A CLEAR PLASTIC HALLWAY\\n\\n       Thatís right, PLASTIC.

And to win a war it takes the\\n                 will to fight it at all costs, by any\\n                 means necessary.  And for that reason,\\n                 I will always have the advantage.  No\\n                 matter how you trap me, how I am\\n                 contained -\\n\\n       Chess pieces seem to visually mimic their conversation\\n       Xavierís white pieces slowly surrounding Magnetoís Black\\n       King.\\n\\n                           MAGNETO (contíd)\\n                 - I will always find an escape.\\n\\n                           XAVIER\\n                 And I will always be there, old\\n                 friend.\\n\\n       And with that, Xavier places his queen gently down,\\n       taking away a knight.\\n\\n                           XAVIER (contíd)\\n                 Check.\\n\\n       Just then, the door to the cell opens.

When he reaches for a \\n     handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a \\n     lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of \\n     feet to oblivion.\\n                                \\n                                ETHAN\\n                Whoaa..\\n\\n     He pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang.\\n\\n     REVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT\\n\\n     with Ethan\\'s hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the \\n     summit.  He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who \\n     favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.

He turns to see the source of the \\n     beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo \\n     streamer.  Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now \\n     ominously circling back.\\n\\n     Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of \\n     the copter.  With a distinct lack of enthusiasm.\\n\\n     The helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears.

Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder \\n     over her wanna-be escort, a very attentive gentleman.  Nyah \\n     offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to \\n     the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one \\n     another.

Once upstairs, a security \\n     guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her\\n     down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to \\n     Ethan.  In a few moments, Nyah can be seen past the \\n     windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following.  \\n     In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard \\n     can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the \\n     hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah.  Ethan smiles, moves out \\n     of shot.\\n\\n     INT - MASTER BEDROOM (EVE)\\n\\n     Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom.\\n\\n     INT - BATH (EVE)\\n\\n     A decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored \\n     walls.  The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler         \\n     chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of \\n     ice.  Nyah can\\'t resist.  She spoons a dollop of the caviar and \\n     downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to \\n     its back.  There, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff, \\n     revealing an electronic density meter.  She turns it on and holds \\n     it at the rear of the tub.  Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from \\n     green thru yellow and into red.\\n\\n                                NYAH\\n                        (her fondest hopes confirmed)\\n                Mmmm.\\n\\n     She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the \\n     tiles just above the sop dish.  Her knee eyes search for any \\n     cracks in the grout and she spots one.  Using a tweezers she \\n     pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing \\n     something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles.  \\n     She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish.\\n\\n     There\\'s the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble \\n     casing out from the rear of the tub.  Nyah breathes a sigh of \\n     relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself \\n     looking down at an open safe, revealing some half-dozen locked \\n     compartments.  As she studies them:\\n\\n                                ETHAN\\n                Decisions, decisions.\\n\\n     Nyah looks up to see Ethan\\'s reflection in the bathroom \\n     mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub.\\n\\n                                NYAH\\n                What are you doing here?\\n\\n                                ETHAN\\n                Think you\\'re the only one who can pick a \\n                lock?\\n\\n                                NYAH\\n                        (not altogether pleased)\\n                I see.  You\\'re not just another pretty face..\\n\\n     Before Ethan can answer, a voice can be heard coming from the \\n     bedroom warbling Granada in Spanish, and with considerable gusto.\\n\\n                                NYAH (cont\\'d)\\n                Oh god.  A bloody baritone.\\n\\n     Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethan\\'s in the bathroom mirror.  \\n     She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the \\n     tub, pulling him down on top of her.  Once again they\\'re nose to \\n     nose.\\n                                \\n                                ETHAN\\n                I take it you prefer tenors.\\n\\n     She glances up at the mirror.  In it is the reflection of SENOR \\n     AUGUSTO DE L\\'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who\\'s \\n     changing a white dinner jacket that\\'s had wine split on it.  He \\n     breaks into a heavily accented version of \\'Now or Never\\', and \\n     disappears from the dressing room mirror.\\n\\n                                NYAH\\n                Would you mind if I\\'m on top?\\n\\n                                ETHAN\\n                Oh, either way works for me.\\n\\n     With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins \\n     working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque \\n     wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara \\n     brush.  She glances down and is rather disconcerted.  Continues \\n     working with the pick and wrench.\\n\\n                                ETHAN\\'S VOICE\\n                You\\'re never gonna find it there.\\n\\n                                NYAH\\n                        (she jumps, dropping the torque wrench)\\n                Damn it!

Not exactly in the mood \\n     to move:\\n\\n     She stiffens - he knows too damn much.\\n\\n                                NYAH\\n                - right..where is it?\\n\\n                                ETHAN\\n                Far right. \\n\\n     She immediately switches her efforts from top left to the\\n     bottom right compartment.

HILLS AROUND VINEYARD - SUNSET\\n\\nMaximus is racing over the countryside, galloping in a\\nfrenzy.

They\\nare nothing more than grotesquely twisted, charred shapes.\\n\\nMaximus instantly collapses to his knees -- he howls out\\nhis torment in a heartrending keen of despair as he coats\\nhis face in the ashes of his dead world. He sinks into\\nunconsciousness, praying for death.\\n\\nEXT.   VINEYARD - DAY\\n\\nAn unusual jingling sound is heard. Maximus appears to be\\ndead, his gaping wound beginning to fester.\\n\\nThe source of the jingling becomes clear when we see the\\nfeet of Bedouin brigands, with delicate anklets, shuffling\\naround him.

PROXIMO\\'S SCHOOL - DAY\\n\\nMaximus and Juba are crammed into a wagon with about ten\\nother slaves, including a very scared and reedy SCRIBE.\\nOther wagons are filled with exotic animals, including\\nseveral lions.\\n\\nThe wagons move through a crowded casbah and are taken\\nthrough an imposing set of gates to...\\n\\nEXT.   PROXIMO\\'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - DAY\\n\\nAn open compound in Proximo\\'s school.

Heavily armed guards supervise everything.\\n\\nBut Proximo\\'s slaves are having a bit of a problem with\\none of the new lions -- it growls and resists them.\\n\\nWithout the slightest hesitation, Proximo thunders to the\\nlion and grabs it by the mane -- manhandling it into a\\ncage.\\n\\n                                  PROXIMO\\n             COME ON, YOU FILTHY BEAST!\\n\\nHe kicks the lion in the rear as he shoves it into the\\ncage.\\n\\nProximo\\'s provincial school resembles nothing so much as a\\nseedy prison. The fading grandeur of the decaying\\nbattlements and the sweeping North African architecture\\nonly slightly mitigate the brutal feel of the place.\\n\\nAnd if Maximus had any doubts as to Proximo\\'s profession\\n-- all doubts are washed away when he sees the compound.\\n\\nTwenty GLADIATORS are working out in the compound --\\nhacking at practice dummies and sparring. The many\\nheavily armed guards oversee everything. The gladiators\\nstop working out as they see the new slaves enter. They\\neye their potential new opponents warily.\\n\\nOne huge, glowering gladiator -- VIBIUS -- watches with\\nparticular interest. His eye is quickly drawn to the most\\nobvious athlete: Juba.\\n\\nThe new slaves are herded to the middle of the compound\\nand house slaves immediately begin throwing buckets of\\nwater on them, cleaning them.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Proximo shrugs off his cloak.

Wow, that was very thoughtful of him.\\n\\n            I can\\'t believe he knew to ask Dad\\'s permission.\\n\\n            Yeah. [Chuckling]\\n\\n            I\\'m just here with Greg. He\\'s gonna take me out for lunch. He\\'s okay.\\n\\n            Okay, yeah, I know you gotta go. I love you.\\n\\n            Okay, talk to you soon. Bye.\\n\\n            So what\\'s going on? What? Debbie\\'s marrying that guy? Yeah, in two weeks.\\n\\n            Dr. Bob of Denver. Isn\\'t that great?\\n\\n            Yeah, yeah, that\\'s-- Didn\\'t they just meet like a few months ago?\\n\\n            Well, yeah, but, you know, he asked her, and she said yes.\\n\\n            He asked my dad. He said yes. Then he asked Debbie.\\n\\n            Huh? Yeah, I overheard that. So, what, like he had to ask his permission?\\n\\n            No, no, he didn\\'t have to.\\n\\n            Bob just understood that Dad appreciates that kind of thing.\\n\\n            Hmm? Mm-hmm. Anyway, Deb said Dad\\'s crazy about him.\\n\\n            Evidently, Bob bought him, like, the perfect gift that just won him over.\\n\\n            You know? Really? Huh? A gift?\\n\\n            Are you sure it\\'s okay to X-ray this?\\n\\n             Yeah, it\\'s not gonna mutate or anything.\\n\\n              - Uh, sir, that\\'s not gonna fit. - Wait. Hang on a second.\\n\\n              The bag\\'s too big, guy. You gotta check it.\\n\\n              [Beeping] Over here.\\n\\n              Raise your arms, sir. Look.\\n\\n              I\\'ve got an engagement ring for my girlfriend in the bag.\\n\\n              I can\\'t open it here. Don\\'t you think I can just carry it on?\\n\\n              Hey, pal, if it ain\\'t fittin\\' through the frame, you ain\\'t carryin\\' it on the plane.\\n\\n              -     -- New York La Guardia. Check it. - Wait, wait!\\n\\n              Excuse me! Don\\'t worry. It\\'ll be waitin\\' for you on the other side.\\n\\n              Baby, hurry Don\\'t make me worry\\n\\n              [Woman Over P.A.] Welcome to New York\\'s La Guardia Airport.\\n\\n              [Baby Crying]\\n\\n              Excuse me. Hi.\\n\\n              You lost my bag, and there\\'s a two-carat diamond ring inside it.\\n\\n              I didn\\'t lose your anything, sir.\\n\\n              But put your local address on this form, and we\\'ll ship it when it surfaces.\\n\\n              And what if it doesn\\'t? Am I supposed to spend the entire weekend...\\n\\n              with just the clothes on my back?\\n\\n              [Crying Continues]\\n\\n              It\\'s a great gift. I just thought you were gonna get them champagne.\\n\\n              Trust me. I think your dad is gonna be very psyched about this gift.\\n\\n              Well, don\\'t forget he\\'s retired, though.\\n\\n              The guy was in the rare-flower business for    years. I think he still maintains an interest.\\n\\n              You make it sound like they\\'re really hard to please. No, not at all!\\n\\n              He\\'s the sweetest man in the whole world. Just relax!\\n\\n              He\\'s gonna love you. I promise.\\n\\n              As much as he loves Dr. Bob?\\n\\n              Take it easy on the sarcasm. Humor is entirely wasted on my parents.\\n\\n              What, are they Amish? [Pam Giggling]\\n\\n              Okay, no jokes.\\n\\n              What are you doing? What?\\n\\n              I told you my dad sees smoking as a sign of weakness.\\n\\n              Okay, all right, I\\'ll leave \\'em in the car.\\n\\n              No, no, no, no, he\\'ll check there. Oh, gosh.\\n\\n              Yeah, the roof is probably a better idea.\\n\\n              Okay. And, oh, uh,\\n\\n              we\\'re not living together.\\n\\n              I thought you said you told him. Well--\\n\\n              Hi, Daddy! Hi! Sweet pea!\\n\\n              I missed you so much, Pamcake. I missed you too, Flapjack.\\n\\n              [Continue Kissing]\\n\\n              Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!\\n\\n              [Together] Short stack, short stack, coming up.\\n\\n              - Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba. - Where\\'s my \"wittle\" girl?\\n\\n              - Mommy! Mom! - You look so beautiful.\\n\\n              [Pam] So do you. Look at you.\\n\\n              Oh, I\\'m sorry. Mom, Dad, this is Greg.\\n\\n              Hi, Greg. I\\'m Pam\\'s father, Jack Byrnes. Great to finally meet you.\\n\\n              Good meeting you. And I\\'m Dina. Welcome to Oyster Bay.\\n\\n              Oh, thanks. Ah!\\n\\n              What are you driving there, a Ford?\\n\\n              Oh, yeah, it\\'s a Taurus.\\n\\n              We were gonna get a mid-size, but I figure, hey, we pull down decent bucks.\\n\\n              Might as well go all out, pop for the full-size.\\n\\n              Sure. Interesting color. You pick it? Oh.\\n\\n              Oh, no, the guy at the counter. Why?\\n\\n              Well, they say geniuses pick green.\\n\\n              - But you didn\\'t pick it. - Jack!\\n\\n              Oh, yucky. What smells of old sour milk?\\n\\n              Oh, poor Greg got spit up on by a baby. He didn\\'t.\\n\\n              Yeah, he did, Ma, at the lost luggage counter. The airline lost his bag.\\n\\n              They didn\\'t! Oh.\\n\\n              Yeah. Yeah, they did.\\n\\n              What about you, honey? Oh, no, no, no. I carried on.\\n\\n              That\\'s my girl.\\n\\n              It\\'ll turn up, I\\'m sure. And anyway, Greg, meanwhile, anything you need, just ask.\\n\\n              That\\'s right. Mi casa es su casa. Oh, thanks, Jack. You too.\\n\\n              Yeah. [Giggling]\\n\\n              [Chattering]\\n\\n              This is so nice. [Jack] We like it.\\n\\n              [Sighs] Beautiful.\\n\\n              Oh, now, Greg, you have a very unique last name.\\n\\n              Um, we were curious, how do you pronounce it?\\n\\n              Oh, just like it\\'s spelled. F-O-C-K-E-R.\\n\\n              Focker. Hmm, Focker. Hmm.\\n\\n              Mm-hmm.\\n\\n              - Oh, I\\'ll get it, honey. - Oh, thanks, Mom.\\n\\n              - Oh, there he is. There\\'s our little guy. -Jinxy, come here, boy.\\n\\n              Come here, baby. Come to Daddy, Jinxy. Come on. Come on, Jinxy.\\n\\n              Come here. Come to Daddy. Jinxy!\\n\\n              Come on. [Chuckles] Taught him that in one week.\\n\\n              This is Pam\\'s cat, Jinxy. Jinxy, say hello to Greg.\\n\\n              Hi, Jinx. Wave to Greg. Hello, Jinx.\\n\\n              Attaboy. That took me another week.\\n\\n              Oh, my gosh. Pam, I didn\\'t know you had a cat.\\n\\n              Yeah, I left him here when I moved to Chicago.\\n\\n              Your daddy\\'s found his new best friend.\\n\\n              You won\\'t believe it. He even taught him to use the potty.\\n\\n              You won\\'t believe it. He even taught him to use the potty.\\n\\n              - He did? Dad, that\\'s kinda weird, isn\\'t it? - What\\'s so weird about it?\\n\\n              Now we don\\'t have to smell kitty litter all the time. That\\'s right.\\n\\n              That\\'s incredible. How did you teach the cat to use the toilet?\\n\\n              Oh, that was easy, Greg. I just designed a litter box to put inside the toilet,\\n\\n              and then once he got used to it, I took it away.\\n\\n              Yeah, makes sense. But I don\\'t think he likes it.\\n\\n              I mean, every chance he gets, he tries to dig, squat and bury.\\n\\n              I had to move all my potted plants off the floor.\\n\\n              Plus, you got another guy around the house to leave the seat up.\\n\\n              He can\\'t lift the seat, Greg.\\n\\n              He lacks the strength and the opposable thumbs. Yeah.\\n\\n              Ah, right. Opposable-- I didn\\'t think about that.\\n\\n              Jinx is strictly a house cat. Can\\'t let him outside because he lacks outdoor survival skills.\\n\\n              Okay. One of those things, isn\\'t it, sweetheart?\\n\\n              I don\\'t think Greg will be playing with Jinxy too much. He hates cats.\\n\\n              [Chuckles Nervously] Pam, I don\\'t hate cats.\\n\\n              I don\\'t-- I don\\'t hate cats. I just happen to be more of a dog lover.\\n\\n              Yeah, yeah. [Mouthing] I am too.\\n\\n              Well, that\\'s okay if you hate cats, Greg. No!\\n\\n              I don\\'t. I don\\'t hate cats at all. [Jack] That\\'s okay.\\n\\n              Just be honest about it. There\\'s some things I hate.\\n\\n              I-- I\\'m being honest. Really? Like what?\\n\\n              Honey, why don\\'t we let the kids freshen up, huh?\\n\\n              Greg, you come with me. We\\'ll get you something to wear from Jack\\'s closet, okay?\\n\\n              Okay. Oh, honey, honey, honey, honey.\\n\\n              - Yeah? - I\\'m so happy you\\'re home, sweetheart.\\n\\n              Oh! Me too, Dad.\\n\\n              Hey, listen, be nice to this one, okay? I kinda like him.\\n\\n              Okay, I\\'ll try. Thank you.\\n\\n              Shirt fit okay, Greg? Oh, fantastic. Thanks, Jack.\\n\\n              Good. Tom Collins coming up.\\n\\n              - You know, I wish you hadn\\'t told your parents I hate cats. - But you do hate cats.\\n\\n              Yeah, but you didn\\'t have to tell them right when we met.\\n\\n              I know. I\\'m sorry. It just kinda slipped out.\\n\\n              Get your red-hot papooses. My goodness, what is that?\\n\\n              Oh, that\\'s just a little something from me. Go ahead. Open it up.\\n\\n              Oh. Look, honey, Greg brought us a present.\\n\\n              Oh, isn\\'t that nice?\\n\\n              Oh! Oh, look at this.\\n\\n              It\\'s a flower pot with the dirt in it.\\n\\n              - Hmm. - Actually, the real gift is what\\'s planted in the soil.\\n\\n              The bulb of a Jerusalem tulip.\\n\\n              Which I was told is one of the rarest and most beautiful flowers in existence.\\n\\n              Oh, right, right, the Jerusalem--\\n\\n              From the \"Jerusales tulipesias\" genus. Yes, yes.\\n\\n              Hmm. Anyway, yeah,\\n\\n              the guy said with regular watering, it should bloom in about six months, so--\\n\\n              Oh, we\\'ll look forward to that, Greg.\\n\\n              [Clearing Throat] So, uh, Greg, how\\'s your job?\\n\\n              Um, good, Pam. Thanks for asking.\\n\\n              I, uh, I recently got transferred to triage.\\n\\n              Oh, is that better than a nurse?\\n\\n              No, Mom, triage is a unit of the E.R.\\n\\n              It\\'s where all the top nurses work. Well--\\n\\n              No, they do. [Chuckling Nervously]\\n\\n              Not many men in your profession, though, are there, Greg?\\n\\n              No, Jack, not traditionally. Mm-hmm.\\n\\n              Oh, Pam, honey, did you know that your father started his own business?\\n\\n              Really? Dad, that\\'s great. Oh, wow!\\n\\n              Yes, I thought with my knowledge and experience,\\n\\n              why should I allow retirement to stop me?\\n\\n              I really admire that. Yeah.\\n\\n              So what is it? What\\'s the new venture?\\n\\n              Let me ask you a question, Greg.\\n\\n              Let\\'s just say you have kids...\\n\\n              and you wanna get out of the house, spend a night on the town.\\n\\n              So, you hire a baby-sitter, someone you think you can trust.\\n\\n              References, work experience-- it all checks out fine.\\n\\n              But then how do you really know for certain...\\n\\n              that your loved ones are safe with this stranger?\\n\\n              I mean, can you ever really trust another human being, Greg?\\n\\n              Sure, I think so.\\n\\n              No, the answer is you cannot.\\n\\n              Let me show you something.\\n\\n              Take a look at this, Greg.\\n\\n              What\\'s this look like to you? Um--\\n\\n              [Squeaks] This looks like a teddy bear.\\n\\n              Smile, you\\'re on \"Nanny Camera.\" Ah!\\n\\n              Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah! I\\'ve seen these things advertised on TV.\\n\\n              Oh, no, not like this, you haven\\'t. Take a look.\\n\\n              Oh, my gosh. Hi! Oh!\\n\\n              Where\\'s the other camera? Right here in this decorative artifact.\\n\\n              Wow, that\\'s great. Our cameras are motion-activated,\\n\\n              so they begin taping as soon as they sense any movement.\\n\\n              We can hide \\'em in anything. We hide \\'em in mirrors, lamps, televisions, you name it.\\n\\n              So no matter where you go,\\n\\n              we\\'ll be watching you. [Pam Chuckling]\\n\\n              So, Jack, couldn\\'t this maybe be construed as illegal? You know, invasion of privacy?\\n\\n              Trust me, Greg, when you start having little Fockers running around,\\n\\n              you\\'ll understand the need for this level of protection.\\n\\n              Mm.\\n\\n              Impressive, isn\\'t it?\\n\\n              Quite. Mm. [Phone Ringing]\\n\\n              Quite. Mm. [Phone Ringing]\\n\\n              Oh, I\\'ll get that. I\\'ll get it. I\\'ll get it.\\n\\n              Honey, I\\'ll get it.\\n\\n              [Chuckling] Okay.\\n\\n              Any problem with the documents?\\n\\n              Okay. I\\'ll meet you at the Oyster Bay Drugstore in about    minutes.\\n\\n              Now you gotta be more careful when you call here.\\n\\n              If anybody else answers, just use a Southern accent...\\n\\n              and ask for the vegetarian special, okay?\\n\\n              [Chattering]\\n\\n              Oh, that wasn\\'t the airline, was it?\\n\\n              Nope, wrong number.\\n\\n              We\\'re all out of Collins mix, so I\\'m gonna make a run for the store.\\n\\n              That\\'s funny. I thought I just bought some.\\n\\n              You know how that stuff-- it just goes, so I\\'ll be back in a jiff.\\n\\n              Well, why doesn\\'t Greg go with you?\\n\\n              Sweetie, you\\'ll need something in case your suitcase doesn\\'t show up.\\n\\n              - Oh, I\\'m sure it\\'ll show up. - Yeah.\\n\\n              You don\\'t wanna take a chance. You don\\'t have a toothbrush. Go on, sweetie.\\n\\n              Yeah. Okay, unless you want some privacy.\\n\\n              Why would I need privacy?\\n\\n              No, I didn\\'t think you would.\\n\\n              Okay, let\\'s head out. [Dina] Oh, good.\\n\\n              Bye.\\n\\n              Have fun, you guys. Pam, he seems wonderful.\\n\\n              He is. We have the best time together. Good.\\n\\n              Now, have you two been mm, mm, mm?\\n\\n              Mother! Oh, thinking about anything permanent.\\n\\n              Oh, I don\\'t know. I mean, we haven\\'t really discussed it,\\n\\n              but I definitely have a feeling this is it.\\n\\n              [Sighs] Dad seems to like him. Don\\'t you think?\\n\\n              Absolutely.\\n\\n              Big day, Saturday. Nice car.\\n\\n              Yes. This car is--\\n\\n              You got-- What do you use? Unleaded? Regular unleaded?\\n\\n              Premium. Uh-huh.\\n\\n              Hey, you know, Jack, now that we have a second to talk,\\n\\n              I just want you to know how much Pam means to me.\\n\\n              I know-- I know that we haven\\'t been together that long,\\n\\n              but the time that we have spent together has been really incredible.\\n\\n              Greg, how come you don\\'t like cats?\\n\\n              I don\\'t not like cats.\\n\\n              I-l just-- I just prefer dogs.\\n\\n              I mean, I\\'m just more of a dog kind of, you know--\\n\\n              Come home, wagging their little tails, happy to see you kind of--\\n\\n              You need that assurance? You prefer an emotionally shallow animal?\\n\\n              I--\\n\\n              You see, Greg, when you yell at a dog,\\n\\n              his tail will go between his legs and cover his genitals, his ears will go down.\\n\\n              A dog is very easy to break, but cats make you work for their affection.\\n\\n              - They don\\'t sell out the way dogs do. - Huh.\\n\\n              You like Peter, Paul and Mary?

Wow.\\n\\n              I\\'m gonna take it over to the Byrneses\\',\\n\\n              and tomorrow Robert and Debra will meet beneath it to become man and wife.\\n\\n              And later, when they purchase a home,\\n\\n              maybe it will grace their garden.\\n\\n              Well, that\\'s my sappy, romantic idea.

If Florence Nightingale over here would play defense.\\n\\n              - Larry, I missed one shot. - It was a big shot.\\n\\n              Larry, keep floatin\\' where you are. You\\'re doin\\' great.\\n\\n              Denny, take the deep shots. Greg, nobody\\'s expecting much out of you.\\n\\n              - If I set you up with the ball, can you jump up and spike it? - [Denny] No.\\n\\n              Yeah.

It\\'s okay.\\n\\n              I don\\'t know what got into me, Iceman.\\n\\n              \"Iceman\"? I\\'m sorry. Is that a special thing\\n\\n              Stop it. Stop what, Iceman?\\n\\n              Top Gun was a very popular movie when Kevin and I dated.\\n\\n              All right? That\\'s it. Hey, Iceman.\\n\\n              Do you want to be Maverick? Is that what this is all about?\\n\\n              I can\\'t be Maverick. Kevin\\'s Maverick. He used to be,\\n\\n              but we can change that.\\n\\n              Um, can he be Goose?

We\\'re gonna use it for storage.\\n\\n              Greg will stay in Debbie\\'s room, and she\\'ll bunk up with you tonight.\\n\\n              Fine. Come on, Greg.\\n\\n              - Okay. I\\'ll be right up. - I\\'ll meet you upstairs.\\n\\n              - Okay. I\\'ll be right up. - I\\'ll meet you upstairs.\\n\\n              Oh, good. They found your suitcase. Yeah.\\n\\n              Hey, Jack, I don\\'t quite know what happened back at the tux shop,\\n\\n              but if I\\'ve given you the wrong impression regarding Pam in any way, I\\'m sorry.\\n\\n              Okay?

[Toilet Tank Lid Clattering]\\n\\n              And I wouldn\\'t feel right asking her to wear it...\\n\\n              without her father\\'s permission.\\n\\n              Jack?\\n\\n              Did you flush this toilet?\\n\\n              Maybe. You know what? Maybe Jinx flushed it.\\n\\n              I saw little Jinxy come in last night,\\n\\n              and he took a little squat and relieved himself.\\n\\n              Jinx knows not to use that toilet, and even if he did, he\\'d never flush it.\\n\\n              - What does it matter? - The matter, Greg, R.N.,\\n\\n              is that when this toilet is flushed, it runs,\\n\\n              and when you have a septic tank that\\'s nearly full and a toilet that\\'s been running all night,\\n\\n              then you could have a hell of a problem.\\n\\n              Mr. Byrnes?\\n\\n              [Man] This is not part of my job description.\\n\\n              Nice stench.

Now! - Dad, what\\'s going on?\\n\\n              Oh, my God! What\\'s that smell?\\n\\n              That smell, Bob, is our shit.\\n\\n              Focker flushed the toilet in the den, so the septic tank is overflowing.\\n\\n              Jack, I told you. It wasn\\'t me. It was Jinx.\\n\\n              Focker, I\\'m not gonna tell you again!\\n\\n              Jinx cannot flush the toilet. He\\'s a cat, for chris sakes!\\n\\n              The animal doesn\\'t even have thumbs, Focker.\\n\\n              - Hey, look at this! - Kevo!\\n\\n              Over by the tree, right?\\n\\n              No. No, no, no. Not on the lawn!\\n\\n              Stay where you are. Not on the lawn!\\n\\n              - [Pam] Kevin, no! - No, no, no, no!\\n\\n              - [Screaming] - Oh!\\n\\n              - No, no, no! - Ahh!\\n\\n              What the heck?\\n\\n              I got my mojo workin\\'\\n\\n              Just won\\'t work on you\\n\\n              I got my mojo workin\\'\\n\\n              Just won\\'t work on you\\n\\n              Oh--\\n\\n              I know that\\'s what I said I wanted, \\'cause that\\'s what I wanted.\\n\\n              It is a black Samsonite suitcase.\\n\\n              What I\\'m saying is, do you think it\\'s possible that the Samsonite people,\\n\\n              in some crazy little scheme to actually turn a profit, made more than one?\\n\\n              [Woman On Phone] I don\\'t think so. You don\\'t?\\n\\n              I am going to need your baggage claim number again. Jinx, stop.\\n\\n              - I know I signed for it. - I\\'m looking at your signature right here, Mr. Focker.\\n\\n              - Do me a favor.

[Man] Yeah.\\n\\n              Please, I\\'m in a time situation here, so just do it. I\\'ll hold on.\\n\\n              So the name\\'s \"Greg Focker\"? I don\\'t know. Greg or Gregory.

He lied to you when I thought you should know the truth.\\n\\n              I love you too much to see you get hurt.\\n\\n              I don\\'t care what your information says, Dad.

ROOM - DAY\\n\\n\\n               Claire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a \\n               window, then pulls the curtains to reveal:\\n\\n\\n               A LOVELY, WOODED LAKE. It couldn\\'t be more picturesque. A \\n               24\\' SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONE LIGHTHOUSE \\n               sits on a point across the lake.\\n\\n\\n               The sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGURE \\n               still shrouded by covers.\\n\\n\\n               Claire sits beside the sleeping form. She scans the room \\n               briefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a \\n               tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp.\\n\\n\\n               She gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same \\n               face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped \\n               hair and tiny nose ring. Claire leans over and inhales the \\n               sleeping scent of her only daughter, CAITLIN. She places her \\n               hand on a cheek. The girl\\'s eyelids flutter softly.\\n\\n\\n                                     CLAIRE\\n                         Morning, beauty.\\n\\n\\n               Caitlin lets out a grunt and rolls over onto her belly.\\n\\n\\n                                     CLAIRE\\n                         Let\\'s go.

HALLWAY - DAY\\n\\n\\n               Claire bends down to pick up one of Caitlin\\'s socks. When \\n               she stands, something catches her eye out a window.

Claire \\n               watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with an unruly \\n               shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood of \\n               their huge old Buick. She tries to get a glimpse of the woman, \\n               but all that\\'s visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD.\\n\\n\\n               A TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire\\'s waist. She lets out a \\n               small gasp as a hand closes on her breast. It\\'s Claire\\'s \\n               husband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck.\\n\\n\\n               He\\'s older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks \\n               beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him \\n               look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the \\n               prominent academic that he is. Claire, however, can\\'t take \\n               her eyes off the scene below.\\n\\n\\n                                     NORMAN\\n                         They at it again?\\n\\n\\n               Claire nods.\\n\\n\\n                                     NORMAN\\n                         Christ, that\\'s twice in...

The man leans over the hood, \\n               murmuring darkly at his wife, though for Claire and Norman \\n               the scene is entirely silent.\\n\\n\\n                                     CLAIRE\\n                         What\\'s their name?\\n\\n\\n                                     NORMAN\\n                         Feur, I think. Psych department. \\n                         Figures. They\\'re all psychotic.\\n\\n\\n               Outside, Mr. Feur turns and walks toward his house. Norman \\n               begins, once again, to nuzzle Claire. Her eyes close, but \\n               then she gently demurs.\\n\\n\\n                                     CLAIRE\\n                         She\\'s awake.\\n\\n\\n                                     NORMAN\\n                         We\\'ll be quiet.

BACKYARD - MORNING\\n\\n\\n               Claire sets up a camera and tripod. She steps back and aims \\n               her camera. She glances up at a large upstairs window at the \\n               FEUR\\'S HOUSE. One side of the curtain seems to be pulled \\n               open, but no one\\'s there.\\n\\n\\n               Feeling self-conscious, she turns back to the camera. The \\n               morning sun hits the flowers just right and she SNAPS SEVERAL \\n               PICTURES OF THEM against her lovely house.\\n\\n\\n               She glances back at the Feur\\'s window. The CURTAIN IS NOW \\n               CLOSED.\\n\\n\\n               She walks over to the fence and tries to peek through it.\\n\\n\\n               When this doesn\\'t work, she drags a lawn chair over and peers \\n               across the fence. She can barely see over, but glimpses:\\n\\n\\n               A DEEP FURROW in the mud of the driveway. Just then, a car \\n               pulls into the driveway, Claire scrambles down from her perch.\\n\\n\\n               EXT.

Claire tosses a long stick for Cooper, who \\n               bolts out onto the LONG WOODEN DOCK. Claire gazes at the \\n               LIGHTHOUSE across the lake and a long BRIDGE in the distance.\\n\\n\\n               Cooper starts BARKING and looking down into the water.\\n\\n\\n               Claire arrives at Cooper\\'s side and stares down into the \\n               dark water.\\n\\n\\n                                     CLAIRE\\n                         Cooper... what do you see?\\n\\n\\n               She looks down and sees nothing but her own reflection.

LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON\\n\\n\\n               Claire sits frozen, cello between her legs, bow hovering in \\n               position. After an uncomfortable long pause, she touches bow \\n               to string, drawing in a breath at the power of the sound.\\n\\n\\n               Claire takes another deep breath, then launches into a \\n               beautiful and melancholy piece of music. She\\'s very, very \\n               good. Eyes closed. Her body begins to sway slightly as her \\n               left hand vibratos like butterfly wings on the neck.\\n\\n\\n               She reaches a difficult transition and falters. She seems \\n               almost surprised. She attacks the transition again, and again \\n               falters. Claire bites her lower lip and tries yet again, \\n               this time failing completely.\\n\\n\\n               She sits back in the chair, despondent. Almost as an \\n               afterthought, she sadly drags the bow across strings. At the \\n               end of the tone, something catches her ear. She can just \\n               make out the HINT OF A FAINT FEMININE VOICE echoing the tone.\\n\\n\\n               She sits up and plays a different note, then another. Each \\n               time the soft mournful voice becomes more distinct. Finally \\n               she plays a sharp, higher pitched note. The voice echoes \\n               with a distinct, unsettling shriek.\\n\\n\\n               CRASH!\\n\\n\\n               INT.

At least security can \\nget you backstage. \\nCINDY: \\nI think Buffy is sweet. \\nBRANDY: \\nShe\\'s as fake as press on nails. \\nThey greet Buffy. \\nBRANDY (CONT\\'D) \\nHey girl, what\\'s up? \\nBrandy and Buffy kiss as though they were best friends. BRANDY (CONT\\'D) \\nHey, lookin\\' good, love your hair! \\nBUFFY: \\nThanks, just got it done. \\nCindy waves goodbye to Buffy\\'s dad as he drives off. \\nCINDY: \\nBye Mr. Gilmore! \\nBUFFY: \\n(not looking back) \\nIs he gone? \\nCINDY: \\nYes. \\nBuffy rips off her clothes, revealing a sexy outfit underneath. She lets her hair down and with a shake of her head, a new do, worthy of a sex kitten. \\nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL \\' FRONT WALKWAY \\' DAY \\nThe girls walk together towards campus. \\nBrandy passes her a makeup pack. Buffy applies her makeup.  Cindy passes her the \\nlipstick. Two strokes and the transformation from Daddy\\'s baby to every high school \\nguy\\'s wet dream is complete. \\nBUFFY: \\nI love this color! \\nCINDY: \\nLet me see that. \\nPage 13/94\\nCindy checks the label. \\nCINDY (CONT\\'D) \\nYou guys shouldn\\'t use this brand. \\nBRANDY: \\nWhy not? \\nCINDY: \\nBecause they test their make-up on \\nanimals. \\nBRANDY: \\nSo? \\nCINDY: \\nHave you seen what they do to those \\npoor animals? \\nCindy shows them a flyer that reads \"Stop Animal Testing\".  A picture of a monkey in full make-up. \\nBUFFY: \\n(taking back the lipstick) \\nWell, I\\'m more of a people person. \\nBUFFY (CONT\\'D) \\nI\\'d rather help my fellow man than some \\nanimal. \\nA homeless man approaches. \\nHOMELESS MAN: \\nSpare a dollar? \\nBUFFY: \\nGet away from me you bum! \\nCINDY: \\nBuffy!? Can\\'t you see that he\\'s just hungry? Cindy gives the man a sandwich from her lunch bag. \\nCINDY: \\nHere you go. A nice sandwich. \\nThe girls walk away. Suddenly, Cindy is hit in the back of the head by the sandwich. \\nHOMELESS MAN: \\nPage 14/94\\n(V.O.) \\nI said a dollar bitch! \\nThe girls attention is distracted by a commotion on campus. \\nBUFFY: \\nGod, look at this place, it\\'s a circus! \\nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL \\' FRONT \\' DAY \\nNEW ANGLE \\' HOARDS OF MEDIA \\nIn the midst of the chaos, we pan around to see various reporters attempting to report the \\nstory. Close on young attractive overly ambitious woman, GAIL HAILSTORM, \\nsyndicated talk show host and author. \\nGail is giving an update on camera. Behind her an obnoxious KID is mugging for the \\ncamera. \\nGAIL: \\nHello, I\\'m Gail Hailstorm, author of \\nthe book \"You\\'re Dead, I\\'m Rich\".

Do you think the \\npress is going to interview us? \\nBRANDY: \\nNo way. The press only want to interview \\nthe most ignorant person they can find. \\nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL \\' DAY \\nThe media is surrounding a young black teen sporting a short black afro with a pick \\nPage 16/94\\nsticking out, a hemp emblemed t-shirt and a roach clip on a chain around his neck. He \\nsmiles, revealing a gold cap on a rotting tooth. His name is SHORTY. \\nREPORTER: \\nCan we have a word with you? \\nSHORTY: \\nOh shit, I\\'m on TV. I wanna give a \\nshout out to Shane and dem! Peace to my \\npeeps, much love to the east and west, \\nTasha, wake up, the baby\\'s daddy is a \\nstaraah!! \\nREPORTER: \\nWhat can you tell us about Drew Decker? \\nSHORTY: \\nShe got a fat ass, kid! Ya know what I \\nmean? \\nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL \\' DAY \\nShorty stands smoking a fat joint, looking up at two billboard ads. One reads, \"Just Say \\nNo.\" The other, a Nike ad that reads, \"Just Do It.\" He looks back and forth between the \\ntwo. Heavily contemplating both messages. Finally, he looks down at his own tennis \\nshoes. Then back up to the Nike ad. \\nSHORTY: \\nYo, son, I\\'m with you. Just do that \\nshit. \\nHe takes a long drag off his joint and exits. EXT. HIGH SCHOOL \\' DAY \\nShorty and his HOMIES kick it up on the school lawn.  Getting high and tripping off \\nDrew\\'s death. \\nSHORTY: \\nYo, son, that\\'s fucked up that Drew \\ngot killed. \\nHOMIE #1 \\nWord. \\nPage 17/94\\nSHORTY: \\nI didn\\'t even get to fuck her. HOMIE #2 \\nTrue dat. True dat. \\nSHORTY: \\nI\\'m just glad that it wasn\\'t one of us. HOMIE #1 \\nWord? \\nSHORTY: \\nYo, son, don\\'t you know?

If you stop to get a forty, you could miss the whole thing. \\nHOMIE #2 \\nTrue dat. True dat. \\nSHORTY: \\n\\'Cause you know they ain\\'t gone never let us play the homeopathic killer. \\nHOMIE #1 \\nWord. \\nSHORTY: \\nOh, sure there\\'s that one cat, Page 18/94\\nCandyman, but they don\\'t even let that brotha wear a mask. Why not?  Jason, Michael Myers, even the Phantom of the Grand Ole Opry covers half his face. \\nHOMIE #2 \\nTrue dat. True dat. \\nSHORTY: \\nBut see, the thing is, they don\\'t fit a description. On the other hand, without a mask, they could easily stick my man Candy in a \\nline up and frame him for some trumped up bullshit. You see what I\\'m saying? HOMIE #1 \\nUh, word? \\nSHORTY: \\nAnd tell me this, why he always got to be on C.P. time? \\nSHORTY: \\nYou\\'ve got to call the brotha\\' \\nrepetitiously before he even shows up.  Candyman! Candyman! Candyman!  Nigga\\' you hear me callin you.  Bring your pimp lookin ass on.  Off chasing white girls. That\\'s what got your hands cut off in the first place. Which brings me to my point, son. \\nThe two stare at him in confused silence. SHORTY (CONT\\'D) \\n(as if it were obvious) \\nYo, it all started with a white girl.  So you know what that means. \\nContinued silence. \\nSHORTY (CONT\\'D) \\nDrew\\'s dead. We black. Candy.  Man.

HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY \\' DAY \\nThe girls enter. \\nV.O. \\nHey ladies! \\nThe girls turn to see SHORTY, young African American, cute, in an awkward kind of \\nway. \\nCINDY: \\nHi Shorty. \\nBRANDY: \\nTalk to the hand. \\nShe puts her hand in his face. \\nSHORTY: \\nCindy? \\nCINDY: \\nCan\\'t Shorty. \\nSHORTY: \\nOh well, you force me to open it up \\nto hundreds of other girls who would \\ndie for the opportunity, but just \\nbecause I like you guys, I\\'m gonna \\nwait till lunch before I go public.  \\nSee ya at the fountain. \\nShorty heads to class. \\nBUFFY: \\nWhatever! What a geek! \\nCINDY: \\nI think Shorty is cute. If I wasn\\'t \\ndating Bobby, I would go out with him. \\nBRANDY: \\nPage 20/94\\nShit girl, Bobby lives in a trailer.  \\nDating Shorty would be a step up. \\nCINDY: \\nIf how much money a guy has is so \\nimportant, why are you dating Ray? \\nBRANDY: \\nFirst of all, look at him. He\\'s \\n100% man. \\nP.O.V. GIRLS \\nRay and Greg standing at lockers. \\nRay takes off his shirt, exposing his muscular upper body.  He slips on a ty-dyed tank top. \\nRAY: \\nYo, man, this shirt make me look gay. \\nGREG: \\nNah. \\nRay ties the lower part of the tank top in a knot and rolls it above his navel. \\nRAY: \\nHow about now? \\nBack to girls. \\nBRANDY: \\nBesides, the boys got potential, \\ngirl. Ray runs a 4.4 40, has a \\n3.5 GPA and he\\'s being scouted by \\nevery major college in the country.  \\nIf he stays healthy, we\\'re talking \\nmulti million dollar contract and \\nthat\\'s not including endorsements.  \\nNow Greg on the other hand, that\\'s \\nsomebody else\\'s mess. \\nBUFFY: \\nI\\'ll admit, the pro\\'s is a long shot \\nfor Greg. He\\'s been injured twice \\nand he\\'s not that bright. \\nP.O.V. BUFFY \\nGreg slamming his head into the lockers, obviously upset Page 21/94\\nabout something. \\nBUFFY (CONT\\'D) \\nAnd the only way we\\'ll see him in prime \\ntime in on \"Cops\". But for now, he\\'s the \\nhottest guy in the school and even if \\nI don\\'t want him, I\\'m not going to let \\nanyone else have him. \\nThe girls meet up with Greg and Ray at the lockers. \\nBRANDY: \\nHey baby. \\nBrandy kisses Ray. \\nBUFFY: \\nWhat\\'s the matter, honey? \\nGREG: \\nI got my report card. \\nHe hands it to Buffy. \\nREPORT CARD READS: D.U.M.B.A.S.S. \\nBUFFY: \\nAt least you got one \"A\". \\nGREG: \\nYeah, I did huh? \\nCINDY: \\nAnybody seen Bobby? \\nRAY: \\nNah. That kid is late every day.  \\nI don\\'t get it. He lives so close. \\nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT \\' BOBBY\\'S TRAILER \\' DAY Bobby exits, books in hand. Pull back to reveal the trailer is parked in the school parking \\nlot. \\nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOUNTAIN \\' DAY \\nBobby joins the gang sitting at the fountain. \\nBOBBY: \\nHey guys.

They say that girl Drew \\nDecker got killed last night. \\nRAY: \\nI think I knew her. She had a brother \\nnamed Steve, pretty eyes, long hair, \\nperfect ass. \\nBOBBY: \\nYeah, that was her. \\nRAY: \\nNo, I was talking about Steve.  \\nWhatever happened to him? \\nBOBBY: \\nI don\\'t know. \\nCINDY: \\nHey, do you guys think it\\'s strange \\nthat she got killed exactly one year \\nafter we, you know, killed that guy? \\nGREG: \\nHey, it was an accident. \\nCINDY: \\nWas it? \\nEXT. PARKING LOT \\' NIGHT - (FLASHBACK \\' ONE YEAR AGO) \\nGREG: \\nHey dude. Nobody drives my car but \\nme! Well, except for that big black \\nguy that car jacked me last month, he \\ndrove it, but other than that, nobody \\ndrives my car but me. Okay, there \\nwas that one time the dope man had \\nit for a week because I owed him \\nfor a bag of weed, but other than \\nthat\\' \\nCINDY: \\nYou know cars are only to make guys \\nPage 23/94\\nfeel more secure about the size \\nof their penises. \\nGREG: \\nWhat\\'s that supposed to mean? \\nBobby takes the keys from Greg. \\nBOBBY: \\nShe\\'s kidding, come on. \\nGreg approaches Buffy. \\nGREG: \\nWhy did you tell Cindy about it? \\nBUFFY: \\nI didn\\'t say anything. \\nGREG: \\nThen why did she make that comment? \\nBUFFY: \\nGreg, you know I would never tell \\nanyone our little secret. \\nShe kisses him. Cindy walks by. She holds up her pinky.  Buffy giggles. \\nThey get in the car and drive off. \\nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD \\' NIGHT (GREG\\'S CAR) \\nBobby and Cindy in the front, the other two couples in the back. \\nThe two couples are making out. \\nGreg opens a bottle of liquor. \\nGreg takes a sip, then another. Slowly, he starts to feel good. \\nGREG: \\nHey, let\\'s put on some music. \\nRay pulls a tape out of his pocket. \\nRAY: \\nHere, put this on. \\nBobby puts in the tape. \\nThe song \"It\\'s Raining Men\" blares out speakers. Everyone looks at Ray. \\nRAY (CONT\\'D) \\nPage 24/94\\nHey, it\\'s a classic. \\nGREG: \\nLet\\'s put on the radio. \\nGreg ejects the tape and finds a station. Loud rock music fills the car. \\nGREG: \\nNow that\\'s more like it. Yeah. \\nGreg nods to the music. \\nGREG (CONT\\'D) \\n(yelling) \\nAYOO!!! \\nGreg stands up, pokes his head through the sunroof, takes another swig of liquor and \\nyells as he enjoys the wind against his face. \\nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD \\' NIGHT (GREG\\'S CAR) \\nRay and Brandy in the back are really going at it hot and heavy. \\nBOBBY: \\n(adjusting the rear view mirror) \\nLook at what they\\'re doing. \\nCINDY: \\nBobby, keep your eyes on the road. \\nBOBBY: \\nWhen are we gonna do stuff like that? \\nCINDY: \\nOne day. \\nBobby unzips his pants. \\nCINDY: \\nWhat are you doing? \\nBOBBY: \\nI just want you to touch it. \\nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD \\' NIGHT \\' (GREG\\'S SUNROOF) \\nGreg yelling. This time in tears as he realizes he is about to be hit by a low hanging \\nbranch. \\nThud. His head goes reeling. \\nPage 25/94\\nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD \\' NIGHT \\' (GREG\\'S CAR) \\nCindy gingerly touching Bobby\\'s crotch. He closes his eyes momentarily. \\nBOBBY: \\nOh yeah. \\nSuddenly, Greg\\'s liquor bottle comes falling through the sunroof, crashing against \\nCindy\\'s head, sending her face down into Bobby\\'s lap. BOBBY (CONT\\'D) \\n(shocked) \\nOh yeah! That\\'s what I\\'m talking about. \\nBobby lays his seat back. \\nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD \\' NIGHT \\' (GREG\\'S SUNROOF) \\nGreg\\'s head, passing through the tree branches, emerges with a bee hive wrapped around \\nhis face. He desperately tries to remove it. \\nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD \\' NIGHT \\' (GREG\\'S CAR) \\nIt looks like a wild orgy. \\nBobby steering with his bare feet. \\nCindy trying to raise her head but is being stepped on by Greg. \\nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD \\' NIGHT \\' (GREG\\'S SUNROOF) \\nGreg finally removes the hive. He sees something in the road. \\nGREG: \\nLook out! \\nEXT. WINDING ROAD \\' NIGHT \\' (GREG\\'S CAR) \\nBobby hears Greg\\'s scream. He too sees something. Bobby swerves to avoid it. \\nBOBBY: \\nOh my God! \\nThe car goes spinning out of control before it finally comes to a stop. \\nBOBBY (CONT\\'D) \\nWhat was that? \\nCINDY: \\nI think we hit something. \\nEXT. WINDING ROAD \\' NIGHT \\nEveryone gets out of the car. \\nBuffy finds a boot. \\nPage 26/94\\nBUFFY: \\nOh my God! We hit a boot! \\nThey see a man lying unconscious in the road. \\nCINDY: \\nAhh! It\\'s a body! \\nRAY: \\nIs he alive? \\nBOBBY: \\nI don\\'t know. \\nBUFFY: \\nLet me check\\' \\nBuffy kneels next to the body. \\nBUFFY (CONT\\'D) \\nHey mister, you want a blow job? \\nNo answer. \\nBUFFY (CONT\\'D) \\nHe\\'s dead. What are we gonna do? \\nShe quickly backs up and joins the rest of the group. The man slowly starts to gain consciousness. The kids don\\'t see him, caught up in their own drama. \\nCINDY: \\nWe have to call the police. \\nRAY: \\nNo way, I ain\\'t going to jail. \\nCINDY: \\nWe have to. \\nGREG: \\nDo you know what happens to a young boy \\nin prison? All those sex starved \\nconvicts just waiting for a fresh \\npiece of meat. \\nRAY: \\nYou\\'re right. Maybe we should call \\nthe police. \\nPage 27/94\\nBehind them we see the man sit up. He calls out to them. \\nMAN: \\nThat\\'s not necessary. I\\'m fine. \\nThey can\\'t hear him. They\\'re too busy yelling at each other. \\nBOBBY: \\nThink about it, Ray. If you do that \\nyou ruin the rest of this movie. This \\nis your chance to crossover, Ray. \\nRAY: \\nWhite girls?! \\nBobby nods yes. \\nRAY (CONT\\'D) \\nWhat do we do first? \\nBOBBY: \\nWe\\'ll hide the body. \\nCINDY: \\nI won\\'t have anything to do with this. \\nIn the background, the man is now standing, brushes himself off and calls out to the group again. \\nMAN: \\nI guess I\\'ll be going now. \\nAgain he\\'s ignored. He shrugs his shoulders and starts to walk away. \\nBUFFY: \\nWhat about the alcohol? \\nGREG: \\nWe\\'ll get rid of it. \\nGreg tosses the bottle over his shoulder. It crashes the man on the head, knocking him out. He flops back on to the road, just as the group turns to look at him. GREG (CONT\\'D) \\nNow let\\'s get him in the trunk. Move the car closer. As the three of them talk among themselves, one of them gets in the car and backs it up. The Man sits up \\nagain, shaking his head clear. \\nPage 28/94\\nHe gets up just as the car backs up into him. Knocked unconscious again, he falls flat on the road. Just then, the kids turn around. \\nBOBBY: \\nWe\\'ll throw him in the ocean. \\nThey throw him in the trunk and look at each other as they talk. \\nBOBBY (CONT\\'D) \\nWe\\'ll go down to Steveson and dump him in \\nthere. The sharks will take care of \\nthe evidence. \\nThe Man wakes up again in the trunk, but the kids aren\\'t looking at him. \\nNot looking at him, Brandy slams the trunk lid down on the Man\\'s head. \\nGreg tries slamming it down again and again. \\nEXT. PIER \\' NIGHT \\nThey get him out of the trunk and carry him over to the edge of the road, which is \\noverlooking the ocean. \\nCINDY: \\nWait. Shouldn\\'t we check his wallet? \\nBUFFY: \\nFor what? \\nBRANDY: \\nShit, he might have some money. We \\nalready committed murder. Might as \\nwell rob his ass. \\nBOBBY: \\nGood idea. I\\'ll take credit cards. \\nBRANDY: \\nI want the jewelry. \\nRAY: \\nI\\'ll take his underwear. \\nThey finish stripping the man then toss his naked body over the side. \\nPage 29/94\\nGREG: \\nWe must never mention this again. \\nCINDY: \\nMention what? \\nGREG: \\nThe guy we just killed. \\nCINDY: \\nWell, you just mentioned it. \\nGREG: \\nStarting now. \\nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOUNTAIN \\' DAY (PRESENT) \\nBOBBY: \\nThat\\'s all behind us now, Cindy, we \\nhave to move on. \\nGREG: \\nYeah, it\\'s just a coincidence. \\nBUFFY: \\nGreg\\'s right, Cindy. I mean what do \\nyou think we\\'re in, a horror movie? \\nCindy relaxes and smiles. \\nCINDY: \\nYeah, if it were, they\\'d probably cast \\nsome ding-bat like Jennifer Love \"Huge-Tits\" \\nto play me. \\nThey share a laugh as the bell rings and everyone heads to class. \\nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL \\' CURBSIDE \\' DAY \\nSkate boarders cruise by, followed by guy with no legs on a skate board. \\nCindy walks toward building, she passes Gail\\'s news van. Kenny sees Cindy.

He scrambles \\nfor it, then resumes his composure. \\nDOOFY: \\n(embarrassed) \\nYou shouldn\\'t be here. \\nGAIL: \\nI know. I should be on my knees \\ncovering the next presidential \\nelection. But who knew? \\nShe tickles Doofy. He farts. \\nDOOFY: \\nPage 31/94\\nExcuse me. \\nGAIL: \\nYou look awfully young to be a \\npolice officer. \\nDOOFY: \\nI\\'m twenty-five and a half years \\nold. That\\'s this many. \\nHe spreads his fingers on his hands twice. Then once on one hand and gives her a bent \\nthumbs up. \\nGAIL: \\nYou know, I prove to be most popular \\nwith males eleven to twenty-four. And \\nmost prison lesbians. Of course, you \\ndon\\'t look a day over twelve. Except \\nfor that big head and glazed over look \\nin your eyes. Ooh, look a little drool. \\nDOOFY: \\nYeah, sometimes I forget to swallow. \\nGAIL: \\nDon\\'t worry, I never do. \\nShe tickles him again and he farts again. \\nGAIL (CONT\\'D) \\nRemind me not to do that again. \\nSuddenly they are interrupted by an announcement.

Now \\nhere is where I fall and break my leg, \\nleaving me helpless. \\nShe sighs, like she\\'s indulging him. She trips and twists her leg grotesquely. We hear a \\nloud snap. \\nBUFFY (CONT\\'D) \\nThere ya go, mister scary killer. I\\'m \\npanicking now. God, somebody please \\nhelp me! \\nKiller gets down and viciously attacks.

Ray presses his ear against the hole. A penis pokes through tickling his ear. Ray \\nchuckles and presses his head closer. \\nThis time the penis thrusts through his ear. \\nRay grabs his ear in pain. Goo flows out of his mouth. He falls to the floor. \\nINT.
