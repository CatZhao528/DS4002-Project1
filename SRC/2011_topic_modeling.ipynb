As\\n      the others watch, Harry reaches out and -- gently as he\\n      can -- pulls the dagger from Dobby’s chest, then shrugs\\n      off his jacket and enwraps the elf’s body. Slowly, his\\n      shoulders begin to shake. Only Luna dares to step\\n      forward.

As Snape enters,\\n       the room goes slowly silent.\\n\\n                               SNAPE\\n                 Many of you are surely wondering\\n                 why I have summoned you here at\\n                 this hour. It has come to my\\n                 attention that earlier this\\n                 evening... Harry Potter was\\n                 sighted in Hogsmeade.\\n\\n       A MURMURED THRILL fills the Hall. McGonagall’s eyes\\n       glisten with curiosity. Snape raises his voice, briefly,\\n       to quell the noise in the Hall.\\n\\n                               SNAPE\\n                 I mention this in the hopes that\\n                 truth will not be supplanted by\\n                 rumor.\\n                               (MORE)\\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\\n\\x0c                                                                  56.\\n230   CONTINUED:                                                        230\\n                                 SNAPE (CONT\\'D)\\n                   For myself and a few select\\n                   members of the staff this comes as\\n                   little surprise. We have, for\\n                   some time, considered Mr. Potter’s\\n                   return to Hogwarts to be not only\\n                   possible but inevitable.\\n                   Consequently, in the past several\\n                   months and under my specific\\n                   direction, exhaustive defensive\\n                   strategies have been employed to\\n                   defeat any attempt Mr. Potter\\n                   might make to breach these walls.\\n                   But know this. Should anyone --\\n                   student or staff -- attempt to\\n                   aid Mr. Potter, that person will\\n                   be punished in a manner consistent\\n                   with the severity of their\\n                   transgression. Rest assured: So\\n                   long as I am Headmaster at\\n                   Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never\\n                   again step foot in this castle.\\n\\n      As APPLAUSE erupts from the Slytherins, Maisy Reynolds,\\n      glowers over at them. Snape raises a hand. The room\\n      returns to silence.\\n\\n                                 SNAPE\\n                   Now then. If anyone here has\\n                   knowledge of Mr. Potter’s\\n                   movements this evening... I invite\\n                   them to step forward now.\\n\\n      Snape’s eyes rake the Hall. Dead silence.       A nervous\\n      shift of glances. And then...\\n\\n      FOOTSTEPS.\\n\\n      A FIGURE appears in the shadows at the back of the Hall.\\n      McGonagall’s chin rises in disbelief. Maisy’s face\\n      blooms with hope. And then...\\n\\n                                 HARRY (O.S.)\\n                   I think I can help you out with\\n                   that...\\n\\n      ...

Harry’s eyes narrow with\\n      malice as he stares at Snape.\\n\\n                               HARRY\\n                 How dare you stand where he stood.\\n\\n      Snape watches Harry draw his wand, point it at him.\\n\\n                               HARRY\\n                 Tell them how it was that night.\\n                 Tell then how you looked him in\\n                 the eye, a man who trusted you...\\n                 and killed him. Tell them!\\n\\n      Snape’s eyes find Harry’s, but his face remains a mask.\\n      McGonagall stands poised, no longer an ashen ghost.\\n      Flitwick’s hand twitches over his wand. The air prickles\\n      with anticipation.\\n\\n      Snape moves as if to retrieve his wand. McGonagall steps\\n      forward and sends a VOLCANIC BLAST Snape’s way.\\n      Pivoting, he parries the spell -- barely -- and sends it\\n      RICOCHETING around the room.\\n\\n      CHAOS ensues. Flitwick and the rest of the staff --\\n      inspired by Harry and McGonagall -- leap forth, wands\\n      out. Snape, outnumbered, standing at the epicenter,\\n      parries spell after spell with astonishing skill\\n      deflecting two of the curses into Alecto and Amycus\\n      Carrow.\\n\\n      Snape takes the measure of the room and sweeps his wand\\n      over his head, reducing the TORCHES that line the wall to\\n      SMOKE and pitching the Hall into total DARKNESS.\\n\\n      As STUDENTS SCREAM, a GREAT WHOOSHING sound fills the\\n      Hall and some flying thing flickers past the windows,\\n      RATTLING the PANES before BLASTING through one.\\n\\n      Instantly, the torches BURST back to life and we see that\\n      it’s McGonagall, wand raised aloft, who’s done it. In\\n      the moonlight, Harry can see a BATLIKE CREATURE beating\\n      into the night. McGonagall peers bitterly into the\\n      darkness.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\\n\\x0c                                                            58.\\n230   CONTINUED: (3)                                              230\\n\\n                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL\\n                Coward!

Even\\n      McGonagall can’t help but smile. Just then, Harry WINCES\\n      slightly, pressing his fingers to his temple.\\n\\n                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL\\n                Potter...\\n\\n      A slow RUMBLING fills the Hall. Harry, fingers trembling\\n      with pain, glances up, sees DARK CLOUDS coagulating in\\n      the Enchanted Ceiling. McGonagall follows his gaze, as\\n      do others, watching as the clouds shift eerily, like\\n      blots of blood.\\n\\n      Suddenly the FLAMES in the torches along the walls\\n      TREMBLE as a CHILL BREEZE consumes the room. The Hall\\n      slowly DIMS. All grows progressively silent when...\\n\\n      ... a GIRL SCREAMS, her voice rising and rising. Harry\\n      rushes through the throng, the students parting as he\\n      pelts forwards, pushing past them until he finds...\\n\\n      ... Maisy, cowering on the floor in the corner, hands\\n      over her ears, eyes clenched tight. She seems possessed.\\n      Everyone watches, chilled. Finally Harry starts to move\\n      forward, when he himself WINCES, pressing his fingers to\\n      his temples. Another person SCREAMS somewhere in the\\n      Hall, then another. Harry glances about him, at the\\n      circle of faces in his vicinity.\\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\\n\\x0c                                                             59.\\n230   CONTINUED: (4)                                               230\\n\\n      All are a mirror image of Maisy now, grimacing in pain.\\n      Harry stares, confused, stricken with pain, when...\\n\\n      ... a VOICE BLOOMS in his head in a DEATHLY WHISPER.\\n\\n                              VOLDEMORT (V.O.)\\n                I know that many of you will want\\n                to fight.

Above them, the clouds evaporate    in the\\n      Enchanted Ceiling. And then, like iron filings    flaking\\n      to the surface of a magnet, every eye finds...\\n\\n      Harry.\\n\\n      For a moment, silence.

Overmatched and outnumbered, our defeat was all but certain.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: But in the war\\'s final days, one Autobot ship escaped the battle. It was carrying a secret cargo which would have changed our planet\\'s fate.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: A desperate mission.

I\\'m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can\\'t tell you how proud we all are of you. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. Because of what you have done-\\n\\nAnnouncer: We have splashdown.\\n\\nPresident Nixon: -the heavens have become a part of man \\'s world.

You know who gave that to me?\\n\\nCarly: Who?\\n\\nSam: POTUS.\\n\\nCarly: Ah.\\n\\nSam: President of the United States. I-\\n\\nCarly: Aaaah!\\n\\nCarly (present day): Babe, it\\'s hard for everybody to get a job.\\n\\nSam: I don\\'t have time. You see, my parents are gonna be here in a week on their road trip Party-bus World Tour. If my dad gets here and I don\\'t have a job, he\\'s gonna spank me. You know, it\\'s go time for me.\\n\\nCarly: All right, tonight, I\\'ll give you a job. Romance me with a nice dinner and, uh, maybe you can get that bonus.\\n\\nSam: Mm. Mmm...\\n\\nBrains: Whooaah...\\n\\nCarly: [screams]\\n\\nBrains: Ah-ha. Get lucky.\\n\\nCarly: Get him out of here.\\n\\nBrains: Wait. No no no no no no no. Oof! Ow.\\n\\nCarly: Oh, he\\'s gross!\\n\\nBrains: She\\'s good.\\n\\nSam: I\\'m sorry. But they\\'re stranded here. Somebody\\'s got to watch out for them.\\n\\nCarly: Yesterday, that one was in my underwear drawer.\\n\\nBrains: Did research. Looking real good, too. Ha ha ha ha ha! Oww! No need to hit me, man.\\n\\nCarly: You are so not a normal boyfriend.\\n\\nSam: That\\'s what you love about me, yeah?\\n\\nBrains: Crybaby.\\n\\nCarly: We\\'re not at the love word yet. Maybe a little bit closer when you\\'re covering your half of the rent.\\n\\nSam: Goodbye.\\n\\nWheelie: Frickin\\' shorting my circuits out here! It\\'s inhumane, what it is! Make us live in a box on a balcony, right next to a beast! Like a common animal!\\n\\nSam: Stop, okay? You and your creepy sidekick you can\\'t be in here without permission.\\n\\nWheelie: Oh, according to who? Miss Blondy-Blond? Giddy up, little doggie! Hyah! Yo Brains, what\\'s up?\\n\\nBrains: Doing good.\\n\\nWheelie: Ah shit, I\\'ve seen this one. It\\'s the one where Spock goes nuts. You know, Sam, I don\\'t know about moving in with this chick. Uh. What if she dumps us like the last girl?\\n\\nBrains: She was mean. Didn\\'t like her.\\n\\nWheelie: Us guys got to stick together.\\n\\nBrains: [singing] We are family!\\n\\nSam: No, we\\'re not family. You\\'re a political refugee, and I have finally found someone who appreciates me for me.\\n\\nBrains: Well, you tell her that we\\'re not your pets, and we\\'re not your toys, all right? We\\'re an advanced, genius alien race just looking for a home.\\n\\nJudy: Maybe it wasn\\'t such a good idea.\\n\\nRon: Didn\\'t have to stop.\\n\\nJudy: Come on. What\\'re they going to do, tow it? Where is he? Ah! Sammy!\\n\\nRon: Sam.\\n\\nJudy: Oh, come on, that\\'s funny. Ha-ha.\\n\\nRon: Sam...\\n\\nSam: I missed you guys so much.\\n\\nJudy: Sure, you did. What do you think?\\n\\nSam: Look at that. Wow.\\n\\nJudy: Cute.\\n\\nSam: You look old.\\n\\nJudy: Stop it.\\n\\nSam: Feel like I can see the end.\\n\\nJudy: I love your little tie. Hey, where\\'s my girl? Where\\'s my beautiful Carly?\\n\\nSam: She\\'s at work, Ma.\\n\\nJudy: Right!\\n\\nSam: She\\'s got a new job. You guys said you were gonna be here in a week.\\n\\nJudy: Yeah...\\n\\nSam: The twenty first, not the eleventh, Dad, remember?\\n\\nRon: We just hauled ass in this thing. We stopped for gas.\\n\\nJudy: This thing. The love tub, it flies. Oh, are we keeping you from something? Like, say, your job?\\n\\nRon: Well, it\\'s about time.\\n\\nJudy: [giggles]\\n\\nRon: You had us worried.\\n\\nSam: I have- uh- job interviews.\\n\\nJudy: Oh. That\\'s good.\\n\\nRon: That sucks.\\n\\nJudy: Stop it.\\n\\nSam: You don\\'t have to be so negative, Dad. You know, you\\'re in D.C. You\\'re here with your son and your family. I mean, it\\'s a good time.\\n\\nRon: It sucks that you don\\'t have a job.\\n\\nSam: Yeah, but there\\'s good things to do here, too, right?\\n\\nJudy: Yeah-\\n\\nSam: Right? Museums and monuments, okay?\\n\\nJudy: Nothing to worry about.\\n\\nSam: I\\'ll see you tonight.\\n\\nRon: I\\'m bagging the gift.\\n\\nJudy: Sam, I think for an interview you should wear real pants.\\n\\nSam: I think for life you should wear real pants.\\n\\nJudy: Oh, what- what happened to Bumblebee?\\n\\nRon: Jesus.\\n\\nSam: He\\'s off on his missions. I had to get this for backup.\\n\\nRon: Oh, your car has a job, huh?\\n\\nJudy: Stop. What does it change into?\\n\\nSam: It doesn\\'t change into anything. It\\'s a collector\\'s item, Ma. I got it for a steal. It just needs some work. Trust me.\\n\\nJudy: Oh. No, I think it\\'s darling. It reminds me a lot of Bumblebee, if Bumblebee were- a sad piece of shit.\\n\\nJudy: Come on, we\\'ll give you a ride!\\n\\nAct Three:\\n\\nOptimus Prime: In the years since our arrival, our new home, Earth, has seen much change. Energon detectors guard its cities now. Long-range defense system watch the skies.\\n\\nMiddle East - Illegal Nuclear Site\\n\\nOptimus Prime: So now we assist our allies, n solving human conflicts, to prevent mankind from bringing harm to itself.\\n\\nGuard: The Defense Minister\\'s car.\\n\\nGuard: Raise the banner!\\n\\nDino: Yah-ha-ha! On the ground, per favore! And stay there!\\n\\nGuards: Aaah!\\n\\nOptimus Prime: We work in secret teams on various missions around the globe. And all the while, we search for signs... of our true enemies\\' return.\\n\\nVoshkod: I am Voshkod, General Counsel with Ukrainian Department of Energy. My government will officially deny that we\\'re having this conversation. At one of our decommissioned facilities, a, uh, discovery was made, which I fear may be... alien in nature. The facility\\'s name is... Chernobyl.\\n\\nLennox: Mr Voshkod. So, uninhabited since \\'86. I hear it won\\'t be livable again for another twenty thousand years?\\n\\nVoshkod: At least. Ukraine was the most fertile land. It\\'s a tragedy. This way.\\n\\nLennox: Gear up! We have sixty minutes on the ground. Watch your radiation levels. Mr Voshkod, where\\'s your protective gear?\\n\\nLennox: Where is your protective gear?\\n\\nVoshkod: It would not matter. For me, it\\'s only a matter of time. Through the school.\\n\\nVoshkod: Yuri will take you below And one other thing, Colonel. In private... there were some energy experiments-\\n\\nLaserbeak: [growling]\\n\\nVoshkod: Ahh! It can wait.\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Keep moving. Stay tight.\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Okay, right here. I think I found it.\\n\\nLennox: Optimus, we got a visual. Looks like the object\\'s clamped in some kind of a metal harness.\\n\\nNEST Soldier: What\\'s this? Guys! Why does this thing have Soviet space program markings on it?\\n\\nLennnox: Sputnik?\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Energon readings, sir. It\\'s strong... below us. It\\'s coming fast.\\n\\nDriller: [roar]\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Contact, contact! Oof-\\n\\nSoldiers: [screaming]\\n\\nLennox: Get topside now! Move, move, move!\\n\\nDriller: [growling & roaring]\\n\\nOptimus Prime: [grunting]\\n\\nLennox: Let\\'s go!\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Weapons up! Heavy weapons up!\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Stay behind me!\\n\\nLennox: Optimus!\\n\\nNEST Soldiers: [screaming]\\n\\nLennox: Fall back! It\\'s circling around us!\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Taking our flank! It\\'s taking our flank! Aah!\\n\\nOptimus Prime: [grunting]\\n\\nLennox: Get the heavy weapon!\\n\\nShockwave: Optimus!\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Hyaaah!\\n\\nDriller: [growling]\\n\\nLennox: What the hell was that thing?\\n\\nOptimus Prime: That... is Shockwave.\\n\\nLennox: Why was he after this?\\n\\nOptimus Prime: It\\'s impossible. This is an engine part... from a long lost Autobot ship.\\n\\nVoshkod: [panting]\\n\\nLaserbeak: [screeching] Pleasure working with you.\\n\\nAct Four:\\n\\nJudy: Interviews! This is so exciting! Honey, do you want some gum? Your breath gets really gnarly when you\\'re nervous.\\n\\nSecretary: Mister With-weeky?\\n\\nSam: Yeah. Search is over.\\n\\nWhitley: I\\'m Mr. Whitley.\\n\\nSam: Mr-\\n\\nSam: Is anybody else joining?\\n\\nSuited Interviewer: No.\\n\\nSam: No? You want me to move right there? I\\'ll move right there.\\n\\nSuited Interviewer: I\\'d prefer not.\\n\\nSam: Sensei.\\n\\nMatsumoto: Ready? Begin.\\n\\nSam: I graduated this year. Majored in geopolitics. Minor in tech studies. Very interested in government and technology, how that\\'s gonna intersect and co-exist. Shape the future...\\n\\nRon: Why did we bother sending him to an lvy college for? Three months out of school and he can\\'t find a job?\\n\\nJudy: Oh-\\n\\nSam: Mr Matsuhisu-\\n\\nMatsumoto: Matsumoto.\\n\\nSam: -hasi\\n\\nMatsumoto: Matsumoto.\\n\\nSam: -moto.\\n\\nSam: Martha, can I call you Martha?\\n\\nMartha: No, you may not.\\n\\nSam: Okay, Jack, there\\'s two types of people in this world. There\\'s thinkers, there\\'s doers.\\n\\nWhitley: Hmm.\\n\\nSam: There\\'s winners, there\\'s dreamers and there\\'s buddies.\\n\\nWhitley: What about some weaknesses?\\n\\nSam: Pfft! I don\\'t... You have a very trustworthy face. You remind me of like, uh, an Asian Colonel Sanders. A man I can trust.\\n\\nJudy: He\\'s a millennial. That means they\\'re the, you know, like lost generation.\\n\\nSuited Interviewer: Why was the FBI looking for you?\\n\\nSam: The what? Yeah, FBI. Good of you to flag that. It was during all that alien craziness when you were... fourteen. I mean, they were very kind to me, found me in a jiffy. Uh. And that\\'s all been expunged. Obama gave me a medal, actually. I\\'m just saying. It\\'s always good to have a medal guy in the office, with a medal.\\n\\nSuited Interviewer: From Obama?\\n\\nSam: Yeah.\\n\\nSuited Interviewer: In this office, we\\'re... mostly Republicans, so...\\n\\nRon: I\\'m not feeling too good.\\n\\nSam: No?\\n\\nRon: No.\\n\\nSam: Why don\\'t you get a little dipping tray and dip the dog in Pepto? That\\'s a solution.\\n\\nRon: Hmm.\\n\\nSam: Pow. I got another one. We got to go. Come on.\\n\\nJudy: Really?\\n\\nBrazos: Sit.\\n\\nSam: Yeah. Okay.\\n\\nBrazos: Got myself a Mr Sam Witwicky, recent college graduate. Previous experience, next to zero, yet... he has a recommend letter from our board? Double-you-tee-eff to that...\\n\\nSam: Do I know somebody on your board?\\n\\nBrazos: Here\\'s the deal. You know who we are. Accuretta Systems, global leader in telecom, aerospace, seventeen billion in profit last year. We contract for DARPA, NASA, JPL, you name it. You perform here, doors open for you anywhere. First job out of college is critical, kid. You either take a step down the correct career path or you fall into a life-sucking abyss.\\n\\nSam: Mmm.\\n\\nBrazos: So it all depends on how you respond to my next two words: Impress me.\\n\\nSam: Now?\\n\\nBrazos: Impress me.\\n\\nSam: You catch me off guard. I\\'m- I don\\'t know where to begin.\\n\\nBrazos: Impress me.\\n\\nSam: I- I\\'m an open book. Ask me any question you like.\\n\\nBrazos: So you a go-getter, ramrod-\\n\\nSam: Yes, sir.\\n\\nBrazos: -take-charge kind of guy?\\n\\nSam: I\\'m a killer. A stone-cold killer.\\n\\nBrazos: So, take-charge guy?\\n\\nSam: Take-charge, Viking, barbarian, of course, that\\'s me. Pow! I\\'m here.\\n\\nBrazos: We are not looking for that here. No brown-nosing. No suck up. No toolery. I-\\n\\nBrazos\\' Aide: Yes, Mr. Brazos.\\n\\nBrazos: Why is Shontel using what appears to be a red cup from the red floor when we are on the yellow floor?\\n\\nBrazos\\' Aide: I\\'m on it.\\n\\nBrazos: It is a visual and, therefore, a visceral betrayal. Stop it!\\n*\\nBrazos\\' Aide: Such a dumbass.\\n\\nBrazos: Disgusting! Thank you! It\\'s total anarchy around here.\\n\\nShontel: [sobbing]\\n\\nSam: The, uh, email I, uh, read said administrative aide?\\n\\nBrazos: Nope. Mail room.\\n\\nSam: I\\'m gonna go.\\n\\nBrazos: Do you have any idea how many lvy League Phi Beta Kappas would kill to-\\n\\nSam: Mister, I saved your life twice. Okay? I can\\'t tell you how or when or why, but I have done shit that matters. And I\\'d just kind of like a job where I matter again. So thank you, but no thank you, okay?\\n\\nBrazos: You know what I think? You want the job after this job. But, son, this is the job that\\'s standing in your way. And that\\'s why you\\'re gonna be so very very good at it. \\'Cause when I look at you, I see a younger me.\\n\\nAct Five:\\n\\nClassified NEST Headquarters - Washington D.C.\\n\\nNEST Announcer: All arriving Autobots, in pan training and debriefing in fifteen minutes. Dino, report to bay twenty-three. Sideswipe, bay thirty-seven for weapons assessment.\\n\\nMearing: Senator, I suggest you remember that when the NSA wants funding they call me. When the CIA is gonna take out a target, they ask first for my permission. And when the President wants to know which members of Congress are politically vulnerable in terms of, let\\'s say, undiscovered criminal conduct, I\\'m the number he dials.\\n\\nNewscaster: U. S. Agencies say they have been monitoring the blast. But if, in fact, this was a covert military strike, no nation has yet claimed responsibility.\\n\\nMearing: CIA is up my ass about this mystery raid in the Middle East. So, it\\'s time to come clean. Was your unit involved?\\n\\nLennox: Ah... I\\'m not sure, ma\\'am.\\n\\nNEST Soldier: All right, guys. This is how you do a Decepticon head kill shot.\\n\\nBumblebee: [whistling]\\n\\nMearing: As Director of National Intelligence, I\\'m a really big fan of intelligent answers. I can\\'t really tell you definitively. These Autobots are like teenage kids. They like to sneak out of the house every once in a while.\\n\\nMearing: Colonel Lennox, are you in command or are you not?\\n\\nLennox: Yes, ma\\'am, I am. I-\\n\\nMearing: Stop with the ma\\'am. Enough with the ma\\'am. Do I look like a ma\\'am?\\n\\nLennox: No, ma\\'am. Ye- Yes, ma\\'am. Yes.\\n\\nQue: This gun is my perfect invention, Ironhide.\\n\\nIronhide: Right.\\n\\nQue: Oh, good! You\\'re here! Me name\\'s Que. I do hope you have answers for him. I\\'ve never seen him so upset before.\\n\\nLennox: Optimus, you remember Charlotte Mearing? Our Director of National Intelligence?\\n\\nDino: He\\'s in a bad mood. He\\'s-a not talking to anybody today.\\n\\nMearing: What is this, the silent treatment?\\n\\nIronhide: We\\'ve seen that, and this is not that.\\n\\nQue: Definitely not.\\n\\nIronhide: This is worse. Prime! Make something of yourself!... He\\'s pissed.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: You lied to us. Everything humans know of our planet we were told had all been shared. So why was this found in human possession?\\n\\nMearing: We were in the dark on this also. It was Director Only clearance at Sector Seven until now. The bag.\\n\\nMearing\\'s Aide: Which bag?\\n\\nMearing: Herm�s. Birkin. Green ostrich! My God... This is a secret few men knew, and fewer still remain alive. Allow me to please introduce to you two of NASA\\'s founding mission directors and astronaut Dr. Buzz Aldrin, one of the first two men to step foot on the moon. Sir? Optimus Prime.\\n\\nBuzz Aldrin: From a fellow space traveler, it\\'s a true honor.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: The honor is mine.\\n\\nMearing: Our entire space race of the 1960\\'s, it appears, was in response to an event.\\n\\nNASA Officer: Our astronauts investigated a crashed alien ship. No survivors on board.\\n\\nBuzz Aldrin: We were sworn to secrecy by our Commander in Chief.\\n\\nNASA Commander (flashback): This was a mission you will never speak of.\\n\\nBuzz (flashback): I understand, sir.\\n\\nNASA Officer: A total of thirty five people knew the real plan at NASA.\\n\\nNASA Officer: Soviets managed to land unmanned probes. Somehow they must have... picked up that fuel rod.\\n\\nMearing: We believe the Russians deduced that the rod was a fissionable fuel assembly, believed they had it mastered and tried to harness it at Chernobyl.\\n\\nNASA Officer: We landed six missions in all. We took hundreds of photos and samples. We locked them away forever when the moon program was shut down.\\n\\nIronhide: Well, did you search the crash vault?\\n\\nOptimus Prime: The ship\\'s name was the Ark. I watched it escape Cybertron myself. It was carrying an Autobot technology which would have won us the war. And... its captain.\\n\\nMearing: Who was its captain?\\n\\nOptoimus Prime: The great Sentinel Prime. The technology\\'s inventor. He was commander of the Autobots before me. It\\'s imperative that I find it before the Decepticons learn of its location. Our Autobot spacecraft has the ability to get there. And... you must pray it\\'s in time.\\n\\nAct Six:\\n\\nSam: Hi. I\\'m here to see Carly Spencer.\\n\\nSam: Carly!\\n\\nCarly: Sorry, just gotta- You got the job?\\n\\nSam: This is crazy.\\n\\nCarly: You really got it?\\n\\nSam: Yes.\\n\\nCarly: See, what did I tell you? It\\'s the bunny. [giggling] You are so welcome.\\n\\nSam: Do you like me more?\\n\\nCarly: A little bit, yeah.\\n\\nSam: You said you were his assistant curator, you didn\\'t say the guy owns Space Mountain.\\n\\nCarly: I know. Isn\\'t it beautiful in here? And, he\\'s the coolest guy. Ever.\\n\\nDylan: Hmm.\\n\\nSam: Yeah?\\n\\nCarly: Yeah.\\n\\nDylan: Sam! Dylan Gould.\\n\\nSam: Hey. A pleasure to meet you.\\n\\nDylan: Pleasure meeting you. Carly\\'s told me a lot about you.\\n\\nSam: Well, vice versa. It\\'s a- it\\'s a beautiful building you got. It\\'s like the Starship Enterprise in here.\\n\\nDylan: Heh-heh, thank you very much. It leaks. Now, before Carly came to help run the collection, it was just a... complete mess. But now, the restorations are back on track, we\\'re going to Pebble Beach this year and we\\'re gonna get a trophy for that stand right there. You know why? Because this woman right here is my secret weapon.\\n\\nCarly: Oh.\\n\\nSam: Okay.\\n\\nCarly: Mr. Gould, please, you exaggerate. All I\\'ve done is get you organized.\\n\\nDylan: Oh, you\\'ve done much more than that, my Duchess.\\n\\nSam: Oh. Nicknames, that\\'s fun.\\n\\nDylan: Yeah. The Duchess.\\n\\nOlder Woman: She\\'s adorable.\\n\\nDylan: You know, when I stole her away from the British Embassy, I said: It\\'s easy to manage a country. Try managing a priceless collection of art. Take a look at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet. Designed by a Frenchman. Look at the curves. Elegant, isn\\'t it? Beautiful. Sensual. Built to evoke the body of the ideal woman. Come on. My dad had a ten dollar desk and a dream, and he built it into an empire.\\n\\nSam: Whoa-ha-ha! Wow.\\n\\nDylan: We\\'re the largest accounting firm in the U.S. I started up the venture side after he, ah, passed. Invest in the future. Try and bet on the winners. See, collecting cars helps me keep my sanity.\\n\\nSam: You guys look great.\\n\\nCarly: Oh. That was a great day, Mr. Gould.\\n\\nDylan: I haven\\'t seen that one.\\n\\nCarly: No. Me neither.\\n\\nDylan: Jeans are tight.\\n\\nSam: Oh. Here we go. Here we go. You see that? Judgment. Judging a man by his car? And you\\'re gonna wave at him while he\\'s judging me?\\n\\nCarly: What\\'s with you? He\\'s my boss. This job pays for our food, our rent.\\n\\nSam: No, I totally understand. I\\'m totally fine. I get it. I\\'m well fed. And guess what? I\\'m not your boy toy anymore. I got my big boy pants on. You see them? In the car. Thank you, Duchess.\\n\\nCarly: [chuckles] My god, are you threatened by him?\\n\\nSam: [obviously fake laughter] Threatened? What am I threatened by? His money? His power? His good looks? None of the above. Check!\\n\\nCarly: God! Your temper tantrums are so sexy.\\n\\nSam: Get in the car, please. Sam, he\\'s hardly the first man to ever smile at me. I think I can handle it.\\n\\nSam: Hold on, hold on. It\\'s the smiling back part that gets me. Okay?\\n\\nCarly: No more smiles. Never again. I promise.\\n\\nSam: See, that works for me.\\n\\nCarly: Yeah?\\n\\nSam: [grunting]\\n\\nDylan: Easy! Easy! You\\'re not gonna get it started that way.\\n\\nSam: Well, I was just getting it ready. I\\'m about thirty-two percent done with my restoration. Some chrome work, put a spoiler on the back. Done deal.\\n\\nDylan: You know, Carly\\'s been telling me you\\'ve been struggling job-wise. Just so you know, I\\'m on the board for Accuretta Systems, and I, I put in a call for you. Let\\'s keep it between us, okay? She\\'s so proud of you. You\\'re a lucky man.\\n\\nAct Seven:\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Xantium approaching Tranquility Base\\n\\nGround Base Officer: [Something obscured by static] You\\'re a go for landing. [More obscured by static]\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Ratchet, let\\'s roll.\\n\\nGround Base Officer: Did he get that mag-cam out? ... Inbound. Copy, contact.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: We\\'re entering the Ark.\\n\\nRatchet: His levels are faint. He locked himself away to guard the pillars.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Sentinel. You\\'re coming home, old friend.\\n\\nAct Eight:\\n\\nMegatron: [assorted growling] All... hail... Megatron.\\n\\nIgor: [slobbering, giggling] My master! Yes, my master! Yes!\\n\\nHatchlings: [squeaking]\\n\\nMegatron: Ah, don\\'t be greedy, my fragile ones.\\n\\nStarscream: Oh, my poor master. How it pains me to see you so wounded, so weak...\\n\\nMegatron: Spare me, you gaseous sycophant!\\n\\n(A) Doctor: Aah!\\n\\nMegatron: You know what you are told, which is nothing.\\n\\nSoundwave: Soundwave reporting, Lord Megatron.\\n\\nMegatron: And what news from your little assassin?\\n\\nLaserbeak: Autobots have taken the bait! They\\'ve discovered the Ark and returned with its cargo.\\n\\nMegatron: You did me great honor tracking that ship to the moon. Your human collaborators have served their purpose, Soundwave.\\n\\nA Doctor: [screaming] Ayiiee!\\n\\nMegatron: It\\'s time to eliminate loose ends.\\n\\nSoundwave: Laserbeak. Kill them all.\\n\\nLaserbeak: With pleasure.\\n\\nLaserbeak: Is your daddy home?\\n\\nMadeline: Then Madeline said, it\\'s about time-\\n\\nMom: Madeline!\\n\\nLaserbeak: Hello, Mom!\\n\\nMom: [screaming] Get out of the house!\\n\\nDad: What are you doing in my house?\\n\\nLaserbeak: Just visiting.\\n\\nAct Nine:\\n\\nMailroom Guy: What is this hoochie-mama outfit?\\n\\nWoman: [speaks in a foreign language]\\n\\nMailroom Guy: No, this is the aerospace division! We do not allow that here!\\n\\nWoman: [continues to speak in the foreign language]\\n\\nMailroom Guy: New guy! You see that? That\\'s a Latin meltdown, okay? You ever show up in my office with a hoochie-mama outfit, you\\'re fired. You got that? Okay, you\\'re gonna be on this cart for two and a half years, okay? I want you to live it, love it and name it.\\n\\nWoman: [continues to rant in the background]\\n\\nMailroom Guy: There\\'s no ladder climbing in my office. I run a tight ship. Okay?\\n\\nSam: Yes sir.\\n\\nMailroom Guy: Move.\\n\\nDonny: I found that paper I was telling you about... What are we looking at?\\n\\nWang: Shut up!\\n\\nDonny: You do that to me again and I\\'ll kick your ass!\\n\\nCarly: Hi.\\n\\nSam: Oh! Hi, angel.\\n\\nCarly: How are you?\\n\\nSam: Good.\\n\\nCarly: I had a meeting downtown. Was it okay for me to stop by?\\n\\nSam: I don\\'t know. My five hundred page employee conduct manual isn\\'t exactly a page turner.\\n\\nCarly: This is great.\\n\\nSam: Yeah, Autobots are off saving the world, and I have organized four binders. I\\'m living the dream. Come on.\\n\\nMustache Guy: Visitor violation.\\n\\nSam: You okay?\\n\\nWang: Absolutely. I\\'m next.\\n\\nCarly: Listen.\\n\\nSam: Hmm?\\n\\nCarly: Saturday. Dylan\\'s throwing a party at his house. It\\'s a work thing but he\\'s invited you too.\\n\\nSam: Oh, did he?\\n\\nCarly: I want you to come and laugh at my bad jokes. It would really mean a lot to me, okay?\\n\\nSam: I\\'d love to go. How\\'d you get over here?\\n\\nCarly: Car.\\n\\nSam: You don\\'t have a car.\\n\\nCarly: Yes I do.\\n\\nSam: What, did you win it in a raffle?\\n\\nCarly: Uh, he gave me one.\\n\\nSam: He gave you a car?\\n\\nCarly: Yeah, I think it was a work perk.\\n\\nSam: Huh. A work perk. What kind of car did he give you?\\n\\nCarly: Uh, A Mercedes SLS-AMG. Really throaty engine.\\n\\nSam: Hmm.\\n\\nMercedes Ad: Mercedes-Benz SLS combines breathtaking performance... [Trails off]\\n\\nSam: You drove this here? That\\'s a two hundred thousand dollar car.\\n\\nCarly: I know.\\n\\nSam: You know how long it would take me to afford a car like this?\\n\\nCarly: A long time?\\n\\nSam: Yeah, like fifty three years.\\n\\nCarly: He said it was for both of us.\\n\\nSam: Then what we should do is, we should sell it and buy a house.\\n\\nCarly: You\\'re frustrated, I know. I\\'ve been there. It\\'s called paying your dues. Good things will happen.\\n\\nBrazos: Ladies and gentlemen, I need some lunch time filing done, stat.\\n\\nMustache Guy: He\\'s coming.\\n\\nBrazos: Who would like to score some Bruce Brazos points?\\n\\nMustache Man: Bruce, you found your guy.\\n\\nBrazos: Witwicky! The man who makes this company run. Now, who have we here? Is it a sister, Facebook friend, Twitter tweeter?\\n\\nSame: Carly, this is Bruce. Bruce.\\n\\nCarly: Hi, I\\'m his girlfriend. A pleasure to meet you. Sam was right. You really do have a smashing head of hair.\\n\\nBrazos: Well, thank you. Heh-heh.\\n\\nCarly: Sam, I got to run.\\n\\nSam: Yeah.\\n\\nCarly: Oh. Here, your present. Your favorite color. Nice to meet you, Mr. Brazos.\\n\\nBrazos: And you.\\n\\nCarly: See you, boys.\\n\\nDonny: I\\'m still stewing about that binder incident, Jerry.\\n\\nWang: May I finish my Shu Hua milk, Donny?\\n\\nDonny: I don\\'t care about your exotic milk. I care about respect!\\n\\nWang: Ahh. I know who you are!\\n\\nSam: Shit!\\n\\nWang: Witwicky! Witwicky! I\\'m talking to you!\\n\\nSam: Excuse me. Thank you.\\n\\nWang: Whoa whoa whoa, slow down, tiger. You showed up in the background of six different photos, two continents, with aliens. That was you in Egypt, huh, right? Because you know the aliens. See, you!\\n\\nSam: Give me my jacket!\\n\\nWang: Whoa! Wah! Hai! I\\'m Wang. Deep Wang. Deep Wang. You\\'re not getting it. Deep throat. Watergate? I\\'m talking code to you. Shhh! Damn it. They watch and listen. I can\\'t go to the government, but you, you can! Because shit\\'s going down, son! It is code pink, as in Floyd! Dark Side! Why do you think no one\\'s been up there since 1972?\\n\\nSam: I know you\\'re speaking English, it\\'s just a very strange English. That\\'s why I\\'m not- oh. Don\\'t. I\\'m gonna hit you.\\n\\nWang: I\\'m gonna hit you right back, son. It\\'s my manifesto. They\\'re whacking us out. Everyone who knows what\\'s on the dark-\\n\\nBrazos: [indistinct words]\\n\\nWang: Your alien friends are in danger, you know, the good ones. It\\'s up to you.\\n\\nWang: Calm down. Ow! Easy, Sam!\\n\\nWang: What are you looking at? Yo, dawg. Are you up in my shit? Who are you working for? Stare down, you and me. Guess I won.\\n\\nSam: Moon satellites. The Russian space program. Experts dead. Space program ends. Dark side. Dark side of the moon.\\n\\nMailroom Guy: Look what I found outside the bathroom. Huh? Is it yours? Deal with this.\\n\\nSam: Yes, sir.\\n\\nWang: I did everything you want!\\n\\nSam: I really think we should talk, cause some of the stuff-\\n\\nWang: Whoa! Knock first! Can\\'t you see I\\'m busy? Who are you? Who are you?\\n\\nSam: You straddled me in the stall. That\\'s happened to me once in this life. I wouldn\\'t forget it.\\n\\nWang: No!\\n\\nSam: From the bathroom stall. You took your package out.\\n\\nWang: WHOA!\\n\\nSam: You took your package out.\\n\\nWang: Whoa! We are not boyfriends, okay? One phone call from me and I\\'ll have you fired. Oh yes, I will, gaylord!\\n\\nSam: Are you okay?\\n\\nWang: Ahh- hemorrhoids!\\n\\nSam: Should I come back? When should I come back?\\n\\nWang: Come back when you learn some manners!\\n\\nWang: Ah! I don\\'t know him! I would never say anything!\\n\\nLaserbeak: [cawing, growling]\\n\\nWang: Whoa whoa whoa whoa, okay, okay! I sabotaged the mapping satellite, just like I promised, I can put a blind spot in the program as a bonus, what more do you want from me?\\n\\nLaserbeak: Jerrrry, you are my favorrrite.\\n\\nWang: I\\'ll do whatever you want me to do.\\n\\nLaserbeak: I know, but my superiors need me to- [caw]\\n\\nWang: Please, please, you don\\'t have to do-\\n\\nLaserbeak: -Suicide you.\\n\\nWang: No, no no-\\n\\nLaserbeak: What did you say to Witwicky?\\n\\nWang: Ah, shit! Huh? Who wants some chicken dinner now, bitch? Cause somebody messed with the wrong Wang today!\\n\\nLaserbeak: [hissing]\\n\\nWang: Come on! You want some of me? Huh? Huh? Oh no no no no no no- [screaming]\\n\\nDonny: I don\\'t need any more didactic lectures from Chuck. That\\'s not helping-\\n\\nBrazos: Jesus!\\n\\nWang: Aaaaaah-\\n\\nVarious Employees: [talking indistinctly]\\n\\nBrazos: Get legal.\\n\\nDonny: That\\'s Jerry!\\n\\nBrazos: Come on, people. Yes, a workmate died but looking out the window is not going to bring him back. The man was depressed.\\n\\nWoman: Don\\'t take a picture! A little respect!\\n\\nBrazos: You can keep watching him, but he\\'s not getting up. You all read Humpty Dumpty. Okay? Witwicky. I\\'m spearheading the press. You clean up. Wang is everywhere. He is in the bistro. He\\'s in the bamboo. He\\'s on the balustrade.\\n\\nDonny: You see the sidewalk down there? Man!\\n\\nBrazos: Box up his personals. Get his name off his parking space. We need-\\n\\nDonny: Hey, when did we get a new copier?\\n\\nBrazos: Listen, I\\'m not gonna say anything about what I saw. Who you share a toilet stall with is totally your business.\\n\\nLaserbeak: [plays out the G1 cartoon theme tune]\\n\\nDonny: This is exceedingly Japanese. They never make it easy, do they- [screaming]\\n\\nLaserbeak: [cawing]\\n\\nBrazos: Aaah!\\n\\nSam: [assorted shouting]\\n\\nAct Ten:\\n\\nCarly: What is with you?\\n\\nSam: This is the real deal, Carly, okay? I need you to stay composed. It\\'s real life. I\\'ll explain it to you later.\\n\\nSam: We\\'ve got an emergency. You gotta get Colonel Lennox out here. I\\'m reporting a Decepticon. The Decepticons are back. You gotta open that gate right now.\\n\\nNEST Guard: Easy, sir. This is Health and Human Services.\\n\\nSam: Right. Packing M4\\'s? What are you protecting, colostomy bags? Bedpans? Throat lozenges?\\n\\nCarly: Babe. Babe-\\n\\nSam: Where\\'d you get that hat from, nursing school? So, you\\'re nurses and foot-powder protectors? Fantastic.\\n\\nCarly: Babe.\\n\\nSam: Yes.\\n\\nCarly: I don\\'t think we\\'re in the right place.\\n\\nSam: We are in the right place. We\\'re in the right place and we\\'re in the right place and I\\'m gonna talk to Optimus right now.\\n\\nNEST Guard: Sir.\\n\\nSam: You\\'re gonna get Optimus out here.\\n\\nNEST Guard: Sir. Sir, you got the wrong building. I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\\n\\nSam: What part of Decepticons are back do you not understand?\\n\\nNEST Guard: Yo! You being a smartass?\\n\\nSam: DO NOT hit my car! It\\'s a collector\\'s item!\\n\\nNEST Guard: I wouldn\\'t do that.\\n\\nCarly: You\\'re crazy!\\n\\nSam: Whoa!\\n\\nNEST Guard: We got an Energon reading!\\n\\nNEST Guard: We\\'ve got aliens in the vehicle!\\n\\nSam: Whoooaaa!\\n\\nNEST Guard: You move, you\\'re dead! Out! Out! Got aliens in the vehicle!\\n\\nSam: Whoaaa!\\n\\nWheelie: Aah!\\n\\nNEST Guard: Freeze! Get out!\\n\\nBrains: Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! We\\'re freezing!\\n\\nSam: Are you- are you kidding me?\\n\\nCarly: Sam, they\\'ve got guns! Oh my god.\\n\\nNEST Guard: I got him. Go!\\n\\nSam: Bee! Is Bee in there? Aaah! Okay, all right.\\n\\nBrains: This how you treat Autobots? We\\'re on the same team.\\n\\nWheelie: Yeah, enjoy your next job at Seven-Eleven, dickhead.\\n\\nBrains: That\\'s right!\\n\\nWheelie: A-hole.\\n\\nNEST Guard: How\\'s your car now?\\n\\nBumblebee: [whistling noises]\\n\\nSam: That\\'s my car. Come here.\\n\\nBumblebee: [whistling noises]\\n\\nSam: Come here!\\n\\nBumblebee: {Come on! Sam...}\\n\\nSam: What is your deal, huh? I know your black ops stuff is important to you. I\\'m not trying to diminish it or, you know, guilt-trip you or anything, I just never see you anymore. You can\\'t come to the garage, just hang out one night?\\n\\nBumblebee: {Sam. That makes me. Feel bad.}\\n\\nSam: Well, yeah, I hope you feel bad. You should feel bad. Look at the jalopy I\\'m driving now. I feel bad every single day.\\n\\nNEST Guard: Yo, let\\'s go, both of you. Lennox wants to see you.\\n\\nWheelie: What, we not good enough for you anymore?\\n\\nSam: I\\'m sorry, babe. They were very rude, all right? And you\\'re fixing my car! You don\\'t think so?\\n\\nSam: Raise your hand if you had a flying psycho-ninja copier trying to kill you today! Those are my brass knuckles. That\\'s my anklet. Do I have to take that off too? And my toe rings?\\n\\nNEST Announcer: All NEST officials clear the floor. We have 10 minutes until attempted contact.\\n\\nMearing: We\\'ve taken possession of the five devices that were hidden in the ship with Sentinel Prime. They\\'re some kind of prototype Autobot technology. They say Sentinel was the... Einstein of his civilization, so we\\'re gonna keep these locked up until we know what we\\'re dealing with. Right now, no one gets access. No one.\\n\\nSam: This Wang guy recognized me. He told me to warn you, he was talking about the dark side of the moon, and then they killed him.\\n\\nLennox: Wait a minute. He mentioned the moon?\\n\\nSam: Yeah, dark side of the moon.\\n\\nCarly: But why would Decepticons want to kill humans? I thought their war was with the Autobots.\\n\\nMearing: ...And that is when he made his first quick-look science report, that\\'s what we want- who\\'s the chick? Okay, excuse me!\\n\\nSam: These compiled-\\n\\nMearing: Colonel Lennox?\\n\\nLennox: Director Mearing, this is Sam Witwicky, a civilian-\\n\\nMearing: I know his name, Colonel. I want to know who gave him clearance?\\n\\nSam: Who gave me clearance? How about Optimus Prime, when he touched down in suburbia looking for my house?\\n\\nLennox: This is the National Intelligence Director, in case you...\\n\\nSam: Hi.\\n\\nMearing: Disrespecting a federal officer? Huh! Maybe that\\'ll get you somewhere. Who\\'s she?\\n\\nSam: She\\'s my girlfriend.\\n\\nMearing: What is this, like a date?\\n\\nLennox: She knows all about the Autobots, okay? She knows Bumblebee. And she comes from a military family. I can vouch for her.\\n\\nSam: Hey, I- I- have an idea. How about we get back to the important topics, like the fact that I almost had my face cut off by a Decepticon? As a taxpayer, I would like to lodge a complaint, a- as a matter of fact.\\n\\nLennox: Okay, okay, listen, all right? One of the software engineers at Sam\\'s office was murdered today. He was involved in NASA\\'s lunar mapping probe.\\n\\nMearing: Here\\'s the thing. Colonel Lennox. We cannot entrust national security to teenagers, unless I missed a policy paper. Are we doing that now? No. Good. I don\\'t care who you are. If you breathe a word of what you see in here, you will do time for treason. Do you understand me?\\n\\nSam: I\\'ll take my orders from the Autobots. I know them. I don\\'t know you.\\n\\nMearing: You will.\\n\\nNEST Announcer: [saying something indistinct]\\n\\nLennox: Sentinel Prime. These things run on Energon, and he\\'s out of it. He\\'s in a... sort of a sleep mode.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Let us begin.\\n\\nLennox: That\\'s the great Matrix of Leadership. He holds the only thing in the universe that can re-power a Transformer\\'s spark.\\n\\nCarly: This is incredible.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Sentinel Prime, we bid you return.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: [Speaking in Cybertronian]\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Unngh-\\n\\nLennox: Hold your fire!\\n\\nSentinel Prime: [Speaking in Cybertronian]\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Stop! Sentinel! It is I- Optimus- Prime! It is all right. You are safe.\\n\\nRatchet: There is nothing to fear.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: We are here. You are home, Sentinel.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: The war... the war!\\n\\nOptimus Prime: The war was lost. Cybertron is now but a barren wasteland. We have taken refuge here, on planet Earth. Its human race is our ally.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: My ship! We came under fire. The pillars. Where are the pillars?\\n\\nOptimus Prime: You saved five of them, including the control pillar.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: Only five? We once had hundreds!\\n\\nMearing: Excuse me, gentlemen. May I ask... what is this technology you\\'re looking for?\\n\\nSentinel Prime: It is the ability to reshape the universe. Together the pillars form a Space Bridge. I designed, and I alone, can control it. It defies your laws of physics to transport matter through time and space.\\n\\nMearing: You\\'re talking about a teleportation device, aren\\'t you?\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Yes, for resources, for refugees.\\n\\nMearing: Refugees, or troops of soldiers, weapons, maybe bombs! A means of an instant strike! That\\'s its military function, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nSentinel Prime: It is our technology and it must be returned.\\n\\nMearing: Yes. If humans say so! You can\\'t just bring weapons of mass destruction into our atmosphere! Kind of have to clear customs first. A little formality called paperwork, kind of separates us from the animals.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: I will overlook your condescending tone if you heed the gravity of mine. The Decepticons must never know the Space Bridge is here. For in their hands, it would mean the end of your world.\\n\\nMearing: \\'Total Nightmare\\' file. So, the investigation is open. We\\'ve sent agents to your office. And for the time being we\\'re gonna send you home with Autobot protection.\\n\\nSam: Uh, who do I- who do I need to speak to to get you guys to understand that I can help, that I can contribute?\\n\\nBrains: Hey, we can all help. Want to tell you what I know? I could tell you about the solar system, all the fun planets to hang out in.\\n\\nMearing: Get off my desk, please.\\n\\nBrains: Oh. You pulling out guns? Oh, can\\'t help you out now. She angry.\\n\\nMearing: Oh my God.\\n\\nSam: What do you envision for me? I go home now? I go back to work? I make copies? I mean-\\n\\nMearing: This is a unit for veteran intelligence officers and Special Forces, not for boys who once owned special cars.\\n\\nCarly: That\\'s a bit harsh isn\\'t it, ma\\'am?\\n\\nMearing: Don\\'t call me ma\\'am. I\\'m not a ma\\'am.\\n\\nCarly: Well, you\\'re a woman aren\\'t you?\\n\\nSam: So-o-o, are those yours?\\n\\nMearing: Yeah. CIA.\\n\\nSam: I only ask \\'cause I also have a medal, from the President.\\n\\nMearing: Yeah. Great. So, it\\'s not that complicated, right? No one gets to work with the Autobots unless I approve it. You\\'re breaking my chain of command.\\n\\nCarly: Come on, let\\'s go. You\\'ve done what you came for.\\n\\nMearing: With all due respect, young man, I appreciate what you did. But you\\'re not a soldier. You\\'re a messenger. You\\'ve always been a messenger.\\n\\nCarly: He\\'s a hero.\\n\\nSam: Bee, you take the freight elevator. I\\'ll see you up there.\\n\\nWheelie: Eh, this blows. That lady officially kicked us out.\\n\\nBrains: Yeah. Witness protection program sucks.\\n\\nWheelie: Yeah, but we\\'re a whole lot safer with big yellow and his cannons, \\'cause that dog can\\'t protect crap.\\n\\nBumblebee: {whistling noises}\\n\\nSam: Bee? You miss hanging out?\\n\\nBumblebee: {whistling noises}\\n\\nSam: Yeah, me, too.\\n\\nBumblebee: {whistling noises}\\n\\nSam: That woman, she called me a messenger. Can you believe that? After everything I\\'ve done, I\\'m a messenger.\\n\\nWheelie: Oh, I believe it. I tell you, Sammy, we feel the same way. The disrespect on this rock is criminal.\\n\\nSam: We should do something about it.\\n\\nBumblebee: {whistling noises}\\n\\nSam: Bee, I need to know why they\\'re killing humans. I say we call in the expert.\\n\\nBill O\\'Reilly: My next guest is a former American intelligence operative who has dared to speak out regarding our alleged military alliance with what many describe as a group of extraterrestrial mercenaries. He is the author of the bestselling book, Code-Name Hero. Former special agent, Seymour Simmons\\n\\nSimmons: Bill. Big fan. Great to be here.\\n\\nBill O\\'Reilly: Now Agent Simmons, you would have us believe that it is in our best interest to formally take sides in this so-called alien civil war?\\n\\nSimmons: Well, the other side wanted to spank us for breakfast, so I wouldn\\'t exactly call it a toss-up. These Decepticons are lethal.\\n\\nBill O\\'Reilly: But polls show half the world would feel safer with the Autobots completely gone. Get them out of here! We don\\'t need them here!\\n\\nSimmons: I feel safer when I sleep with a hand grenade. Doesn\\'t mean I\\'m always right.\\n\\nBill O\\'Reilly: Now, agent, here at the Factor we have obtained documents that show you were fired by the intelligence committee-\\n\\nSimmons: Chaz, I\\'m doing an interview.\\n\\nChaz: Sorry, Mr. Simmons.\\n\\nSimmons: Downsized, Bill. Budget cuts. Chaz, out.\\n\\nBill O\\'Reily: Your psych evaluation reports severe delusional tendencies!\\n\\nSimmons: This is ambush journalism.\\n\\nBill O\\'Reilly: Look, I\\'m not-\\n\\nSimmons: You want the truth about the alien alliance? Buy my book! Buy my book! Before it\\'s too late, people! You want a piece of me, Bill? You want to get naked? I\\'m ready!\\n\\nSam: Wow.\\n\\nSimmons: Interview is over! You, out- of- my- house.\\n\\nBill O\\'Reilly: You\\'re sounding like a pinhead, agent. And I\\'ve got a suggestion for you...\\n\\nSimmons: It\\'s over! Understand?\\n\\nBill O\\'Reilly: Damage control.\\n\\nSimmons: Dutch!\\n\\nDutch: You have obviously upset Mr Simmons. You have twenty-three seconds to leave the property, I have called the police. You are peasant people throwing rocks at a giant!\\n\\nSimmons: What\\'s up next? What have we got?\\n\\nDutch: Book signing, Midtown, noon. Then we pitch your reality show to the Discovery Channel. And I have this, um- um- Vitvicky, who keeps calling me, five times today.\\n\\nSimmons: Kid? What does he want?\\n\\nSam: I called you because the Decepticons are back. I want to know why, and I need your help.\\n\\nSimmons: They\\'re back? Well, that\\'s good for business.\\n\\nSam: What if I told you I know a fifty year old alien secret that nobody ever told you?\\n\\nSimmons: Do not tempt... my addiction. I have gone through withdrawal, kid. Dutch! is this line secure?\\n\\nDutch: No.\\n\\nSimmons: Don\\'t take the risk. I\\'m rich, why should I? Do not. Relapse. I won\\'t. Do not let the demons win.\\n\\nDutch: Got it.\\n\\nSimmons: What kind of... secret?\\n\\nSam: Apollo. Moon. Aliens. Cover-up. Future tech. Assassinations. That kind of stuff.\\n\\nSimmons: Ohh, Apollo...\\n\\nSimmons: Dutch!\\n\\nSimmons: Tell Megatron... let\\'s tango.\\n\\nAct Eleven:\\n\\nSentinel Prime: So majestic and peaceful, this planet. Unlike the final days of Cybertron.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: I\\'ve wondered what might have been, if you had fought the final battle, instead of me.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: Never mourn the past, young warrior. Thanks to you... our race survives.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: You were our leader, Sentinel. It is your right to lead us again.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: In a world I do not know. I am no longer your teacher, Optimus. You are mine.\\n\\nAct Twelve:\\n\\nSimmons: You\\'ve got to break this case down. What we have here is an astronaut epidemic. MIA. Dead. Died in a car accident. Killed. DOA. Car death. It\\'s like these guys can\\'t drive. They can fly into outer space, but they can\\'t drive a car.\\n\\nBrazos: Procured your information, Witwicky.\\n\\nSam: Thank you, Bruce.\\n\\nBrazos: Now...would you let me see one right now. One time.\\n\\nSam: Quick.\\n\\nBrazos: Very.\\n\\nSam: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. It says NASA launched it in 2009. See, forensics show Wang may have messed with the code, preventing it from mapping the far side of the moon, which is also the dark side.\\n\\nBumblebee: {whistling noises}\\n\\nBrazos: F*cking awesome.\\n\\nSimmons: They infiltrate us, intimidate us, coerce us to do their dirty work. And once they\\'re done, kadoosh. A double-tap to the cerebellum.\\n\\nSam: So humans are working for the Decepticons.\\n\\nSimmons: I don\\'t think this is about the Decepticons looking for something on the moon. I think it\\'s about something... they wanted to hide.\\n\\nBrazos: Come to Daddy. Come on, throw down. Ya! Ha!\\n\\nBumblebee: {Did you eat a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?}\\n\\nSimmons: He\\'s a freak.\\n\\nBrazos: Ha! Like it?\\n\\nBumblebee: {Get back!}\\n\\nBrazos: [laughing] I\\'m ticklish! [laughing]\\n\\nSimmons: Sir! We are having a pretty high-level alien intel confab here, that I don\\'t think you\\'re cleared for, errand boy.\\n\\nBrazos: Yeah, you\\'re right. It\\'s a bitching robot.\\n\\nSam: I think it\\'s time to go, Bruce.\\n\\nBrazos: Thank you so much for this. And-\\n\\nSam: Got to go, Bruce.\\n\\nBrains: Hey, I\\'m smoking over here. Downloaded missing Russian cosmonauts. Turns out the Soviets canceled a manned mission to the moon. The moon! In 1972. And two of their cosmonauts went into hiding in America. And I just found them alive!\\n\\nWheelie: You\\'re a genius, Brains.\\n\\nBumblebee: {whistling noises, surprised noises}\\n\\nBrains: Oh, that was smooth, Bumblebee.\\n\\nBumblebee: {Missed it by... that much.}\\n\\nSam: Hi.\\n\\nCarly: Would somebody care to tell me what the hell\\'s going on?\\n\\nSimmons: Who are you?\\n\\nCarly: Who are you?\\n\\nSimmons: Who am I? Who is that? Dutch! Frisk her!\\n\\nDutch: Certainly.\\n\\nSam: No, no. Dutch, uh-\\n\\nCarly: Don\\'t touch me.\\n\\nDutch: I\\'m not gonna touch her.\\n\\nCarly: Sam?\\n\\nSam: Angel. Uh. I was working. I\\'m sorry about this.\\n\\nWheelie: Great! We\\'re homeless.\\n\\nSimmons: She lives here? Wow. You had your chance to frisk her.\\n\\nDutch: I have a girlfriend.\\n\\nSimmons: Really? What\\'s her name?\\n\\nDutch: India.\\n\\nCarly: We\\'re supposed to be at Dylan\\'s party, remember?\\n\\nSam: I do remember, but these are my friends. They need me. I have to be here right now.\\n\\nCarly: So, what, the Autobots and the military, they can\\'t handle this on their own? You know what I liked about your war stories, Sam? It\\'s that they were stories, they were in the past.\\n\\nSam: Look, I know you\\'re thinking about your brother, okay? And you\\'re thinking about your family. And it\\'s not that situation.\\n\\nCarly: No?\\n\\nSam: No.\\n\\nCarly: Why not? Why isn\\'t it, Sam? You think we\\'d rather have his medals, or we\\'d rather have him?\\n\\nSam: I hear you. I get it. Where are you taking my bunny? Stop! Just stop for a second.\\n\\nCarly: You think I could sleep last night? And then it hit me. No, Sam wants to be in danger! He doesn\\'t know who he is without it.\\n\\nSam: I just want to matter.\\n\\nCarly: You matter to me.\\n\\nSam: I know you\\'re worried. I know you\\'re worried. But I promise you, I can- I can handle this.\\n\\nCarly: Can you? You can promise it?\\n\\nSam: I promise.\\n\\nCarly: Sam, I don\\'t want to lose you and I know where this leads. I\\'m not ready for this. Are you coming with me?\\n\\nSam: I can\\'t.\\n\\nCarly: Okay.\\n\\nSam: Hey.\\n\\nCarly: Here\\'s your foot.\\n\\nSimmons: The warrior\\'s path is a solitary one... how the hell did she afford that car?\\n\\nSam: Her boss.\\n\\nSimmons: Rich bastards! I used to hate them. Now, it\\'s-\\n\\nSimmons: Going to a gig on the hunt for two Russian cosmonauts. Nothing like driving in a Maybach, eh? Germans know how to make cars, let me tell you.\\n\\nSimmons:My Dutchman, former NSA cybersleuth extraordinaire, tracked them down.. here. So, these cosmonauts went into hiding. Why?\\n\\nDutch: Bingo. I got a match.\\n\\nSimmons: You\\'re a German Shepherd, Dutch. The thing about Russians is, they never like to talk. It\\'s gonna take a little of the international language.\\n\\nSimmons: Do svidaniya.\\n\\nBouncer: That means good-bye.\\n\\nSimmons: Watch this. [Hands money, speaks in Russian]\\n\\nBouncer: [Speaks in Russian]\\n\\nDimitri: [Speaks in Russian]\\n\\nYuri: Stay loose. [Speaks in Russian]\\n\\nSimmons: Dutch, give me something tough.\\n\\nDutch: Ah.. B- baryshnikov.\\n\\nDimitri: We do speak English.\\n\\nSimmons: Dutch, you suck.\\n\\nDutch: It\\'s a Cyrillic alphabet! It\\'s like all the buttons you never push on a calculator!\\n\\nRussians: [laughing]\\n\\nDutch: I don\\'t suck.\\n\\nSimmons: Agent Seymour Simmons, Sector Eight, formerly Seven. We know who you are, cosmonautchiks.\\n\\nYuri: So what?\\n\\nSimmons: You were supposed to travel to the dark side of the moon, then... Tch, it all got shut down. The question is, why?\\n\\nRussian Woman: [speaks in Russian]\\n\\nDutch: Can my child smoke in here?\\n\\nBartender: [speaks in Russian]\\n\\nRussian Woman: [speaks in Russian]\\n\\nDutch: [growls]\\n\\nSam: Ah- okay, all right, okay.\\n\\nSimmons: Go ahead, shoot me.\\n\\nSimmons: I\\'m willing to die for my country. Are you?\\n\\nRussian Woman: [speaks in Russian]\\n\\nSimmons: Really?\\n\\nRussian Woman: [speaks in Russian]\\n\\nBartender: [shouts in Russian]\\n\\nSimmons: You are beautiful. Has anyone ever told you you\\'re beautiful?\\n\\nRussian Woman: [speaks in Russian]\\n\\nSimmons: She\\'s a beautiful woman.\\n\\nBartender: [shouts in Russian]\\n\\nDutch: Hyaah! [Grunts]\\n\\nBartender: [screams]\\n\\nSimmons: Whoa! Hey!\\n\\nDutch: [panting]\\n\\nSimmons: Dutch! Back in the cage.\\n\\nDutch: Hyaaaah!\\n\\nSam: Whoa-\\n\\nOther people in the bar: [screaming]\\n\\nSimmons: Dutch! Hold, Dutch, hold!\\n\\nSam: Control your boy, please! Control your boy.\\n\\nSimmons: Dutch, schtop! Ich-ku-klav-kush-kash-stooop!\\n\\nDutch: I\\'m so sorry... That is the old me.\\n\\nSimmons: Okay, let\\'s everybody just calm down, let\\'s lower the heat, lower the guns, let\\'s relax. World War Two is over.\\n\\nDimitri: You are about to see one of the biggest Soviet secrets. America first to send man to the moon. But USSR first to send camera. In 1959, our Luna Three take picture of the... dark, the shadow side. Sees nothing. But in 1963, Luna Four sees-\\n\\nYuri: Strange rocks.\\n\\nDimitri: Yeah.\\n\\nYuri: Around the ship. Hundreds of them.\\n\\nDimitri: Yeah, show picture.\\n\\nYuri: With some... drag marks.\\n\\nSam: I\\'ve seen these. These aren\\'t rocks, these are pillars. Alien pillars for a space bridge. We know about them because the Autobots have five of these.\\n\\nSimmons: Decepticons must have raided the ship before Apollo Eleven ever got there, took the pillars, and hid them.\\n\\nSam: It doesn\\'t make sense. The Decepticons have the ship. They have all those pillars. Why would they leave Sentinel when he\\'s the only one who can use them?\\n\\nSimmons: Unless...\\n\\nSam: He\\'s the one thing they still need.\\n\\nSam: We\\'ve got to meet up with Sentinel, rendezvous with him and keep him safe.\\n\\nAct Thirteen:\\n\\nSam: Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel. Optimus is ten minutes behind. We\\'re coming to NEST now.\\n\\nMearing: Mr Witwicky, I thought I made it clear to you that I did not want you calling this phone.\\n\\nSam: Listen, the whole thing has been a setup since the beginning. The Decepticons wanted Optimus to find Sentinel because only Optimus could revive him.\\n\\nMearing: But we have the space bridge.\\n\\nSam: Mearing, you have five pillars. I just learned that they have hundreds. You\\'re doing exactly what they wanted you to do. What do you need me to say to you? The Decepticons are coming for Sentinel Prime!\\n\\nMearing: We\\'re going to NEST.\\n\\nNEST Announcer: We have an Energon alert. Energon readings detected on the D. C. Parkway.\\n\\nNEST Analyst: Currently tracking. Three black Suburbans.\\n\\nCrowbar: [roaring]\\n\\nSimmons: Whoa! Nooooo!\\n\\nDreads: [growling]\\n\\nSam: Bee, you got to get Sentinel out of here! You got to guard him!\\n\\nDreads: [growling]\\n\\nDutch: Oh my god I\\'m fired!\\n\\nHatchet: [roaring]\\n\\nSam: Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!\\n\\nHatchet: [roar]\\n\\nHatchet: [pained growl]\\n\\nDino: Got you! Ah ha ha ha!\\n\\nSam: Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him, Bee!\\n\\nHatchet: [growling]\\n\\nSam: Bee, you\\'ve got to move faster! Faster, Bee! Go!\\n\\nSam: Bee! Move- [lots and lots of screaming] All right, back to NEST!\\n\\nSideswipe: Dino, I got him!\\n\\nSam: Ironhide!\\n\\nCrowbar: [pained growling]\\n\\nCrankcase: [growling]\\n\\nCrowbar: [speaks in Cybertronian]\\n\\nIronhide: Is there a... problem?\\n\\nSideswipe: Whoa. Little Mexican standoff we got here.\\n\\nIronhide: Weapons down.\\n\\nSideswipe: And we\\'ll let you escape with your dignity.\\n\\nCrankcase: [speaks in Cybertronian]\\n\\nCrowbar: [speaks in Cybertronian]\\n\\nIronhide: Drop them... That\\'s good.\\n\\nCrowbar: [growl]\\n\\nSideswipe: Ironhide, watch out!\\n\\nIronhide: Yaah!\\n\\nSideswipe: [grunting] Ironhide, catch!\\n\\nCrowbar: [roaring]\\n\\nSideswipe: Behind you!\\n\\nCrankcase: [growling, spluttering]\\n\\nIronhide: Decepticon punk.\\n\\nIronhide: Class dismissed.\\n\\nLennox: Get inside! Let\\'s go!\\n\\nNEST Guard: Move! Keep moving!\\n\\nSam: Lennox!\\n\\nLennox: Go go go go go.\\n\\nSam: We got Decepticons everywhere.\\n\\nLennox: I\\'ve got my whole team deployed looking for them. Ironhide! Protect Sentinel. Get him locked up inside.\\n\\nIronhide: Consider it done!\\n\\nSam: Hey, you\\'ve got to guard him, \\'cause he\\'s the key to the whole thing.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: Indeed I am. What you must realize, my Autobot brothers, is we were never going to win the war. For the sake of our planet\\'s survival, a deal had to be made... with Megatron.\\n\\nIronhide: [grunting]\\n\\nLennox: Get back!\\n\\nIronhide: What have you- done-\\n\\nSentinel Prime: I hereby discharge you from duty.\\n\\nIronhide: No-\\n\\nBumblebee: [whistling noises]\\n\\nNEST Troops: Get back! Get back!\\n\\nSam: Bee!\\n\\nLennox: Get back!\\n\\nBumblebee: [whistling noises]\\n\\nNEST Troops: [screaming]\\n\\nSam: Whoa!\\n\\nLennox: Rally all NEST forces back to the base! Come on! Come on!\\n\\nIronhide: [groaning]\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Get a medic down here!\\n\\nLennox: All right, we don\\'t have enough men! Do not engage Sentinel!\\n\\nMearing: Just go to the back gate.\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Take cover!\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Watch left! Watch left!\\n\\nMearing: Let\\'s go! Follow me!\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Oh- hell no-\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Fall back!\\n\\nMearing\\'s Bodyguard: Director, don\\'t go there!\\n\\nMearing: Stand down! Hey, Sentinel!\\n\\nMearing\\'s Bodyguard: Director!\\n\\nMearing: What is going on? What do you think you are doing?\\n\\nSentinel Prime: I am a Prime! I do not take orders from you.\\n\\nLennox: Director Mearing, come on. We cannot fight him. Let\\'s go. We have to go.\\n\\nNEST Soldiers: Fall back fall back!\\n\\nSentinel Prime: Now! Return what belongs to me!\\n\\nMearing: Ohhh... my God!\\n\\nLennox: Move!\\n\\nNEST Soldier: You guys okay?\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Is everybody out? Is everybody out?\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Everybody, stay calm. You\\'re gonna be fine.\\n\\nMearing: Yeah, take a look, Optimus! This is all on you!\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Sentinel hit the vault! Took the pillars.\\n\\nLennox: Come on, let\\'s go. All right, notify the 101st Airborne! We need to hunt this thing down!\\n\\nAct Fourteen:\\n\\nSam: [panting] Carly!\\n\\nRon: Hot from our little campfire.\\n\\nJudy: Aww.\\n\\nRon: S\\'mores. Isn\\'t that great? We were really living off the land.\\n\\nSam: Mom, Dad, have you guys seen Carly come home yet?\\n\\nJudy: Excuse me. Can you knock, please? This is our bedroom.\\n\\nRon: Why wouldn\\'t she be at home?\\n\\nSam: We had a fight and- we m- might have broken up, or be on a break. I don\\'t really know.\\n\\nJudy: What? No.\\n\\nSam: Look, I can\\'t- I just can\\'t- talk about it right now-\\n\\nJudy: You\\'ve got to be kidding me.\\n\\nSam: I can\\'t go into details, Mom. I have to find her.\\n\\nJudy: Sit down! We\\'re having a family meeting. Family meeting! You may not know this, but your father and I were not always this perfectly happy. You know, there was a time in our marriage when I thought this was not gonna work out. I just can\\'t understand-\\n\\nSam: Can we please not?\\n\\nRon: She\\'s damaging him.\\n\\nJudy: You break up with one world-class hottie-\\n\\nSam: No. Stop. Stop, okay?\\n\\nJudy: Yeah.\\n\\nSam: She dumped me, I moved on to something better. That\\'s it. I\\'m a happier person.\\n\\nJudy: The second beautiful girl, and you lose her-\\n\\nSam: Why don\\'t you help me?\\n\\nRon: They had an argument.\\n\\nJudy: You\\'re a good looking kid, and-\\n\\nSam: One fight.\\n\\nJudy: You\\'re not gonna get a third one, I mean, unless you have like a, big-\\n\\nSam: What the f- Mom, mom, mom!\\n\\nJudy: Maybe it\\'s something else. Maybe you just don\\'t know what you\\'re doing.\\n\\nSam: [fake coughing] I don\\'t want to talk about this anymore.\\n\\nJudy: You need the book.\\n\\nRon: You\\'re always wrong. Get used to it.\\n\\nJudy: Tell him about the book. Okay. This. You\\'ve gotta read this. \\'She Comes First.\\' There\\'s some killer shit in here.\\n\\nSam: No. No. No.\\n\\nRon: Oh. That\\'s it, I\\'m going.\\n\\nSam: No. No! No!\\n\\nJudy: Sit down! Sit down! Back me up!\\n\\nRon: Happy wife happy life.\\n\\nJudy: Heck yeah.\\n\\nRon: Unhappy wife, stone-cold misery for the rest of your-\\n\\nJudy: Stop.\\n\\nRon: It\\'s true.\\n\\nJudy: All I\\'m saying is, do you love this girl?\\n\\nSam: She\\'s the one.\\n\\nJudy: Then you gotta go get her. I mean, your dad and I, when we had troubles, he moved heaven and earth to find me. Look at- Say what you said. Say it.\\n\\nRon: I will follow you to the end of time. Does that suck or what?\\n\\nJudy: No, it\\'s so sweet.\\n\\nRon: It\\'s like a bad sci-fi film.\\n\\nSam: I want you to get out of the city. You guys get as far away from here as you can. You understand? I love you.\\n\\nAct Fifteen:\\n\\nIgor: [slobbering]\\n\\nStarscream: Ah... My master! Such a brilliant scheme! So when Sentinel left Cybertron, it was to defect?\\n\\nMegatron: He was meant to rendezvous with me here on Earth before fate waylaid us both. The only way to revive him... we needed Prime and his Matrix.\\n\\nStarscream: Excellent strategy.\\n\\nMegatron: [growl]\\n\\nIgor: Mine, mine! [chuckling]\\n\\nStarscream: So he is now your partner, master?\\n\\nMegatron: He is my greatest triumph.\\n\\nStarscream: So impressive.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: Commencing transport.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Stop! No, no Sentinel!\\n\\nSentinel Prime: Forgive me.\\n\\nMegatron: Here we are. Fight us now.\\n\\nDecepticon Troops: [lots of growling]\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Contact! Watch out! Move it! Move it!\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Autobots, retreat!\\n\\nHumans: [screaming]\\n\\nOptimus Prime: [grunting]\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Nggah! Why, Sentinel? Why?\\n\\nSentinel Prime: For Cybertron! For our home! What war destroyed, we can rebuild! But only if we join with the Decepticons.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: No, it\\'s not the only way! This is our home! We must defend the humans!\\n\\nSentinel Prime: So lost you are, Optimus. On Cybertron, we were gods. And here... they call us machines. Let the humans serve us, or perish! You\\'re lucky I didn\\'t kill you. In time, you\\'ll see.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: It\\'s not over.\\n\\nAct Sixteen:\\n\\nDylan: Now, if I were him, I wouldn\\'t let you out of my sight for one second.\\n\\nCarly: [chuckling]\\n\\nSam: It\\'s funny. I was just thinking on the way over here, I could really use some advice from Dylan, and there he is. Can I speak to you, Carly?\\n\\nDylan: Welcome, please, sit down. Have a drink.\\n\\nSam: You know what, I don\\'t need a drink. Or a car, or a job. I just need to speak to my girlfriend alone. Is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?\\n\\nCarly: Excuse me.\\n\\nCarly: What\\'s going on?\\n\\nSam: I\\'ll tell you outside.\\n\\nDylan: I really think I can help you, Sam. I remember a talk I had with my dad once about tough choices.\\n\\nSam: Yeah, now\\'s not the time. We\\'ll set something up, though.\\n\\nDylan: Of course, it was way back, when my dad\\'s firm was in charge of budget review and accounting for NASA. You see, the thing that he taught me was, when it\\'s not your war, you join the side that\\'s going to win.\\n\\nSam: Move.\\n\\nDylan: Too direct? Or is it just me?\\n\\nWoman: Certainly not you, sir.\\n\\nSam and Carly: [screaming]\\n\\nSoundwave: [growling]\\n\\nCarly: [screaming]\\n\\nSoundwave: You\\'re mine!\\n\\nSam: Nooo!\\n\\nSoundwave: [growling]\\n\\nSam: Get help.\\n\\nCarly: Sam, I can\\'t get out!\\n\\nSam: Someone get help!\\n\\nDylan: Good night.\\n\\nWoman: Good night, Mr Dylan.\\n\\nCarly: Get me out of here!\\n\\nLaserbeak: [screeching]\\n\\nSam: Help! Get help!\\n\\nMan: He is young. He will learn. Good night.\\n\\nCarly: Get me out!\\n\\nDylan: It was a fun night.\\n\\nDylan: You really think you\\'re the first man ever asked to join the noble alien cause?\\n\\nSam: Who are you?\\n\\nDylan: Do you know why we\\'ve not been back to the moon since 1972? Because these two-\\n\\nLaserbeak: [screeching]\\n\\nDylan: -They came to my dad and they told him to do some creative accounting. Make it way too expensive to ever go back. So he and the others shut down the American and Russian space programs. And they\\'ve been our clients ever since.\\n\\nSam: You helped them kill people?\\n\\nDylan: You think they\\'d give you a choice? Besides, it\\'s not like I personally participated. I am a liaison. I liaise.\\n\\nSam: [grunting]\\n\\nDylan: It\\'s hostile takeover time, Sam.\\n\\nCarly: [whimpering] Sam- Sam! Sam!\\n\\nSam: Let her go!\\n\\nCarly: Sam!\\n\\nDylan: I\\'ve had my eye on you for years, Sam. You\\'re the one spy I\\'ve never been able to provide as someone close to the Autobots.\\n\\nSam: [spits]\\n\\nCarly: Sam! Don\\'t do what he wants!\\n\\nDylan: Yes, he will. They all do.\\n\\nSam: [grunting]\\n\\nDylan: They will slaughter her, you understand me? In the time it takes you to blink, they\\'ll do it to her and they\\'ll do it to me. So you show a little respect! When someone offers you! A job! Wrist.\\n\\nSam: [grunt]\\n\\nDylan: You are to track down Optimus Prime, because you\\'re the one human he trusts, and you will ask one question. How does he intend to fight back? Strategies, tactics, everything!\\n\\nWatch Decepticon: [screeching]\\n\\nSam: Unnngggh!\\n\\nDylan: Has a nasty little bite, doesn\\'t it? It\\'s very high-tech. It lets us see what you see, hear what you hear and it taps your nervous system. So, if you so much as try and signal-\\n\\nSam: [grunting]\\n\\nDylan: Mm. I don\\'t know what to tell you, Sam. Relationships have consequences. I am here because of my father. She is here because of you.\\n\\nCarly: Hh. Hh-\\n\\nSam: Stop, stop! Stop! Stop!\\n\\nDylan: Soundwave, would you please? Sam, do your job. She\\'ll be safe. I give you my word.\\n\\nSam: [panting] I\\'ll kill you. You have my word.\\n\\nAct Seventeen:\\n\\nMorshower: Combatant Commands are now at DEFCON 1.\\n\\nGeneral: Approximately 200 Decepticons are now in hiding. Energon detectors have been triggered as far away as South America and China.\\n\\nMorshower\\'s Aide: The U. N. Just received an encrypted audio file. They say it\\'s from the leader of the Autobots.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: Defenders of Earth. We have come for your natural resources to rebuild our damaged planet. When we have transported all we need, we will leave your world in peace. For such peace to exist, you must immediately exile the Autobot rebels you have harboured. Nonnegotiable. Renounce the rebels. We await your reply.\\n\\nMearing: We\\'ll debrief you in transit.\\n\\nSam: Yeah, I really don\\'t see how I can be of any help. I mean, you guys seem pretty busy. We could just do this another time, I think. Ow!\\n\\nMearing: I have underestimated you at every turn.\\n\\nSam: What- what?\\n\\nMearing: You warned us that they were using humans. And you knew that Sentinel was the key.\\n\\nAnalyst: Director!\\n\\nSam: Who am I? Hey, you\\'re the expert. I\\'m just a walking security risk- ah- ah!\\n\\nMearing: Are you all right?\\n\\nSam: [grunting] Yes.\\n\\nMearing: No, you\\'re not. You\\'re sweating.\\n\\nSam: I\\'m, I\\'m fine. I\\'m fine. I\\'m sweating because I\\'m nervous. I\\'m nervous because you got me in here with this information. Okay, I\\'m a Twitter junkie. I blog everything. I can\\'t keep a secret to save my life.\\n\\nMearing: Oh, you wouldn\\'t dare.\\n\\nSam: That\\'s the truth. I\\'m telling you.\\n\\nMearing\\'s Aide: Director, the Pentagon\\'s calling in fifteen.\\n\\nAnalyst: What are you doing?\\n\\nSam: Nothing. What are you doing?\\n\\nAnalyst: Get away from me.\\n\\nFemale Newscaster: It\\'s been a remarkable series of events today at the Capitol. Just moments ago, legislation was passed to exile the Autobots from American shores. The U. S. Military alliance with them is officially over. In the words of the House Majority Leader-\\n\\nMearing: Yeah.\\n\\nFemale Newscaster: the sponsor of today\\'s resolution, we cannot in good conscience invite-\\n\\nMearing: Okay.\\n\\nSam: What? They can\\'t do this. You gotta tell them. They can\\'t do that.\\n\\nMearing: Okay. It\\'s official. It\\'s a go, people.\\n\\nSam: These are our allies. The Autobots fought for us. They fought with us.\\n\\nMearing: And where are we now? Facing an enemy invasion with an enemy that has the means to deploy countless more.\\n\\nMearing: If there is any more you know, anything at all about the enemy\\'s intentions, now is the time to tell.\\n\\nSam: Autobots have no way of leaving this planet.\\n\\nMearing: And that is where you\\'re wrong.\\n\\nMearing: Its name is the Xantium. It brought the second wave of Autobots, and it\\'s been under NASA \\'s care and study ever since. We linked it with a decommissioned shuttle to maintain military control until they\\'re gone.\\n\\nLeadfoot: Gonna be ten thousand pounds of torque on that itsy-bitsy bolt, not nineteen!\\n\\nRoadbuster: You\\'re gonna risk the lives of all me mates! I\\'ll ball ya! You, there- [speech obscured by Mearing]\\n\\nMearing: These guys are the Wreckers. They take care of the Xantium. We don\\'t let them off the base much, \\'cause they\\'re assholes.\\n\\nRoadbuster: You gotta pull that, ya nancy wanker!\\n\\nLeadfoot: It\\'s time to kill him!\\n\\nTechnician: I\\'m just trying to help, you know. Just doing my job.\\n\\nLeadfoot: Ah, no.\\n\\nEpps: Just calm down. Leave him alone. This is a human being.\\n\\nSam: Epps!\\n\\nRoadbuster: You are ridiculous!\\n\\nSam: Is that you?\\n\\nEpps: What up, man?\\n\\nSam: What are you doing here?\\n\\nEpps: I retired from the Air Force. Can you let my hand go? What the hell was that? Now I just consult to run interference for them.\\n\\nLeadfoot: Well, you\\'re not helping!\\n\\nEpps: No more combat and aliens shooting at my ass. I got a dream job.\\n\\nRoadbuster: Time to get off this planet.\\n\\nLeadfoot: Preflight checks are go.\\n\\nEpps: Kicking the Autobots out. Can you believe this is happening?\\n\\nSam: Where do you think it\\'s taking them?\\n\\nEpps: Any planet but here.\\n\\nSimmons: I wanna talk to whoever\\'s in charge here! Well, well, well. Charlotte Mearing.\\n\\nMearing: Agent Simmons. Former Agent Simmons. So. I see you survived Washington.\\n\\nSimmons: Washington, Egypt, heartbreak. I survive. I will survive. They\\'re bringing everybody in, kid. Putting all the intel on the table. And if you think deporting nine Autobots is gonna solve a damn thing-\\n\\nMearing: It\\'s out of my hands.\\n\\nSimmons: Moving up in the world, huh? Your booty looks excellent.\\n\\nMearing: You ever say a word to anyone about what happened that night in Quantico, I\\'ll cut your heart out.\\n\\nSimmons: You already did.\\n\\nWheelie: Sammy, listen to me. Don\\'t let them exile us.\\n\\nBrains: Don\\'t let them take us, Sam.\\n\\nWheelie: It\\'s a Decepticon trap.\\n\\nLeadfoot: Check the nitrogen levels. We\\'re booking out of here.\\n\\nSam: Optimus?\\n\\nOptimus Prime: What your leaders say is true.\\n\\nQue: Aye.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: This was all my fault. I told them whom to trust. I... was so wrong.\\n\\nSam: That doesn\\'t make it your fault. It just makes you human for a change.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Remember this. You may lose your faith in us, but never in yourselves.\\n\\nSam: [soft grunting] I need to know how you\\'re gonna fight back. I know this is strategy, I know you\\'re... you\\'re coming back with reinforcements, something, I know there\\'s a plan. You can tell me. No other human will ever know.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: There is no plan.\\n\\nSam: If we just do what they want, how are we gonna live with ourselves?\\n\\nOptimus Prime: You are my friend, Sam. You always will be. But your leaders have spoken. From here, the fight will be your own.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Make it short. We\\'re loading up.\\n\\nLeadfoot: All right, hustle up! We launchin\\' at dawn.\\n\\nBumblebee: {We\\'re gonna do whatever we can. Make it like it was. You will always be my friend, Sam. I gotta be going on.}\\n\\nSam: [sobbing]\\n\\nSimmons: Years from now, they\\'re gonna ask us. Where were you when they took over the planet? We\\'re gonna say, we just stood by and watched.\\n\\n6:30 AM\\n\\nDylan: You should really look at this as a partnership. You have to stand on the side of progress if you wanna be a part of history.\\n\\nLaunch Announcer: [indistinct words] Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.\\n\\nLaunch Announcer: Go ahead and throttle up. First flight [indistinct words] status-\\n\\nSam: You wanted an answer. You got one.\\n\\nDylan: I always get what I want, Sam. We just needed to be sure.\\n\\nSam: Sure of what?\\n\\nDylan: That they would go without a fight.\\n\\nStarscream: [speaks in Cybertronian] It\\'s begun.\\n\\nLaunch Announcer: Say again.\\n\\nAnalyst: We\\'re tracking an incoming object.\\n\\nSam: [grunting] Ah!\\n\\nDylan: We all work for the Decepticons now.\\n\\nChicago, Illinois\\n\\nSam: I need your help to track a phone call. There\\'s a man on this phone. He\\'s the head of their human operations and he has Carly hostage.\\n\\nDylan: I want you to sit down. Don\\'t move.\\n\\nDylan: Follow me. I\\'m watching him drive up right now.\\n\\nDutch: The call was placed en route. I\\'m hacking into the phone\\'s camera now. There, that\\'s it. That\\'s a live stream from the camera. Someplace, right, hold on, I can triangulate this. Okay, it\\'s Chicago cell sites. There, I\\'ve got it. Trump Tower, Chicago. Lower penthouse.\\n\\nDylan: We\\'re on.\\n\\nSam: I\\'m going.\\n\\nSimmons: You sure?\\n\\nSam: She\\'s done nothing but try to help me, and I can be there in fifteen hours.\\n\\nEpps: You\\'re not going alone.\\n\\nEpps: I still got my NEST friends out there. I\\'ll round them up, we\\'ll find your girlfriend, we\\'re gonna bring this guy in.\\n\\nSam: Why are you helping me?\\n\\nEpps: \\'Cause that asshole killed my friends, too.\\n\\nCarly: They said they were here for our resources, to rebuild their planet.\\n\\nDylan: Yes, but really one resource in particular. One unique to our planet.\\n\\nCarly: Us?\\n\\nDylan: You\\'re very smart. You see, they can\\'t rebuild without a slave labor force. How many rocks up there in the universe offer six billion workers?\\n\\nCarly: What are you talking about? We can\\'t transport people.\\n\\nDylan: They\\'re not shipping people. They\\'re shipping their planet here.\\n\\nCarly: Oh. Oh my God... what\\'s Sentinel doing here?\\n\\nDylan: Watch. They\\'re spreading hundreds of pillars around the globe right now. In just a few hours, they\\'re gonna launch them into orbit and bring Cybertron into our atmosphere. The red one there controls the rest. He triggers that, it starts the whole thing.\\n\\nMegatron: Begone, insect operatives. Your work is done.\\n\\nDylan: Your Excellency... He\\'s such a dick.\\n\\nPolicemen: [shouting]\\n\\nCarly: You want this to happen?\\n\\nDylan: I want to survive. I want forty more years. You think I asked for this? I inherited a client.\\n\\nCarly: Yeah, and when Cybertron\\'s here and we\\'re all their slaves, I guess they\\'ll still need a human leader.\\n\\nDylan: Don\\'t jinx me. You want to survive, you listen to me.\\n\\nPolicemen: [shouting]\\n\\nCivilians: [screaming]\\n\\nSentinel Prime: It is time for the slaves of Earth to recognize their masters. Seal off the city.\\n\\nHumans: [screaming]\\n\\nDylan: Get the dogs outta here now! Get them in the back!\\n\\nCarly: I guess they didn\\'t tell you about this part, did they?\\n\\nDylan: You think I\\'m at every meeting? Look, I\\'m safe. They said I was safe.\\n\\nAct Nineteen:\\n\\nSoldier: Let\\'s roll!\\n\\nEpps: We had a signal earlier. It\\'s not working.\\n\\nRadio: This is a national emergency broadcast.\\n\\nRadio: Chicago has suffered a massive attack.\\n\\nMan: Wrong way! Get out of here! Go back!\\n\\nGeneral: There is a ring of alien ships around Chicago.\\n\\nMorshower: Our high-range bombers were just knocked out of the sky. They can\\'t get through enemy air defenses over the city. Our satellites have been jammed. We have no way to monitor the enemy\\'s movement.\\n\\nLennox: Our old NEST teams are on stand-down holding at Grissom Air Force Base. We\\'re about ten minutes from the battle zone. We have Special Forces trying to gain access to the city, and infantry is staging at the perimeter.\\n\\nSimmons: Excuse me, excuse me, it just doesn\\'t make sense! Can\\'t we get any eyes in there at all?\\n\\nMearing: They keep shooting down our drones.\\n\\nMorshower: They want us blind. But we do have a couple of mini-drones we\\'re gonna try.\\n\\nSimmons: Well, whoever\\'s manning these UAV drones, can we try to redirect them toward Trump Tower? The kid Witwickety, was on his way to Chicago. Said some point-man human op is there, for the Decepticons! Listen, if I know anything, I know this, that kid is an alien bad news magnet.\\n\\nChildren: [shouting]\\n\\nSam: [panting]\\n\\nEpps: My God. We came here to find her in the middle of all that?\\n\\nStone: Are we really going out there, Epps?\\n\\nEddie: I\\'m not going in there.\\n\\nEpps: No one\\'s going in.\\n\\nSam: I am. With or without you, I\\'ll find her.\\n\\nEpps: You\\'re gonna get yourself killed, Sam. Is that what you want? Is that what you want? You came all the way out here to get yourself killed? Huh? Listen to what I\\'m saying.\\n\\nSam: She\\'s here because of me. Do you understand?\\n\\nEpps: Listen, if you go in this building, that\\'s if she\\'s even still alive, there\\'s no way you\\'re gonna be able to reach her!\\n\\nSam: What do you suggest I do?\\n\\nEpps: It\\'s over. I\\'m sorry, but it\\'s over.\\n\\nSam: No.\\n\\nEddie: Whoa whoa whoa! Incoming!\\n\\nHumans: [indistinct shouting]\\n\\nEpps and Sam: [grunting]\\n\\nDecepticon Pilot: [growling]\\n\\nOptimus Prime: We will kill them all.\\n\\nLeadfoot: Wreckers, kill it.\\n\\nRoadbuster: This is going to hurt! A lot!\\n\\nDecepticon Pilot: [growling]\\n\\nRoadbuster: Ah ha ha!\\n\\nOptimus Prime: Your leaders will now understand. Decepticons will never leave your planet alone. And we needed them to believe we had gone. For today, in the name of freedom, we take the battle to them!\\n\\nSam: I saw your ship blow up!\\n\\nRoadbuster: The ship. We were never in the ship! We designed the damn thing, didn\\'t we?\\n\\nLeadfoot: We were hidden in the first booster rocket to separate. Splashed down back in the Atlantic, just as planned. We ain\\'t going nowhere.\\n\\nBrains: Yeah, no one\\'s exiling us.\\n\\nWheelie: The Autobots are staying right here. We\\'re gonna help you win this war.\\n\\nOptimus Prime: They\\'re surrounding the city to make a fortress, so that no one can see what they\\'re up to inside. Our only chance is the element of surprise.\\n\\nSam: I think I know where to look!\\n\\nDrone controller: Mini-drone is on approach to Trump Tower.\\n\\nMearing: You\\'re telling me Sam\\'s headed into that?\\n\\nSimmons: Poor kid. Probably never got close.\\n\\nSam: So, you can fly this thing, right?\\n\\nBumblebee: [whistling radio noise]\\n\\nSam: What is that? What is that, what is that? So-so? So you so-so can fly this. That feels terrible.\\n\\nEpps: We\\'re right behind you.\\n\\nEpps: All right, we\\'re going in!\\n\\nMegatron: The city is secure. The humans cannot stop us.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: As the afternoon falls, the rest of the pillars will reach their launch position.\\n\\nMegatron: This is the victory I promised you so many years ago, where we rebuild Cybertron... together!\\n\\nSentinel Prime: I have deigned to work with you-\\n\\nMegatron: [grunting]\\n\\nSentinel Prime: -That our planet may survive! I will never work FOR you!\\n\\nMegatron: Ah!\\n\\nSentinel Prime: And you would be wise to remember the difference.\\n\\nDylan: Hah! I\\'m just so sick of this. I\\'m just sick of waiting.\\n\\nSam: Where is she? Where is she?!\\n\\nDylan: You\\'ve got some balls.\\n\\nLaserbeak: [screeching]\\n\\nSam: [screaming]\\n\\nCarly: No, Sam! No! No- no-\\n\\nSam: Carly! Carly!\\n\\nCarly: [grunting]\\n\\nSam: Jump!\\n\\nLaserbeak: [screeching]\\n\\nSam: [grunting]\\n\\nSam: Bee, fire!\\n\\nLaserbeak: [screaming]\\n\\nCarly: Uh- Bee!\\n\\nSam: [screaming]\\n\\nCivilians: [screaming]\\n\\nSam & Carly: [screaming]\\n\\nDylan: [grunting] Autobots! They\\'re alive! They\\'re here! They\\'re alive!\\n\\nMegatron: Decepticons, defend the pillar! Raise the bridges! Find them!\\n\\nSam: [grunting]\\n\\nCarly: Oh, Sam. Oh. You found me.\\n\\nSam: I\\'d follow you anywhere.\\n\\nSoldier: Form a perimeter! Let\\'s go, let\\'s go!\\n\\nEpps: Well, you\\'re crazy.\\n\\nSam: What is that? Is that us?\\n\\nEpps: This thing\\'s a military UAV. Stone, check and see if it\\'s still working.\\n\\nStone: Yeah, it\\'s still got power.\\n\\nEpps: Flight Control, do you copy? Can, can you rotate? Can you do something?\\n\\nController: I think we got something.\\n\\nLennox: Epps! We got Epps!\\n\\nEpps: Can you rotate? Can you do something?\\n\\nEpps: Come on, man! Work! Work!\\n\\nLennox: All right, turn the volume up on that!\\n\\nSimmons: The kid!\\n\\nEpps: Can you rotate or something?\\n\\nEpps: Yes, yes! Okay, okay, okay! They can see us.\\n\\nSam: Chicago is ground zero, do you understand? Can you hear us? You understand?\\n\\nMearing: Witwicky.\\n\\nCarly: Please listen. Sentinel Prime is here and he has the pillars to his Space Bridge. They\\'re on top of a building on Chicago River. It\\'s owned by Hotchkiss-Gould Investments. Now, the pillar that controls everything is in the southeast cupola.\\n\\nSam: You\\'ve got to destroy the pillar. You have to shoot down the pillar or they\\'re going to transport Cybertron here, do you understand? Do you understand?\\n\\nMearing: Cy- What?\\n\\nLennox: Give me a GPS on the building and on that drone! Let\\'s go!\\n\\nAnalyst: Mensurate those coordinates. Shorten the kill chain.\\n\\nLennox: Guys on the tarmac, five minutes.\\n\\nCarly: -The southeast cupola.\\n\\nLennox: All right!\\n\\nOptimus Prime: We need to move before the fighters spot us. Wait here until we scout a route ahead. Let\\'s roll.\\n\\nSideswipe: Ratchet, cover high.\\n\\nSam: Hey, think we could use that rocket to shoot down the pillar?\\n\\nEpps: We\\'re eight blocks away. We got to get closer to take a shot.\\n\\nHooch: Not closer. Higher. We need a clear line of sight.\\n\\nEpps: And it\\'s across the river. Gonna have a hell of a time trying to sneak up.\\n\\nMongo: We only got one shot.\\n\\nSam: One shot\\'s all we need.\\n\\nSimmons: We got to be able to see around that building from the ground. Get NSA to send service specs for any cameras in that area. Maybe some are working. Traffic lights. ATMs. Anything.\\n\\nLennox: Listen up. You want to hit back? We\\'re gonna have to wingsuit in. It\\'s the only way to get close. I can\\'t promise anyone a ride home, but if you\\'re with me, the world needs you now.\\n\\nBabyface: I\\'ll find my own ride home, sir.\\n\\nLennox: Who else?\\n\\nNEST Soldiers: [acknowledgement noises]\\n\\nLennox: General Morshower, requesting diversionary action to the south of the city. We\\'re coming north and low, you guys drive them to the east.\\n\\nBrains: Autobot victory! Autobot victory!\\n\\nDriller: [roaring]\\n\\nShockwave: [speaks in Cybertronian]\\n\\nEpps: That is one scary-ass Decepticon!\\n\\nOptimus Prime: They got my trailer. I need that flight tech. Shockwave can\\'t hunt all of us at once. Wreckers, we need a diversion.\\n\\nRoadbuster: Let\\'s get some!\\n\\nLeadfoot: You got that right.\\n\\nEpps: Listen, we\\'re gonna circle around to that glass building. And we\\'ll get high enough to make the rocket shot while you guys draw his fire. Let\\'s move!\\n\\nQue: Wait a minute! I\\'m not letting you go out there without my urban combat prototypes.\\n\\nSideswipe: We got to go, Que! Come on.\\n\\nQue: Wait, wait. They\\'re great inventions for kicking ass!\\n\\nSam: What are these?\\n\\nQue: Those are boom sticks. Armed in thirty seconds. Grapple gloves, for climbing.\\n\\nSoldier: Go, go! Move your ass!\\n\\nSideswipe: Move, move! Move, move! Go, go, go!\\n\\nSoldier: Move, move!\\n\\nStone: Let\\'s go!\\n\\nShockwave: [roaring]\\n\\nWheelie: Ah!\\n\\nBrains: Ow ow ow!\\n\\nSoldier: Let\\'s go! Run!\\n\\nShockwave: [growling]\\n\\nBrains: Ey, ey, ey. Where you going?\\n\\nWheelie: No, no, no!\\n\\nBrains: Where you going?\\n\\nWheelie: Stop, stop, stop! Don\\'t leave!\\n\\nBrains: You never leave a \\'bot behind! Ahh, Shockwave\\'s coming!\\n\\nEpps: Go for the stairs!\\n\\nSam: Epps, this way!\\n\\nEddie: Let\\'s go, let\\'s go.\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Breaking right.\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Bead. Rolling in.\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: We got another one coming around. Coming around on the left side, coming around on the right side.\\n\\nLennox: We\\'re going to use Willis Tower for cover! Once we make altitude, we jump!\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: A lot of airplanes out here!\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Contact off the nose.\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Mayday Mayday! I don\\'t think he\\'s gonna make it.\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Mayday, mayday! Six-one going down.\\n\\nLennox: Heads up! Heads up!\\n\\nBabyface: Come on, come on, come on, come on.\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Tally on the left.\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Got him. Eagle. Time on target, twenty seconds.\\n\\nLennox: Here we go! Here we go! Keep it tight!\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Coming around.\\n\\nBabyface: All right, focus focus focus.\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Threat above tower, six o\\'clock!\\n\\nStarscream: Locusts!\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Look out! Breaking right! Breaking right!\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Watch out, watch out, watch out!\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Holy shit!\\n\\nOsprey Pilot: Look out, look out, look out!

Get them out now!\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Help!\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Get separation. Track away, track away!\\n\\nLennox: Hard left! Hard left! Six hundred feet.\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Check your six! Check your six!\\n\\nLennox: He\\'s on our ass!\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Watch out, watch out!\\n\\nLennox: Sharp right!\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Building dead ahead!\\n\\nLennox: Thread the needle!\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Whoaa!

They\\'re coming.\\n\\nLennox: Weapon status?\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Twenty-nine Bot-busters, twenty piercing D-Bot.\\n\\nCarly: There, the building with the dome.\\n\\nLennox: For our brothers, let\\'s make this trip worth it.\\n\\nEddie: Oh, God.\\n\\nSoldiers: Oh. Whoa. Whoa!\\n\\nHooch: The building! They\\'re shooting at the building!\\n\\nEddie: Whoa whoa-\\n\\nEddie: This is not a good idea.\\n\\nSam: What?\\n\\nEddie: This is not a good idea. This building is unstable.\\n\\nSam: Listen, stop for a second. If we don\\'t do what we came to do, it doesn\\'t matter, we all die, right? That\\'s your target. Come on, man!\\n\\nEddie: I don\\'t even care if the building collapses. I\\'m having a heart attack anyway.\\n\\nEpps: The building is going over! Hang on!\\n\\nSoldier: Take cover!\\n\\nEddie: Whoaaa!\\n\\nSoldiers: Whoa!\\n\\nEpps: Keep your hands up!\\n\\nSoldiers: Whoaa!\\n\\nSam: [grunting]\\n\\nEpps: It\\'s okay! It stopped!\\n\\nCarly: Guys, look!\\n\\nSoldier: Incoming, incoming!\\n\\nEpps: Everybody hide!\\n\\nDecepticon Protoform: [growling]\\n\\nSam: [panting] Don\\'t.

We have to evac!\\n\\nShockwave: [speaks in Cybertronian] Commence.\\n\\nDriller: [roaring]\\n\\nPeople: [screaming]\\n\\nHooch: Sergeant Epps, the stairs are blocked!\\n\\nSoldier: We\\'re trapped!\\n\\nSoldier: Okay. How do we get out of here? Hey! Come on!\\n\\nEddie: Oh, Lord Jesus, let me just get out of this alive. Oh Lord Jesus just let me get out of this alive.\\n\\nEpps: Whoa!\\n\\nSam: Move! We got to move!\\n\\nEpps: Why do the Decepticons always get the good shit?\\n\\nSam: Move!\\n\\nEpps: We\\'re about to be eaten, people!\\n\\nPeople: [screaming]\\n\\nDriller: [roaring]\\n\\nCarly: Whoa whoa whoa!\\n\\nSoldier: We\\'re gonna die!\\n\\nSoldiers: [screaming and shouting]\\n\\nCarly: Aaah!\\n\\nSam: Hold on!\\n\\nCarly: Aaaah!\\n\\nSam: Give me your hand!

ETA twenty minutes.\\n\\nDutch: I\\'m in the traffic cameras.\\n\\nNEST Announcer: Four Autobots are captured.\\n\\nMearing: Oh, my God. We\\'re helpless.\\n\\nSimmons: Whatever\\'s set to happen, with those pulses getting faster, it\\'s gonna happen soon.\\n\\nNEST Announcer: No sign of Optimus.\\n\\nLennox: How do we get these bridges down? Spread out. Check in there.\\n\\nLennox: Epps! Epps, I\\'ve been looking for your ass. How you doing?\\n\\nEpps: Retirement is whack. Even worse, we can\\'t get across the river to that building, and the Autobots are upstairs, surrounded.\\n\\nSimmons: Just pan the camera around, all right?\\n\\nDutch: All right. Pan- pan right. That\\'s you.\\n\\nLennox: Try getting into the bridge control room.\\n\\nMearing: What are they doing? They\\'re just standing there.\\n\\nSimmons: Hang on. Dutch, see if you can hack into the bridge.\\n\\nNEST Soldier: Sir, SEALs are here.\\n\\nLennox: It\\'s a good day, boys! What do you got?\\n\\nSEAL Captain: Got a ten-man SEAL unit, sir, tasked with vectoring Tomahawks.\\n\\nLennox: How long?\\n\\nSEAL Captain: Fifteen.\\n\\nSoundwave: You\\'re my prisoners!\\n\\nSideswipe: Take it easy. We surrender.\\n\\nDecepticons: [growling]\\n\\nRatchet: Get off me. Get off me!\\n\\nLennox: All right, you\\'re gonna need your forty Mike-Mikes and frags. Go full auto. The vibrations jack up their circuits. Snipers, shoot for the eyes. All right, your target is up on top of that building, that cupola.\\n\\nSentinel Prime: How doomed you are, Autobots. You simply fail to understand, that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Activating the bridge.\\n\\nDecepticons: [shouting]\\n\\nBrains: They happy about something.\\n\\nWheelie: We\\'re in the heart of their ship. Let\\'s give them a little ride.\\n\\nBrains: Oh ho! We gonna screw this ship up.\\n\\nDutch: It\\'s a 128K binary encryption code. It\\'s difficult... but not for me, I\\'m in. Bridge, down.\\n\\nEpps: The bridge is coming down! Someone\\'s watching over us!\\n\\nSoldier: Come on! Let\\'s go!\\n\\nSimmons: Pleasure working with you, Seymour.

They\\'re triggering the pillars!\\n\\nDylan: Prisoners? You\\'re keeping prisoners?\\n\\nSoundwave: Yes.\\n\\nDylan: You need to teach them about respect. This was all business, but now it\\'s personal, do you understand me?\\n\\nSoundwave: Ha ha. I understand. No prisoners, only trophies.\\n\\nQue: Bee? I think they\\'re going to kill us.\\n\\nBumblebee: [whistle]\\n\\nBarricade: You! Your time is up.\\n\\nQue: Wait, wait, wait! We surrendered! We\\'re your prisoners.\\n\\nBarricade: Move it!\\n\\nQue: Can\\'t we talk this out? We\\'re all a bunch of good chaps! I mean you no- why did you- aah!\\n\\nBarricade: [laughing]\\n\\nBumblebee: {Good-bye, my old friend.}\\n\\nSoundwave: You\\'re mine now.\\n\\nBumblebee: [angry whistles] {Get off me!}\\n\\nSoundwave: Come along!\\n\\nSam: I got to help him.\\n\\nCarly: What? What are you doing?\\n\\nSam: I got to help him.\\n\\nCarly: Sam, you can\\'t help him. Sam!\\n\\nSam: [grunting]\\n\\nSoundwave: Turn around.\\n\\nBumblebee: {We- we gave them a hell of a run.}\\n\\nSoundwave: [grunting]\\n\\nBumblebee: [whistle]\\n\\nWheelie: We did it, Brains! We did it!\\n\\nBrains: Rip this ship apart!\\n\\nSoundwave: Nngh!\\n\\nSam and Carly: [shouting]\\n\\nBumblebee: {Yeah!}\\n\\nSoundwave: No- NO!\\n\\nWheelie: We had a nice run, Brains.\\n\\nBrains: Yeah.\\n\\nWheelie: You and me.\\n\\nBrains: We gonna die.\\n\\nEpps: Come on.

Have you come to surrender?\\n\\nDoctor: Hi!\\n\\nCarly: Was it all worth it?\\n\\nMegatron: Obviously.\\n\\nCarly: All your work to bring Sentinel back and now clearly he has all the power. It\\'s actually almost tragic.\\n\\nMegatron: You dare lecture me, slave?\\n\\nCarly: Your Decepticons finally conquering this planet, and yet, their leader won\\'t be you!\\n\\nMegatron: It will be me! It will always be me.\\n\\nCarly: In any minute now, you\\'ll be nothing but Sentinel\\'s bitch.\\n\\nMegatron: [roar]\\n\\nBumblebee: [whistle]\\n\\nHooch: Rocket!

My brides little brother is coming to the wedding. Is that ok with you?\\n\\nWell, it\\'s the first time I\\'ve heard of it. You could have paged me.\\n\\nDon\\'t over react. It\\'s gonna be fine.\\n\\n- Hey. Mind if I sit? - Wolf pack only. Find another chair.\\n\\n- There\\'s no wolfpack, Alan. C\\'mon. - It\\'s no problem. I\\'ll find...\\n\\n- Teddy, don\\'t be ridiculous! You\\'re sitting here! - Careful, that\\'s a Louis...\\n\\nThat is a Louis Vuitton!\\n\\n- That\\'s a nice neck roll! - Thanks! You can use it if you want.\\n\\nOk.\\n\\nThe Downeaster \\'Alexa\\'\" by Billy Joel playing\\n\\nBaby!\\n\\nThis is so absolutely beautiful! Thank you much!\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nBetween Teddy and me, you must be pretty excited. Pretty soon you\\'ll have 2 doctors in the family.\\n\\nYou have to realize that in my country we don\\'t consider dentists to be real doctors.\\n\\nDad...\\n\\nOk.\\n\\nAnyway I have to go and talk to Teddy about his cello performance tonight.\\n\\nOuch!\\n\\nI\\'m so sorry...\\n\\nYour dad\\'s kind of obsessed with your brother, isn\\'t he?\\n\\nTeddy is my dad\\'s prize possession. It\\'s always been that way.\\n\\nHe\\'ll warm up, I promise! Okay?\\n\\nYou can just fax it over to me. I\\'ll pick it up at the concierge.\\n\\nThanks, papa! Bye bye!\\n\\nThat was my dad. I\\'m a stay at home son.\\n\\nWe were discussing your wedding gift. He\\'s sparing no expense.\\n\\nOh... That\\'s so unnecessary.\\n\\nI\\'ve been meaning to ask someone. I notice this is a fishing village.\\n\\nIs there a Long John Silver\\'s on the island?\\n\\nYou know. No, I don\\'t think so. I\\'m so sorry.\\n\\nBut, we are actually serving some great fresh seafood.\\n\\n- Better than Long John\\'s? - Yes.\\n\\n- I\\'ll be the judge of that. Enjoy your evening. - You too. Ok.\\n\\nAll right!\\n\\nThank you, Teddy!\\n\\nThe hands of a brilliant musician!\\n\\nAnd one day, a great surgeon.\\n\\nI admit it...\\n\\nWhen I first met Stu, I was not quite sold.\\n\\nHe seemed unattractive. He lacked intelligence and imagination.\\n\\nHe was missing the spark you look for in a man.\\n\\nBut then I looked into Stu\\'s eyes.\\n\\nIt reminded me of my sweet brother, Chai Yo.\\n\\nFor those who do not know, Chai Yo is learning the sailboat and lives in a group home.\\n\\nBut Chai Yo loves \"khao\" .\\n\\nAnd that\\'s when I realized, Stu is \"khao\".\\n\\nWhat is \"khao\"?\\n\\n\"Khao\" is soft white rice in luke warm water.\\n\\nIt has no taste.\\n\\nWe feed it to small baby and uh, very old people.\\n\\nIt is nourishment that everyone can digest.\\n\\nThe world needs \"khao\", just as the world needs people like Stu.\\n\\nTo my sweet daughter and Stu! Congratulations!\\n\\nCheers!\\n\\nAnd now I believe that Teddy has something to say.\\n\\nSit down! I got this. Sit down, boy!\\n\\nThat was a.. a great speech, sir!\\n\\nI like the comparison between Stu and rice.\\n\\nI\\'ve also prepared a few words.\\n\\nHey everybody. Here\\'s some fun facts.\\n\\nThe population in Thailand is 63 million people.\\n\\nIt is twice the size of Wyoming.\\n\\nIt\\'s chief exports are textiles, footwear and rice.\\n\\nEach year approximately 13,000 people are killed in car accidents in Thailand.\\n\\n- The climate in Thailand... - Alan!\\n\\n- Why don\\'t you skip to the last card there, buddy. - Okay. Sorry!\\n\\nNone of you know Stu like I do.\\n\\nNot you... not you... not you...\\n\\nNot nobody knows Stu like I do.\\n\\nNo one!\\n\\nI can\\'t even tell you what we\\'ve been through cause we made a pact.\\n\\nMore important than blood.\\n\\nWhat I can tell you is this. This is not Stu\\'s first marriage.\\n\\nThere was a whore in Las Vegas a couple of years ago.\\n\\nSit down...\\n\\n- Enough! He\\'ll get over it! - Okay. Thanks, Phil!\\n\\nIn your face!\\n\\nWell that was exactly as painful as I expected it to be.\\n\\nSorry...\\n\\n- Oh, rice pudding! What are you doing? - HaHa. Very funny!\\n\\nBe nice, Phil! He\\'s extra sensitive tonight.\\n\\nGet over it! He\\'s your father in law. He\\'s supposed to hate you.\\n\\nCome have a drink with me and the guys.\\n\\nYou know... I\\'m really exhausted. We\\'re just gonna go upstairs and crash.\\n\\nC\\'mon, I just spoke with the manager. He\\'s gonna let us have a bonfire on the beach.\\n\\nThat sounds fun!\\n\\n- Nyah... I\\'m good. - He\\'s tired!\\n\\nStu, one drink with your friends who came all this way.\\n\\n- I just wanna hang out with you! - Oh c\\'mon. Just go! And do me a favor.\\n\\nTake Teddy with you. He never gets to have any fun.\\n\\nThat is a great idea. Bring the kid.\\n\\n- Alright. One drink! - Perfect.\\n\\n- See you later. - Have fun!\\n\\n- You have the key? - Yep, got it right here!\\n\\nI\\'ll see you in 20 minutes!\\n\\nMy uncle Roger said that he once saw an albino polar bear.\\n\\nReally? Polar bears are white. How would he know if it\\'s an albino?\\n\\nThis one was black.\\n\\nDid you ever think maybe it was just a black bear?\\n\\nWhatever...\\n\\nOk. Here we go. American beer.\\n\\n- Sealed bottle! - Thank you. Alright!\\n\\n- I\\'m not really old enough to drink. - Yeah, it\\'s illegal.\\n\\nWould be a shame if somebody reported you.\\n\\nNobody\\'s reporting anybody. It\\'s fine Teddy. Have a little fun.\\n\\nCareful!\\n\\nWhat is this? Instant marshmallows? Nice touch!\\n\\n- That was Alan\\'s idea. - Good thinking, Al!\\n\\nYou know... I gotta hand it to you, Stu! This place is paradise.\\n\\nNot bad, right?\\n\\nAnd I can\\'t believe I\\'m saying this, but I\\'m actually jealous of you.\\n\\n- I mean, Lauren is an angel. - Yeah, she really is amazing.\\n\\nWow, you guys are sweet.\\n\\nNot big breasts on her. But still, solid rack for an Asian.\\n\\n- Sorry, Teddy, but it\\'s true. - That\\'s ok.\\n\\nThat is just wildly inappropriate.\\n\\nAnd yet... I\\'m really glad you\\'re here. All you guys. Even you Alan.\\n\\nIt means a lot that you made the trip. Thank you.\\n\\n- Wouldn\\'t have missed it buddy. - Great!\\n\\nNow. Can we have our one fucking beer, dad?\\n\\nAlright. Toast! C\\'mon stand up guys.\\n\\nCome over here, Alan!\\n\\nTo Lauren and Stu!\\n\\n- You did it, buddy. - Sure did.\\n\\nCheers!\\n\\nWhat the hell...\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nPhil...\\n\\nI think it happened again.\\n\\n- Alan, what the fuck did you do? - I didn\\'t do anything. I swear to god.\\n\\nYour hair is gone.\\n\\nNo, no... up.\\n\\nWhere the fuck are we?\\n\\nPhil, I\\'m scared.\\n\\nStu, c\\'mon get up! We got a situation.\\n\\n- Oh, holy shit! - Where are we?\\n\\n- Oh my god, Alan. Your head. - No your head!\\n\\n- Is it bald? - Stu, you\\'re gonna freak out, but it\\'s gonna be ok.\\n\\n- Why? Was it my teeth? - Nope, it\\'s not your teeth.\\n\\n- Are you sure? - Yep.\\n\\nCan you see the bottom?\\n\\nOh my god! What the fu...ck\\n\\nThat\\'s good. Why don\\'t you try to wash it off.\\n\\nIt\\'s not coming off. This is a real tattoo!\\n\\n- Alan, what did you do! Did you Roofie me? - I didn\\'t do anything!\\n\\nStu, he swore to god!\\n\\nWhat happened?\\n\\nGet it off of me!\\n\\n- What the hell? - It\\'s a monkey.\\n\\nWhat a cute little mask. Hi little monkey.\\n\\nAlan...\\n\\nPhone! Alan, go find the phone!\\n\\nI got it!\\n\\n- Doug, where the hell are you? - I\\'m at breakfast. By the pool.\\n\\n- You guys coming down or what? - Oh Jesus. Thank god. Doug\\'s fine.\\n\\n- Stu, Doug\\'s fine. He\\'s at the resort. - Why aren\\'t we at the resort.\\n\\nWhat\\'s going on? Where are you guys?\\n\\nI do not know, man! We woke up in some shit hole room in some city.\\n\\n- Oh god. What city? - I don\\'t know, Doug!\\n\\nFuckin Asia-town.\\n\\n- I do not know, I told you. - Where are we?\\n\\n- Hey Stu. - What?\\n\\nCheck this out.\\n\\nEver seen anything like this?\\n\\n- What is that? - Careful. Might be a spiders nest.\\n\\nI\\'ve tangled with those before.\\n\\nI don\\'t get it man. We each had one beer last night, right? I mean you too!\\n\\n- Yeah but I left early, remember? - I don\\'t remember shit!\\n\\nTracy wasn\\'t feeling well. She came down to get me.\\n\\n- Wait and second. Is Teddy with you guys? - Teddy? What? What are you talking about?\\n\\nHe wasn\\'t in his room. They\\'ve been looking for him all morning.\\n\\n- Teddy went to Stanford, right? - Yeah. Why?\\n\\nFuck!\\n\\n- I just found his finger! - What?\\n\\n- I just found his fucking finger, Doug! - Phil, what is going on?\\n\\nAlright. Alright, alright... this is what we\\'re gonna do.\\n\\nYou tell the girls that we woke up early and went on a fishing trip, ok. And that\\'s where we are.\\n\\n- Right. - Right, stay by the phone!\\n\\nShit!\\n\\nUh, we got a little bit of a problem.\\n\\nWhat is that?\\n\\nWe don\\'t know.\\n\\n- Is it a worm? - It\\'s a mushroom.\\n\\nYeah, shiitake.\\n\\nMonkey, taste it! Is it shiitake?\\n\\n- He can\\'t understand you. - He just did.\\n\\n- Why is he pulling on it? - He\\'s probably hungry.\\n\\nWait a second. Is that...\\n\\nWhat the fuck man. Tell that gay monkey to leave my shit alone.\\n\\nChow?\\n\\nYou\\'re fucking crazy.\\n\\nIt\\'s so fucking light in here! Alan, grab me my sunglasses!\\n\\n- It\\'s great to see you, Leslie! - Nice to see you too my little popo.\\n\\nChow, what the fuck are you doing here?\\n\\nAlan called me a few days ago and invited me to the wedding.\\n\\n- Excuse me? - What, he\\'s my plus one.\\n\\nYou don\\'t have plus one. It\\'s $200 a plate.\\n\\nGuys, guys. Just focus, ok. -Chow, what happened?\\n\\nYou guys texted me, said you\\'re fucked up and looking to party.\\n\\nI picked you up on my boat and I brought you here to Bangkok.\\n\\nBut we had a sick night, bitches!\\n\\nWait a second Chow, we\\'re in Bangkok?\\n\\nHoller, city of squalor.\\n\\n- Do you know how I got this tattoo? - Uh, yeah from a fucking tattoo guy!\\n\\nCome on Stu, use that big Jewish brain.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the monkey holding?\\n\\n- That\\'s a finger! - Stu, I got some bad news.\\n\\nTeddy was with us last night. That\\'s his finger.\\n\\n- Teddy\\'s dead? - Teddy\\'s not dead! He partied with us all night!\\n\\n- Well then where is he? - Don\\'t you remember anything?\\n\\n- No! - No, nothing, Chow.\\n\\nOk I explain it all, ok?\\n\\nJust let me do one bump, get my head straight. Come to papa.\\n\\nThat\\'s a big...\\n\\nYou ready for craziest fucking story ever...\\n\\nChow!\\n\\nHey Chow, you okay?\\n\\nYou gotta be kidding me.\\n\\nFuck, he\\'s dead!\\n\\n- Help! - Stu!\\n\\n- Help! - Stu, shut up!\\n\\n- Call an ambulance! - Shut up! He\\'s dead!\\n\\nLook if someone comes and finds a dead body and a pile of cocaine...\\n\\nWe\\'re gonna spend the rest of our fucking lives in a Thai prison.\\n\\nAlan! Please don\\'t cry!\\n\\nAlright. Alright. I just need a second to figure this out.\\n\\nICE MACHINE LOCATED ON 15TH FLOOR.\\n\\nLook, this is the worst idea, ever.\\n\\nWhat the fuck is this place?\\n\\nBangkok is the capital of Thailand. Its population is 12 million people...\\n\\nAlan, will you help!\\n\\n- The elevator! - I\\'ll get the button!\\n\\n- What the fuck is the deal with this monkey? - That monkey gets it!\\n\\n- Come on! - Fuck no!\\n\\nThe powers out. We gotta take the stairs.\\n\\n- Oh fuck! - Come on!\\n\\nHere it is!\\n\\nFeet first. I\\'ve done this before.\\n\\nCareful!\\n\\n- Stu! - What?\\n\\n- We still have to find Teddy! - Oh god.\\n\\nThe roof!\\n\\nTeddy!\\n\\n- You guys see him? - No!\\n\\nHe\\'s not here.\\n\\nI can\\'t believe this is happening again.\\n\\nOk, look. We\\'ll handle this. You get back there.\\n\\nYou tell them that Alan and I got drunk with him, we\\'re still partying.\\n\\n- You gotta go get married! - No! Not going back without Teddy!\\n\\nHe\\'s Lauren\\'s little brother. He\\'s lost, he\\'s injured.\\n\\nIf I fuck this up, I have to lose everything.\\n\\nOk.\\n\\nAlright.\\n\\n- Alan, check your pockets! - What?\\n\\nYou know the drill. C\\'mon there might be clues.\\n\\n- Check your phones! Numbers, texts. - That\\'s a good idea!\\n\\n- I got nothing. Fuck! - I got an text from Chow.\\n\\n- What time? - Uh, 10 o\\'clock last night.\\n\\n- What\\'s it say? - \"On my way, Niggahs\"\\n\\nOh, Niggahs... ok... hip hop.\\n\\nWe are so... fucked!\\n\\nHey Phil! Look who\\'s back!\\n\\nWe gotta get you out of the sun. You\\'re too hot.\\n\\nPhil, I really think we should go to the American Consulate.\\n\\nFor what? To report a dead body we shoved into an ice machine?\\n\\nWhat are we gonna do? Keep walking around in circles? Cause that\\'s real productive.\\n\\nYou know I\\'m trying to figure this thing out here and your attitude is not helping.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry. It\\'s a 100 degrees and we don\\'t have a plan.\\n\\nAnd all we\\'ve done is buy him hats and sodas.\\n\\n-What, it\\'s a bag of Fanta! - Alright, what do you want to do, Stu?\\n\\nI don\\'t know!\\n\\nWell then stop yelling at me like it\\'s my fuckin fault.\\n\\nIt is your fault!\\n\\nAll I wanted was a bachelor brunch.\\n\\nShit! Shut up! It\\'s Doug! Talk to me!\\n\\nI just got off the phone with Bangkok PD. They\\'ve got him. He\\'s ok.\\n\\nOh thank god! Doug found him.\\n\\n- What happened? - He got arrested.\\n\\n- Arrested? For what? - Disorderly conduct.\\n\\n- Seriously? - Yeah! He\\'s ok though.\\n\\nThey\\'ll release him to you. No questions asked. No one has to know.\\n\\nHe\\'s at the Ratra Wang police station.\\n\\nOk. I\\'ll call you when we get there.\\n\\nTeddy\\'s in jail, but he\\'s fine. We gotta get a cab.\\n\\n- Ok! - Alright!\\n\\n- Yes, I have his paperwork here. - Okay.\\n\\n- He has been treated. - Sounds good.\\n\\nWe\\'re good. They\\'ve processed him for release.\\n\\nThey put him in the drunk tank. He\\'s fine.\\n\\nSixteen years old and spent a night in jail. Can you imagine?\\n\\nHaha! We love to party.\\n\\nHere we go!\\n\\n- Wait who\\'s this fuckin guy? - Teddy Sisay.\\n\\nNo, no, no, no. That\\'s the wrong guy! Sir!\\n\\nExcuse me.. I\\'m sorry. Officer. You brought the wrong guy. That\\'s not Teddy!\\n\\nOf course it is! We have his ID\\'s and everything!\\n\\nThese were in his pocket when we made the arrest.\\n\\nThey were in his pocket?\\n\\nExcuse me, sir! How did you get this stuff?\\n\\nHello?\\n\\nTeddy doesn\\'t speak. We tried English, Thai, Chinese... Nothing.\\n\\nLet me ask you something.\\n\\nDoes he look like he works out at Bally Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?\\n\\nLook. We arrest a lot of people. We cannot analyze everything.\\n\\n- What do you expect us to do with this guy? - Not my problem!\\n\\nHey guys, I think he knows us. Hi. Hello.\\n\\nDo you know where our friend is, Teddy? He\\'s missing!\\n\\n- Stu, forget it. The guys worthless. - He knows something!\\n\\nHe\\'s wearing Teddy\\'s sweatshirt.\\n\\nMaybe he just doesn\\'t understand. I\\'ll act it out. Yeah, like charades. Watch.\\n\\n- Two words. - Is it a movie?\\n\\nThis is not for you, Alan!\\n\\n- American teenager... in Asia. - Karate Kid, with Jaden Smith.\\n\\nIt\\'s easy cause you\\'re talking to him.\\n\\nStu, it\\'s a waste of time! Just leave this fucking guy here.\\n\\nHere\\'s something. There are 500 thousand monks living in Thailand.\\n\\nIt is not uncommon for some monks to take a vow of silence, at the age of eight.\\n\\nThere you go.\\n\\n- Anything else in that envelope? - Nah, it\\'s empty.\\n\\nWoah, hang on. A drink card from White Lion bar in Bangkok?\\n\\nWorth a shot.\\n\\nJesus christ! Is this the right street?\\n\\nThat\\'s what it says.\\n\\n- Whoa! This is the White Lion! - What the fuck happened here?\\n\\nHoly shit!\\n\\n(yelling in Thai)\\n\\n- Let\\'s... - We should probably...\\n\\nThat\\'s ok.\\n\\nWhat the fuck is going on here?\\n\\n- Whoa, guys. Check it out! - Holy shit! Stu, look!\\n\\nThat\\'s my face. Go, go go! Nice work, Alan!\\n\\n- Hello? - Be with you in a minute!\\n\\n- Excuse me. - Oh, look who it is!\\n\\n- So what do ya think? - What, I\\'m sorry?\\n\\n- The tattoo. You love it? - Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.\\n\\n- No refunds. Get the fuck out! - Wait a second!\\n\\nRead the sign!\\n\\nNO REFUNDS. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.\\n\\nWe don\\'t want any refunds. We just have a couple of questions.\\n\\nWe\\'re trying to figure out what went down last night.\\n\\nWhat went down? Take a look at what you did outside. Half the neighborhood went down.\\n\\n- We did that? - You don\\'t remember getting into a bar fight at the White Lion?\\n\\n- Starting a full on fuckin riot? - Sir, we don\\'t remember anything.\\n\\nOh boy...\\n\\nCheck this out!\\n\\nOh shit!\\n\\nFuck the Police!\\n\\nThere\\'s Teddy! He was with us!\\n\\nJesus christ!\\n\\nThat\\'s when the cops arrived and started cracking skulls.\\n\\nI took you guys and hid you in the shop here.\\n\\nThen you decided to get a tattoo. You cried like a little bitch.\\n\\nThis kid is fucking nine years old. He\\'s got balls twice your size.\\n\\n- Show him your balls, Nao! - No, no, no. That\\'s ok.\\n\\nListen, we\\'re looking for our friend Teddy. Have you seen him?\\n\\nNot since last night. Why? What happened?\\n\\nYeah, I\\'m supposed to marry his sister tomorrow and we kinda lost him.\\n\\n- Oh well. Then fuck it! - What do you mean, fuck it?\\n\\nBangkok has him now and she\\'ll never let him go.\\n\\n- You hear that, huh? Is this what you wanted? You happy now?\\n\\nYou\\'re wasting your time. These monks take their vow shit seriously.\\n\\nLook at this. That\\'s the sign of the Chang Mai Monastery, just outside of town.\\n\\nMaybe somebody over there can get him to talk.\\n\\n- Ok, can we just go over this one more time? You got the beer from...\\n\\n- The hotel bar. They gave me a sealed case. - Right.\\n\\n- But, who gave it to you? - The bartender.\\n\\nAnd then you brought em out and I opened them.\\n\\nYeah and Doug had one and he was fine so it\\'s not the beer.\\n\\n- So what the hell happened? - I have no idea!\\n\\nHey guys. Check it out. He\\'s got a Chinese boner.\\n\\nAlan, come on! Cut it out!\\n\\n- That is so wrong! - Don\\'t stop monkey, keep doing it.\\n\\nWhen a monkey nibbles on a penis it\\'s funny in any language!\\n\\nKeep doing it!\\n\\nAlright, thank you!\\n\\nBye Shannon! Bye Little Wayne!\\n\\nWow! So beautiful!\\n\\nWhat is this, a PF Chang\\'s?\\n\\nAh, they\\'re meditating.\\n\\n- Such a peaceful people! - Yeah.\\n\\n- Knock, knock! Hello! - Alan! Show some respect!\\n\\n- Don\\'t get up guys. - We brought one of your guys back.\\n\\nHe\\'s really funny. He\\'s really nice and cool.\\n\\nHi, how you doing. You the one in charge?\\n\\n- Excuse me... ow... Wait! - Stop it! Calm down!\\n\\nHold on. It\\'s because we\\'re talking.\\n\\nGod damn it! Oh! Stop!\\n\\nWait it\\'s me!\\n\\nOh I get it.\\n\\nNo talk! No talk! Shh.. Ok...\\n\\nOk.\\n\\nLate last night, you climbed the walls of our monastery.\\n\\nShouting out questions about love, marriage and the meaning of life.\\n\\nPoor brother Han was meditating alone in the garden.\\n\\n- And you took him. - Oh my god!\\n\\n- We kidnapped a monk. - We live an alternative life style.\\n\\nWe are so sorry about that, but we weren\\'t ourselves last night.\\n\\nYep, things kinda spun outta control a little bit. But there\\'s a boy who\\'s missing and hurt.\\n\\nCan you find out if he knows where our friend is?\\n\\nBrother Han took a vow of silence many years ago.\\n\\nIt would be useless to try.\\n\\nWell maybe he can write down what happened, on a piece of paper?\\n\\nActually Phil, that would be cheating. Isn\\'t that right, Grand Wizard.\\n\\n- Alan! - I\\'m afraid fatty is right.\\n\\nSee?... What?\\n\\nNone of us will ever know what brother Han knows.\\n\\nOh, alright. Well, so much for holy people. Bunch of bald assholes. C\\'mon, let\\'s go.\\n\\nHey you know what! FYI! You may want to put some signs up that say no talking...\\n\\n- ...before you unleash your dragon. - Yeah, that was a little rough.\\n\\nAnd \"your welcome\" for bringing him back safe.\\n\\n- You know we found him in the drunk tank. - Yeah well we did take him in the first place.\\n\\n- C\\'mon guys, let\\'s go. - Wait!\\n\\nThe Buddha teach, every memory lives somewhere deep within.\\n\\nPerhaps you should bring your question to the Garden of Meditation.\\n\\n- Did you understand a word he just said? - Yeah, yeah. About two thirds.\\n\\nHe said something about the Garden of Meditation?\\n\\nNo, he said he\\'s farting because of his medication.\\n\\nI get that.\\n\\nIt\\'s a waste of time. I don\\'t remember anything. Do you?\\n\\nNo. I got nothing. Alan?\\n\\nAlan!\\n\\n\"Every memory lives somewhere deep within\"\\n\\n- Sweetie. - What?\\n\\nYou have visitors.\\n\\n- Hey, Alan! - Hey, guys!\\n\\n- Hey, Phil. - Hey buddy!\\n\\nStu would like to invite you to his wedding.\\n\\n- Is this true, Stuart? - Yeah, why not. It\\'ll be fun.\\n\\nFuck!\\n\\n- For Lauren and Stu! - Cheers!\\n\\n- Chow! - We had a sick night bitches!\\n\\nAlan, what the fuck!\\n\\nIs that person coming to the wedding?\\n\\n- There is no wolfpack. - Alan, Alan, don\\'t do that!\\n\\nAnd finally...\\n\\nThe three best friends anyone could have.\\n\\nFuck the Police!\\n\\nI know where to go.\\n\\n- What do you think, Alan? - This is the place.\\n\\nC\\'mon. Let\\'s go.\\n\\nI don\\'t remember any of this!\\n\\n- Yeah Alan, you sure this is the place? - Yeah, pretty sure.\\n\\nRose! Harmony!\\n\\nIs he coming or what? I\\'ve been waiting all day for him.\\n\\n- I\\'m sorry. Waiting for who? - Chow, that dick ass fuck!\\n\\n- Why? What\\'s wrong? - Nothings wrong.\\n\\nOk, good. Look at this. Look what I bring for him. Check it out, huh.\\n\\n- No, no! - $ 6,000 American.\\n\\nWow looks so real!\\n\\nSorry!\\n\\n- Alan, what the fuck! - It\\'s ok. The gun, it\\'s very sensitive.\\n\\nEverybody ok?\\n\\nOk, then get the fuck back to work! Come on. Music, please!\\n\\nWhere is my 6,000 dollars?\\n\\n6,000? No, no, no. This is Chow\\'s deal. We got nothing to do with that.\\n\\nUn-fucking believable.\\n\\nThis guy, if he backs out again, the shits gonna catch up with him.\\n\\nHe\\'s made a lot of enemies in this town, and now they\\'re gonna be your enemies.\\n\\nThat\\'s not fair!\\n\\nOk listen. We\\'re just looking for a little kid.\\n\\n- 2,000 dollars. - What!\\n\\nI don\\'t know, maybe more. How young you want this kid to be?\\n\\nNo, no! Sorry, you misunderstood. We\\'re looking for our friend... 16 years old.\\n\\n- Teddy. - Teddy?\\n\\n- Yeah he was here with you guys last night. - He was?\\n\\nDo you know if he left with us?\\n\\nI don\\'t know. You were in the corner all night with Kimmy.\\n\\n- I didn\\'t see you leave. - Kimmy?\\n\\n- Is she here? - Yes, she\\'s in the back. She just came for her shit.\\n\\nGo and talk to her.\\n\\nAlright, listen. I\\'m sorry about everything that happened.\\n\\nListen to me, ok? Pay attention to what I\\'m going to talk to you know.\\n\\nWhen you see Chow, you tell him Samir says \"Hello\".\\n\\nOkay!\\n\\nBut do it like that, ok! \"Hello\" like threatening. Like, ironic.\\n\\n- \"Hellooo\" - Okay!\\n\\nGo away! Go away!\\n\\nOf course I remember him. He was buying shots for everyone.\\n\\nNice kid! His parents must be so proud.\\n\\nYou have no idea.\\n\\nOk, so do you remember if he left with us?\\n\\nYeah, you were all leaving together, but you almost forgot this one right here.\\n\\nRight, super star?\\n\\nThis one was following me around like a little puppy dog. All night.\\n\\nSaying he\\'d fallen in love with me. Asked me to marry him.\\n\\nClassic Stu!\\n\\n- We didn\\'t get married, did we? - Course not!\\n\\nWe just had some fun in the Chardonnay room.\\n\\n- What happens in the Chardonnay room? - Let\\'s just stay on task.\\n\\nI danced for him. He tickled me. We had sex.\\n\\n- Fuck! - It\\'s ok. You\\'re not married yet.\\n\\n- No big deal. - It\\'s cheating!\\n\\nNo offense to you.

So if you want out,\\n\\nspeak now.\\n\\nOur mission is Hendricks.\\n\\nWe\\'re all that stands\\nbetween him and his goal.\\n\\nNothing can be left to chance.\\n\\nEveryone connected with this man\\n\\nis considered an asset with valuable\\ninformation about our target.\\n\\nNo one can know we\\'re still on line.\\n\\nWe lose Hendricks now,\\nwe lose him forever.\\n\\nSo, what\\'s the play?\\n\\nWistrom will take delivery from Moreau\\nin 36 hours.\\n\\nNow we cannot let\\nthe launch codes leave the hotel,\\n\\nbut we need Wistrom\\nto lead us to Hendricks.\\n\\nHe\\'ll only do that if he has the codes.\\n\\nOr if he thinks he has them.\\n\\nOur objective is to intercept the sale,\\n\\nreplace the authentic\\ncodes with counterfeits\\n\\nand follow Wistrom to Hendricks.\\n\\nWell, that\\'s simple enough.\\n\\nWe snatch the codes,\\nwe gin up some fakes.\\n\\nJane, you double Moreau, and sell the\\ncodes to Wistrom and Bob\\'s your uncle.\\n\\nAnd how do you propose\\nwe just snatch the codes from Moreau?\\n\\nWe take her out.\\n\\nYeah, we take her out.\\nBut, you know, discreetly.\\n\\nDiscreetly?\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nRight, she\\'s an asset. Right. I get it.\\nSorry. Nothing left to chance.\\n\\nHe said... I\\'m spitballing.\\nIt\\'s not all gonna be gold.\\n\\n- We don\\'t touch Wistrom.\\n- All right.\\n\\nOr Moreau.\\n\\nShe\\'ll answer for Hanaway,\\nbut it has to be when I say.\\n\\nAfter we hit Hendricks.\\n\\nOnly pack what we need.\\n\\nYeah, absolutely. Only pack what we...\\nYou never know.\\n\\nSo even if we can double\\nWistrom and Moreau,\\n\\nhow do we keep them in separate rooms\\n\\nwhile having them think that\\nthey\\'re in the same room?\\n\\nWe give the hotel a facelift.\\n\\nWistrom will think\\nhe\\'s arriving at Moreau\\'s suite,\\n\\nbut, really, he\\'ll be\\nwalking into our decoy room.\\n\\nWhere I\\'ll double Moreau.\\n\\nDownstairs, Benji will double Wistrom.\\n\\nMasks!\\n\\nAnd meet with the real Moreau.\\n\\nAnd...\\n\\nWhat am I doing?\\n\\nYou? You\\'re the helper!\\n\\nHelper. That\\'s great.\\n\\nOkay, so to the extent I understand\\nwhat you\\'re talking about here...\\n\\nThe Burj Khalifa,\\nit\\'s the tallest building in the world,\\n\\nand you want to alter its infrastructure\\n\\nwith the hopes of convincing\\ntwo people that they\\'ve\\n\\nhad a meeting,\\nwhich actually really never happened.\\n\\nRight?\\n\\nCamels.\\n\\nETA on dry cleaning.\\n\\nOn my way up.\\n\\nOkay, 34 minutes to door knock.\\n\\nWow...\\n\\nOkay, this is a slight wrinkle,\\nbut nothing to worry about.\\n\\nWe\\'re just going to have to go into\\nthe server room from the outside.\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nWell, the firewalls on this building\\'s\\nserver are military grade.\\n\\nI mean, this would be a cinch\\n\\nif I could call Youssef\\nback at headquarters,\\n\\nbut Youssef doesn\\'t exist any more,\\nand neither do we.\\n\\nI could hack it,\\nbut it would take too long.\\n\\nThen hardwire in.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s four layers\\nof next-gen security\\n\\nbetween us and the server room.\\n\\nThere\\'s no way\\nwe can get to it from inside.\\n\\nIf we can\\'t get to the server,\\nwe don\\'t control the elevators,\\n\\nwe don\\'t control the security cameras.\\n\\nThis operation is over\\nbefore it even begins.\\n\\nI\\'m telling you,\\nwe can get to it from outside.\\n\\nWe\"?\\n\\nI\\'m... I\\'m on the computer.\\n\\nI\\'m just...\\n\\nThe helper.\\n\\nWhat floor is it on?\\n\\n130.\\n\\n130?\\n\\n- Vent ducts.\\n- Pressure sensitive.\\n\\nNot enough time.\\n\\n- Elevator shaft.\\n- Infrared sensors.\\n\\nNot enough time.\\n\\nHow am I supposed to do this?\\n\\nGod damn it!\\n\\nOh, that\\'s high.\\n\\nOkay, now remember, it\\'s a rolling off\\nmotion that disengages the bond.\\n\\nWhen the meter is blue,\\nthat\\'s full adhesion.\\n\\nEasy way to remember, blue is glue.\\n\\n- And when it\\'s red?\\n- Dead.\\n\\nHere\\'s your cutter, okay?\\nAnd your server interface.\\n\\nBoth going back here. One, two.\\n\\nOkay, Ethan, the hotel server is\\neleven stories up and seven units over.\\n\\nOkay? Comm check.\\n\\nYeah. Copy.\\n\\nSo...\\n\\nIt\\'s 26 minutes to door knock.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n25 minutes to door knock.\\n\\nWhat the hell is that?\\n\\nYeah, what the hell is that?\\n\\nIt\\'s a sandstorm.\\n\\nIt\\'s a long way off, Ethan.\\n\\nShouldn\\'t be a problem.\\n\\n24 minutes to door knock.\\n\\nWhere\\'s Ethan?\\n\\nYou\\'ve got to be kidding me.\\n\\n23 minutes to door knock.\\n\\nI\\'m at server level.\\n\\n22 minutes to door knock.\\n\\nThe countdown is not helping.\\n\\nI\\'m just saying.\\n\\nI\\'m in.\\n\\nThat\\'s great, Ethan.\\nYou\\'re halfway home.\\n\\nLocated server.\\n\\nPlease tell me we\\'re online.\\n\\nAll right, we\\'re live.\\n\\nOkay, I now have control of\\nthe elevators and the security cameras.\\n\\nTime to redecorate.\\n\\nOkay, you drive.\\nAnd look out for Wistrom and Moreau.\\n\\nMoreau is at the elevators\\nahead of schedule.\\n\\nGo.\\n\\nWe can\\'t open this door, can we?\\n\\nThe door? No.\\n\\nEthan, you gotta get down here now.\\n\\nEthan!\\n\\nIs there a problem? Ethan?\\n\\nWe\\'re not gonna make it.\\n\\nWe have to make it.\\n\\nWhere\\'s Ethan?\\n\\nYour line\\'s not long enough!\\n\\nNo shit!\\n\\nThat was not easy,\\n\\nbut I did it.\\n\\nWhat\\'d I miss?\\n\\nThe lens might be a little uncomfortable.\\n\\nIt captures images and transmits them\\nto the printer in the briefcase.\\n\\nAll right?\\n\\nI can\\'t see out of one eye, but I\\'m fine.\\n\\nBlink twice to activate the shutter.\\n\\nNotice the numbers are in order?\\n\\nA perfect copy.\\n\\nBut the numbers are scrambled.\\n\\nMasks?\\n\\n60 seconds.\\nYou sure I shouldn\\'t wear a mask?\\n\\nYou know,\\n\\'cause I\\'m not exactly Omar Sharif.\\n\\nI\\'ll play it French.\\nThis is your tracking device.\\n\\n- This is what you\\'re tracking.\\n- The paper clip?\\n\\nNo, it\\'s the paper.\\n\\nIt\\'s in the briefcase. It\\'s coated with\\nisotopes which give off a unique...\\n\\nIt just means\\nthat you can track the documents\\n\\neven if they switch briefcases.\\n\\nRange?\\n\\nNot that good. It\\'s, like, half a mile.\\n\\nSafest thing to do would be not let\\nWistrom out of your sight.\\n\\nIs that Wistrom?\\n\\nWho\\'s that with him?\\n\\nI don\\'t know. We don\\'t have an uplink,\\nso there\\'s no facial recognition.\\n\\nWho\\'s that with him?\\n\\nThat\\'s Leonid Lisenker.\\nPolish-born cryptographer.\\n\\nHe redesigned Russia\\'s nuclear\\nsecurity after the Cold War.\\n\\nHe\\'s here to authenticate\\nthe launch codes.\\n\\n- Yes, he is. We are blown.\\n- No, we\\'re not blown.\\n\\nWell, we will be as soon as he sees\\nthe counterfeit launch codes.\\n\\nWe\\'re not blown.\\n\\nHe\\'s in the elevator.\\n\\nDelay them.\\n\\nBenji, how long would it take you\\nto reprogram the case?\\n\\nA couple of seconds. What for, though?\\n\\nTo make an exact copy\\nof the launch codes.\\n\\n- What?\\n- You can\\'t do that.\\n\\n- Wistrom\\'s on 22!\\n- Slow him down.\\n\\nI\\'ll do what I can.\\n\\nWait, wait. Ethan, hang on now!\\n\\nHang on. Just a second.\\n\\nYou\\'re talking about handing over active\\nnuclear launch codes to Wistrom?\\n\\nYes. Reprogram the case.\\n\\nListen... Stop!\\n\\nJust listen to what you\\'re saying.\\n\\nYou\\'re fixating.\\nYou\\'re not thinking clearly.\\n\\nIt\\'s not gonna happen. I won\\'t let it!\\n\\n33 and climbing!\\n\\nBrandt, use your head now.\\n\\nThe mission is not the codes,\\nthe mission is Hendricks.\\n\\nThen just let it play out.\\nGive him bad codes. Neutralize him.\\n\\nYou know that won\\'t do it.\\n\\nFailure to a terrorist\\nis just a rehearsal for success.\\n\\n41!\\n\\nWe lose Hendricks today,\\nhe shows up somewhere else tomorrow.\\n\\nHe finds another way.\\n\\nWith no IMF to stop him.\\n\\nNo. It\\'s now or never.\\nNow, Brandt, give me the case.\\n\\nNothing can be left to chance.\\nYou said that.\\n\\nYou\\'re the analyst.\\n\\nNow, tell me there\\'s not another way\\nfor Hendricks to get those codes.\\n\\n50!\\n\\nYou tell me that this is his only avenue,\\nright here, right now, today.\\n\\nYou tell me that, I\\'ll walk away.\\n\\n- We go without.\\n- Without masks?\\n\\n- Jane needs to go.\\n- Ethan!\\n\\nWe have no choice.\\n\\nEthan, you\\'d be walking in\\non Moreau unarmed.\\n\\nFace-first. Literally.\\n\\nHow do we know they\\'ve met?\\n\\n- How do we know they haven\\'t?\\n- Doesn\\'t matter!\\n\\nDamn it.\\n\\nWe have no choice.\\n\\nGoggles.\\n\\nWhat if they have met?\\n\\nCome in.\\n\\nWhich one of you is Wistrom?\\n\\nWhich one of you is Wistrom?\\n\\nI am.\\n\\nI admire your work.\\n\\nSit.\\n\\nWhere are my codes?\\n\\nWhere are my diamonds?\\n\\nClose by.\\n\\nYou have my payment?\\n\\nWhen I see the codes.\\n\\nNot to worry. Come in!\\n\\nI thought we could have tea.\\n\\nNo diamonds, no codes.\\n\\nNo codes, no diamonds.\\n\\nKill this one.\\n\\nWe didn\\'t come alone.\\n\\nThat hallway out there is a kill-box.\\n\\nYou know who we work for.\\n\\nWe come back with the codes,\\nor we don\\'t come back.\\n\\nHow good is your backup?\\n\\nThe best.\\n\\nI\\'ve killed the best.\\n\\nDo you care for some sugar?\\n\\nEnough. Let\\'s get this done.\\n\\nYou want payment, I want guarantees.\\n\\nWhen he\\'s authenticated the codes,\\n\\nI\\'ll make the call\\nand you get your diamonds.\\n\\nThat or\\n\\nwe all go home in buckets.\\n\\nNobody leaves this hotel alive.\\n\\nGet the papers.\\n\\nIs there a problem?\\n\\nIt\\'s locked.\\n\\nForgive me. There must be a key.\\n\\nOne moment, huh?\\n\\nMy mistake.\\nIt is a combination, not a key.\\n\\nYou tell me the numbers.\\n\\nThey\\'re good.\\n\\nZero.\\n\\nZero.\\n\\nZero.\\n\\nCome on, come on, come on.\\n\\nIt was a pleasure doing business with...\\n\\nWistrom has the launch codes.\\nHe\\'s on the move.\\n\\nHey, I did as you asked. I did.\\nNow let my family go!\\n\\nRelease Leonid\\'s family.\\n\\nThank God.\\n\\nYou can thank him in person.\\n\\nIt was a pleasure\\ndoing business with you.\\n\\nKill him!\\n\\nMoreau\\'s on the move!\\n\\nI\\'ve got her.\\n\\nJane?\\n\\nShe\\'s an asset!\\n\\nI need her\\n\\nalive!\\n\\nAcknowledge!\\n\\nAcknowledge!\\n\\nEthan, Wistrom is in the elevator.\\nI can\\'t see Leonid, though.\\n\\nBenji, slow him down.\\nGet me an elevator.\\n\\nFind Leonid.\\n\\nBenji, I\\'ve got a lock on Wistrom.\\nBut I can\\'t tell.\\n\\nIs he still in the elevator?\\n\\nBenn?\\n\\nEthan. Over?\\n\\nBenj\\n\\nBenji, I lost...\\n\\nEthan, can you hear me?\\n\\nEthan, can you hear me? Over.\\n\\nJesus!\\n\\nSit down!\\n\\n- Watch her.\\n- Why me?\\n\\nBecause if I do, I\\'ll kill her.\\n\\nHold it, Team Leader.\\n\\nDid you really think\\nI wouldn\\'t catch up with you?\\n\\nYou and I are not enemies.\\nIt was a set-up...\\n\\nWe\\'ll find out your lies soon enough.\\n\\nMove it!\\n\\nI\\'m sorry about this.\\n\\nLeonid. Benji?\\n\\nGo for Benji.\\n\\nI\\'ve got Leonid by the elevators.\\nHe\\'s been shot.\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nHey, hey. Stay with me. Stay with me.\\n\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,\\n\\nJane! No!\\n\\nCome on. Come on.\\n\\nNow, what happened\\nwith Moreau, Jane?\\n\\nShe couldn\\'t help us with Hendricks.\\n\\nSo let\\'s throw her off the building!\\n\\nI didn\\'t throw her.\\n\\nLet\\'s throw her off the building!\\n\\nShe was not the mission, Jane!\\n\\nThe mission was to track the file\\nback to Hendricks, who is in the wind\\n\\nwith nuclear launch codes!\\n\\nMaybe you didn\\'t notice the gun\\nshe had pointed at me.\\n\\nYeah, like you didn\\'t notice\\nthe open window,\\n\\nor that we\\'re about a mile up in the air!\\n\\nIt was an instinctive move.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter!\\n\\nWe\\'re talking about a nuclear war.\\n\\nThe asset is more important than you.\\n\\nWhere do you get off telling me\\nhow well I executed?\\n\\nWe inherited you.\\n\\nYou\\'re just a bureaucrat!\\n\\nBetter have good news for me.\\nIs he here?\\n\\nYou think I need you to tell me\\nwhat the mission is?\\n\\nYeah, I got it. Dunhill lighter.\\nI\\'ll be there.\\n\\nAnd no one will be following me.\\n\\nJust make sure no one\\'s following you.\\n\\nAnd how the hell\\ndid the Russians find us?\\n\\n- What are you asking me for?\\n- Because you\\'re communications!\\n\\nYou\\'re in charge of covering our tracks.\\n\\nYou cannot afford to make mistakes\\nlike that now, Benji.\\n\\nYou\\'re not a technician any more.\\nYou\\'re a field agent.\\n\\nAnd you\\'re just an \"analyst.\"\\n\\nRight?\\n\\nRight?\\n\\nWho are you really, Brandt?\\n\\n- What are you asking?\\n- What am I asking?\\n\\nLet me see if I can put it another way.\\n\\nHow does an agent with skills like that\\nend up an analyst?\\n\\nWell, we all have our secrets.\\n\\nDon\\'t we, Ethan?\\n\\nYou tell me yours, I\\'ll tell you mine.\\n\\nI have friends in the region.\\nJust sit tight.\\n\\nI\\'ll send someone to get you out of here.\\n\\nWhat about Hendricks?\\nWhat\\'s the plan?\\n\\nThe plan was for us\\nto stop him together.\\n\\nWell, what are you going to do?\\n\\nChange the plan.\\n\\nWait. That\\'s it?\\n\\nWhat are you going to do,\\ngo after him alone?\\n\\nWould you care to explain yourself,\\nAgent Brandt?\\n\\nI was on a protection detail in Croatia.\\n\\nShadowing the assets,\\nhusband and wife.\\n\\nThey were never supposed to know\\nwe were there.\\n\\nWhole thing\\'s routine, it was a milk run.\\n\\nThree days in\\n\\nwe caught wind that a Serbian hit squad\\nwas after our couple.\\n\\nBut my team had it under control.\\n\\nWe knew they were coming.\\n\\nBut I couldn\\'t shake this feeling that I\\nshould warn the couple somehow.\\n\\nI wanted to find a way to let them know.\\n\\nBut, you know, orders are orders,\\nso I didn\\'t.\\n\\nOne day, the husband decides\\nto leave the hotel and go for a run,\\n\\nso I follow him,\\nand I leave two men with the wife.\\n\\nWhen I get back, my guys are\\nunconscious and the wife is gone.\\n\\nLocal police found her body\\nthree days later.\\n\\nWhat was left of her, anyway.\\n\\nThat was my last day in the field.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t face another\\nlife-or-death situation after that.\\n\\nSo what happened to the husband?\\n\\nI never saw him again.\\n\\nUntil two days ago in Moscow,\\n\\nwhen the Secretary\\nintroduced me to Ethan Hunt.\\n\\nNo, that\\'s not what happened.\\nShe left him.\\n\\nYeah, I heard that one, too, Benji.\\n\\nBut, unfortunately, I was there.\\n\\nJust like I was there\\nwhen the Secretary got the phone call\\n\\nthat Ethan was in custody for killing\\nsix Serbian nationals in cold blood.\\n\\nAn unsanctioned hit.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nDisavowed.\\n\\nThe next thing I know,\\n\\nI\\'m on a plane to Dubai,\\n\\nwondering the whole time, do I tell him?\\n\\nHow do I tell him?\\n\\nThat I\\'m responsible.\\n\\nI could have warned him.\\n\\nI should have warned him.\\n\\nBut I didn\\'t.\\n\\nAnd she died.\\n\\nSergei! Sergei, my friend!\\n\\nI told you I would get him here.\\nDidn\\'t I say?\\n\\nHow do I know it\\'s him?\\n\\nYes, it\\'s him.\\nYou trust me, I trust you. Right?\\n\\nThis is the guy!\\n\\nThis is the guy, the one I told you about.\\n\\nSo we can take these things off.\\n\\nSorry. He\\'s a great guy,\\nbut he doesn\\'t know you like I do.\\n\\nSo, you work for\\nthe American government.\\n\\nAnd you\\'re an arms dealer.\\n\\nNo, no, no. Sergei. Sergei.\\n\\nHe\\'s \"independent\\ndefense coordinator.\" Right?\\n\\nThat you are. Very classy job.\\n\\nListen. He\\'s a friend.\\n\\nThose diamonds are for Bogdan.\\n\\nNo, no. It\\'s okay. You can have them.\\n\\nWhatever arrangements you made with\\nmy cousin is between you and him.\\n\\nYou want something from me, you pay.\\n\\nYou misunderstand.\\nI\\'m not buying. I\\'m selling.\\n\\nYou\\'re selling.\\n\\nSelling what?\\n\\nThe future.\\n\\nYeah, I got all I need, thank you.\\n\\nOur countries are on the brink of war.\\n\\nWar is very good for business.\\n\\nNuclear war?\\n\\nGo on.\\n\\nI\\'m looking for a man\\nnamed Kurt Hendricks.\\n\\nYou may know him as Cobalt.\\n\\nIn either case,\\nI think you know what he wants.\\n\\nI\\'ll bet he even tried\\nto buy it from you at some point.\\n\\nGo on.\\n\\nHe has a case, he has codes.\\n\\nBut they\\'re worthless\\nwithout a tactical satellite.\\n\\nI want to know where he\\'d get it.\\n\\nA man with information like that\\nwould be a potential terrorist.\\n\\nAnd to your government,\\n\\na potential terrorist is a terrorist.\\n\\nIf you help me,\\n\\nmy friends become your friends.\\n\\nSorry.\\n\\nI cannot help you.\\n\\nI certainly cannot tell you\\nthat Russia quietly sold\\n\\nan obsolete tactical satellite\\nto a certain telecom in Mumbai.\\n\\nAnd whoever gave them that idea?\\n\\nAn enterprising third party.\\n\\nWorking on commission.\\n\\nHelping old friends.

So, where are we going?\\n\\nIndia.\\n\\n- India? India?\\n- Sure.\\n\\nOkay. Great.\\n\\nLove the jet.\\n\\nWait till you see the car.\\n\\nSidorov.\\n\\nHow have you been, old friend?\\n\\nOh, it\\'s you.\\n\\nI\\'ve been busy with other things.\\n\\nBut I\\'ll be after you again soon enough.\\n\\nI understand you\\'re looking\\nfor an American...\\n\\nI am.\\n\\nYou\\'re also looking for a nuclear launch\\ndevice stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.\\n\\nYou\\'re also looking for a nuclear launch\\ndevice stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.\\n\\nI am?\\n\\nI can help you find both.\\n\\nIf... we can come to an understanding.\\n\\nBrij Nath.\\n\\nBrij Nath.

Why is that so hard to grasp?\\n\\nWell...\\n\\nWhy? It\\'s a 25-foot drop.\\nAnd we\\'re using magnets.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nIn light of our recent efforts,\\nthe technology\\'s...\\n\\nThe science is sound. All right?\\n\\nI\\'d be more worried about the heat.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s that. What heat?\\n\\nWell, it\\'s like any computer, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nIf you switch off the fan,\\nit\\'s gonna get really hot!\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nRelatively, you know.\\n\\nOf course it will.

Celebrated author and lecturer.\\n\\nBoxing champion at Cambridge... where he made friends with our current prime minister.\\n\\n\\nDo you have any evidence to substantiate your claim?\\n\\nThis. Now do you see?\\n\\nDr. Hoffmanstahl\\'s death? Yes.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard you speak of him, extolling his virtues.\\n\\nHoffmanstahl was at the forefront of medical innovations, a true pioneer.\\n\\nJust the other day, I averted an expl*si*n that was intended for him.\\n\\nSays here he d*ed of a heart att*ck.\\n\\nHas all my instruction been for naught? You still read the official statement and believe it.\\n\\nIt\\'s a game, dear man, a shadowy game.\\n\\nWe\\'re playing oat and mouse, the professor and I.

I\\'ll give my life to see his demise.\\n\\nHe must be stopped before his evil machinations come to a crescendo.\\n\\nAnd how will he do all this?\\n\\nDon\\'t be a dingy bird. Bad people do bad things because they can.\\n\\nNo one, not the victims, the police, the governments, not anyone--\\n\\nExcept the great Sherlock Holmes... Correct. on this diet, will work it all out. Right.\\n\\nOr thereabouts. Thereabouts, not quite there.\\n\\nHere\\'s to your good health.\\n\\nDingy bird.\\n\\nWhat have you done to Gladstone now?\\n\\nRicinus communis. The fruit is highly toxic.\\n\\nHe\\'s barely breathing.\\n\\nWhat an excellent opportunity.\\n\\nThis may be just the thing.\\n\\nSorry, do you mind terribly if I try my adrenal extract?\\n\\nHow many times are you going to k*ll my dog, Holmes?\\n\\nTook off like a monkey from a box.\\n\\nHmm. I may need one of those in a few hours.\\n\\nConsider it a wedding gift.\\n\\nWatson, might we use an alternative exit?\\n\\nIs there something different about you?\\n\\nI\\'m under observation.\\n\\nAs you should be.\\n\\nYou drive.\\n\\nWill your beard be with us all night?\\n\\nI\\'ll remove it once we\\'re south of Trafalgar Square.\\n\\nIf you believe Moriarty has you under observation... isn\\'t this a bit conspicuous?\\n\\nIt\\'s so overt, it\\'s covert.\\n\\nTrafalgar Square. You must be safe by now.\\n\\nWhy are you looking at me with such concern?\\n\\nI\\'m so very worried. Your vitality\\'s been drained from you.\\n\\nMarriage is the end, I tell you. I think of it as the beginning.\\n\\nArmageddon. Rebirth.\\n\\nRestriction. Structure.\\n\\nAnswering to a woman. Being in a relationship.\\n\\nA life in matrimony, the possibility of a family.\\n\\nWho wants to die alone?\\n\\nWe\\'ll have a good old-fashioned romp tonight... you\\'ll settle down, have a family, and I\\'ll die alone.\\n\\nYes, that\\'s about it.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s better for one to die alone than to live life in eternal purgatory.\\n\\nAnyway...\\n\\nNot bad, that.\\n\\nSo where are we going?\\n\\nIn the future, there\\'ll be one of those machines in every town in Europe.\\n\\nLoitering in the woodshed again, are we, Myccie?\\n\\nGood evening, Sherly. Well.\\n\\nI see your bootmaker is ill, dear brother.\\n\\nAs I detect that you\\'ve recently changed the brand of soap with which you shave.\\n\\nThe chimney in the front room at Baker Street... still needs a damn good sweeping up.\\n\\n\\nWere you aware that the hackney carriage by which you arrived had a damaged wheel?\\n\\nYes, the left. And it\\'s plain to the meanest intelligence... that you have recently acquired a new bow for your violin.\\n\\nSame bow, new strings.\\n\\nAnd may I deduce, Mycroft--? Good evening, by the way.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t. May I deduce that you... who rarely strays from the path that runs from your home to the Diogenes Club... and never on a Monday when they serve your favorite potted shrimps... must be here for some far more important reason than my stag party?\\n\\nYou know, he\\'s nothing like as slow-witted as you\\'d been leading me to believe, Sherly.\\nNo, you\\'re quite right, Dr. Watson... but with all the conflict in Europe at the moment, the whole situation could--\\n\\nExcuse me... suddenly erupt.\\n\\nI am here to avoid a dire catastrophe.\\n\\nIf the concerns of two nations... which shall remain nameless... but I can tell you they speak French and German... are not dealt with tonight, I shall be forced to go to Switzerland... to attend the ghastly peace summit in Reichenbach.\\n\\nThe worst thing about Switzerland is the altitude.\\n\\nIt gives me nosebleeds, exacerbates my asthma--\\n\\nI\\'m so glad you invited your brother.\\n\\nThis looks promising.\\n\\nAnd your poison of choice, gentlemen?\\n\\nWe\\'ll start with the champagne. We may need several more chairs.\\n\\nPerhaps a good cigar.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t bother with the chairs.\\n\\nWhat is it your brother does exactly?\\n\\nHe\\'s the keeper of the broom cupboard of state.\\n\\nNo ambition, no energy... yet I\\'m repeatedly told that he\\'s indispensable to the British government... particularly the Foreign Office.\\n\\nI would like to propose a toast. Really?\\n\\nTo my dear friend, Dr. John-- um, Hamish Watson...\\n\\nI\\'m right here. on the eve of his wedding. He--\\n\\nhas been the best companion.\\n\\nShouldn\\'t we be waiting for the boys from my rugby club?\\n\\nHe has always kept us-- They couldn\\'t attend. flat-footed on the ground.\\n\\nAll of them? Hmm. The chaps from my medical school?\\n\\nThey declined. The lads from the regiment?\\n\\nNo man\\'s better worth having at your side-- Who is it you\\'re looking for?\\n\\nBecause I don\\'t know a single damn person here, do I?\\n\\nThere\\'s no need for hysterics. You know me and Mycroft.\\n\\nDon\\'t be a ponce, Watson. Ponce?\\n\\nYou completely forgot about my stag party, didn\\'t you?\\n\\nWhy are we here? Your very good health, doctor.\\n\\nShame none of your friends could make it.\\n\\nI\\'m going to the gaming tables. I refuse for this night to be a total loss.\\n\\nGive me my money. Happily. Give me the wedding ring.\\n\\nSo now you\\'re interested in being the best man.\\n\\nYou\\'re supposed to keep the ring anyway.\\n\\nJust as you\\'re supposed to organize my stag party.\\n\\nDon\\'t want to lose it on a bet. And invite my friends... of which, by the way, there are many. You\\'re the one with no friends...\\n\\nSherly No Mates.\\n\\nHe\\'s all \"me, me, me,\" isn\\'t he?\\n\\nI win!\\n\\nPlease, sit.\\n\\nPut your money on the table and we will begin.\\n\\nWelcome. I am Madam Simza.\\n\\nCards can illuminate your past... clarify your present, and show you the future.\\n\\nIf you have a specific question, hold it in your mind.\\n\\nI\\'m holding.\\n\\nLet me know when you\\'re ready.\\n\\nActually, I\\'d prefer to read... your fortune.\\n\\nTemperance inverted.\\n\\nIndicative of volatility.\\n\\nA woman who has recently taken her comfort in drink.\\n\\nFrom what does she seek solace? What does she not wish to see?\\n\\nA fool embarrassing himself? Hmm.\\n\\nHmm. Oh, yes. The Fool.\\n\\nSomeone has been led astray, involved in something without their knowledge.\\n\\nNot bad, but you have to make me believe you.\\n\\nI have to see it in your eyes.\\n\\nRight. I can do better. Uh-huh.\\n\\nThe Two of Cups, a powerful bond.\\n\\nBut between whom? A brother and sister perhaps?\\n\\nAnd I see a name. Yes, it\\'s...\\n\\nRene.\\n\\nWhat do you want?\\n\\nThe Devil.\\n\\nWhy are we playing this game?\\n\\nWhere did you get this?\\n\\nI stole it from a woman in an auction room, but I believe it was intended for you.\\n\\n\"Found my purpose in life.\"\\n\\nSo the question I\\'ve been holding is, what purpose is Rene fulfilling?\\n\\nTime is up.\\n\\nI have other clients.\\n\\nThough you may not have detected the wisp of astrakhan fur... snagged on a nail over my left shoulder... you couldn\\'t have failed to notice the overpowering aroma... of herring pickled in vodka... in tandem with a truly unfortunate body odor.\\n\\nThere\\'s a man concealed in the rafters above us.\\n\\nA Cossack, renowned for their infeasible acrobatic abilities... and are notorious for moonlighting as assassins.\\n\\nSo it\\'s safe to presume that your next client is here to k*ll you.\\n\\nAnything else? No?\\n\\nFirst, pillage the nest.\\n\\nClip wings.\\n\\nNow blunt his beak.\\n\\ncr*ck eggs.\\n\\nScramble. Pinch of salt.\\n\\nTouch of pepper.\\n\\nFlip the omelet.\\n\\nAdditional seasoning required.\\n\\nBreakfast is served.\\n\\nCome with me. I need you alive. Now.\\n\\nOh!\\n\\nDidn\\'t see that in the cards, did you?\\n\\nOh...\\n\\nComing down, folks, coming down.\\n\\nLooks like we\\'ve got ourselves our next cockfight.\\n\\nFive, four, three, two, one... let him go!\\n\\nGet up there!\\n\\nAll mine?\\n\\nNow, wait a minute.\\n\\nYou\\'re right. He did stink.\\n\\nHey, you can run--\\n\\nWhere\\'s you?\\n\\nJust had a fight.\\n\\nJust had a fight. Yes.\\n\\nWhere were you? I\\'m glad to see... you\\'re taking your best-man duties so seriously.\\n\\nI was on my own! Not gonna get my monies!\\n\\nShe was biting my leg.\\n\\nI\\'ll have Carruthers put some fuel into that motor carriage of yours.\\n\\nYou do have a wedding to attend.\\n\\nOh, I\\'ll drive.\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\nHo-honk.\\n\\nLet\\'s have another drink. No, no, I think you\\'ve had quite enough.\\n\\nPresent arms!\\n\\nI\\'ve been to a wedding here before.\\n\\nFuneral too.\\n\\nThe professor wants to meet.\\n\\nI\\'d expected to hear from him sooner, in light of recent events.\\n\\nHe was wondering if it\\'d be convenient for you to come by the college this afternoon.\\n\\nHis lecture concludes at 4.\\n\\nLooking forward.\\n\\nOne side, chummy.\\n\\n\"Fischerweise,\" Schubert, 1826.\\n\\n\"Give up your foolish trickery.\" \"This fish you cannot cheat.\"\\n\\nI hope I\\'m not intruding.\\n\\nExcuse me. Matthew, take these up to Mr. Williams.\\n\\nAnd make sure he packs my white tie and tails.\\n\\nI\\'ll take care of it, professor. Thank you. I do apologize.\\n\\nI\\'m off on a blasted lecture tour. Would you care for some tea or coffee?\\n\\nNeither. Something stronger, perhaps?\\n\\nNo, but might I trouble you for an inscription?\\n\\nI read that the good doctor was to be married today.\\n\\nHow was the service?\\n\\nDefinitive.\\n\\nHe\\'ll no longer be party to my investigations. He\\'s out of the equation.\\n\\nI trust you\\'ll take this into consideration.\\n\\nAnd what considerations will you grant me?\\n\\nHave you actually read the book?\\n\\nI found it compelling... though I\\'m primarily interested in your more recent endeavors.\\n\\nI take that as a compliment.\\n\\nI have the utmost regard for your talents.\\n\\nIt\\'s a pleasure to finally meet you... officially.\\n\\nAre you familiar with the study of graphology?\\n\\nI\\'ve never given it any serious thought, no.\\n\\nThe psychological analysis of handwriting.\\n\\nThe upward strokes on the P, the J, and the M indicate a genius-level intellect.\\n\\nWhile the flourishes on the lower zone... denote a highly creative yet meticulous nature.\\n\\nBut if one observes the overall slant and the pressure of the writing... there\\'s a suggestion of acute narcissism, a complete lack of empathy... and a pronounced inclination toward-- No. moral insanity.\\n\\nIn answer to your previous request regarding Dr. Watson not being involved... the answer is no.\\n\\nThe laws of celestial mechanics dictate that when two objects collide... there is always damage of a collateral nature.\\n\\nExempli gratia.\\n\\nTwo gentlemen find themselves at cross-purposes.\\n\\nA young woman torn between them.\\n\\nThe strain proves too much for her, and she suddenly falls ill... with tragic consequences.\\n\\nA rare form of tuberculosis.\\n\\nShe succumbed in a matter of seconds.\\n\\nNow... are you sure you want to play this game?\\n\\nI\\'m afraid you\\'d lose.\\n\\nRest assured, if you attempt to bring destruction down upon me...\\n\\nI shall do the same to you.\\n\\nMy respect for you, Mr. Holmes, is the only reason you\\'re still alive.\\n\\nYou\\'ve paid me several compliments.\\n\\nLet me pay you one in return when I say that if I were assured of the former eventuality...\\n\\nI would cheerfully accept the latter.\\n\\nI\\'ll be sure to send my regards to the happy couple.\\n\\nAnother time, then.\\n\\nAll aboard for Brighton! All aboard!\\n\\nWhich coach are we?\\n\\nWe should be just here.\\n\\nFirst class.\\n\\nAll aboard for Brighton! All aboard!\\n\\nHurry up, Dr. Watson, your wife needs you.\\n\\nComing, Mrs. Watson.\\n\\nOh. First class, champagne.\\n\\nYou do know how to spoil a girl, Mr. Watson.\\n\\nYou\\'re not just any girl.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, madam. You can\\'t use the lavatory while the train\\'s in the station.\\n\\nYou\\'re Mrs. Watson.\\n\\nGive me that bottle.\\n\\nJohn, there is nowhere else in the world I would rather be.\\n\\nThere\\'s no one I\\'d rather be with.\\n\\nWhy do you have a g*n stuffed down the back of your trousers?\\n\\nOld habits.\\n\\nCome in.\\n\\nOh, yes, please. We didn\\'t order that.\\n\\nWith our compliments, sir.\\n\\nThank you. Put it there.\\n\\nOpen the door, John.\\n\\nI think it\\'s time for you to leave.\\n\\nSit down.\\n\\nShh.\\n\\nI agree it\\'s not my best disguise, but I had to make do.\\n\\nMy God. They\\'ll be back.\\n\\nJohn, shut the door. They\\'ll only sh**t through it.\\n\\nHe\\'s right, you know. Oh, my God.\\n\\nI understand. Do you?\\n\\nTerribly inconvenient.\\n\\nWe don\\'t have much time.\\n\\nHow many are we expecting? Half a dozen.\\n\\nWho are they? A wedding present from Moriarty.\\n\\nLovely ceremony, by the way. Many a tear shed in joy.\\n\\nOh, John?\\n\\nYeah, just a minute, darling.\\n\\nDo you trust me? No.\\n\\nWell, then I shall have to do something about that.\\n\\nWho\\'s up to bat next, you bastards?\\n\\nSend out the fast bowler!\\n\\nJohn, do shut the door.\\n\\nIt had to be done.\\n\\nShe\\'s safe now.\\n\\nIn my own defense, I timed it perfectly.\\n\\nDid you k*ll my wife?!\\n\\nDid you just k*ll my new wife?!\\n\\nOf course not!\\n\\nWhat do you mean? How do you know that when you just threw her off a train?\\n\\nI told you, I timed it perfectly.\\n\\nWhat does that mean?!\\n\\nCalm down. Explain!\\n\\nBy the time I\\'ve explained, we\\'d both be d*ad!\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, madam. You can\\'t use the lavatory while the train\\'s in the station.\\n\\nThat was no accident.\\n\\nIt was by design.\\n\\nNow, do you need me to elaborate... or can we just cr*ck on?\\n\\nCome on!\\n\\nDon\\'t worry, old boy, she\\'s as safe as houses.\\n\\nShe\\'s with my brother.\\n\\nI\\'m on my honeymoon!\\n\\nWhy did you lead them here?! Why did you involve us?!\\n\\nThey aren\\'t here for me! They\\'re here for you!\\n\\nFortunately...\\n\\nso am I.\\n\\nNow mind the door.\\n\\nGood evening.\\n\\nI think you\\'ll find that second class is more comfortable.\\n\\nThe coast is clear.\\n\\nTo the south, quick march.\\n\\nLie down with me, Watson.\\n\\nWhy? I insist.\\n\\nWhat are we doing down here?\\n\\nWe are waiting. I am smoking.\\n\\nPatiently waiting. For what?\\n\\nYour window of opportunity.\\n\\nMake it count.\\n\\nI said make it count. How many windows must I provide?\\n\\nWho\\'d have known that honeymooning in Brighton was such a dangerous notion?\\n\\nIs that what this is about?\\n\\nBy your own admission, you\\'ve never enjoyed it there.\\n\\nI\\'ve never been to Brighton.\\n\\nOr you\\'re just too fragile to remember at present.\\n\\nOh, shut up.\\n\\nTell me my wife\\'s safe.\\n\\nI can\\'t do both.\\n\\nI promise. As I said, I timed it perfectly.\\n\\nOver here, madam!\\n\\nI believe congratulations are in order, Mrs. Watson.\\n\\nI\\'m the other Holmes.\\n\\nYou mean there\\'s two of you?\\n\\nHow marvelous. Could this evening get any better?\\n\\nWhy were Mary and I targeted at all?\\n\\nExcellent question. The answer is twofold.\\n\\nHe\\'s after us because of you.\\n\\nI\\'m afraid you must bear half the responsibility.\\n\\nHere it comes. So predictable. Had you and Mary... not been hell-bent on wedding, we could\\'ve solved this case.\\n\\nOh, it\\'s my fault now. The argument could be made...\\n\\nNo, it couldn\\'t. that your nuptials were poorly timed.\\n\\nThus, our relationship--\\n\\nRelationship?\\n\\nVery well, partnership. has not yet run its course.\\n\\nMy dear fellow, if you could be bothered to see this through to the end...\\n\\nI shall never again ask you to assist me.\\n\\nOnce more unto the breach.\\n\\nThat\\'s the spirit. Now, to the question.\\n\\nThis is so deliciously complicated. You may be asking yourself... what does a criminal mastermind want with a simple gypsy fortune teller?\\n\\nIt\\'s her brother, I tell you. When we find him, and we must--\\n\\nAfter you find my luggage.\\n\\nGo on.\\n\\nWait.\\n\\nWhere is it we\\'re going?\\n\\nParis, the most sensible honeymoon destination of all.\\n\\nSo why Paris? Peaches.\\n\\nOutside the city at Montreuil... there\\'s a Gypsy camp famous for its dried fruit, especially peaches.\\n\\nAnd there we shall find our fortune teller... and return her bag.\\n\\nAnd my ticket?\\n\\nUnfortunately, you won\\'t be needing yours.\\n\\nThat\\'s a shame, professor. I was looking forward to Don Giovanni.\\n\\nFollow Meinhard.\\n\\nWake up, we\\'re here.\\n\\nBrace yourself. We\\'re about to be violated.\\n\\nDon\\'t be so cynical.\\n\\nThey\\'re taking my luggage. Laugh them away, Watson. I have her bag.\\n\\nYou had her bag.\\n\\nNow they have my coat.\\n\\nWhere is Madam Simza?\\n\\nThis is Simza.\\n\\nSim is a goose.\\n\\nI am Sim.\\n\\nNice scarf. I like.\\n\\nYou hungry? Famished.\\n\\nMadam, this is a glorious hedgehog goulash.\\n\\nI can\\'t remember ever having had better.\\n\\nDo tell me, when was the last time you had a hedgehog goulash?\\n\\nI told you, Watson, I can\\'t remember.\\n\\nPerhaps you\\'ve repressed it.\\n\\nThat\\'s where we differ. Unlike you, I repress nothing.\\n\\nPerfectly normal.\\n\\nHow dare you be rude to this woman who has invited us into her tent... offered us her hedgehog?\\n\\nSays the man who throws women from trains.\\n\\nWho are you two?\\n\\nConcerned citizens.\\n\\nWhy did someone try to k*ll me?\\n\\nYour brother has become involved with a very dangerous man... who clearly believes that Rene has told you something you shouldn\\'t know.\\n\\nI don\\'t know anything.\\n\\nI\\'ve been looking for him for over a year.\\n\\nThat was why I was in London.\\n\\nIt\\'s the last place anyone saw him. It\\'s clear that your brother loves you.\\n\\nHe\\'d never send you a message that would put you in harm\\'s way.\\n\\nAny information, therefore, would be, by default, unintentional.\\n\\nHas he sent you anything else?\\n\\nJust a few drawings.\\n\\nLet\\'s just see what they have to tell us.\\n\\nUnusual choice of paper. Thicker gauge, designed for a printing press.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s the same stock as the letter. Mm.\\n\\nThey smell musty.\\n\\nMust have been stored somewhere cold and damp.\\n\\nWhat\\'s that? Blood?\\n\\nWine. So a wine cellar located near a printing press.\\n\\nThat should narrow it down.\\n\\nThere\\'s a wine cellar used by the anarchist group Lapin Vert.\\n\\nRene was close to their leader.\\n\\nClaude Ravache.\\n\\nA b*mb maker. I sampled some of his work last week.\\n\\nI was a part of the movement. So was Rene.\\n\\nUntil it became too extreme for us.\\n\\nRavache knows me.\\n\\nIf my brother\\'s back there, he will see us.\\n\\nWe will send a message.\\n\\nWhatever you do, don\\'t let these gypsies make you drink.\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nYou dance?\\n\\nFor God\\'s sake, don\\'t dance. It\\'ll be the death of you.\\n\\nYou know what happens when you dance.\\n\\nOh, good morning, Mrs. Watson.\\n\\nHave you had breakfast? I--\\n\\nStanley here does a wonderful deviled kidney.\\n\\nCarruthers? Morning, sir.\\n\\nTelegram for Mrs. Watson.\\n\\nUh....\\n\\nIt just doesn\\'t make any sense.\\n\\nAllow me.\\n\\nOh, yes.\\n\\n\"My most loathed Mary, I do not love you. I never wish to see you again.\\n\\nEvery moment I count away from you is a blessing.\"\\n\\nFret not. It\\'s a double encryption, my dear... that Sherly and I have used since we were boys.\\n\\nIf the first letter of the message is a consonant... then what follows is the mirrored truth.\\n\\nI see. Hmm.\\n\\nStanley!\\n\\nYou know, although our time together has been but a brief interlude...\\n\\nI\\'m beginning to understand how a man of particular disposition... under certain circumstances, extreme ones perhaps... might grow to enjoy the company of... a person of your gender. Hmm. Hmm.\\n\\nThank you so much.\\n\\nMost charming.\\n\\nMay--? Terribly sorry. Thank you.\\n\\nWhere are you going, Stanley?\\n\\nWhoa, whoa.\\n\\nStill hiding in basements?\\n\\nI\\'m not here to see you.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n...with your English friends.\\n\\n1789, a seminal vintage.\\n\\nThe year of our glorious revolution.\\n\\nIs he here? When freedom triumphed over tyranny.\\n\\nIs my brother here?\\n\\nI haven\\'t seen him for a long time.\\n\\nYou\\'re lying.\\n\\nSit, please.\\n\\nA letter was received from Rene using this same paper.\\n\\nOf course. He took it with him wherever he went.\\n\\nHe\\'s telling the truth. Rene isn\\'t here.\\n\\nHe was given another assignment by an-- An anonymous benefactor.\\n\\nAnother Englishman... with money, power, who supported our cause.\\n\\nAnd now... he dictates our every move...\\n\\ndemanding I take responsibility for his acts of terror.\\n\\nI made a deal with the devil.\\n\\nBut after tonight... it will be over.\\n\\nMy job is almost done.\\n\\nHe\\'s had you plant another b*mb, hasn\\'t he?\\n\\nClaude, please.\\n\\nThese men can help you.\\n\\nI wish they could.\\n\\nYou see, gentlemen... he has my wife and children.\\n\\nIf you tell us where the b*mb is...\\n\\nI\\'ll find a way to help your family. That\\'s already taken care of.\\n\\nWe have a deal.\\n\\nHe and I.\\n\\nNo loose ends.\\n\\nThere\\'s only one thing I can do to keep my family safe.\\n\\nYou have less than 10 minutes. Don\\'t!\\n\\nHe has no further need of that p*stol. Why don\\'t you take it and cover the stairs?\\n\\nThere\\'s only one way out of this place.\\n\\nRight you are.\\n\\nAh. Ingenious.\\n\\nThat\\'s the one. Quickly as we can.\\n\\nYou know what to do with that sandbag, Watson.\\n\\nQuick now.\\n\\nDoctor, could you secure that lever?\\n\\nYou could have told me.\\n\\nRavache was strong. He lived for liberty. He would never take his own life.\\n\\nCalm yourself.\\n\\nMy brother, he\\'s weak.\\n\\nSim, I need you to take a deep breath... and follow us.\\n\\nTo the opera.\\n\\nI was mistaken.\\n\\nWhat? I made a mistake.\\n\\nHe took the sh*t from here.\\n\\nUsing a tripod and a sh**ting stick.\\n\\nAnd realized there was a better position.\\n\\nThere\\'s a faint scrape where he dragged his tripod and set it up here.\\n\\nSix hundred yards? Or 650?\\n\\nNot to mention a seven- or eight-mile-an-hour wind.\\n\\nHe would\\'ve needed a wind gauge.\\n\\nWhich he placed here.\\n\\nAnd put a cigarette down here.\\n\\nCan anyone sh**t that far?\\n\\nNot more than half a dozen men in all of Europe.\\n\\nHow many of those men served in Afghanistan?\\n\\nWhy? Hirschsprung with a touch of Tekel.\\n\\nMust have fallen out when he was rolling up.\\n\\nWasn\\'t that the blend you all smoked?\\n\\nDidn\\'t I read something about a colonel? Sebastian Moran.\\n\\nBest marksman in the British army.\\n\\nDishonorable discharge.\\n\\nHe\\'s likely now a g*n for hire. This is the second victim of his that I\\'ve encountered.\\n\\nWhat better way to conceal a k*lling?\\n\\nNo one looks for a b*llet hole in a b*mb blast.\\n\\nHe\\'s 20 minutes late. He must come soon.\\n\\nI don\\'t have any papers.\\n\\nAnd I am a foreigner.\\n\\nThis climate is exactly what Moriarty wants.\\n\\nThe omelet fines herbes was divine... but they spared every expense on the tea.\\n\\nNow shall we compare moods, or consider what we know?\\n\\nLast night\\'s b*mb was clearly meant... to look like Germany\\'s retaliation for Strasbourg.\\n\\nHowever, the b*mb was also meant to conceal the m*rder of just one man.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe man k*lled by the g*n was none other than Alfred Meinhard.\\n\\nHe makes g*n. Big g*n.\\n\\nOnly days ago, a large share of his company was bought by an unknown investor.\\n\\nMoriarty.\\n\\nThe clues point in one direction, but to avoid repeating last night\\'s debacle...\\n\\nI was obliged to collect more sufficient data, hence my tardiness.\\n\\nTrain departs in 40 minutes, sir.\\n\\nWhoa!\\n\\nJust the bags. But....\\n\\nWe have enough time for me to indulge my little habit.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\n\\nHis habit of feeding that urban species, the feral pigeon.\\n\\nSo there are seven mainline railway stations in Paris.\\n\\nBut taking 10 minutes to get to the Jardin des Tuileries... where the largest concentration of the winged vermin may be found... reduces there to one, the Gare du Nord... where he will be just in time to catch the 11:04 train to Berlin.\\n\\nIt makes several stops along the way, one of which is--\\n\\nHeilbronn.\\n\\nExactly where we must go.\\n\\nWhere Meinhard\\'s factory is.\\n\\nIt\\'s Moriarty\\'s factory now.\\n\\nUnfortunately, due to the b*mb... the crossing between France and Germany is to be closed.\\n\\nI\\'m afraid our pursuit is over unless we can happen upon a comrade... who knows their way around borders.\\n\\nToo English.\\n\\nHowever, you do make a fantastic gypsy.\\n\\nCertainly smell like a fantastic gypsy.\\n\\nNow, now, no need to be demeaning.\\n\\nIt is a nice scarf.\\n\\nNo, no, too English. It\\'ll suit you more.\\n\\nBlack one is yours. Gray one is mine.\\n\\nAnd this is for you. Um... Hmm.\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nWhere are the wagons? The wagon is too slow.\\n\\nCan\\'t you ride?\\n\\nIt\\'s not that he can\\'t ride.\\n\\nHow is it you put it, Holmes?\\n\\nThey\\'re dangerous at both ends and crafty in the middle.\\n\\nWhy would I want anything with a mind of its own bobbing about between my legs?\\n\\nThen I shall require a bicycle, thank you very much.\\n\\nIt\\'s 1891. Could\\'ve chartered a balloon.\\n\\nHow can we make this more manageable?\\n\\nWhere\\'s the f*re?\\n\\nIt\\'s not as if Germany is going somewhere.\\n\\nWe know another way.\\n\\nSlow and steady wins the race.\\n\\nCome on!\\n\\nWe slip in through the loading bay, find out what he\\'s doing... and we get out.\\n\\nGetting out might be tricky.\\n\\nWe will get you out.\\n\\nIf my brother\\'s in there, get him out alive.\\n\\nAre you happy?\\n\\nWhat? At this moment... are you as happy as you would be on your honeymoon in Brighton?\\n\\nI\\'m not going to grace that question with an answer.\\n\\nAre you happy? I think we\\'re here for another reason.\\n\\nOkay. Shall we get on--?\\n\\nSimple question. Will we do something?\\n\\nOr wait for them to come back round? What time is it?\\n\\nThree-fifteen.

Rene has blue eyes.\\n\\nHe could be wearing glass lenses to change the color.\\n\\nIn which case, his eyes will be hurting.\\n\\nRene is left-handed.\\n\\nPerhaps the assassin will take measures... to ensure he doesn\\'t give himself away.\\n\\nLike a gambler concealing a tell.\\n\\nI think it might be him.\\n\\nYou think?\\n\\nYour clock is ticking.\\n\\nYou have to be sure.\\n\\nMay I remind you, this is blitz chess.\\n\\nA single miscalculation will cost you the game.\\n\\nIf I tackle the wrong man to the ground, I could start a w*r.\\n\\nMaybe it\\'s less obvious.\\n\\nA nervous tic.

PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1\\n\\n          A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set\\n          amid endless flat, arid scrubland.

Suddenly, the roof panels\\n          of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a\\n          variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point\\n          at the sky.\\n          JANE FOSTER (late 20\\'s) pops her head through the roof. She\\n          positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the\\n          constellations above.

Jane passes it to\\n          Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large\\n          and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the\\n          foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.\\n\\n          JANE (CONT\\'D)\\n          Not until you see it!\\n\\n                         SELVIG\\n          (re: the gloves)\\n          I recognize those.

ODIN\\'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 160\\n\\n          A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three\\n          sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between\\n          Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting\\n          their battle with the Destroyer.\\n\\n                         VOLSTAGG\\n          ...and then, with a mighty bellow,\\n          I flew at the great metal beast and\\n          laid it low...\\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113.\\n\\n                         FANDRAL\\n          Is that another way of saying you\\n          fell on your huge a--\\n\\n                         VOLSTAGG\\n          As a matter of fact, falling down\\n          was a tactic.

That makes me the\\n          real hero. Doesn\\'t it, Hogun?\\n          Hogun points to Volstagg.\\n\\n                         HOGUN\\n          Big stomach.\\n          (points to Fandral)\\n          Big mouth.\\n          The other gathered Asgardians laugh.

Sif notices, approaches\\n          Frigga, bows her head.\\n\\n                         SIF\\n          My Queen. I am so sorry for your\\n          loss.\\n          Frigga takes Sif\\'s hand appreciatively.\\n\\n                         FRIGGA\\n          Thank you, Sif.\\n          She looks to Thor, who\\'s unable to enjoy the merriment around\\n          him.\\n\\n          FRIGGA (CONT\\'D)\\n          How is he?\\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.\\n\\n                         SIF\\n          He mourns for his brother. And he\\n          misses her. The mortal.\\n          Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif\\'s face as she looks at\\n          Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.\\n\\n                         FRIGGA\\n          He will need his friends now more\\n          than ever.\\n\\n                         SIF\\n          I will always be at his side.\\n          Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.\\n\\n          161 EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161\\n\\n          Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin\\n          walks up behind him.\\n\\n                         ODIN\\n          You\\'ll be a wise King.\\n\\n                         THOR\\n          There will never be a wiser king\\n          than you.

RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162\\n\\n          Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost\\n          energy, drifting off into space.\\n          Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.\\n          Thor stares out at the stellar void.\\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 114.\\n\\n                         THOR\\n          Can you see her?\\n          Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.\\n\\n                         HEIMDALL\\n          Yes.\\n\\n                         THOR\\n          How is she?\\n\\n          163 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163\\n\\n          Through the window into Jane\\'s lab, we see an enlarged\\n          ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull\\n          away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly\\n          inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see\\n          that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research\\n          facility, abuzz with activity.\\n          SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-\\n          the-art equipment.\\n          Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the\\n          SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass\\n          windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the\\n          roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at\\n          hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE\\n          before her, which bears the \"STARK INDUSTRIES\"� logo.\\n          From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.\\n\\n                         DARCY\\n          Here you go.\\n\\n                         JANE\\n          Thanks.\\n          Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.\\n\\n                         DARCY\\n          He would have come back if he\\n          could.\\n\\n                         JANE\\n          I know. But if he can\\'t get here\\n          on his own...\\n          Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D\\n          HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device,\\n          bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is --\\n          YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.\\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n\"\\n\\n           JANE (CONT\\'D)\\n           ...maybe we can help him find his\\n           way back.\\n\\n          164 OMITTED COMBINED WITH SCENE 163 ABOVE 164\\n\\n                          FADE OUT:\\n\\n                          THE END\\n\\n                         \\n\\n                         \\n'"
