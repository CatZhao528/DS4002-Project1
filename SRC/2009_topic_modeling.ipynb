What a pathetic excuse for a school.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI think I\\'ll pitch myself off the astronomy tower\\nat the thought I have to continue for another two years.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What\\'s that supposed to mean?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s just that I can\\'t see myself\\nwaisting time in charms class next year.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAmused, Gless?\\nWe\\'ll see just who\\'s laughing in the end.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You two go on. Wanna check something.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Where\\'s Harry?\\n- Probably already half up. Come on.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Didn\\'t mommy ever tell you\\nit was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?\\n\\n\\n  \\nPETRIFICUS TOTALUS!\\n\\n\\n  \\nOh yeah. She was dead before you\\ncould wipe the drawl off your chin.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s for my father. And\\nyou\\'re going right back to London.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Penihe.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHello, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Luna. How did you know where I was?\\n- Racksbirds. Your head\\'s full of them.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sorry, I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna.\\n- That\\'s all right. It was like being with a friend.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well, I am your friend, Luna.\\n- That\\'s nice.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ah, about time. I\\'ve been looking all over\\nfor you two. All right. Names?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Professor Flitwick, you know me for five years.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No exceptions, Potter.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Who are those people?\\n- Aurors. For security.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What\\'s this cane here, then?\\n- It\\'s not a cane, you... old...\\n\\n\\n  \\n- And what is that...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...be considered an offensive weapon?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s all right, Mr. Filch.\\nI can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Nice face, Potter.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Would you like me to fix it for you?\\n\\n\\n  \\nPersonally I think you look a bit more\\ndevil-may-care this way, but it\\'s up to you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Umm... Have you ever\\nfixed a nose before?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No, but I\\'ve done several toes.\\nAnd how different are they, really?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Umm, okay, yeah, give it a go.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Episky.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- How do I look?\\n- Exceptionally ordinary.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Brilliant.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Worried? He\\'ll be here in a bit.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well, turn around you lunatic.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Will you stop eating?\\nYour best friend is missing.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- He\\'s covered in blood again.\\nWhy is it he\\'s always covered in blood?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Looks like it\\'s his own this time.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Where have you been?\\nWhat happened to your face?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Nothing. Blood.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sorry, her urge is to be brave\\nand strong in these troubled times.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- ???\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Very best of evenings to you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nFirst off, let me introduce the newest\\nmember of our staff: Horace Slughorn.\\n\\n\\n  \\nProfessor Slughorn, I\\'m happy to say, has agreed\\nto assume his old post as potions master.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMeanwhile, the post of the defence against\\nthe Dark Arts will be taken by Professor Snape.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAs you know, each and everyone of you was\\nsearched upon your arrival here tonight.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd you have the right to know why.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOnce, there was a young man who, like you, sat in this\\nvery hall, walked this castle\\'s corridors, slept under its roof.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe seemed to all the world\\na student like any other.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHis name:\\n\\n\\n  \\nTom Riddle.\\n\\n\\n  \\nToday of course he\\'s known\\nall over the world by another name.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhich is why, as I stand looking out upon\\nyou tonight, I\\'m reminded of a sobering fact:\\n\\n\\n  \\nEvery day, every hour, this very minute perhaps,\\ndark forces attempt to penetrate this castle\\'s walls.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut in the end their greatest weapon is you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- That was cheerful.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Straight magic is upstairs, ladies, not down.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMr. Levis, that is the girl\\'s lavatory.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPotter.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Now this can\\'t be good.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Enjoying ourselves, are we?\\n- What, I have free period this morning, professor.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- So I noticed.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI would think you would want to fill it with potions.\\nOr is it no longer your ambition to become an auror?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It was, but I was told I had to\\nget an \"outstanding\" in my O.W.L.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- So you did when professor\\nSnape was teaching potions.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHowever professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept\\nmute students with \"exceeds expectations\".\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Brilliant. Well, I\\'ll head there straight away.\\n- Good, good.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPotter, take Weasley with you.\\nHe looks far too happy over there.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I don\\'t wanna take potions.\\nThere\\'s quidditch tryouts coming up, I need to practice.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- ... to detail in the preparation is the prerequisite of all...\\nAh. Harry, old boy. I was beginning to worry.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWe\\'ve got someone with us, I see.\\n- Ron Weasley, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m dead awful at potions, I\\'m menaced\\nactually, so I\\'ll probably just go.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Nonsense. We\\'ll sort you out.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAny friend of Harry\\'s is a friend of mine.\\nGet your books out.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSorry, Sir, I haven\\'t actually got my book yet. Nor does Ron.\\n- Not to worry, then, get you one from the cupboard.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning.\\nAny ideas what these might be?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYes, Miss...\\n- Granger, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThat one there is Veritaserum. It\\'s a truth telling serum.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd that one...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...terribly tricky to make. And this is Amortentia.\\nThe most powerful love potion in the world.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s rumoured to smell differently to each\\nperson according to what attracts them.\\n\\n\\n  \\nFor example I smell freshly mown grass and\\nnew parchment and spearmint toothpaste.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Now, amortentia doesn\\'t create actual love, that\\'d be impossible,\\nbut it does cause powerful infatuation or obsession.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd for that reason it is probably the\\nmost dangerous potion in this room.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sir, you haven\\'t told us what\\'s in that one.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ah, yes. What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen,\\nis a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut it is more commonly referred to as...\\n- Liquid luck.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes, Miss Granger.\\n\\n\\n  \\nLiquid luck.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDesperately tricky to make,\\ndisastrous should you get it wrong.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOne sip and you\\'ll find that\\nall of your endeavours succeed.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAt least until the effects wear off.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSo, this is what I offer each of you today.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOne tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who, in the hour\\nthat remains manages to brew an acceptable draft of Living Death.\\n\\n\\n  \\nRecipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou should not doubt however: Only once did a student manage\\nto brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this price.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNevertheless, good luck to you all.\\nLet the brewing commence.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- How did you do that?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Crush it, don\\'t cut it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No, the instructions specifically say to cut.\\n- Oh, really.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Merlin\\'s beard. It\\'s perfect.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSo perfect I dare say\\none drop would kill us all.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHere we are, then, as promised.\\nOne vial of Felix Felicis.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCongratulations. Use it well.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ah, Harry, you got my message. Come in.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHow are you?\\n- Fine, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Enjoying your classes?\\n\\n\\n  \\nI know professor Slughorn is most impressed with you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I think he overestimates my abilities, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Do you?\\n- Definitely.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What about your activities outside the class room?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sir?\\n- Well, I noticed you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI can\\'t help wondering if...\\n- Oh, no, no. I mean...\\n\\n\\n  \\nShe\\'s brilliant, and we\\'re friends, but... no.\\n- Forgive me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI was mainly being curious.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut enough chit chat.\\nYou must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe answer lies here.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat you\\'re looking at are memories.\\nIn this case pertaining to one individual: Voldemort.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOr as he was known then: Tom Riddle.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThis vial contains the most particular memory of the day I first met him.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'d like you to see it, if you would.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I must admit to some confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn all the years Tom\\'s been here he\\'s never once had a family visitor.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThere have been incidents with the other children.\\nNasty things.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTom, you have a visitor.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- How do you do, Tom?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Don\\'t!\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re a doctor, aren\\'t you?\\n- No. I\\'m a professor.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I don\\'t believe you.\\nShe wants me locked up.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI think I\\'m different.\\n- Well, perhaps they\\'re right.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m not mad.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.\\nHogwarts is a school.\\n\\n\\n  \\nA school of magic.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou can do things, can\\'t you, Tom?\\n\\n\\n  \\nThings other children can\\'t.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I can make things move without touching them.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI can make animals do what I want without training them.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI can make bad things happen to people who\\'re mean to me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI can make them hurt if I want.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWho are you?\\n- Well, I\\'m like you Tom.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m different.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Prove it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I think there\\'s something in your\\nwardrobe trying to get out, Tom.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAt Hogwarts you\\'ll be taught not only\\nhow to use magic but how to control it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDo you understand me?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I can speak to snakes, too.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThey find me, whisper things.\\nIs that normal for someone like me?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Did you know, Sir? Then?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Did I know I just met the most dangerous\\ndark wizard of all times? No.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIf I had, I...\\n\\n\\n  \\nOver time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle\\ngrew close to one particular teacher.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCan you guess who that teacher might be?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You didn\\'t bring professor Slughorn back\\nsimply to teach potions, did you, Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No, I did not.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou see, professor Slughorn posesses something\\nI desire very dearly.  But he will not give it up easily.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You said professor Slughorn would try to collect me.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I did.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Do you want me to let him?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ahem. Okay, so this morning I\\'m going to be putting you\\nall through a few drills just to assess your strengths.\\n\\n\\n  \\nQuiet, please.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- SHUT IT!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Thanks. All right.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow then, remember, just because you made the team last\\nyear does not guarantee you a spot this year, is that clear?\\n\\n\\n  \\nGood.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hard feelings?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yeah, I\\'ll be going for keeper as well, it\\'s nothing personal.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Really? It\\'s ???, you\\'ve got more\\nof a beaters build, don\\'t you think?\\n\\n\\n  \\nKeepers need to be quick, agile.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I like my chances.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSay, you think you could introduce\\nme to your friend Granger?\\n\\n\\n  \\nWouldn\\'t mind getting on a first\\nname basis, know what I mean?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Come on, Ron. Come on.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Come on, Ron.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Confundus.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I have to admit, I thought I was going to miss that last one.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHope Cormac is not taking it too hard.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione, Cormac.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- He\\'s vile.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Have you ever heard of a spell Sectum Sempra?\\n- No, I haven\\'t.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd if you had a shred of self respect you\\'d hand that book in.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Not bloody likely. He\\'s top of the class.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s even better than you, Hermione.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSlughorn thinks he\\'s a genius.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'d like to know whose that book was. Let\\'s have a look, shall we?\\n- No.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Why not?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- The binding is fragile.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- The binding is fragile?\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Who\\'s the Half Blood Prince?\\n- Who?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- That\\'s what it says, right here.\\nThis book is property of the Half Blood Prince.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- For weeks you carry about this book.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou practically sleep with it, and yet you have no\\ndesire to find out who the Half Blood Prince is?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I didn\\'t say, I wasn\\'t curious and I don\\'t sleep with it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well that\\'s true. When I ??? go to bed,\\nanything you do is read that bloody book.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s just like being with Hermione.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well, I was curious, so I went to...\\n- ... the library.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- And?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- And nothing.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI couldn\\'t find a reference anywhere to a Half Blood Prince.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- There you go, that settles it then.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- ... hoping to find you in the three Broomsticks.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ah, no, emergency choir practice I\\'m afraid, Horace.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Does anyone fancy a butter beer?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- ... Clagsby Hill, we had a... long, homemade norwegian style...\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No, sit beside me.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- \\'kay.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Something to drink?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Um, three butter beers and some ginger wine, please.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, bloody hell.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSlick git.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Honestly, Ron, they\\'re only holding hands.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd snogging.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'d like to leave.\\n- What?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou can\\'t be serious.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- That happens to be my sister.\\n- So?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What if she looked at me and saw you snogging me,\\nwould you expect her to get up and leave?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hey, my boy.\\n- Hello, Sir, wonderful to see you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- And you, and you.\\n- So, what brings you here?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back,\\nfurther than I care to admit.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI could have ??? with one Broomstick.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOh, hands on deck, Granger.\\nListen my boy:...\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn the old days I used to throw together\\nthe occasional supper party.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSelect studenthood.\\nWould you be game?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'d consider it an honour, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You\\'ll be welcome, too, Granger.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'d be delighted, Sir.\\n- Splendid. Look for my owl.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGood to see you, Wallanby.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What are you playing at?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Dumbledore\\'s asked me to get to know him.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Get to know him?\\n- Downright.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt must be important.\\nIf it wasn\\'t, Dumbledore wouldn\\'t ask.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Got... you\\'ve... a bit...\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Katie, you don\\'t know what it could be.\\n- Don\\'t worry, I know what I\\'m doing.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Harry, did she mean what she was saying back\\nat the pub about me and her snogging?\\n\\n\\n  \\nAs if.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Wands out. I warned her not to touch it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Don\\'t get any closer.\\nGet back, all of you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, now, now, now...\\n\\n\\n  \\nDo not touch that except for the wrappers,\\ndo you understand?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You\\'re sure, Katie did not have this in her\\nposession when she entered the Three Broomsticks?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s like I said. She left to go to the loo,\\nand when she came back she had the package.\\n\\n\\n  \\nShe said it was important that she deliver it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Did she say to whom?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- To professor Dumbledore.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Very well, thank you, Lianne, you may go.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy is it when something happens\\nit is always you three?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Believe me, professor, I\\'ve been asking myself\\nthe same question for six years.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, Severus.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat do you think?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I think, Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- She was cursed, wasn\\'t she?\\n\\n\\n  \\nI know Katie, off the quidditch pitch she wouldn\\'t hurt a fly.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIf she was delivering that to professor Dumbledore\\nshe wasn\\'t doing it knowingly.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes, she was cursed.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It was Malfoy.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- That is a very serious accusation, Potter.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Indeed.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYour evidence?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I just know.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You just... know.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Aren\\'t you getting astonished with your gifts, Potter?\\nGifts mere mortals can only dream of posessing.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHow grand it must be to be the chosen one.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I suggest you go back to your dormitories.\\nAll of you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What do you suppose Dean sees in her, Ginny?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What does she see in him?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Dean? He\\'s brilliant.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You called him slick git not five hours ago.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yeah, well, he was running his hands all\\nover my sister, wasn\\'t he?\\n\\n\\n  \\nSomething snaps, you\\'ve got to hate him, you know.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOn principle.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I suppose.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- So, what is it he sees in her?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I don\\'t know.\\nShe\\'s smart. Funny.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAttractive.\\n- Attractive?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You know, she\\'s got nice skin.\\n- Skin?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re saying Dean\\'s dating my\\nsister because of her skin?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Look, no, I mean, I\\'m just...\\nI\\'m just saying it could be a contributing factor.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hermione\\'s got nice skin,\\nwouldn\\'t you say, as skin goes, I mean.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'ve never really thought about it, but...\\nI suppose, yeah. Very nice.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI think I\\'ll be going to sleep now.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Right.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- So tell me Cormac, you see anything\\nof your uncle Tiberius these days?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes, Sir. In fact I meant to go hunting with\\nhim and the minister for magic over the holidays.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ah, well, be sure to give them both my best.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What about your uncle, Belby? For those of you who don\\'t know,\\nMarcuses uncle invented the wolfsbane potion.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIs he working on anything new?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Don\\'t know.\\nHe and me dad don\\'t get on.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPoor git says me dadses potions are rubbish.\\nHis only potion worth anything is a stiff one at the end of the day.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What about you, Miss Granger. What exactly does\\nyour family do in the muggle world?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- My parents are dentists.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThey attend to people\\'s teeth.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Fascinating.\\nAnd is that considered a dangerous profession?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAlthough, one boy, Robbie Fenwick, did\\nbite my father once. He needed ten stitches.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ah, Miss Weasley.\\nCome in, come in.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Look at her eyes.\\nThey\\'ve been fighting again, her and Dean.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sorry, I\\'m not usually late.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No matter. Just in time for desert.\\nThat is if Belby\\'s left you any.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What?\\n- Nothing.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Good bye.\\nBye-bye.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Potter.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m sorry, Sir, I was just\\nadmiring your hour glass.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ah, yes, most intriguing object.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe sand runs in accordance with\\nthe quality of the conversation.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIf it is stimulating,\\nthe sand runs slowly.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIf it is not...\\n- I think I\\'ll be going then.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Nonsense.\\nYou have nothing to fear, dear boy.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAs for some of your class mates,\\nwell, let\\'s just say they\\'re unlikely to make the shelf.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- The shelf, Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Anyone who aspires to be anyone\\nhopes to end up here.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut then again, you already\\nare someone, aren\\'t you, Harry?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou knew him, didn\\'t you, Sir? Tom Riddle?\\nYou were his teacher.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMr. Riddle had a number of teachers\\nwhilst here at Hogwarts.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What was he like?\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m sorry, Sir. Forgive me.\\nHe killed my parents.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Of course, it\\'s only natural you should\\nwant to know more.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut I\\'m afraid, I must disappoint you, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhen I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet, obedient,\\nbrilliant boy committed to becoming a first rate wizard.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNot unlike others I\\'ve known.\\nNot unlike yourself, in fact.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIf the monster existed,\\nit was buried deep within.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Good luck today, Ron.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- We\\'re counting on you, Ron.\\nI\\'ve two galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- So, how was it, then?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- How was what?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Your dinner party?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Pretty boring, actually.\\nAlthough I think Harry enjoyed desert.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSlughorn\\'s having christmas, too, you know.\\nAnd we\\'re meant to bring someone.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI expect you\\'ll be bringing McLaggen.\\nHe\\'s in the Slug club, isn\\'t he?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Actually, I was going to ask you.\\n- Really?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Good luck today, Ron.\\nI know you\\'ll be brilliant.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m resigning.\\nAfter today\\'s match McLaggen can have my spot.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Have it your way.\\nJuice?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hello, everyone.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou look dreadful, Ron.\\nIs that why you put something in his cup?\\n\\n\\n  \\nIs it a tonic?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Liquid luck?\\n\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t drink it, Ron.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou could be expelled for that.\\n- I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Come on, Harry.\\nWe\\'ve got a game to win.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- YES!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Weasley!

Weasley!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You shouldn\\'t have done it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I know.\\nI suppose I could have just used a confundus charm.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- That was different.\\nThat was tryouts, this was an actual game.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou didn\\'t put it in?\\n\\n\\n  \\nRon only thought you did.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCharm spell.\\nJust practicing.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- They\\'re really good.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- How does it feel, Harry?\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhen you see Dean with Ginny?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- How...? How...\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I know.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI see the way you look at her.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re my best friend.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oops.\\nI think that we\\'re mistaken.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What\\'s with the birds?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oppugno!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It feels like this.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I can\\'t help her if she\\'s got\\nknickers in a twist.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd what Lav and I have...\\nwell, let\\'s just say, there\\'s no stopping it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s chemical.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWill it last?\\nWho knows.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPoint is, I\\'m a free agent.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- He\\'s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.\\nI really couldn\\'t care less.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWas I under the impression, he and I\\nwould be attending Slughorns christmas party together?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, given the circumstances,\\nI\\'ve had to make other arrangements.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Have you?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes. Why?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well I just thought seeing as neither of us can\\ngo with who we\\'d really like to, we should go together.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAs friends.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy didn\\'t I think of that?\\n\\n\\n  \\nWho are you going with?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Umm, it\\'s a surprise.\\nAnyway, it\\'s you we\\'ve got to worry about.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou can\\'t take anyone.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSee that girl over there?\\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s Romilda Vane.\\n\\n\\n  \\nApparently she\\'s trying to smuggle you a love potion.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Really?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hey, she\\'s only interested in you because\\nshe thinks you\\'re the chosen one.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- But I am the chosen one.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Right. Sorry. Umm...\\nGetting... umm...\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ll ask someone I like.\\nSomeone cool.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'ve never been to this part of the castle.\\nAt least not while awake.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI sleepwalk, you see.\\nThat\\'s why I wear shoes to bed.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hommonia nectare passus.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hommonia nectare passus.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hommonia nectare passus.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Drink?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Neville.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I didn\\'t get into the Slug club.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s okay, though.\\nHe\\'s got Belby handing out towels in the loo.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m fine thanks.\\n- \\'kay.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hermione. What are you doing?\\nWhat happened to you?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'ve just escaped.

He asked me to give you his best\\nand he hopes you enjoy your holidays.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s travelling and he won\\'t return until term resumes.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Travelling where?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Aww, take your hands off me, filthy squibb.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Professor Slughorn, Sir. I\\'ve just discovered this\\nboy lurking in an upstairs corridor.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe claims to have been invited to your party.\\n- Okay, okay, I was gate crashing.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHappy?\\n- I\\'ll escort him out.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Certainly, professor.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You had to ???, and you didn\\'t.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat\\'s it to you?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- A squat of attention.\\nI made the unbreakable vow.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I don\\'t need protection.\\nI was chosen for this.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOut of all of us. Me.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You\\'re afraid, Drako.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'d hate to consider it, but it\\'s obvious.\\nLet me assist you!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No!\\n\\n\\n  \\nI was chosen.\\nThis is my moment.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- The unbreakable vow.\\nYou\\'re sure that\\'s what Snape said?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Positive. Why?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s just you can\\'t break an unbreakable vow.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I... I... worked that thing out myself, funny enough.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Can\\'t understand.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOh, bloody hell.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'ll miss you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Lovely.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- All she wants to do is snogg me.\\nMy lips are getting chapped blue.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'ll take your word for it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSo what happens to you?\\nWhat happens if you break an unbreakable vow?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You die.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- So Voldemort has chosen Drako Malfoy for a mission.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I know it sounds bad.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending\\nto offer Drako help, so he could find out what he was after?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- That\\'s not what it sounded like.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Perhaps Harry\\'s right, Remus.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI mean to make an unbreakable vow...\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It comes down to whether or not\\nyou trust Dumbledore\\'s judgement.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Dumbledore can make mistakes, he said so himself.\\n- You\\'re blinded by hatred!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m not.\\n- Yes you are.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- People are disappearing, Harry, daily.\\nWe can only place our trust in a handfull of people.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIf we start fighting amongst ourselves we are doomed.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ginny?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Open up, you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t you trust me?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s good.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Pie?\\n- Not for me, no.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You\\'ll have to forgive Remus.\\nIt takes its toll, his condition.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- We\\'re being followed, all of us.\\nMost days, Molly doesn\\'t leave the house.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s not been easy.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Did you get my owl?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes, I did.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIf Dumbledore\\'s travelling, then that\\'s news to the ministry,\\nbut perhaps that\\'s the way, Dumbledore wants it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAs for Drako Malfoy, I know a bit more.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Go on.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI think from what you described what you\\nand Ron saw at the end of the summer...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...the object, that Drako is so interested in, is a vanishing cabinet.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- A vanishing cabinet?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou can see the appeal.\\n\\n\\n  \\nShould the Death Eaters come knocking, one simply\\nhad to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCan transport you practically anywhere.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTricky contraptions though, very temperamental.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What happened to it?\\nThe one at Borgin and Burkes?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Nothing.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s still there.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It was delicious, Molly, really.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Are you sure you won\\'t stay?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No, we should go.\\nThe first night of the cycle is always the worst.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Remus?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sweetheart?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Has Ron gone to bed?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Umm, not yet, no.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Shoelace.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Merry christmas, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Merry christmas.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Harry, NOOO!\\n\\n\\n  \\nRemus!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ginny!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I killed Sirius Black.\\nI killed Sirius Black.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou coming to get me?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Harry?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Stupefy!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- HARRY!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- GINNY!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Molly.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- If it\\'s so easy for them to get to you,\\nyou\\'re bloody lucky you weren\\'t killed.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou have to realize who you are, Harry.\\n- I know who I am, Hermione, all right.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m sorry.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Of course I\\'ll wear it.\\n- I\\'m sorry, Won-Won.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sir, is it true professor\\nMerrythought is retiring?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Tom, I couldn\\'t tell you\\nif I knew, could I?\\n\\n\\n  \\nBy the way, thank you for the pineapple,\\nyou\\'re quite right, it is my favourite.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut how did you know?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Intuition.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Good gracious, is it that time already? Off you go,\\nboys, or professor Dippet will have us all in detention.\\n\\n\\n  \\nLook sharp, Tom. Don\\'t be caught\\nout of bed after hours.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIs something on your mind, Tom?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYes, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSee, I couldn\\'t think of anyone else to go to.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe other professors, well, they\\'re not like you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThey might misunderstand.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Go on.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I was in the library the other night,\\nin the restricted section.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd... I read something rather odd\\nabout some piece of rare magic.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI thought, perhaps you could illuminate me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s called, as I understand it, Hobdudlb.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I beg your pardon. I don\\'t know anything\\nabout such things and if I did I wouldn\\'t tell you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, get out of here at once. And don\\'t let me\\never catch you ??? again!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Confused?\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'d be surprised if you weren\\'t.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Why, I don\\'t understand.\\nWhat happened?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- This is perhaps the most important memory I\\'ve collected.\\nIt is also a lie.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThis memory has been tampered with, by the same\\nperson whose memory it is. Our old friend, professor Slughorn.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- But why would he tamper with his own memory?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I suspect he\\'s ashamed of it.\\n- Why?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Why indeed?\\n\\n\\n  \\nI asked you to get to know professor Slughorn and you have done so.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAny way you can.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I don\\'t know him that well, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- This memory is everything.\\nWithout it we are blind.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWithout it we leave the fate of our world to chance.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou have no choice.\\nYou must not fail.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I highly recommend you reacquaint yourself\\nwith the chapter on antidotes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ll tell you more about bezoars in our next class.\\nRight up you go.\\n\\n\\n  \\nLouise, don\\'t forget your rat tail.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Aha! If it isn\\'t the prince of potions himself.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat do I owe this pleasure?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well, Sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ask away, dear boy, ask away.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well, you see, the other day I was in the library in the restricted section.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes? What was this rare piece of magic?\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy, I don\\'t know, I can\\'t remember the name exactly.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut it just got me wondering. Are there some\\nkinds of magic you\\'re not allowed to teach us?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m the potions master, Harry, I think your\\nquestion\\'s better be posed to professor Snape.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes, umm... He and I don\\'t\\nexactly see eye to eye, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat I mean to say, is...\\nwell, he\\'s not like you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe might misunderstand.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes. There can be no light without the dark,\\nand so it is with magic.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMyself, I\\'ve always strived to live within the light.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI suggest you do the same.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Is that what you told Tom Riddle, Sir,\\nwhen he came asking questions?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Dumbledore put you up to this, didn\\'t he?\\n\\n\\n  \\nDidn\\'t he?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes?\\n\\n\\n  \\nAh, it\\'s you Potter.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m sorry, I\\'m busy at the moment.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s beautiful, isn\\'t it?\\nThe moon.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Divine.\\nHad ourselves a little late night snack, did we?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It was on your bed, the box.\\nI thought I\\'d try one.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Or twenty.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I can\\'t stop thinking about her, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Honestly, you know, I reckoned\\nshe was starting to annoy you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- She could never annoy me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI think I love her.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well, brilliant.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Think she knows I exist?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I bloody well hope so.\\nShe\\'s been snogging you for three months.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Snogging? Who are you talking about?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Who are you talking about?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Romilda, of course.\\nRomilda Vane.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Okay, very funny.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ow, what\\'s that for?\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s no joke!\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m in love with her.\\n- All right fine, you\\'re in love with her.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHave you ever actually met her?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No.\\nCould you introduce me?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Come on, Ron.\\nWe\\'re going to introduce you to Romilda Vane.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m sorry, Sir, I wouldn\\'t bother you if it\\nweren\\'t absolutely essential.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Where\\'s Romilda?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What\\'s the matter with Wembley?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Very powerful love potion.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Very well, better bring him in.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI would\\'ve thought you could whip up\\na remedy for this in no time, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I thought this called for more practiced hands, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hello, darling.\\nWhat\\'s your drink?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Perhaps you\\'re right.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m sorry, by the way, professor, about\\nearlier today. Our misunderstanding.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No, not at all. All water under the bridge, you know.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCorrect?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I expect you\\'re tired a bit after all these years\\nfull of questions about Voldemort.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Don\\'t use that name.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHere, old boy. Bottoms up.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What\\'s this?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Tonic for the nerves.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What happened to me?\\n- Love potion.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Bloody strong one at that.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I feel really bad.\\n- You\\'ll need a pick-me-up, my boy.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGot butter beer, wine, guzzling oak-matured mead.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI had other intentions for this, but I think given the circumstances...\\n\\n\\n  \\nThere, Potter.\\nTo life!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ron!\\n\\n\\n  \\nRon!\\n\\n\\n  \\nProfessor, do something.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I don\\'t understand.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Come on, Ron, breathe.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThese girls, they\\'re going to kill me.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Quick thinking on your part, Harry,\\nusing the bezoar.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMust be very proud of your student, Horace.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I think we agree. Potter\\'s actions were heroic.\\nThe question is: Why were they necessary?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Why indeed?\\n\\n\\n  \\nThis appears to be a gift, Horace.\\nYou don\\'t remember who gave you this bottle?\\n\\n\\n  \\nBy the way, posesses remarkably\\nsubtle hints of licquorice and sherry...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...but not polluted with poison.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- To whom, I might ask?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- To you, headmaster.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Where is he?\\nWhere\\'s my Won-Won?\\n\\n\\n  \\nHas he been asking for me?\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat\\'s she doing here?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I might ask you the same question.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I happen to be his girlfriend.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I happen to be his... friend.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Don\\'t make me laugh.\\nYou haven\\'t spoken in weeks.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI suppose you want to make up with him\\nnow, that he\\'s suddenly all interesting?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- He\\'s been poisoned you daft dimbo.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd for the record, I\\'ve always\\nfound him interesting.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ha. See? He senses my presence.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t worry, Won-won.\\nI\\'m here. I\\'m here.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Her... my... nee.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHermione.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHermione.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, to be young and\\nto feel love\\'s keen sting.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOh, come on everybody.\\nMr. Weasley is well tended.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- About time, don\\'t you think?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Thank you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, shut up.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Stop it, Ron.\\nYou\\'re making it snow.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Tell me how I broke up with Lavender, again.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Umm, well, she came to visit you in the hospital.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd you talked.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI don\\'t believe it was a particularly long conversation.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Don\\'t get me wrong,\\nI\\'m bloody thrilled to be shot of hers.\\n\\n\\n  \\nShe seems a bit put out.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes, she does, doesn\\'t she?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou say, you don\\'t remember anything from that night?\\nAnything at all?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- There is something.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut it can\\'t be.\\nI was completely boggled, wasn\\'t I?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Boggled.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHarry, there\\'s Katie.\\n\\n\\n  \\nKatie Bell.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Katie.\\nHow are you?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I know you\\'re going to ask, Harry,\\nbut I don\\'t know who cursed me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve been trying to remember, honestly.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut... I just can\\'t.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Katie?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I know what you did, Malfoy.\\nYou hexed her, didn\\'t you?\\n\\n\\n  \\nSECTUM SEMPRA!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Vulnera cemento.\\nVulnera cemento.\\n\\n\\n  \\nVulnera cemento.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You have to get rid of it. Today.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTake my hand.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- The room of requirement.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- We need to hide the Half Blood Prince\\'s book,\\nwhere no one\\'ll ever find it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIncluding you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What was that?\\n- What was that?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- See? You never know what you\\'ll find up here.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAll right, close your eyes.\\nThat way, you can\\'t be tempted.\\n\\n\\n  \\nClose your eyes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI can stay hidden up here, too, if you like.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- So, did you and Ginny do it, then?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You know, hide the book.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, yeah.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ah, yes.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Still no luck with Slughorn, then, I take it?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Luck.\\nThat\\'s it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAll I need\\'s a bit of luck.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well?\\nHow do you feel?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Excellent.\\n\\n\\n  \\nReally excellent.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Remember, Slughorn usually eats early, takes\\na walk and then returns to his office.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Right.\\nI\\'m going down to Hagrid\\'s.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What?\\nNo, Harry, you\\'ve got to try to speak to Slughorn.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWe have a plan.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I know, but, I\\'ve got a really\\ngood feeling about Hagrid\\'s.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI feel it\\'s the place to be tonight.\\nDo you know what I mean?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No.\\n- No.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well, trust me. I know what I\\'m doing.\\nOr Felix does.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHi.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh! Merlin\\'s beard, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sorry, Sir. I should have announced myself.\\nEither spoke or coughed.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou probably feared I was professor Sprout.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes, I did actually.\\nWhat makes you think that?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, well, just your general behaviour, Sir.\\nSneaking around, jumping when you saw me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAre those tentacular leaves, Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\nThey\\'re very valuable, aren\\'t they?\\n\\n\\n  \\nTen galleons a leaf to the right buyer.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNot that I\\'m familiar with any of those back\\nalley transactions, but one does hear rumours.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMy own interests are purely\\nacademic, of course.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Personally, these plants always kind\\nof freaked me out.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Exactly how did you get\\nout of the castle, Harry?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Through the front door, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m off to Hagrid\\'s, you see. He\\'s a very\\ndear friend, and I just fancied paying him a visit.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSo, if you don\\'t mind, I will be going now.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Harry!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s nearly nightfall.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSurely you realize I can\\'t allow you to\\ngo roaming the grounds by yourself?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well, then why don\\'t you come along, Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Harry, I must insist you accompany\\nme back to the castle, immediately!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- That would be counterproductive, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- And what makes you say that?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No idea.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Horace.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Merlin\\'s beard.\\nIs that an actual acromantula?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- A dead one, I think, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Good god.\\nDear fellow, however did you manage to kill it?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Kill it?\\nMy oldest friend, he was.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m so sorry,\\nI didn\\'t...\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, don\\'t worry yourself.\\nYou\\'re not alone.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSeriously misunderstood\\ncreatures, spiders are.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s the eyes, I reckon.\\nThey unnerve some folk.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Not to mention the pincers.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yeah, I reckon that, too.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hagrid, the last thing I wish to be is indelicate,\\nbut acromantula venom is uncommonly rare.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWould you allow me to extract a vial or two?\\nPurely for academic purposes, you understand?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well, that much isn\\'t going to do him much good, now, is it?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yeah, my thoughts exactly.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI have an ampulle or two about my person\\nfor just such occasions as this.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOld potion master\\'s habit, you know?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I wish you could have seen him in his prime.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMagnificent he was.\\nJust magnificent.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Would you like me to say a few words?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- He had family, I trust?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, yeah.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Farewell...\\n- Aragog.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Farewell, Aragog, king of the arachnids.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYour body will decay,\\nbut your spirit lingers on.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn your human friends and sons,\\nthose about to stay.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- ... and if you rest, and did one\\nsnout in two, which was sane.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I had him from an egg, you know?\\n\\n\\n  \\nTiny little thing, he was, when he hatched.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNo bigger than a pekinese.\\nA pekinese, mind you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- How sweet.\\nI once had a fish, Frances, was very dear to me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOne afternoon I came downstairs\\nand it vanished. Pouf.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- That\\'s very odd, isn\\'t it?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes, isn\\'t it?\\nBut that\\'s life, I suppose.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou go along and then\\nsuddenly... pouf.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Pouf.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Pouf.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It was a student, who gave me Frances.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOne spring afternoon, I discovered a bowl on my desk.\\n\\n\\n  \\nJust a few inches of clear water in it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd floating on the surface was a flower petal.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAs I watched it sank.\\n\\n\\n  \\nJust before it reached the bottom,\\nit transformed...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...to a wee fish.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt was beautiful magic.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWondrous to behold.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe flower petal had come from a lilly.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYour mother.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe day I came downstairs,\\nthe day the bowl was empty...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...was the day your mother...\\n\\n\\n  \\nI know why you\\'re here.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut I can\\'t help you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt would ruin me.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Do you know, why I survived, professor?\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe night I got this?\\n\\n\\n  \\nBecause of her.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBecause she sacrificed herself,\\nbecause she refused to step aside.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBecause her love was more\\npowerful than Voldemort.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Don\\'t say his name.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m not afraid of the name, professor.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m going to tell you something.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSomething, others have only guessed at.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s true. I am the chosen one.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOnly I can destroy him, but in order to do so, I need to\\nknow, what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...in your office and I need to\\nknow what you told him.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBe brave, professor.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBe brave, like my mother.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOtherwise you disgrace her.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOtherwise she died for nothing.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOtherwise the bowl will remain empty.\\n\\n\\n  \\nForever.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Please, don\\'t think badly of me, when you see it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'ve no idea what he was like even then.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I was in the library the other night.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn the restricted section.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd, I read something rather odd\\nabout a bit of rare magic.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s called, as I understand it,...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...a horcrux.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I beg your pardon?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Horcrux.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI came across the term while reading.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd I didn\\'t fully understand it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m not sure what you\\'re reading, Tom,\\nbut this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Which is...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...why I came to you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- A horcrux is an object in which a person has\\nconcealed a part of their soul.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- But I don\\'t understand how that works, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- One splits one\\'s soul and hides\\npart of it in an object.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBy doing so you are protected should you\\nbe attacked and your body destroyed.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Protected?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- The part of your soul which is hidden lives on.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn other words, you cannot die.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- And how does one split his soul, Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I think you already know the answer to that, Tom.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Murder.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nKilling rips the soul apart,\\nit is a violation against nature.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Can you only split the soul once?\\nFor instance, isn\\'t seven...\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Seven?\\n\\n\\n  \\nMerlin\\'s beard, Tom, isn\\'t it\\nbad enough to consider killing one person?\\n\\n\\n  \\nTo rip the soul into seven pieces...\\n\\n\\n  \\nThis is all hypothetical, isn\\'t it, Tom?\\nAll academic?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Of course, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'ll be all this evening.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- This is beyond anything I imagined.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Do you mean to say he succeeded, Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn making a horcrux?\\n\\n\\n  \\nOh yes, he succeeded all right.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd not just once.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What are they, exactly?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Could be anything.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMost commonplace of objects.\\n\\n\\n  \\nA ring, for example.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOr a book.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Tom Riddle\\'s diary.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s a horcrux, yes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nFour years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley\\nfrom the chamber of secrets you brought me this.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI knew then this was a different kind of magic.\\nVery dark, very powerful.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut until tonight I had no idea just how powerful.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- And the ring?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Belonged to Voldemorts mother.\\nDifficult to find.\\n\\n\\n  \\nEven more difficult to destroy.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- But... if you could find them all,\\nif you did destroy each horcrux...\\n\\n\\n  \\n- One destroys Voldemort.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- How do you find them?\\nThey could be hidden anywhere, couldn\\'t they?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- True. But magic, especially dark magic...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...leaves traces.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- That\\'s where you\\'ve been going, isn\\'t there, Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhen you leave school?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd I\\'ve think perhaps I may have found another.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOnce again, I must ask too much of you, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Have you ever considered that you ask too much?\\nThat you take too much for granted?\\n\\n\\n  \\nHas it ever crossed your brilliant mind,\\nthat I don\\'t want to do this any more?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Whether it has or hasn\\'t is irrelevant.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI will not negotiate with you, Severus.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou agreed. Nothing more to discuss.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAh, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou need a shave, my friend.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou know, at times, I forget\\nhow much you\\'ve grown.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAt times I still see the small boy from the cupboard.\\n\\n\\n  \\nForgive my morkishness, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m old now.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You still look the same to me, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Just like your mother,\\nyou\\'re unfailingly kind.\\n\\n\\n  \\nA trait people never fail\\nto undervalue, I\\'m afraid.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe place to which we journey tonight\\nis extremely dangerous.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI promised you could accompany me,\\nand I stand by that promise.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut there\\'s one condition:...\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou must obey every command I give\\nyou without question.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You do understand what I\\'m saying:...\\n\\n\\n  \\nShould I tell you to hide, you hide.\\n\\n\\n  \\nShould I tell you to run, you run.\\n\\n\\n  \\nShould I tell you to abandon me and save yourself,\\nyou must do so.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYour word, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- My word.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Take my arm.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- But, Sir, I thought you couldn\\'t\\napparate within Hogwarts?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well, being me has its privileges.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThis is the place.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOh, yes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThis place has known magic.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sir!\\n- In order to gain passage payment must be made.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPayment intended to weaken any intruder.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You should have let me, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No, Harry.\\nYour blood\\'s much more precious than mine.\\n\\n\\n  \\nVoldemort will not have made it easy\\nto discover this hiding place.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe will put certain defences in position.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCareful.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThere it is.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe only question is,\\nhow do we get there?\\n\\n\\n  \\nIf you would, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Do you think the horcrux\\nis in there, Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh yes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt has to be drunk.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAll of it has to be drunk.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou remember the conditions on\\nwhich I brought you with me?\\n\\n\\n  \\nThis potion might paralyze me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMight make me forget, why I\\'m here.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMight cause me so much pain\\nthat I beg for relief.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou are not to indulge these requests.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s your job, Harry, to make sure,\\nI keep drinking this potion.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'ll maybe have to force it\\ndown my throat.\\n\\n\\n  \\nUnderstood?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Why can\\'t I drink it, Sir?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Because I am much older,\\nmuch cleverer and much less valuable.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTo good health, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Professor!\\n\\n\\n  \\nProfessor!\\n\\n\\n  \\nProfessor?\\n\\n\\n  \\nCan you hear me?\\n\\n\\n  \\nProfessor?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou have to keep drinking,\\nlike you said, remember?\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt will stop, it will stop,\\nbut only if you keep drinking.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Don\\'t... make me...\\n- I\\'m sorry, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- KILL ME!\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s my fault.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMy... fault.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMy fault.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Just one more, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOne more, I promised.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI promised I\\'ll do what you say.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI promised.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPlease!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWater.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWater.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Water.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou did it, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nLook.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWater.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Aguamenti.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Water.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Lumos.\\n\\n\\n  \\nLUMOS MAXIMA.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSTUPEFY!\\n\\n\\n  \\nSECTUM SEMPRA!\\n\\n\\n  \\n-

get you to the hospital wing, Sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTo Madam Pomfrey.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSeverus.\\nSeverus is whom I need.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWake him.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTell him what happened.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSpeak to no one else.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSeverus, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHide yourself below, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t speak or be seen by anybody without my commission.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhatever happens.\\nIt\\'s imperious you stay below.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHarry, do as I say.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTrust me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTrust me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGood evening, Drako.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat brings you here\\non this fine spring evening?\\n\\n\\n  \\nWho else is here?\\n\\n\\n  \\nI heard you talking.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I often talk aloud to myself.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI find it extraordinarily useful.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHave you always been to yourself, Drako?\\n\\n\\n  \\nDrako, you are no assassin.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- How do you know what I am?\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve done things that would shock you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that they\\'d\\nthen return to bear a cursed necklace to me?\\n\\n\\n  \\nLike replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison?\\n\\n\\n  \\nForgive me, Drako.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI cannot help feeling these actions are so\\nweak that your heart can\\'t really have been in.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- He cursed me.\\nI was chosen.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I shall make it easy for you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Expelliarmus.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Very good, very good.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re not alone.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThere are others.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHow?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- The vanishing cabinet in the room of requirement.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve been mending it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- And I guess it has a sister.\\nWhich one?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Borgin and Burke\\'s.\\nThey form a passage.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ingenious.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDrako, years ago, I knew a boy\\nwho made all the wrong choices.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPlease let me help you.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I don\\'t want your help.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t you understand?\\n\\n\\n  \\nI have to do this.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI have to kill you...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...or he\\'s going to kill me.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well.\\n\\n\\n  \\nLook what we have here.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWell done, Drako.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Good evening, Bellatrix.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI think introductions are in order, don\\'t you?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'d love to, Albus.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut I\\'m afraid we\\'re on a bit of a tight schedule.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDo it!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- He doesn\\'t have the stomach.\\n\\n\\n  \\nJust like his father.\\n\\n\\n  \\nLet me finish him in my own way.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- NO!\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe Dark Lord has ??? to do it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\'Cause it\\'s ???\\n\\n\\n  \\nGo on, Drako, NOOW!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Severus.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPlease.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Avada kedavra.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- SNAPE!\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe trusted you!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Go on!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Incarcerus!\\n\\n\\n  \\nFIGHT BACK!\\n\\n\\n  \\nYOU COWARD, FIGHT BACK!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- NO!\\nHe belongs to the Dark Lord.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSECTUM SEMPRA!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYes, I\\'m the Half Blood Prince.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Potter.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn light of what has happened,\\nif you should have the need to talk to someone...\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou should know, professor Dumbledore...\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou meant a great deal to him.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Do you think he would have done it?\\nDrako?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- No.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNo, he was lowering his wand.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn the end it was Snape.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt was always Snape.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCan\\'t do nothing.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s fake.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOpen it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- To the Dark Lord.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI know I will be dead long before you read this,\\nbut I want you to know it was I who discovered your secret.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI have stolen the real horcrux and I intend\\nto destroy it as soon as I can.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI face death in the hope that, when you meet your match,\\nyou will be mortal once more.\\n\\n\\n  \\nR.A.B.\\n\\n\\n  \\nR.A.B.?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut whoever they are,\\nthey have the real horcrux.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhich means, it was all a waste.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAll of it.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Ron\\'s okay with you, you know?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou and Ginny.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIf I were you when he\\'s around\\nI\\'d keep the snogging to a minimum.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m not coming back, Hermione.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve got to finish whatever Dumbledore started, and...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...I don\\'t know where that\\'ll lead me...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...but I\\'ll let you and Ron know\\nwhere I am, when I can.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'ve always admired your courage, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut sometimes you can be really thick.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou don\\'t really think you\\'re going to be able to find all\\nthose horcruxes by yourself, do you?\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou need us, Harry.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I never realized how beautiful this place was.\\n\\nHead cocked to the left. \\n\\n\\n  \\nPartial deafness in ear. \\n\\n\\n  \\nFirst point of attack. \\n\\n\\n  \\nTwo.

Bring \\nsomething to cheer him up. \\n\\n\\n  \\nPermission to enter the armoury.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGranted. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWatson, I am in the process \\nof inventing a device \\n\\n\\n  \\nthat suppresses the \\nsound of a gunshot. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s not working. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh. \\n- Can I see that? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou know it\\'s been three \\nmonths, since your last case? \\n\\n\\n  \\nGently. Gently, Watson. \\nBe gentle with me. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t you think it\\'s time \\nyou found another one. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI can\\'t but, agree. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMy mind is in a terrible condition,\\ngive me problems, give me work. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe sooner the better. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Paper. \\n- Thank you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLet\\'s see then. \\nThere\\'s a letter here, \\n\\n\\n  \\nfrom...\\n\\n\\n  \\nMrs. Ramsay, of Queenspark. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHer husband\\'s disappeared. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s in Belgium, with the scullery maid. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIs it November? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYes, Holmes. \\nWhat?\\n\\n\\n  \\nLady Rathford reports... \\n\\n\\n  \\nher emerald bracelet \\nhas disappeared. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAn insurance swindle. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLord Rathford likes fast \\nwomen and slow ponies. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI see you\\'re the attending \\nphysician, at Blackwood\\'s hanging.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt was our last case together\\n\\n\\n  \\nand I wanted to see it \\nthrough to the end.\\n\\n\\n  \\nA Mr. Louis... \\n\\n\\n  \\nThere\\'s only one case, that \\nintrigues me at present. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe Curious Case of Mrs. Hudson \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe absentee landlady. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve been studying her \\ncomings and goings\\n\\n\\n  \\n- and they appear most... sinister. \\n- Tea, Mr. Holmes? \\n\\n\\n  \\nIs it poisoned, \"Nanny\"? \\n\\n\\n  \\nThere\\'s enough of \\nthat in you already.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t touch. Everything \\nis in it\\'s proper place. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAs per usual, \"Nanny\". \\n\\n\\n  \\nOh, his killed the dog... again. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat have you done \\nto, Gladstone now? \\n\\n\\n  \\nI was simply testing \\na new anaesthetic. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe doesn\\'t mind. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes,\\n\\n\\n  \\nas your doctor... \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'ll be straight as \\na trivet in no time.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAs your friend... \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'ve been in this room for two weeks. \\nI insist, you have to get out. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThere\\'s nothing of interest, \\nfor me, out there on Earth. At all.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- So, you\\'re free this evening? \\n- Absolutely. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Dinner? \\n- Wonderful. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- The Royal? \\n- My favourite. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMary\\'s coming. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Not available.\\n- You\\'re meeting her, Holmes! \\n\\n\\n  \\nHave you proposed yet? \\n\\n\\n  \\nNo, I haven\\'t found the right ring. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell, then it\\'s not official. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s happening, whether \\nyou like it or not.\\n\\n\\n  \\n8:30, the Royal. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Where a jacket. \\n- You wear a jacket. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Holmes! \\n- Hmm.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re early. \\n\\n\\n  \\nFashionably. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMiss Mary Morsten. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOh my goodness. What a pleasure. \\n\\n\\n  \\nFor the life of me, I don\\'t know why it\\'s \\ntaken him so long to introduce us properly.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe pleasure is mine. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt really is quite a thrill to\\nmeet you, Mr. Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve heard so much about you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI have a pile of detective \\nnovels at home... Collins, Poe.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s true. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt can seem a little\\n\\n\\n  \\nfar fetched though, at times. Making these \\ngrand assumptions out of tiny details.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s not quite right is it?\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn fact, the little details are \\nby far, the most important. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Take Watson... \\n- I intend to. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSee his walking stick over \\nthere? African snake wood.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHiding a blade of \\nhigh tensile steel. \\n\\n\\n  \\nFew were rewarded to the \\nveterans of the Afghan war, \\n\\n\\n  \\nso I can assume, he\\'s \\na decorated soldier. \\n\\n\\n  \\nStrong, brave, born \\nto be an adventurer. \\n\\n\\n  \\nand neat, like \\nall military men.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, I check his pockets. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAh, a stamp from a boxing match. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, I can infer that \\nhe\\'s a bit of a gambler.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'d keep an eye on \\nthat dowry, if I were you. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Those days are behind me. \\n- Right, behind you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s cost us the rent, \\nmore than once. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell with all due respect, Mr. Holmes, \\nYou know John very well. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat about a complete stranger? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat can you tell about me? \\n\\n\\n  \\n- You? \\n- I don\\'t think that\\'s... \\n\\n\\n  \\n- I don\\'t know that, that\\'s... \\n- Not at dinner. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Perhaps another time. \\n- I insist. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- You insist? \\n- You remember we discussed this. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe lady insists \\n\\n\\n  \\n- You\\'re a governess. \\n- Well done. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYes, well done. Shall we... Waiter! \\n\\n\\n  \\nYour student... \\nIt\\'s a boy of eight.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCharlie is seven, actually. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd he\\'s tall for his age. \\nHe flicked you with ink today. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Is there ink on my face? \\n- There is nothing wrong with your face. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThere are two drops \\non your ear in fact. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIndia blue is nearly\\nimpossible to wash off. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnyway, very\\nimpetuous act of that boy, \\n\\n\\n  \\nbut you\\'re too experienced \\nto react rashly, which is why\\n\\n\\n  \\nthe lady for whom you work \\nlent you that necklace.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPearls, diamonds, flawless rubies. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHardly the gems of a governess .\\n\\n\\n  \\nHowever, the jewels you \\nare not wearing, tell us rather more.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Holmes! \\n- You were engaged. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe ring has gone, but the lightness of\\nthe skin where it once sat suggests\\n\\n\\n  \\nthat you spent some time \\nabroad, wearing it proudly\\n\\n\\n  \\nthat is, until you were informed\\nof its true and rather modest worth\\n\\n\\n  \\nand then you broke of the engagement \\nand returned to, England \\n\\n\\n  \\nfor better prospects. \\nA doctor perhaps? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re right on all counts\\nMr. Holmes, apart from one. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI didn\\'t leave him. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe died. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell done, old boy. \\n\\n\\n  \\nGet up and fight! \\n\\n\\n  \\nCome on! \\n\\n\\n  \\nCome on! \\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s it, big man... We\\'re done. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou won. Congratulations. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOi, we ain\\'t done yet. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThis mustn\\'t register\\non an emotional level. \\n\\n\\n  \\nFirst, distract target. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThen block his blind jab. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCounter with cross \\nto the left cheek. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDiscombobulate. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDazed, he\\'ll attempt a wild \\nhay maker. employ the elbow block. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd body shot. \\n\\n\\n  \\nblock thorough left. \\n\\n\\n  \\nweaken right jaw. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNow fracture. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBreak cracked ribs. \\n\\n\\n  \\nTraumatize, solar plexus. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDislocate jaw entirely. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHeel kick to diaphragm. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIn summary:\\n\\n\\n  \\njaw fractured, three \\nribs cracked four broken,\\n\\n\\n  \\ndiaphragm haemorrhaging. \\n\\n\\n  \\nPhysical recovery: 6 weeks. \\n\\n\\n  \\nFull psychological \\nrecovery: 6 months.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCapacity to spit at back of head...\\n\\n\\n  \\nNeutralized. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhere did that come from? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat the hell\\'s going on here, Charley? \\n\\n\\n  \\nLord Blackwood\\'s put him \\non some kind of spell, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s like he\\'s burning \\nfrom the inside out! \\n\\n\\n  \\nShut up! \\n\\n\\n  \\nCharley. Charley! \\n\\n\\n  \\nTake this man to the infirmary! \\nNow! \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat\\'s this all about then, Blackwood? \\n\\n\\n  \\nThere\\'s someone I want to see. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Watson? \\n- Right. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLet\\'s go. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat started merely \\nas an experiment\\n\\n\\n  \\nhas brought me to the \\nthreshold of monumental discovery\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow if I play, chromatic scale\\n\\n\\n  \\nthere\\'s no measurable response. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou do know, what you\\'re \\ndrinking is meant for eye surgery. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut... now, \\n\\n\\n  \\nand this is remarkable \\n\\n\\n  \\nif I change to \\natonal clusters.\\n\\n\\n  \\nVoila!\\n\\n\\n  \\nThey fly in counter-clockwise, \\n\\n\\n  \\nsynchronized concentric circles. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAs though a regimented flock.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWatson this is exceptional. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI, using musical theory, \\nhave created order out from chaos. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHow did you lure them in? \\n\\n\\n  \\nExcellent question. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIndividually, I\\'ve been \\nat it for six hours. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd what happens if I do this? \\n\\n\\n  \\nClean yourself up. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou are Blackwood\\'s last request. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLook at those towering structures. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s the first combination of a Bascule\\'s\\nsuspension bridge ever attempted. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMost innovative. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat an industrious empire! \\n\\n\\n  \\nOh, I have your \\nwinnings from last night. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou weren\\'t there, so I \\nmade your customary bet.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re right. I\\'ll keep \\nit with your chequebook, \\n\\n\\n  \\nlocked safely away in my draw. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDid you know the opera house \\nis featuring \"Don Giovanni\"? \\n\\n\\n  \\nI could easily procure \\na couple of tickets \\n\\n\\n  \\nIf you had any cultural \\ninclinations this evening.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou have a grand gift of silence, \\n\\n\\n  \\nWatson, it makes you quite\\ninvaluable as a companion.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI knew she\\'d been engaged. \\n\\n\\n  \\nShe told me. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo that\\'s, no to the opera then. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThat was my waistcoat. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI thought we agreed \\nit\\'s too small for you. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'d like it back. \\n- I thought we agreed. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI want it back. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThis way, Mr. Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBlackwood certainly seems to have got\\nthe crowd into something of a fear frenzy.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m sure it will disperse once \\nhis feet have stopped twitching. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCare to come along? \\n\\n\\n  \\nNo, you\\'re on your own, old cock.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI have no business with him \\nwhilst he\\'s alive. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSuit yourself, \"mother hen\". \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt seems you still have \\nlots of rooms to let. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe had to move the prisoners, sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOtherwise we\\'re gonna \\nhave a riot on our hands.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe has a peculiar effect on the inmates.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAs though, he can \\nget inside their heads. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m sure I can find my own way \\nif you have other duties to perform. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMuch obliged, sir. \\nThank you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd I stood upon the sand of the sea, \\nand saw a beast rise up out of the sea, \\n\\n\\n  \\nhaving seven heads and ten horns, \\nand upon his horns ten crowns,\\n\\n\\n  \\nand upon his heads \\nthe name of blasphemy,\\n\\n\\n  \\nand they worshipped the dragon \\nwhich gave power unto the beast\\n\\n\\n  \\nthey worshipped \\nthe beast saying, \\n\\n\\n  \\nWho is like the beast? \\n\\n\\n  \\nthe beast which I just saw\\nhad the body of a leopard, \\n\\n\\n  \\nbut had feet of a bear and the \\nmouth was the mouth of a lion.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe dragon gave his power unto the \\nbeast, and his seat and great authority. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI love what you\\'ve \\ndone with the place. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo glad you can accept my invitation. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI just have a small point of concern. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHow can I help? \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve already followed the \\nmurders with some interest.\\n\\n\\n  \\nand although my heart went out primarily \\nto the families of the victims \\n\\n\\n  \\nI couldn\\'t but notice \\na criminal mastery,\\n\\n\\n  \\nin the stroke of your brush. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re too kind. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHowever, by comparison, \\nyour work in the crypt \\n\\n\\n  \\nlooks more like a finger painting. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo now you\\'re curious \\nif there\\'s a larger game afoot?\\n\\n\\n  \\nEither that or, um... \\n\\n\\n  \\nshortly my friend will \\npronounce you dead \\n\\n\\n  \\nand I thought I might \\nkeep him company. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYour mistake is to \\nimagine that anything\\n\\n\\n  \\nthat is earthly has\\nled us to this moment. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYour error of judgement is to assume \\nthat I\\'m holding the brush at all.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m merely a channel. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell my only wish is that \\nI could have caught you sooner. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou see? Five lives \\nmight have been spared. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThose lives were a necessity. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSacrifice. \\n\\n\\n  \\nFive otherwise meaningless creatures \\ncalled to serve a greater purpose. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI wonder if they\\'ll let me and \\nWatson dissect your brain. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAfter you hang, of course. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'d wager, there is some deformity \\nthat would be scientifically significant.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThen you too, could serve \\na greater purpose. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes, you must \\nwiden your gaze. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m concerned, you underestimate \\nthe gravity of coming events. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou and I are bound together on a journey \\nthat would twist the very fabric of nature. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut beneath your mask of logic \\nI sense a fragility... \\n\\n\\n  \\nThat worries me. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSteel your mind, Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI need you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'d say, you\\'ve come a long way \\ndown from a house of Lords. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- I will rise again. \\n- \"Bon voyage\". \\n\\n\\n  \\nPay attention! \\n\\n\\n  \\nThree more will die and there is nothing \\nyou can do to save them. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou must accept that this\\nis beyond your control. \\n\\n\\n  \\nby the time you realise \\nyou made all of this possible \\n\\n\\n  \\nit will be the last sane \\nthought in your head. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat did he want? \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m not sure. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut I don\\'t think you\\'re needed \\nfather. Not for this one. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLord Henry Blackwood, \\nyou are sentenced to death \\n\\n\\n  \\nfor the practice of black magic \\n\\n\\n  \\nthe unholy murder of\\nfive innocent young women\\n\\n\\n  \\nand an attempted \\nmurder of a sixth.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDo you have any final words? \\n\\n\\n  \\nDeath... is only the beginning. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThat is the end of \\nLord Blackwood. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLondon\\'s so bleak\\nthis time of year. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNot that I\\'m pining \\nfor New Jersey, \\n\\n\\n  \\nbut much prefer to \\ntravel in the winter. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHere, I bought you these. \\nAll the way from Syria. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI found these exquisite \\ndates in Jordan.\\n\\n\\n  \\nand your favorite... \\n\\n\\n  \\nolives from the Cyclades. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI thought we might \\nhave a little tea party.\\n\\n\\n  \\nand while I was setting \\nthe table, I found this. \\n\\n\\n  \\nA file with my name on it. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\"The theft of the Velásquez \\nportrait from the King of Spain. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMissing naval documents lead to\\nresignation of Bulgarian prime minister\\n\\n\\n  \\nscandalous affair\\nends engagement of...\\n\\n\\n  \\nperhaps to both\\nRomanov princess.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m simply studying your methods. \\n\\n\\n  \\nShould the authorities ask me \\nto hunt you down. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut I don\\'t see my name \\nin any of these articles. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut your signature was clear. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIs that the Maharajah\\'s missing diamond?\\n\\n\\n  \\nOr just another souvenir? \\n\\n\\n  \\nLet\\'s not dwell\\non the past. \\n\\n\\n  \\nShall we? \\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, by the looks of things, \\nI\\'d say you were between jobs.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd you between husbands. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHow much did \\nyou get for the ring? \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe was boring and jealous \\nand he snored. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m Irene Adler, again. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThank you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI need your help. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI need you to find someone. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy are you always so suspicious. \\n\\n\\n  \\nShould I answer chronologically \\nor alphabetically? \\n\\n\\n  \\nCareful not to cut yourself\\non this lethal envelope. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI think you\\'ll find \\nall the information inside. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWho are you working for? \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo I\\'ll have to find \\nout the hard way. \\n\\n\\n  \\nKeep your money, \\nI didn\\'t say I\\'ll take the case. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell, consider it a \\nwager that you will. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou remember the Grand? \\n\\n\\n  \\nThey gave me our old room. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHold the door. \\nThank\\'s, doctor. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMa\\'am. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- He\\'ll do it. \\n- Well done, Miss Adler. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s precisely why \\nI hired you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI wager, he\\'ll have our man \\nin the next 24 hours. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'d better. \\n\\n\\n  \\nReordan is the key to what \\nBlackwood was doing. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s essential to my plan. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDamn! What are you doing? \\nCan\\'t you see where you\\'re going? \\n\\n\\n  \\nGet off out of it!\\n\\n\\n  \\nA little ride, I\\'ve come along way, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nRubbing these calluses off this...\\n\\n\\n  \\nGod save the queen! \\n\\n\\n  \\nGod save the Queen, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nGet off out of it! \\n\\n\\n  \\nLook at you? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy is the only woman \\nyou\\'ve ever cared about\\n\\n\\n  \\na world class criminal? \\n\\n\\n  \\nAre you a masochist? \\n\\n\\n  \\nAllow me to explain... \\n\\n\\n  \\nAllow me! \\n\\n\\n  \\nShe\\'s the only adversary, \\nwho ever out smarted you. Twice.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMade a proper idiot out of you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nRight, you\\'ve had your fun. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- What she after, anyway? \\n- It\\'s time to press on. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat could she possibly need? \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt doesn\\'t matter. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAn alibi, a beard. A human canoe.\\n\\n\\n  \\nShe can sit on your back \\nand paddle you up the Thames. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s no consequence \\nto you really, is it Watson? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe\\'ve done our, last case together. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve already read it. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMissing person. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLuke Reordan. \\n\\n\\n  \\n4 foot 10, red hair, no front teeth. \\nCase solved. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re obviously not her type. \\n\\n\\n  \\nShe likes gingered dwarfs. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMidgets. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- So, you agree. \\n- No, I don\\'t agree. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s more than a technicality, you see. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou are misrepresenting the \\ndimensions of foreshortened peoples.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve said too much. \\nI can tell, I\\'ve upset you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNo, I\\'m just simply \\nstating, that one has... \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat were you doing? \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Will you allow me to explain? \\n- I wish you would. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Holmes? What are you doing? \\n- Nothing. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Are you wearing a false... \\n- A false nose? No. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Tell me, that, that wasn\\'t \\n- Was... \\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes! Where are you going? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWatson? \\n\\n\\n  \\nHelp! Watson! \\n\\n\\n  \\nGot some flowers for you, sweetheart. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCut you a deal, cos you\\'re so pretty. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOh, my lucky day! \\n\\n\\n  \\nHello gorgeous, you \\ngot something for me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t move! \\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, what have we got here? \\n\\n\\n  \\nThank you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s the Irene I know. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThis man Intrigues me, Watson, \\nHis got Adler on the edge. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd she\\'s no mean feet. \\n\\n\\n  \\nShe\\'s intimidated,\\nshe\\'s scared of him. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYet she work\\'s for him. \\n\\n\\n  \\nRight. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt is nothing to do with me, but I \\nadvise you to leave the case alone. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI may not always have a choice. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAfter all, I may be paying the rent \\non my own soon. Thanks to you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGet that out of my face. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s not \"in your face\" \\nit\\'s in my hand. \\n\\n\\n  \\nGet what\\'s in your \\nhand out of my face. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Mr. Holmes! \\n- Clarky! \\n\\n\\n  \\nSorry. Inspector Lestrade asks\\nyou come with me at once. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat\\'s he done now,\\nlost his way to Scotland Yard? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWatson drop a compass, he means us. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNo, you means you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s Lord Blackwood, \\nsir. He... \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell... it appears he\\'s come \\nback from the grave, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Most engaging. \\n- Very clever. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI pronounced the man dead myself. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat are the facts? \\n\\n\\n  \\nGround keeper, claims he saw him walking\\nthrough the graveyard just this morning, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ll leave this in your capable hands. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI have an appointment with, Mary. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s not my reputation at stake here. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Don\\'t try that. \\n- Have the newspapers\\n\\n\\n  \\n- got wind of it yet.\\n- Well that\\'s what we\\'re trying to avoid, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCertainly.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What\\'s the major concern? \\n- Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIndeed. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re not taking this seriously, Holmes? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYes, as you should.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s a matter of\\nprofessional integrity. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNo girl wants to\\nmarry a doctor \\n\\n\\n  \\nwho can\\'t tell If \\na man\\'s dead or not. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWho do you think \\nwon the match, Clarky? \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Sir? \\n- The rugby match. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYour boys have done a magnificent\\njob of obliterating any potential evidence.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYes, but at least they \\nnever miss an opportunity... \\n\\n\\n  \\nto miss an opportunity. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou took your time, Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd on the third day...\\n\\n\\n  \\nThese slabs are sand stone, they \\nhalf a ton each if they\\'re a pound,\\n\\n\\n  \\nand they were smashed \\nopen from the inside . \\n\\n\\n  \\nLestrade. What of the coffin? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe are in the process of \\nbringing it up now. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI see... \\n\\n\\n  \\nHmm... Right. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAt what stage of the process? \\nContemplative? \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd how is our witness? \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s over there. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd apparently he\\'s got ca... \\ncat... cata... \\n\\n\\n  \\nCatatonic, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- He\\'s not feeling very well. \\n- Yes \\n\\n\\n  \\nIf you lot don\\'t stop behaving like a bunch \\nof quivering milk maids, you\\'re on double time. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNow you get down there, and \\nyou bring that coffin up, now! \\n\\n\\n  \\nGood day, sir! \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s alright. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m a doctor. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe man\\'s in shock. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- He may need a few moments\\n- The witness states that\\n\\n\\n  \\nhe saw, lord Blackwood, \\nrise from the grave. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Well? \\n- Well? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou pronounced him dead. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe had no pulse. \\n\\n\\n  \\nGood lord. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s not Blackwood. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell, now we have a \\nfirm grasp, of the obvious. \\n\\n\\n  \\nTime of death? \\n\\n\\n  \\nDiptera is approximately...\\n\\n\\n  \\n2/3 of an inch \\n\\n\\n  \\nwhich would put the time of death\\nat between 10 and 12 hours ago. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMay I borrow your pen? \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Adler\\'s dwarf. \\n- Midget. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI know what I saw! \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt was Blackwood! \\n\\n\\n  \\nAs clear as I see you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd when the dead walk... \\n\\n\\n  \\nthe living will fill \\nthese coffins. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell... Umm...\\n\\n\\n  \\nRight, put the lid on \\nand clean this lot up.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou really believe he was resurrected? \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe question is not \"if\" but \"how.\" \\nThe game\\'s afoot.\\n\\n\\n  \\nFollow your spirit and \\nupon this charge, cry\\n\\n\\n  \\ngod for Harry,\\nEngland and St. George. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHere you are. Why that \\ncertain fish and chips store\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I don\\'t understand\\n- Well there\\'s a particular pier\\n\\n\\n  \\nthey use out in the back,\\nnorthern stout, to be exact. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou know, Holmes \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve seen things in war \\nI don\\'t understand. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIn India, I once met a man \\nwho predicted his own death \\n\\n\\n  \\nright down to the number and placement \\nof the bullets that killed him. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou have to admit, Holmes \\n\\n\\n  \\nthat a supernatural explanation \\nto this case, is theoretically possible. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNo. Agreed.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut, it is a huge mistake to \\ntheorize before one has data.\\n\\n\\n  \\nInevitably, one begins to twist facts to \\nsuit theories, instead of theories to suit facts\\n\\n\\n  \\nThat said I believe\\n\\n\\n  \\nour midget is the key to this. \\n\\n\\n  \\nRight. Scratches around the\\nkeyhole where the watch is wound.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat does that tell you? \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe man was likely a drunk. \\n\\n\\n  \\nEvery time he wound the watch, \\nhis hand slipped, hence the scratches.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYes \\nVery good, Watson. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou have developed considerable\\ndeductive powers of your own.\\n\\n\\n  \\nLet\\'s see now. There are several \\nsets of initials.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Pawn brokers marks. \\n- Excellent. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMost recent of which are: \\nM.H. M.H. M.H... \\n\\n\\n  \\n- M.H is for... \\n- \"Maddison and Haig\". \\n\\n\\n  \\nThey should be able \\nto give us an address. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat a coincidence. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThere\\'s one thing you failed to \\ndeduce from the watch, Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nReally? I think not. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe time. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI have to get back, Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nTaking tea with the in-laws.. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Can I predict your future, sir? \\n- Absolutely not. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNo thank you, ma\\'am. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou need to hear what\\nI have to tell you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe have no need of your \\nlucky hella Gypsy women. \\n\\n\\n  \\nEven if it\\'s to do with Mary. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI see two men. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBrothers. Not in \\nblood, but in boned. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat of Mary? \\n\\n\\n  \\nM for Mary, for marriage. \\nOh, you will be married.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGo on. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI see patterned table \\ncloths and china figurines.  \\n\\n\\n  \\nand lace doilies... \\n\\n\\n  \\ndoilies... \\n\\n\\n  \\nLace doilies... Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Does your depravity know, no bounds? \\n- No.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOh she turns fat and has a beard... \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd what of the warts? \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh She\\'s covered in warts... \\n- Enough, enough. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Are they extensive? \\n- Please, enough! \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s the most apt prediction, \\nFlora\\'s made in years. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd precisely the reason you \\ncan\\'t find a suitable ring. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDo you have my money? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou are terrified of a life \\nwithout the thrill of a macabre. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDo you have my cut? \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Admit it, admit it! \\n- Give me my money! \\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nOh I see. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThank you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell you\\'ve got your ring, and I\\'ve got \\nthe address for the ginger midget. \\n\\n\\n  \\nShould be just there. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI think she\\'ll really like this. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd I have some change in my pocket. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Should I look after it for you? \\n- No, no. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Don\\'t give it away here. \\n- No!\\n\\n\\n  \\nI have to go see Mary. \\n\\n\\n  \\nGive her my best. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd the family as well. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt does make a considerable difference \\nto me, having someone with me\\n\\n\\n  \\non whom I can thoroughly rely. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell, you can rely on me \\nfor exactly 10 minutes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe clearly felt something \\nwas coming to get him.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOr something did. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIrene Adler was here, \\n\\n\\n  \\neither that or the ginger midget \\nwore the same Parisian perfume. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAh, putrefaction. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAmmonium sulphate, \\namong other aromas. \\n\\n\\n  \\nPhosphorus. \\n\\n\\n  \\nFormaldehyde. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt looks like he was \\nattempting to combine \\n\\n\\n  \\nsome kind of sorcery \\nand scientific formula. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMore importantly... \\n\\n\\n  \\nlet\\'s see what he was \\ntrying to dispose of.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPotassium and magnesium. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSultafitic acid. \\n\\n\\n  \\nTry to take the ion out of the ink\\nAs long as it\\'s not too burnt.\\n\\n\\n  \\nPeculiar. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHydrated rhododendron. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes. \\nLook at the crest. \\n\\n\\n  \\nReordan was working with, Blackwood. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOf course he was. \\n\\n\\n  \\nQuestion is, to what end. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhatever he was working \\non, he clearly succeeded. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHow so? \\n\\n\\n  \\nOtherwise, he\\'d still alive. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhich is why Miss Adler is\\nso desperate to find him. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThere\\'s one odour I can\\'t \\nquite put my finger on. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIs it candy floss?\\nMolasses. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMaple syrup. Ah, barley sugar.\\n\\n\\n  \\nToffee apple. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLet me guess. \\n\\n\\n  \\nJudging by your arsonist tool kit\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re here to burn down the building \\nand extinguish all the evidence therein  \\n\\n\\n  \\nJust one minute boys.. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOh, Dredger! \\n\\n\\n  \\nIs there a problem?\\n\\n\\n  \\nMeat... \\n\\n\\n  \\nor potatoes? \\n\\n\\n  \\nMy 10 minutes are up. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou alright? \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat is that? \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes! \\n\\n\\n  \\nWatson... \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat have you done? \\n\\n\\n  \\nI haven\\'t slept all night. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNot a whink. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy I ever believed... \\n\\n\\n  \\nthat I would get to have \\ntea with Mary\\'s parents? is beyond me\\n\\n\\n  \\nhaving been talked \\ninto going with you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWe were set upon man,\\nit was self-defence. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve been reviewing my notes, of our \\nexploits over the last seven months. \\n\\n\\n  \\nwould you like to know my conclusion? \\n\\n\\n  \\nI am psychologically disturbed. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHow so? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy else would I be \\ncontinually led into situations \\n\\n\\n  \\nwhere you deliberately, withhold \\nyour plans from me? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy else? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou never complained \\nabout my methods before. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- I\\'m not complaining. \\n- You\\'re not? \\n\\n\\n  \\n- What do you call this? \\n- How...\\n\\n\\n  \\nHow am I complaining? I \\nnever complain, when do I\\n\\n\\n  \\never complain about you practising \\nthe violin at three in the morning.\\n\\n\\n  \\nor your mess, \\nyour general lack of hygiene \\n\\n\\n  \\nor the fact that you \\nsteal all my clothes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe have a barter system. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhen do I complain about\\nyou setting fire to my room? \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Our rooms. \\n- The rooms,\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhen do I ever complain that \\nyou experiment on my dog? \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Our dog! It\\'s our dog.\\n- On the... the dog!\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut I do take issue, is your campaign \\nto sabotage my relationship with Mary. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI understand. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Do you? \\n- I do.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- I don\\'t think you do. \\n- You\\'re overly tired. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Yes.\\n- You\\'re feeling a bit sensitive. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m not sensitive. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat you need is to rest. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMy brother, Mycroft, \\nhas a small estate near Chichester. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBeautiful grounds... There\\'s a falling.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- We could throw a lamb on the spit... \\n- We?\\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes, if I were to go to the country \\nit would be with my future wife. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell certainly, if you must... \\n\\n\\n  \\nNo not you, Mary and I. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- You are not... \\n- What? Invited? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy would I be not invited to my \\nown brothers country home, Watson? \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Now you are not making any sense! \\n- You\\'re not human! \\n\\n\\n  \\n- John Watson? \\n- Yes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYour bail has been posted. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMary! \\n\\n\\n  \\nJust Watson. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI hope you get bail by breakfast, \\nbecause the boys, are getting hungry. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBack off! Back off! \\n\\n\\n  \\nTo which the barman says: \\n\"may I push in your stool?\". \\n\\n\\n  \\nRight you, you\\'re out.. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Until next time, big Joe. \\n- Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThank heaven you\\'re here, Lestrade \\nI\\'d almost ran out of jokes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou know, In another life, you\\'d \\nhave made an excellent criminal. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYes, sir and you an \\nexcellent policemen.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTomsky! Thank you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNow please tell me you have answers. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAll in good time, Lestrade.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAll in good time? what is this some parlour \\ngame where we have to guess what you\\'re thinking.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve got a public in \\nfrenzy out there\\n\\n\\n  \\nand if you don\\'t fill me in, I\\'ll have you in there \\nplaying Victoria and Albert quicker than a bookies runner\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, clean up and \\nmake yourself presentable.\\n\\n\\n  \\nFor whom? \\n\\n\\n  \\nFriends in high places. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThey\\'re the ones \\nwho bailed you out. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m terribly sorry to \\ninconvenience you, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut I\\'m going to have \\nto put this on you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMr. Holmes, apologies for \\nsummoning you like this. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m sure it\\'s quite a mystery as to \\nwhere you are and who I am? \\n\\n\\n  \\nAs to where I am... \\n\\n\\n  \\nI was admittedly lost for a moment, \\nbetween Charing Cross and Holborn, \\n\\n\\n  \\nbut I was saved by the bread\\nshop on Southford Hill. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe only baker to use the certain French \\nglaze on their loaves a Brittany sage.\\n\\n\\n  \\nafter that the carriage \\nfork left and right\\n\\n\\n  \\nuntil a tell-tale bump \\nat the Fleet conduit.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd as to who you are? that\\ntook every ounce of my not\\n\\n\\n  \\ninconsiderable experience. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe letters on your desk were \\naddressed to a Sir Thomas Rodrum. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLord Chief Justice. That \\nwould be the official title\\n\\n\\n  \\nWho you really are... is of \\ncourse another matter entirely. \\n\\n\\n  \\nJudging by the sacred \\nox on your ring.\\n\\n\\n  \\nyou\\'re the secret head of the\\nTemple of the Four Orders\\n\\n\\n  \\nin who\\'s headquarters we now sit. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLocated, Northwest corner \\nof St. James square I think.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s the mystery, the only mystery is to \\nwhy you bothered to blind fold me at all. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYes... well, standard \\nprocedure I suppose. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI dare say we have the\\nright man, gentlemen. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSherlock Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m Ambassador Standish of America\\nand Lord Coward, the home secretary. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI suppose you already have some \\nnotion as to the practices of our order.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYes. They are practically interesting.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBe as sceptical as you like. \\n\\n\\n  \\nbut our secret system have steered the \\nworld for the greater good for centuries.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nThere danger is they can also be \\nused for more nefarious purposes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat some call the dark arts\\nor practical magic. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe know you don\\'t believe \\nin magic Mr. Holmes \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe don\\'t expect you \\nto share our faith\\n\\n\\n  \\nmerely our fears. \\n\\n\\n  \\nfear is the more \\ninfectious condition.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIn this instance. \\n\\n\\n  \\nfear of your own child. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBlackwood is your son \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou have the same irises, a rare dark \\ngreen, the diamond shaped hazel flex\\n\\n\\n  \\ntogether with identical outer ears or pinner, which \\nare only past down through direct blood line\\n\\n\\n  \\nwhich makes by \\nnecessity either brothers\\n\\n\\n  \\nor in this case, more \\nlikely father and son.\\n\\n\\n  \\nVery few people are\\nprivy to that information.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd we\\'d want to \\nkeep it that way. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe was conceived \\nduring one of our rituals. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHis mother wasn\\'t my wife. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut she shared our beliefs. \\nShe was a powerful practitioner. \\n\\n\\n  \\nthough not enough to \\nsurvive giving birth to him. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDeath followed him \\nwherever he went. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThose five girls were not \\nthe first to be butchered. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe killed many more using\\nthem to enhance his powers.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNo one could prove anything \\nof course, but we all knew. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe boy was a curse. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe\\'d done our best to \\nstop him ourselves, but its not enough. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHis power grows daily. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHis resurrection is evidence of that.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut what he does next \\nwill be far more dangerous. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe secret lies in the book of spells. \\nThis is the source of his power. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHis going to raise a force that will \\nalter the very course of the world.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI want you to find him and \\nstop him before he does.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWe\\'ll give you any \\nassistance that we can.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAs home secretary, I have a \\nconsiderable influence over the police.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Oh, yes \\n- So... \\n\\n\\n  \\nName your price? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell, of great benefit to being a consulting \\ndetective is that I can pick and choose my clients.\\n\\n\\n  \\nConsider it done, I\\'ll stop him.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut not for you. And \\ncertainly not for a price. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI do have a parting \\nquery Sir Thomas.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat is that? \\n\\n\\n  \\nIf the rest of his family\\'s dead... \\n\\n\\n  \\nhow long do you expect to survive? \\n\\n\\n  \\nFood for thought. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell perhaps you\\'ll have \\nbetter luck opening that.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMargaux. 58.\\nComet vintage.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHow fascinating that a astronomical \\nevent can effect the quality...\\n\\n\\n  \\nHow is it going with our \\ncase that you refused to take.\\n\\n\\n  \\n...wine. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOr I\\'ve hit a dead end. Literally.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI found your man. He\\'s \\nburied in Blackwood\\'s tomb. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIf you still need him. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOh dear... \\n\\n\\n  \\nI hope my client doesn’t \\ncome looking for a refund.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s a professor, isn\\'t he? \\n\\n\\n  \\nI couldn\\'t see his face, but I spotted \\na bit of chalk on his apparel. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve never known a professor to carry a \\ngun, and on such a clever contraption. \\n\\n\\n  \\nEye patch. Nice touch... \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo... case closed. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhich makes this a social visit. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNo. It\\'s you\\'re in over \\nyour head Irene, visit. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWho ever killed, Reardon \\nwas covering their tracks, \\n\\n\\n  \\nwhich makes you the next \\nloose end to be snipped. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLet it breathe. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve never been in over my head.\\n\\n\\n  \\nLeave now, disappear. \\nYou\\'re good at that. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOr stay. And volunteer\\nfor protective custody. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIf I\\'m in danger, \\nso are you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCome with me. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat if we trusted each other. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re not listening. I\\'m taking \\nyou, to either the railway station \\n\\n\\n  \\nor the police station. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo... \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhich is it to be? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou decide, which will it be? \\n\\n\\n  \\nI told you to let it breathe. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCan you taste the comet? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy couldn\\'t you \\njust come away with me? \\n\\n\\n  \\nMadam, I need you to remain calm,\\n\\n\\n  \\nand trust me, I\\'m a professional. \\nBeneath this pillow \\n\\n\\n  \\nlies the key to my release. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOf course, she misinterpreted \\nmy intention entirely. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Naturally sir. \\n- That\\'s why I find this modern religious fellow so troubling. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThere\\'s no latitude \\nfor misunderstandings. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt runs right over reason, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd chambermaids were \\nonce such a liberal breed. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMy wife\\'s a chambermaid, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnyhow, it’s a good thing she was a friend, \\notherwise we may never have found you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe inspector\\'s been over at Baker \\nStreet himself this morning, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nJust joking about the wife, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe\\'ve checked everything. \\nThere\\'s no sign of a break in\\n\\n\\n  \\nand the butler didn\\'t hear a thing. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo, body in the bath tub, \\nhis eyes were wide open \\n\\n\\n  \\nand the only thing missing was... \\n\\n\\n  \\nHis ring, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy did you drain the water?\\n\\n\\n  \\nOut of common decency. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCrime is common. \\nLogic, is rare. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe decent thing to do is to catch the killer, \\nnot provide conflict for the cause. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat is that? \\n\\n\\n  \\nJasmine bath salt, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSuper. Probably comes \\nfrom a larger container. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt would either be in the pantry. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHigh up where it\\'s warm and dry. \\nOr in a linen cupboard with a vent. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOh and constable, you could \\ndo worse than to check the \\n\\n\\n  \\nground under the rear window for \\nany signs of footprints not your own\\n\\n\\n  \\ndata, data, data. I can not\\nmake bricks without clay. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCharles? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWas it in the cupboard or the pantry. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt was in the pantry, sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI don\\'t know what to make of this.\\n\\n\\n  \\nExcellent work.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAdieu.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat\\'s the meaning of this, Coward? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy have you called this meeting? \\n\\n\\n  \\nSir Thomas is dead.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI nominate Lord Blackwood \\nas head of the Order. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHave you lost your mind? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou know damn well \\nwhat his capable of. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOf course he does. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s why we\\'re here. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s why, we\\'re all here. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMy powers and my assets were \\ngiven to me for one purpose. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMagnificent, but a simple purpose. \\n\\n\\n  \\nTo create a new future. \\n\\n\\n  \\nA future ruled... by us. \\n\\n\\n  \\nTomorrow at noon, we take the first step \\ntowards a new chapter in our history. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMagic will lead the way. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOnce the people of England \\nsee our new found power\\n\\n\\n  \\nthey\\'ll bow down in fear. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAcross the Atlantic, lies a \\ncolony that was once ours. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt will be again. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe civil war has \\nmade them weak. \\n\\n\\n  \\nTheir government is as corrupt \\nand as ineffective as ours. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo we\\'ll take it back. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe will remake the world. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCreate the future. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThese men are with me, \\nStandish. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut... are you? \\n\\n\\n  \\nNo, sir. I am not. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThese powers that \\nyou\\'re playing with... \\n\\n\\n  \\nno man, can control. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell gentlemen... Someone \\nhas to stop them\\n\\n\\n  \\neven if you won\\'t. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI wouldn\\'t do that if I were you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nGentlemen... don\\'t be afraid. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAs you can see, \\nwe are protected. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCome... drink your allegiance here. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou control the \\npolice, now use them. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI didn\\'t know you were here. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSince this room is no longer yours, \\ndo you mind if I utilise it? \\n\\n\\n  \\nBe my guest. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- In here chaps. \\n- Where shall we put him, sir? \\n\\n\\n  \\nAny where\\'s fine. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWho is he? \\n\\n\\n  \\nHis the man who tried to kill \\nyou at Reardon\\'s lodgings. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI suppose his neck didn\\'t survive the \\nimpact of Dredger landing on him. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYes... Thanks for that by the way. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut there is still some consolation in the knowledge \\nthat he can still be of service to his fellow man. \\n\\n\\n  \\nElbow is long stained with blood. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut it\\'s older than his own injuries. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI don\\'t know if it\\'s human. \\nIt\\'s not a butcher. Let me see...\\n\\n\\n  \\nYellow Flame. Green bursts. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAn industrial worker. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCoal. River silt. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd the stains on his trousers, \\nshould put him squarely in... \\n\\n\\n  \\nNine Elms. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSorry what? \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe area you\\'re looking \\nfor is, Nine Elms. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDo you remember where I put the \\nLord\\'s registrar of members interests? \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s on the step ladder. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBlackwood has had his hand in almost\\neverything that is corrosive to the spirit.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWoolidge Arsenal. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLime house Chemical Works. \\n\\n\\n  \\nProbably be a factory\\nby the river. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat\\'s that? \\n\\n\\n  \\nNever mind. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou don\\'t know where \\nmy rugby ball went do you? \\n\\n\\n  \\nNo, not a clue.\\n\\n\\n  \\nQueen side slaughterhouse \\n\\n\\n  \\nNine Elms. \\n\\n\\n  \\nA factory by the river. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell done, Watson. That should \\nlead us right to Blackwood. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDead or Alive. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNot us. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYes... \\n\\n\\n  \\nJust a figure of speech, old boy. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s left it there on purpose. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMore coal doctor.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThat\\'s a good one.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGlad to see you two \\nare working hard then. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd I thought you were \\ntrying to be discrete. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou would not last \\none day in the navy. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes, are you \\nsure that there is no \\n\\n\\n  \\nalternative means of \\nwater transportation, than that.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI guarantee you nobody knows \\nLondon\\'s waterways better. \\n\\n\\n  \\nTanners practically a fish himself.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAt least he certainly drinks like one. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOh you\\'ve found a\\nsense of humour, doctor. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIf only just a sense. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI better take over. \\nA bit tricky down here. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCome on... \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Look familiar? \\n- Yep.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAll that\\'s missing is a ginger midget. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThey cleared something away from here. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNot minutes ago. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLike what? \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m not sure. Something mechanical. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes, look at this. \\n\\n\\n  \\n- 1:18 \\n- Chapter and verse. \\n\\n\\n  \\nRevelations. 1:18. I am he \\nthat giveth, and was dead.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd behold of the life for ever more. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI warned you, Holmes to accept \\n\\n\\n  \\nthat this was beyond your control. \\n\\n\\n  \\nbeyond what your rational \\nmind could comprehend\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat a busy afterlife \\nthat you are having.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI want you to bear witness. \\n\\n\\n  \\nTomorrow, at midday, the \\nworld as you know it, will end.\\n\\n\\n  \\nShow me your face and it will \\nbe the end of your world right now. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSave the bullets, Watson. \\n\\n\\n  \\nA gift for you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat was that about saving bullets? \\n\\n\\n  \\nShe followed you here, Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou led your lamb to slaughter. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes! \\n\\n\\n  \\nThis game was designed to hurt. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWatson! \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s warm in here, Watson! \\n\\n\\n  \\nIn over your head yet, darling? \\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hold on there! \\n- I can\\'t. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLet me take your weight. \\n\\n\\n  \\nGive us a leg up, old boy.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThese German locks always \\ngive me trouble. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s a band saw.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNo matter. We have plenty of time. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes... \\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s not working. \\n- Keep calm.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes! Hurry up. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHope you\\'re not getting excited... \\n\\n\\n  \\nTurn of that valve. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd we bounce in... Three\\n\\n\\n  \\n...two, \\n\\n\\n  \\n...one. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThank you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m gonna get after, Blackwood. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThank you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe should go help the doctor.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes! \\n\\n\\n  \\nLord. Coward has issued \\na warrant for your arrest. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWatson\\'s alive. \\nJust get out of here, sir. Go. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWill the train be departing on time? \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe trains been delayed, madam. \\n\\n\\n  \\nShouldn\\'t be long now though. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe train will depart \\nwhen I tell it too.\\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd you will leave my \\nemployment, when I allow you too.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI fulfilled my contract. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI found Reorden. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s in Scotland Yard\\'s mortuary. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo that\\'s me finished. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYour job was to manipulate, \\nHolmes\\' feelings for you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNot succumb to them.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou have fulfilled nothing.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI want what, Reardon \\nwas making for Blackwood.\\n\\n\\n  \\nfinish the job, or the next dead \\nbody will be Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe surgeon should \\nbe along shortly. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe should be \\nable to rest now. \\n\\n\\n  \\nExcuse me. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIs that the best you can do? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYes for now. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI must attend to \\nmy other patients. \\n\\n\\n  \\nDoctor... \\n\\n\\n  \\nDoctor! \\n\\n\\n  \\nPlease! \\n\\n\\n  \\nI know that you care \\nfor him as much as I do. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThis is not your responsibility,\\nIt was his choice. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'d say it was worth the wounds. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSolve this. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhatever it takes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s Lord Blackwood, sir. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve never been in over my head.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s nothing to do with me, but I\\'d \\nadvise you to leave the case alone.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'re not taking this \\nseriously are you, Holmes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI told you to accept, this \\nwas beyond your control \\n\\n\\n  \\nTomorrow at mid-day, the world will end.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHolmes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou and I are bound together on a journey \\nthat will twist the very fabric of nature.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSteel your mind, Holmes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe will raise a force that will \\nchange the very course of the world.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHis power grows. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThis is the source of his power.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI need you.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe secret lies in the book of spells.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThree more will die...\\n\\n\\n  \\nand there\\'s nothing \\nyou can do to save them.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWe know you don\\'t believe in magic.\\n\\n\\n  \\nReardon was working with Blackwood. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe only thing missing \\nwas his ring.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGive up, Holmes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThis is a riddle you can not solve.\\n\\n\\n  \\nGood morning. \\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, you need to work. \\n\\n\\n  \\nFamiliar artwork? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou look gorgeous. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSome how, I knew you wouldn\\'t leave. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou made the front page. \\n\\n\\n  \\nOnly a name, and no picture? \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo it looks like, you\\'ll be needing \\nto work outside the law now,\\n\\n\\n  \\nand that\\'s my area of expertise. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI feel safer already. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou seem to be making a rapid recovery. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYes... \\n\\n\\n  \\nI took this shrapnel out myself. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMary said I had a lousy doctor. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell I\\'m... I\\'m just so...\\n\\n\\n  \\nvery glad that you\\'re \\num... well, with us.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow that you’re sitting \\ncomfortably, I shall begin.  \\n\\n\\n  \\nMy initial approach \\nwas far to narrow. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhen Blackwood invited \\nme to Pentonville prison \\n\\n\\n  \\nhe suggested I widen my gaze.\\n\\n\\n  \\nand at minimum, I have done just that. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIn fact, I may well have reconciled thousand\\'s \\nof years of theological disparity. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut that\\'s for another time. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBlackwood\\'s method is based \\non a ritualistic mystical system\\n\\n\\n  \\nthat\\'s been employed by the Temple \\nof the Four Orders for centuries. \\n\\n\\n  \\nTo fully understand the \\nsystem, to get inside it, \\n\\n\\n  \\nI re-enacted the ceremony \\nwe interrupted at the crypt, \\n\\n\\n  \\nwith a few enhancements of my own. \\n\\n\\n  \\nmy journey took me some what \\nfurther down the rabbit hole than I intended \\n\\n\\n  \\nand though I dirtied \\nmy fluffy white tail\\n\\n\\n  \\nI have emerged, enlightened.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe fraternity who \\ndecidedly control the empire\\n\\n\\n  \\nwho share the belief with the kings,\\nPharaohs, and emperors of old\\n\\n\\n  \\nthat the Sphinx was a door \\nto another dimension. \\n\\n\\n  \\nA gateway to immeasurable power. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s made up of four parts. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe foot of a lion, the tail of \\nan ox, the wings of an eagle \\n\\n\\n  \\nand the head of a man. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIn Sir Thomas’s secret chamber, \\nI found a bone of an ox\\n\\n\\n  \\nthe tooth of a lion, the feather \\nof an eagle and a hair of a man. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMap. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe points of the stars represent \\nthe five murdered girls\\n\\n\\n  \\nbut the cross is what \\nwe\\'re now interested in. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt’s a wildly held belief, that within \\nthe architecture of the great cities \\n\\n\\n  \\nare coded references to the system \\n\\n\\n  \\nSince he rose from the grave,\\nBlackwood\\'s killed three men.\\n\\n\\n  \\nEach murder was committed at a location that \\nhas a direct connection with the temple \\n\\n\\n  \\ntherefore the system.\\n\\n\\n  \\nReardon, the ginger midget. \\n\\n\\n  \\nrepresents man. We \\nfound his body here. \\n\\n\\n  \\nSir Thomas... master of the \\ntemple, wore the ox ring. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHe died here. \\n\\n\\n  \\nStandish, the ambassador to America\\nWhere the eagle has been the national \\n\\n\\n  \\nemblem for over a hundred years .\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe headquarters of the Temple of the\\nFour Order is where he died, \\n\\n\\n  \\nis here. \\n\\n\\n  \\nCorrespondingly, the map will tell \\nus the location of Blackwood\\'s final act  \\n\\n\\n  \\nSo we have man, the ox,\\neagle, only the lion remaining.\\n\\n\\n  \\nRight here. \\n\\n\\n  \\nParliament. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAlright you four stay here and \\nthe rest of you come with me.\\n\\n\\n  \\nRight this way. \\n\\n\\n  \\nLadies first. \\n\\n\\n  \\nFollow these instructions. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHello, hello, hello... \\n\\n\\n  \\nDid the devil turn up? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell never mind. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou\\'ve got the next best thing. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBeg your pardon my lord, \\nI know that it’s unorthodox \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut Mr. Holmes here, his been making \\nsome serious accusations about you\\n\\n\\n  \\nand The Order. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI see. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAt least this solves the great mystery \\nof how you became inspector.\\n\\n\\n  \\nExcuse me, my lord.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBut I\\'ve been wanting \\nto do that for a long time. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWell inspector, I have five minutes \\nbefore my next engagement.\\n\\n\\n  \\nSo why don’t you regale me \\nwith your stories of conspiracy \\n\\n\\n  \\nThank you Lestrade. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMy lord... \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'m curious, Coward. Did you assist \\nBlackwood in all his murders.\\n\\n\\n  \\nor just the one I prevented? \\n\\n\\n  \\nVery distinctive, those hand \\nmade shoes of yours. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut the price of quality is often \\nthe unique imprint they leave\\n\\n\\n  \\nNonetheless I confess to being \\ncompletely outmatched.\\n\\n\\n  \\nI could deduce very little \\nfrom my investigation.\\n\\n\\n  \\nFortunately there’s nothing \\nmore stimulating than a\\n\\n\\n  \\ncase where everything \\ngoes against you. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHow many members of parliament do \\nyou intend to murder at noon today.\\n\\n\\n  \\nMan, ox, eagle, lion. The \\nlion\\'s parliament isn\\'t it? \\n\\n\\n  \\nVery clever. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut it\\'s not murder, \\nMr. Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s mercy. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe are giving the weak \\nmasses a strong Shepard.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDon\\'t you see that \\nit\\'s for their own...\\n\\n\\n  \\nNo. But I don\\'t care \\nmuch what you think. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI just simply wanted to know the \\nlocation of Blackwood’s final ceremony. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnd now you\\'ve given it to me. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve told you nothing. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBut your clothes say infinitely more \\nthan you could ever hope.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe mud smeared on your boots \\nfrom where you’ve been walking. \\n\\n\\n  \\nA touch of red brick dust on your knee \\nfrom where you’ve been kneeling.\\n\\n\\n  \\nA small bandage on your thumb \\nfrom where you’ve been vowing.\\n\\n\\n  \\nA faint aroma of excrement from \\nwhere you’ve been standing.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou and Blackwood laid the final \\ntouches to your ceremony in the sewers \\n\\n\\n  \\nbeneath parliament\\n\\n\\n  \\nless than an hour ago. \\n\\n\\n  \\nBoth houses meet today. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe whole government will be present. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s a shame you made an \\nenemy out of Blackwood, Holmes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou would have \\nmade a valuable ally.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHow terrible is wisdom.\\n\\n\\n  \\nwhen it brings no \\nprofit to the wise. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe take power at noon. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThen isn\\'t anytime to waste then. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIs there? \\n\\n\\n  \\nI told you you he\\'d be coming out the \\ntop window, soldier boy. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThere isn\\'t any way he\\'d be \\ncoming over that terrace.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTechnically that isn’t the \\ntop window, is it sailor boy.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- What is it?\\n- Well, it\\'s the middle window. \\n\\n\\n  \\nAnyway, you’d be pleased to know \\nthat Lestrade performed in his role perfectly.\\n\\n\\n  \\nActually, I think \\nhe rather enjoyed it. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI hope you know what \\nyou\\'re doing, Holmes. \\n\\n\\n  \\nHere\\'s the key. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou got what you \\nneeded from, Coward? \\n\\n\\n  \\nYes, I smoked him out \\nwith relative ease.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Tanner? \\n- Yes? \\n\\n\\n  \\nIf you would captain, \\ntake us onto the bridge\\n\\n\\n  \\nPort side. proximately 100 yards beyond that \\nyou\\'ll find a tunnel, that leads us to the sewers.\\n\\n\\n  \\nRight away, sir.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe end is nigh.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBlackwood’s come back from hell \\nand laid a curse upon this land\\n\\n\\n  \\nBehold, Blackwood\\'s magic revealed.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat does it do? \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s a chemical weapon. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThe first of its kind. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou deduced that, how? \\n\\n\\n  \\nFrom my pocket. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI snipped this of a rather common \\nrat at the slaughterhouse.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNotice the blue discolouration.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThe faintest smell of almonds,\\ntell-tale traces of cyanide.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow we know what the \\nginger midget was working on.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It will revolutionise warfare.\\n- Yes killing a lot of people.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNow, there\\'s 7 minutes until \\nnoon. What are we going to do? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWe must do this carefully...\\n\\n\\n  \\nShe loves an entrance, your muse.\\n\\n\\n  \\nShoot him! Now please! \\n\\n\\n  \\nMy lords! My lords.\\n\\n\\n  \\nTime has come for any of \\nthose who believe, to remain.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBehold... Lord Blackwood. \\n\\n\\n  \\nYou seem surprised. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI have returned from beyond the \\ngrave to fulfil England’s destiny.\\n\\n\\n  \\nand extend the boundaries \\nof this great empire. \\n\\n\\n  \\nListen to the rabble outside. \\n\\n\\n  \\nListen... \\n\\n\\n  \\nto the fear. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI will use that as a\\nweapon to control them... \\n\\n\\n  \\nand then the world. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI\\'ve never seen anything \\nlike it. Look at this. \\n\\n\\n  \\nIt’s specifically designed to \\nprevent us from disarming it.\\n\\n\\n  \\nThese components appear to be designed \\nto receive a signal of some sort.\\n\\n\\n  \\nElectromagnetic waves? \\n\\n\\n  \\nWhen triggered, the electrodes \\nwill send a charge\\n\\n\\n  \\nconverting the chemical into gas.\\n\\n\\n  \\nand the gas will travel up that shaft \\n\\n\\n  \\nand filter through the ventilation \\nsystem that leads directly to parliament. \\n\\n\\n  \\nWithin seconds, of it\\'s administration the most \\npowerful men in the world will be choking on death.\\n\\n\\n  \\nBlackwood must have \\nsome sort of transmitter \\n\\n\\n  \\nthat connects with it remotely. \\n\\n\\n  \\nThree minutes and ten seconds. \\n\\n\\n  \\nI will create an empire that \\nwill endure for a millennia \\n\\n\\n  \\nIndestructible and eternal. \\n\\n\\n  \\nMove it!

We\\'ve been cleared for takeoff.\\nMCCOY: (to Kirk) I may throw up on you.\\nKIRK: I think these things are pretty safe.\\nMCCOY: Don\\'t pander to me, kid. One tiny crack in the hull, and our blood boils in thirteen seconds. A solar flare might pop up and cook us in our seats. And wait \\'til your sitting pretty with a case of Andorian shingles. See if you\\'re still so relaxed when your eyeballs are bleeding. Space is disease and danger after darkness and silence.\\nKIRK: Well, I hate to break this to you, but Starfleet operates in space.\\nMCCOY: Yeah, well, got nowhere else to go. The ex-wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce. All I\\'ve got left is my bones.\\nKIRK: Jim Kirk.\\nMCCOY: McCoy, Leonard McCoy.\\n[Narada - Three years later]\\nROMULAN: Captain Nero. You\\'ve been requested on the bridge, sir. Ayel, say\\'s it\\'s time.\\n[Narada Bridge]\\nAYEL: Sir, we\\'ve arrived at the coordinates you calculated.\\nROMULAN 2: There\\'s nothing here.\\nAYEL: What are your orders?\\nNERO: We wait. We wait for the one who allowed our home to be destroyed, as we\\'ve been doing for twenty-five years.\\nAYEL: And once we\\'ve killed him?\\nNERO: Kill him? I\\'m not gonna kill him. I\\'m gonna make him watch.\\n(a black hole opens and the Jellyfish exits)\\nNERO: Capture that ship. Welcome back, Spock.\\n[Starfleet Academy grounds]\\nMCCOY: Why are you so happy?\\nKIRK: I don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about.\\nMCCOY: No, I don\\'t suppose you do.\\nKIRK: Hello, ladies. (to McCoy) I\\'m taking the test again.\\nMCCOY: You got to be kidding me.\\nKIRK: Yeah, tomorrow morning and I want you there.\\nMCCOY: You know, I\\'ve got better things to do than to watch you embarrass yourself for a third time. I\\'m a doctor, Jim, I\\'m busy.\\nKIRK: Bones, it doesn\\'t bother you that no one\\'s ever passed the test?\\nMCCOY: Jim, it\\'s the Kobayashi Maru. No one passes the test, and no one goes back for seconds, let alone thirds.\\nKIRK: I got to study.\\nMCCOY: Study my ass.\\n[Dorm Room]\\n(Kirk and Gaila, a green-skinned Orion, are together on her bed)\\nGAILA: Ahh.. Jim, I think I love you.\\nKIRK: That\\'s so weird.\\nGAILA: Lights.\\nMALE COMPUTER VOICE: Lights On.\\nGAILA: Did you just say \"that is so weird?\"\\nKIRK: Yeah, I did but I...\\nGAILA: You don\\'t love me too?\\n(the door opens)\\nGAILA: Oh, that\\'s my roommate.\\nKIRK: I thought you said she was gone for the night?\\nGAILA: Well, obviously, she\\'s not. Quick, you\\'ve got... get under the bed.\\nKIRK: Under...\\nGAILA: Look, under the bed.\\nKIRK: C\\'mon\\nGAILA: She can\\'t see you.\\nKIRK: Why not?\\nGAILA: Because I promised her I\\'d stop bringing guys back to the room.\\nKIRK: Wait, how many guys have you...?\\nGAILA: Down, just down. (to Uhura) Hey.\\nUHURA: Hey.\\nGAILA: How are you?\\nUHURA: Good. The strangest thing. I was in the long-range sensor lab...\\nGAILA: Yeah... I thought all night.\\nUHURA: I was tracking solar systems and I picked up an emergency transmission.\\nGAILA: Really?\\nUHURA: Yeah, from a Klingon prison planet.\\nGAILA: No?\\nUHURA: Yeah. A Klingon armada was destroyed. Forty-seven ships.\\nGAILA: So, you\\'re not going back to the lab tonight?\\nUHURA: Gaila, who is he?\\nGAILA: Who\\'s who?\\nUHURA: The mouth-breather hiding under your bed.\\n(Kirk gets out from under the bed)\\nKIRK: You could hear me breathing?\\nUHURA: You!\\nKIRK: Big day tomorrow.\\nUHURA: You\\'re gonna fail.\\nKIRK: Gaila, see you around.\\nUHURA: Get out.\\nKIRK: If I pass, will you tell me your first name?\\nUHURA: No. Goodnight.\\nKIRK: I think the fact that you picked up a transmission is very interesting.\\n[Kobayashi Maru Scenario]\\nUHURA: We\\'re receiving a distress signal from the USS Kobayashi Maru. The ship has lost power and is stranded. Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them.\\nKIRK: Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them, Captain.\\nMCCOY: Two Klingon vessels have entered the neutral zone and are locking weapons on us.\\nKIRK: That\\'s okay.\\nMCCOY: That\\'s okay?\\nKIRK: Yeah, don\\'t worry about it.\\n[Overhead]\\nINSTRUCTOR 1: Did he say don\\'t worry about it?\\nINSTRUCTOR 2: Is he not taking the simulation seriously?\\n[Scenario]\\nMCCOY: Three more Klingon warbirds decloaking and targeting our ship. I don\\'t suppose this is a problem either.\\nCADET: They\\'re firing, Captain.\\nKIRK: Alert medical bay to prepare to receive all crew members from the damaged ship.\\nUHURA: And how do you expect us to rescue them when we\\'re surrounded by Klingons, Captain.\\nKIRK: Alert medical.\\nMCCOY: Our ship is being hit. Shields at sixty percent.\\nKIRK: I understand.\\nMCCOY: Well should we, I don\\'t know, fire back?\\nKIRK: No. (he eats an apple)\\nMCCOY: Of course not.\\n(the power seems to go out for a second)\\n[Overhead]\\nINSTRUCTOR 2: What is this? What\\'s going on?\\n[Scenario]\\nKIRK: Hmm... arm photons, prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.\\nCADET: Yes, sir.\\nMCCOY: Jim, their shields are still up.\\nKIRK: Are they?\\nMCCOY: No. They\\'re not.\\nKIRK: Fire on all enemy ships. One photon each should do it, so don\\'t waste ammunition.\\nCADET: Target locked and acquired on all warbirds. Firing.\\n(the warbirds are easily dispatched)\\nCADET: All ships destroyed, Captain.\\nKIRK: Begin rescue of the stranded crew. So, we\\'ve managed to eliminate all enemy ships, no one onboard was injured, and the successful rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is underway.\\n[Overhead]\\nINSTRUCTOR 3: How the hell did that kid beat your test?\\nSPOCK: I do not know.\\n[Starfleet Academy Hearing]\\nBARNETT: This session has been called to resolve a troubling matter. James T. Kirk, step forward. Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this council, suggesting that you violated the ethical code of conduct pursuant to Regulation One-Seven point three of the Starfleet Code. Is there anything you care to say before we begin, sir?\\nKIRK: Yes, I believe I have the right to face my accuser directly.\\n(Spock rises from the audience)\\nBARNETT: Step forward, please. This is Commander Spock. He\\'s one of our most distinguished graduates. He\\'s programmed the Kobayashi Maru exam for the last four years. Commander?\\nSPOCK: Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed to install and activate a subroutine to the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test.\\nKIRK: Your point being?\\nBARNETT: In academic vernacular, you cheated.\\nKIRK: Let me ask you something, I think we all know the answer to. The test itself is a cheat, isn\\'t it? You programmed it to be unwinnable.\\nSPOCK: Your argument precludes the possibility of a no-win scenario.\\nKIRK: I don\\'t believe in no-win scenarios.\\nSPOCK: Then, not only did you violate the rules, you also failed to understand the principle lesson.\\nKIRK: Please, enlighten me.\\nSPOCK: You of all people should know, Cadet Kirk. A Captain cannot cheat death.\\nKIRK: I of all people.\\nSPOCK: Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, assumed command of his vessel before being killed in action, did he not?\\nKIRK: I don\\'t think you like the fact that I beat your test?\\nSPOCK: Furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test.\\nKIRK: Enlighten me again.\\nSPOCK: The purpose is to experience fear. Fear in the face of certain death. To accept that fear, and maintain control of oneself and one\\'s crew. This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain.\\nAIDE: Excuse me, sir.\\n(the aide hands something to Admiral Barnett)\\nBARNETT: We\\'ve received a distress call from Vulcan. With our primary fleet engaged in the Laurentian system, I hereby order all cadets to report to Hangar One immediately. Dismissed.\\nKIRK: (to McCoy) Who was that pointy-eared bastard?\\nMCCOY: I don\\'t know, but I like him.\\n[Hangar One]\\nCOMMANDER: ...Regula I, Tracy, USS Farragut... USS Enterprise, McGrath, USS ... Vader, USS Hood. Welcome to Starfleet, godspeed.\\nKIRK: He didn\\'t call my name. Commander! Sir, you didn\\'t call my name. Kirk, James T.?\\nCOMMANDER: Kirk, you\\'re on academic suspension. That means you\\'re grounded, until the Academy board rules.\\nMCCOY: Jim, the board\\'ll rule in your favor. Most likely. Look, Jim, I got to go.\\nKIRK: Yeah, get going. Be safe.\\nOFFICER: Excuse me.\\nKIRK: Yeah, yeah, sorry.\\nMCCOY: Dammit. Come with me.\\nFEMALE ASSIGNER: ...USS Neutral, Uhura, USS Farragut, Petroski, USS Antares. Go to your stations and good luck.\\n(Gaila smiles wide past Uhura, who has a dour expression)\\nKIRK: Bones, where are we going?\\nMCCOY: You\\'ll see.\\n(they pass Uhura)\\nUHURA: Commander, a word.\\nSPOCK: Yes, Lieutenant?\\nUHURA: Was I not one of your top students?\\nSPOCK: Indeed you were.\\nUHURA: And did I not, on multiple occassions, demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity, and I quote, \"an unparalleled ability to identify sonic anomalies in subspace transmission tests?\"\\nSPOCK: Consistently, yes.\\nUHURA: And while you were well aware that of own qualified desires to serve on the USS Enterprise, I\\'m assigned to the Farragut?\\nSPOCK: It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism.\\nUHURA: No, I\\'m assigned to the Enterprise.\\n(Spock presses some buttons on his PADD)\\nSPOCK: Yes, I believe you are.\\nUHURA: Thank you.\\n[Medical Bay]\\nKIRK: What are you doing?\\nMCCOY: I\\'m doing you a favor. I couldn\\'t just leave you there looking all pathetic. Take a seat. I\\'m going to give you a vaccine against viral infection from Melvaran mud fleas.\\nKIRK: Oww! What for?\\nMCCOY: Give you the symptoms.\\nKIRK: What are you talking about?\\nMCCOY: You\\'re going to start to lose vision in your left eye.\\nKIRK: Yeah, I already have.\\nMCCOY: Oh, and you\\'re going to get a really bad headache and a flop sweat.\\nKIRK: You call this a favor?\\nMCCOY: Yeah, you owe me one.\\n[Hangar One]\\nMALE ASSIGNER: Kirk, James T. He\\'s not cleared for duty aboard the Enterprise.\\nMCCOY: Medical Code states the treatment and transport of a patient to be determined at the discretion of his attending physician, which is me. So, I\\'m taking Mister Kirk aboard. Or would you like to explain to Captain Pike why the Enterprise warped into a crisis without one of its senior medical officers?\\nMALE ASSIGNER: As you were.\\nKIRK: As you were.\\nMCCOY: C\\'mon.\\n[Shuttlecraft Gilliam]\\n(as the shuttlecrafts head to their various ships, including the Enterprise)\\nKIRK: I might throw up on you.\\nMCCOY: Oh Jim, you got to look at this. Jim, look!\\nKIRK: What?\\n(they look out at Earth Spacedock and the massive Enterprise)\\n[Enterprise Shuttlebay]\\nMCCOY: We need to get you changed.\\nKIRK: I don\\'t feel right. I feel like I\\'m leaking.\\nMCCOY: Hell, it\\'s that pointy-eared bastard.\\n(Kirk and McCoy swerve to narrowly avoid being spotted by Spock. Spock enters a turbolift and arrives on the bridge)\\n[Bridge]\\nPIKE: Mister Spock.\\nSPOCK: Captain. Engineering reports ready for launch.\\nPIKE: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden voyage of our newest flagship deserves more pomp and circumstance than we can afford today. A christening will just have to be our reward for a safe return. Carry on.\\n(Pike takes the Captain\\'s chair)\\nPIKE: (to the communicator) All decks, this is Captain Pike, prepare for immediate departure. Helm, thrusters.\\nSULU: Moorings retracted, Captain. Dock control reports ready. Thrusters, fired. Separating from Spacedock.\\n(the Enterprise and other ships leave the Spacedock)\\nSULU: The fleet\\'s cleared Spacedock, Captain. All ships ready for warp.\\nPIKE: Set course for Vulcan.\\nSULU: Aye aye, Captain. Course laid in.\\nPIKE: Maximum warp. Punch it.\\n(Sulu \"punches it\" but the ship only flares up and does not enter warp. Everyone stares at Sulu)\\nPIKE: Lieutenant, where\\'s Helmsman McKenna?\\nLIEUTENANT: He has lungworm, sir. He couldn\\'t report to his post.\\nSULU: I\\'m Hikaru Sulu.\\nPIKE: And you are a pilot, right?\\nSULU: Uh, very much so, sir. I\\'m, uh, not sure what\\'s wrong.\\nPIKE: Is the parking break on?\\nSULU: Uh, no. I\\'ll figure it out, I\\'m just, uh...\\nSPOCK: Have you disengaged the external inertial dampener?\\n(Sulu presses a couple buttons)\\nSULU: Ready for warp, sir.\\nPIKE: Let\\'s punch it.\\n(they enter warp)\\n[Sickbay]\\nKIRK: Where are we?\\nMCCOY: Medical bay.\\nKIRK: This is worth it.\\nMCCOY: A little suffering\\'s good for the soul.\\nKIRK: (to a nurse) Hi, how are you.\\nMCCOY: Over here.\\nKIRK: My mouth is itchy, is that normal?\\nMCCOY: Well, those symptoms won\\'t last long. I\\'m going to give you a mild sedative.\\nKIRK: Agh, I wish I didn\\'t know you.\\nMCCOY: Don\\'t be such an infant.\\n(he applies the sedative to Kirk)\\nKIRK: Aggh... how long is it supposed to...\\n(he falls unconscious)\\nMCCOY: Unbelievable.\\n[Bridge]\\nSULU: Engines at maximum warp, Captain.\\nPIKE: Russian whiz kid, what\\'s your name? Chenko, Chirpoff?\\nCHEKOV: Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, sir.\\nPIKE: Fine, Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, begin shipwide mission broadcast.\\nCHEKOV: Yes, sir, happy to.\\n(he punches in a code)\\nCHEKOV: Ensign authorization code nine-five-wictor-wictor-two\\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Authorization Not Recognized.\\nCHEKOV: Ensign authorization code nine-five-vwictor-vwictor-two\\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Access Granted.\\nCHEKOV: (shipwide broadcast) May I have your attention, please. At twenty-two hundred hours, telemetry detected at an anomaly in the neutral zone. What appeared to be a lightning storm in space.\\n[Engineering]\\nCHEKOV: (on monitor) Soon after, Starfleet received a distress signal from Wulcan High Command that their planet was experiencing seismic actiwity.\\n[Shuttlebay]\\nCHEKOV: (on monitor) Our mission is to assess the condition of Wulcan, and to assist in the ewacuations if necessary.\\n[Sickbay]\\nCHEKOV: (on monitor) We should be arriving at Wulcan within three minutes. Thank you for your time.\\n(Kirk awakes in front of the monitor)\\nKirk: Lightning storm!\\nMCCOY: Uh, Jim, you\\'re awake. How do you feel?\\nKIRK: ah.. uh...\\nMCCOY: Good god, man!\\nKIRK: What? Ah!\\n(His hands come into view, extremely swollen)\\nKIRK: What the hell\\'s this?!\\nMCCOY: Reaction to the vaccine. Dammit! Nurse Chapel, I need fifty cc\\'s of cortazone.\\nCHAPEL: (offscreen) Yes, sir.\\n(Kirk replays Chekov\\'s message as McCoy scans Kirk)\\nKIRK: Nice. We got to stop the ship!\\n[Corridor]\\n(Kirk and McCoy are frantically running through the corridors)\\nMCCOY: Jim! I\\'m not kidding, we need to keep your heart rate down!\\nKIRK: Computer, locate crew member Uhura!\\nMCCOY: I haven\\'t seen a reaction this severe since med school.\\nKIRK: We\\'re flying into a trap!\\nMCCOY: Dammit Jim, stand still.\\n(McCoy hypos Kirk in the neck)\\nKIRK: Ow! Stop it!\\n(Kirk runs and finds Uhura)\\nKIRK: Uhura, Uhura.\\nUHURA: Kirk, what are you doing here?\\nKIRK: The transmission from the Klingon prison planet, what exactly was...\\nUHURA: Oh my god, what\\'s wrong with your hands?!\\n(McCoy begins scanning Kirk again)\\nKIRK: It-it-it... look, who is responsible for the Klingon attack? Was the ship Romul...\\nUHURA: Was the ship what?\\nKIRK: (to McCoy) What\\'s happening to my mouth?\\nMCCOY: You got numb tongue?\\nKIRK: (mumbled) Numb tongue!\\nMCCOY: I can fix that!\\n(McCoy briefly leaves)\\nUHURA: Was the ship what?\\nKIRK: (mumbled) Romulan!\\nUHURA: What?\\nKIRK: (mumbled, but clearer) Romulan\\nUHURA: Romulan?\\nKIRK: (mumbled) Yeah\\nUHURA: Yes.\\nKIRK: (mumbled) Yes!\\n(Kirk is hypoed again by McCoy)\\nKIRK: (mumbled) Ahh... dammit!\\n[Vulcan]\\n(a massive drill platform is in the atmosphere, from the Narada.

I take full responsibility.\\nKIRK: Vulcan is not experiencing a natural disaster. It\\'s being attacked by Romulans.\\nPIKE: Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you\\'ve had enough attention for one day. McCoy take him back to medical, we\\'ll have words later.\\nMCCOY: Aye Captain.\\nKIRK: Look, sir, that same anomaly...\\nPIKE: Mister Kirk...\\nSPOCK: Mister Kirk is not cleared to be aboard this vessel.\\nKIRK: Look, I get it, you\\'re a great orator. I\\'d love to do it again with you to.\\nSPOCK: I can remove the Cadet...\\nKIRK: Try it! This Cadet is trying to save the bridge.\\nSPOCK: By recommending a full stop mid-warp during a rescue mission?\\nKIRK: It\\'s not a rescue mission, listen, it\\'s an attack.\\nSPOCK: Based on what facts?\\nKIRK: That same anomaly, a lightning storm in space that we saw today, also occurred on the day of my birth. Before a Romulan ship attacked the USS Kelvin. (to Pike) You know that, sir, I read your dissertation. That ship which had formidable and advanced weaponry was never seen or heard from again. The Kelvin attack to place on the edge of Klingon space and at twenty-three hundred hours last night, there was an attack. Forty-seven Klingon warbirds destroyed by a Romulan, sir. It was reported that the Romulans were in one ship, one massive ship.\\nPIKE: And you know of this Klingon attack how?\\nUHURA: Sir, I intercepted and translated the message myself. Kirk\\'s report is accurate.\\nKIRK: We\\'re warping into a trap, sir. The Romulans are waiting for us, I promise you that.\\nSPOCK: The Cadet\\'s logic is sound. And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics, we would be wise to accept her conclusion.\\nPIKE: Scan Vulcan space, check for any transmissions in Romulan.\\nMALE LIEUTENANT: Sir, I\\'m not sure I can distinguish the Romulan language from Vulcan.\\nPIKE: (to Uhura) What about you? Do you speak Romulan, Cadet?\\nUHURA: Uhura. All three dialects, sir.\\nPIKE: Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.\\nUHURA: Yes sir.\\nPIKE: Hannity, hail the USS Truman.\\nHANNITY: All the other ships are out of warp, sir, and have arrived at Vulcan, but we seemed to have lost all contact.\\nUHURA: Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission, or transmission of any kind in the area.\\nKIRK: It\\'s because they\\'re being attacked.\\nPIKE: Shields up, red alert.\\nSULU: Arrival in Vulcan in five seconds... four... three... two...\\n(the arrive into a huge space battle)\\nPIKE: Emergency evasive.\\nOFFICER: Running sir.\\n(bridge officers begin their reporting)\\nPIKE: Damage report.\\nOFFICER: Deflector shields are holding.\\nPIKE: All stations.

They\\'re weapons are powerful, sir. We can\\'t take another hit like that.\\nPIKE: Get me Starfleet Command.\\nSPOCK: Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered some kind of high energy pulse device into the Vulcan atmosphere. It\\'s signal appears to be blocking our communications and transporter abilities.\\nPIKE: All power to forward shields. Prepare to fire all weapons.\\n[Narada Bridge]\\nWEAPONS OFFICER: Weapons ready.\\n(Nero recognizes the starship on his viewscreen)\\nNERO: Wait! The hull.

To whom am I speaking.\\nNERO: (on viewscreen) Hi Christopher, I\\'m Nero.\\nPIKE: You\\'ve declared war against the Federation. Withdraw. I\\'ll agree to arrange a conference with Romulan leadership at a neutral location.\\nNERO: (on viewscreen) I do not speak for the Empire. We stand apart, as does your Vulcan crewmember, isn\\'t that right, Spock?\\nSPOCK: Pardon me, I do not believe that you and I are acquainted?\\nNERO: (on viewscreen) No, we\\'re not. Not yet. Spock, there\\'s something I would like you to see. Captain Pike, your transporter has been disabled. As you can see by the rest of your armada, you have no choice. You will man a shuttle, come aboard the Narada, for negotiations. That is all.\\n(the viewscreen is turned off. Pike gets up)\\nKIRK: He\\'ll kill you, you know that.\\nSPOCK: Your survival is unlikely.\\nKIRK: Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy. Going over to that ship is a mistake.\\nSPOCK: I, too, agree. You should re-think your strategy.\\nPIKE: I understand that. I need officers who have been trained in advanced hand-to-hand combat.\\nSULU: I have training, sir.\\nPIKE: Come with me. Kirk, you too. You\\'re not supposed to be here anyway. Chekov, you have the conn.\\nCHEKOV: Aye aye Captain.\\n[Narada Bridge]\\nNERO: Prepare the red matter.\\nAYEL: Yes, sir.\\n(Ayel leaves for the Jellyfish, where he extracts a small portion of red matter and loads it into the drill platform apparatus)\\n[Enterprise Engineering]\\nPIKE: Without transporters, we can\\'t beam off the ship, we can\\'t assist Vulcan, we can\\'t do our job. Mister Kirk, Mister Sulu, Engineer Olson, will space-jump from the shuttle. You will land on that machine they lowered into the atmosphere that\\'s scrambling our gear. You\\'ll get inside. You\\'ll disable it, then you\\'ll beam back to the ship. Mister Spock, I\\'m leaving you in command of the Enterprise. Once we have transport capabilities, communications back up, you\\'ll contact Starfleet, report what the hell\\'s going on here. And if all else fails, fall back, rendezvous with the fleet in the Laurentian system. Kirk, I\\'m promoting you to first officer.\\nKIRK: What?\\nSPOCK: Captain, please, I apologize. The complexities of Human pranks escape me.\\nPIKE: It\\'s not a prank, Spock. And I\\'m not the Captain, you are. Let\\'s go.\\nKIRK: Sir, after we knock out that drill, what happens to you?\\nPIKE: Oh, I guess you\\'ll have to come and get me. (to Spock) Careful with the ship, Spock. She\\'s brand new.\\n[Bridge]\\n(Spock takes the Captain\\'s chair)\\nSPOCK: (to communicator) Doctor Puri, report.\\nMCCOY: (on comm) It\\'s McCoy.

Beam us up!\\n[Transporter room]\\nTRANSPORTER CHIEF: I\\'m trying. I can\\'t lock on your signal, you\\'re moving too fast.\\n[Bridge]\\nCHEKOV: I can do that. I can do that!

I\\'m beaming to the surface.\\nKIRK: The surface of what? What, are you going down there? Are you nuts? Spock, you can\\'t do that?!\\nSPOCK: Energize.\\nKIRK: Spock!\\n(Spock transports to Vulcan and heads to the Katric ark)\\n[Katric ark]\\nAMANDA: Spock?\\nSPOCK: The planet has only seconds left.

I\\'m losing her, I\\'m losing her! No, I\\'ve lost her.\\n(the group, minus Amanda, are transported up. Vulcan is shown imploding as Enterprise leaves the area)\\n[Sickbay]\\nSPOCK: (voice-over) Acting captain\\'s log, stardate twenty-two fifty-eight point four two. We have had no word from Captain Pike. I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero. Nero, who has destroyed my home planet and most of its six billion inhabitants. While the essence of our culture has been saved in the elders who now reside upon the ship, I estimate no more than ten thousand have survived. I am now a member of an endangered species.\\n(various cuts and bruises are being fixed, including Kirk\\'s hands and the Vulcan elders)\\n[Bridge]\\n(Spock exits the bridge and enters the turbolift. Uhura follows him)\\n[Turbolift]\\n(Uhura stops the lift)\\nUHURA: I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m so sorry.\\n(she kisses Spock)\\nUHURA: What do you need? Tell me. Tell me.\\n(Spock turns the lift back on)\\nSPOCK: I need everyone to continue performing admirably.\\nUHURA: Okay.\\n(they kiss some more and Spock exits unto a corridor)\\n[Narada torture chamber]\\n(Pike is strapped to a table)\\nNERO: You must have a lot of questions for me. I only have one for you. I need the subspace frequencies of Starfleet\\'s border protection grids. Specifically, those surrounding Earth. Christopher, answer my question.\\nPIKE: No. You answer for the genocide you just committed against a peaceful...\\nNERO: I prevented genocide. In my time, where I come from, this is a simple mining vessel. I chose a life of honest labor, to provide for myself and the wife who was expecting my child. I was off-planet, doing my job, while your Federation did nothing and allowed my people to burn while my planet broke in half. And Spock, he didn\\'t help us. He betrayed us.\\nPIKE: No, no, you\\'re confused. You\\'ve been misinformed. Romulus hasn\\'t been destroyed. It\\'s out there right now. You\\'re blaming the Federation for something that hasn\\'t happened.\\nNERO: It has happened! I watched it happen! I saw it happen! Don\\'t tell me it didn\\'t happen! And when I lost her, I promised myself retribution. And for twenty-five years, I planned my revenge against the Federation, and forgot what it was like to live a normal life. I did not forget the pain. That\\'s the pain that every surviving Vulcan now shares. My purpose, Christopher, is to not simply avoid the destruction of the home that I love, but to create a Romulus that exists free of the Federation. You see, only then will she be truly saved. That is why I will destroy all the remaining Federation planets, starting with yours.\\nPIKE: Then we have nothing left to discuss.\\n(Nero grabs a Centaurian slug with tongues)\\nNERO: You will give me the frequencies to disable Earth\\'s defenses. Centaurian slugs. They latch unto your brainstem, and release a toxin that will force you to answer. Frequencies please, sir.\\nPIKE: Christopher Pike, Captain, USS Enterprise, serial number...\\nNERO: As you wish.\\n(they forcibly open Pike\\'s mouth and drop in the slug as he screams)\\n[Enterprise Bridge]\\nSPOCK: Have you confirmed that Nero is headed for Earth?\\nUHURA: Their trajectory suggests no other destination, Captain.\\nSPOCK: Thank you, Lieutenant.\\n(Kirk is seated in the Captain\\'s chair)\\nKIRK: Earth may be his next stop, but we have to assume every Federation planet\\'s a target.\\nSPOCK: Out of the chair.\\nCHEKOV: Well, if the Federation is a target, why didn\\'t they destroy us?\\nSULU: Why would they? Why waste the weapons? You know... we obviously weren\\'t a threat.\\nSPOCK: That is not it. He said he wanted me to see something. The destruction of my home planet.\\nMCCOY: How the hell did they do that, by the way? Where did the Romulans get that kind of weaponry?\\nSPOCK: The engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create a black hole may suggest an answer. Such technology could theoretically be manipulated to create a tunnel through space-time.\\nMCCOY: Dammit man, I\\'m a doctor, not a physicist. Are you actually suggesting they\\'re from the future?!\\nSPOCK: If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\\nMCCOY: How poetic.\\nKIRK: Then, what would an angry, future Romulan want with Captain Pike?\\nSULU: As Captain, he does know details of Starfleet\\'s defenses.\\nKIRK: What we need to do is catch up to that ship. Disable it, take it over, and get Pike back.\\nSPOCK: We are technologically outmatched in every way. A rescue attempt would be illogical.\\nCHEKOV: Nero\\'s ship would have to drop out of warp for us to overtake him.\\nKIRK: Then, what about assigning engineering crews to try and boost our warp gear?\\nSPOCK: Remaining power and crew are being used to repair radiation leaks on the lower decks...\\nKIRK: Okay, alright. There\\'s got to be some way...\\nSPOCK: ...we must gather with the rest of Starfleet, to balance the terms of the next engagement.\\nKIRK: There won\\'t be a next engagement. By the time we\\'ve gathered, it\\'ll be too late. But you say he\\'s from the future, knows what\\'s going to happen, then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.\\nSPOCK: You are assuming that Nero knows how events are predicted to unfold. To the contrary, Nero\\'s very presence has altered the flow of history, beginning with the attack on the USS Kelvin, culminating in the events of today, thereby creating an entire new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party.\\nUHURA: An alternate reality?\\nSPOCK: Precisely. Whatever our lives might have been, if the time continuum was disrupted, our destinies have changed. Mr. Sulu, plot a course to the Laurentian system warp factor three.\\nKIRK: Spock, don\\'t do that. Running back to the rest of the fleet for a, a, a confab is a massive waste of time...\\nSPOCK: ...orders issued by Captain Pike when he left...\\nKIRK: He also ordered us to go back and get him. Spock, you are captain now! You have to be...\\nSPOCK: I am aware of my responsibilities, Mister...\\nKIRK: Every second we waste, Nero\\'s getting closer to his next target.\\nSPOCK: That is correct and why I am instructing you to accept the fact that I alone...\\nKIRK: I will not allow us to go backwards...\\nMCCOY: Jim!\\nKIRK: ...instead of hunting Nero down!\\nSPOCK: Security. Escort him out.\\n(two security officers grab Kirk and he starts to fight them off)\\nSECURITY OFFICER: Hey!\\nMCCOY: No, Jim!\\n(Spock stops the fight with a Vulcan nerve pinch)\\nSPOCK: Get him off this ship.\\n(Kirk is shot out of the Enterprise in an escape pod, into Delta Vega)\\n[Escape Pod]\\nKIRK: Aggh. Computer, where am I.\\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Location: Delta Vega. Class-M planet. Unsafe. There is a Starfleet outpost fourteen kilometers to the northwest. Remain in your pod until ... summoned authorities.\\nKIRK: Oh, you\\'ve got to be kidding me.\\n(Kirk exits the pod)\\n[Delta Vega surface]\\nKIRK: (to his communicator) Stardate twenty-two fifty-eight point four two, four uh, four whatever. Acting Captain Spock has marooned me on Delta Vega, what I believe to be a violation of security protocol forty-nine point oh nine, covering the treatment of prisoners aboard as starship.\\n(Kirk is suddenly chased by a creature)\\nKIRK: Whoah! Agh!\\n(The creature is attacked and killed by a bigger monster)\\nKIRK: Ahhhh!\\n(He\\'s chased by the monster down a hill and into a cave)\\n[Delta Vega cave]\\n(Kirk\\'s nearly eaten by the monster when the elder Spock shows up with a torch, scaring away the monster)\\nSPOCK PRIME: James T. Kirk.\\nKIRK: Excuse me?\\nSPOCK PRIME: How did you find me?\\nKIRK: How do you know my name?\\nSPOCK PRIME: I have been, and always shall be, your friend.\\nKIRK: Wha... oh, look... uh, I don\\'t know you.\\nSPOCK PRIME: I am Spock.\\nKIRK: Bullshit.\\n(some time later, they are around a fire)\\nSPOCK PRIME: It is remarkably pleasing to see you again, old friend. Especially after the events of today.\\nKIRK: Uh, sir I appreciate what you did for me today, but, but if you were Spock you would know we\\'re not friends at all. You hate me, you marooned me here for mutiny.\\nSPOCK PRIME: Mutiny?\\nKIRK: Yes.\\nSPOCK PRIME: You are not the Captain?\\nKIRK: No, no. Umm... you\\'re the Captain. Pike was taken hostage.\\nSPOCK PRIME: By Nero.\\nKIRK: What do you know about him?\\nSPOCK PRIME: He is a particularly troubled Romulan. Please, allow me. It will be easier.\\n(Spock Prime attempts to mind meld with Kirk)\\nKIRK: Whoah, whoah. What are you doin\\'?\\nSPOCK PRIME: Our minds. One and together.\\n(Spock Prime melds with Kirk)\\nSPOCK PRIME: One hundred twenty-nine years from now, a star will explode, and threaten to destroy the galaxy.\\n[Space]\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) That is where I\\'m from, Jim. The future. The star went supernova...\\n(a star explodes)\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) ...consuming everything in its path. I promised the Romulans that I would save their planet...\\n[Romulus]\\n(a group of Romulans are seen with Spock Prime)\\n[Jellyfish Hangar]\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) We outfitted our fastest ship.\\n[Jellyfish]\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) Using red matter, I would create a black hole, which would absorb the exploding star.\\n[Space]\\n(the Jellyfish goes through space)\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) I was en route, when the unthinkable happened. The supernova destroyed Romulus.\\n(Romulus is consumed by the nova)\\n[Jellyfish]\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) I had little time. I had to extract the red matter, and shoot it into the supernova.\\n(he loads up a drop of red matter and it\\'s shot into the star)\\n[SPACE]\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) As I began my return trip, I was intercepted.\\n[Jellyfish]\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) He called himself Nero. Last of the Romulan Empire.\\n[SPACE]\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) In my attempt to escape, both of us were pulled into the black hole.\\n(the Narada and Jellyfish are sucked through time)\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) Nero went through first. He was the first to arrive.\\n(scenes from the beginning of the film and the destruction of the Kelvin)\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) Nero spent the next twenty-five years awaiting my arrival. But what was years for Nero, was only seconds for me.\\n[Jellyfish]\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) I went through the black hole. Nero was waiting for me.\\n[Narada]\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) He held me responsible for the loss of his world.\\n(Spock Prime kneels before Nero)\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) He captured my vessel, and spared my life for one reason. So that I would know his pain.\\n[Delta Vega surface]\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) He beamed me here, so that I could observe his vengeance. As he was helpless to save his planet, I would be helpless to save mine.\\n(Spock Prime witnesses the destruction of Vulcan from Delta Vega)\\nSPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) Billions of lives lost, because of me, Jim. Because, I failed.\\n[Delta Vega cave]\\n(the meld ends and Kirk is sweaty and crying)\\nSPOCK PRIME: Forgive me. Emotional transferrance is an effect of the mind meld.\\nKIRK: So you do feel?\\nSPOCK PRIME: Yes.\\nKIRK: Going back in time, you changed all our lives.\\nSPOCK PRIME: Jim, we must go. There is a Starfleet outpost not far from here.\\nKIRK: Wait. Where you came from, did I know my father?\\nSPOCK PRIME: Yes. You often spoke of him as being your inspiration for joining Starfleet. He proudly lived to see you become Captain of the Enterprise.\\nKIRK: Captain?\\nSPOCK PRIME: A ship we must return you to as soon as possible.\\n[Enterprise Bridge]\\nSULU: Warp three, sir.\\nCHEKOV: Course one-five-one-mark-three, Laurentian system, sir.\\nSPOCK: Thank you, gentlemen.\\nMCCOY: You wanted to see me?\\nSPOCK: Yes, Doctor. I am aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours. I recognize that supporting me as you did must have been difficult.\\nMCCOY: Is that a thank you?\\nSPOCK: I am simply acknowledging your difficulties.\\nMCCOY: Permission to speak freely, sir.\\nSPOCK: I welcome it.\\nMCCOY: Do you? Okay, then. Are you out of your Vulcan mind? Are you making the logical choice, sending Kirk away? Probably, but the right one? You know, back home we got a saying, \"If you\\'re gonna ride in the Kentucky Derby, you don\\'t leave your prize stallion in the stable.\"\\nSPOCK: A curious metaphor, Doctor, as a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential.\\nMCCOY: My god, man. You could at least act like it was a hard decision.\\nSPOCK: I intend to assist in the effort to reestablish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale was better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I will gladly defer to your medical expertise. Excuse me.\\n(Sarek enters the bridge)\\nMCCOY: Green-blooded hobgoblin.\\n[Delta Vega outpost]\\n(Keenser is heard speaking in an alien language as Spock Prime and Kirk enter the outpost)\\nKIRK: Hello!\\n(Keenser walks up to them and leads them through the outpost. They come up to Montgomery Scott and Keenser gets his attention)\\nSCOTT: What? You realize how unacceptable this is?\\nSPOCK PRIME: Fascinating.\\nKIRK: What?\\nSCOTT: Yeah, I\\'m sure you\\'re just doing your job, but could you not come a wee bit sooner? Six months I\\'ve been here, living off Starfleet protein nibs and a promise of a good meal. And I know exactly what\\'s going on here, okay. Punishment, isn\\'t it? Ongoing, for something that was clearly an accident.\\nSPOCK PRIME: You are Montgomery Scott.\\nKIRK: You know him?\\nSCOTT: Aye, that\\'s me. You\\'re in the right place. Unless there\\'s another hard-working, equally starved Starfleet officer around.\\nKEENSER: Me.\\nSCOTT: Keenser, shut up! You don\\'t eat anything. You can eat like a bean, and you\\'re done. I\\'m talking about food. Real food. But, you\\'re here now, so thank you. Where is it?\\nSPOCK PRIME: You are, in fact, the Mister Scott who postulated the theory of transwarp beaming.\\nSCOTT: That\\'s what I\\'m talking about. How\\'d you think I wound up here? I had a little debate with my instructor on the issue of relativistic physics and how it pertains to subspace travel. He seemed to think that the range of transporting something like a, like a grapefruit, was limited to about a hundred miles. I told him that I could not only beam a grapefruit from one planet to the adjacent planet in the same system, which is easy by the way, I could do it with a lifeform. So, I tested it on Admiral Archer\\'s prized beagle.\\nKIRK: Wait, I know that dog. What happened to it?\\nSCOTT: I\\'ll tell you when it reappears. I don\\'t know. I do feel guilty about that.\\nSPOCK PRIME: What if I told you that your transwarp theory was correct? That it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed?\\nSCOTT: I think if that equation had been discovered, I\\'d have heard about it.\\nSPOCK PRIME: The reason you haven\\'t heard about it, Mister Scott, is because you haven\\'t discovered it yet.\\nSCOTT: I\\'m a, uh, what... Are you from the future?\\nKIRK: Yeah. He is, I\\'m not.\\nSCOTT: Well that\\'s brilliant. Do they still have sandwiches there?\\n(a wee bit later, in the Delta Vega transporter area)\\nSCOTT: Well, she\\'s a wee bit dodgy. Shield emitters are totally bandjacked(?), as well as a few other things. In you go. So, the Enterprise has had its maiden voyage, has it? She is one well endowed lady. I\\'d like to get my hands on her ample nacelles, if you\\'ll pardon the engineering parlance.\\n[Delta Vega shuttle]\\nSCOTT: (to Spock Prime) Except, the thing is, even if I believed you, right, where you\\'re from, what I\\'ve done, I don\\'t, by the way, you\\'re still talking about beaming aboard the Enterprise while she\\'s traveling faster-than-light, without a proper receiving pattern. (to Keenser) Get off there! It\\'s not a climbing free(?). (to Spock Prime) The notion of transwarp beaming is like, trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse. What\\'s that?\\nSPOCK PRIME: Your equation for achieving transwarp beaming.\\nSCOTT: (mumbles something) Imagine that. It never occurred to me to think of space as the thing that was moving.\\nKIRK: (to Spock Prime) You\\'re coming with us, right?\\nSPOCK PRIME: No, Jim. That is not my destiny.\\nKIRK: Your dest... He... the other Spock is not going to believe me. Only you can explain what\\'s gonna happen.\\nSPOCK PRIME: Under no circumstances, can he be aware of my existence. You must promise me this.\\nKIRK: You\\'re telling me I, I can\\'t tell you that I\\'m following your own orders. Why not? What happens?\\nSPOCK PRIME: Jim, this is one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero, you alone must take command of your ship.\\nKIRK: How? Over your dead body?\\nSPOCK PRIME: Preferably not. However, there is Starfleet regulation six-one-nine. Six-one-nine states that any command officer who\\'s emotionally compromised by the mission at hand, must resign said command.\\nKIRK: So, so you\\'re saying that I have to emotionally compromise you guys?\\nSPOCK PRIME: Jim, I just lost my planet. I can tell you, I am emotionally compromised. What you must do is get me to show it.\\nSCOTT: Aye then, Laddie. Live or die, let\\'s get this over with.\\n(Kirk and Scott enter the transporter areas. Keenser attempts to as well, but Scott pushes him out)\\nSCOTT: (to Keenser) You cannae come with me. Go on.\\nKIRK: (to Spock Prime) You\\'re coming back in time, changing history, it\\'s cheating.\\nSPOCK PRIME: A trick I learned from an old friend. (he does the salute) Live long and prosper.\\n(they transport away as Keenser whimpers)\\n[Enterprise Engineering]\\n(Kirk is seen transporting on the ship)\\nKIRK: Mister Scott!\\n(a pounding occurs on the wall next to Kirk)\\nKIRK: Mister Scott, can you hear me!\\n(Scott is stuck in the coolant/water pipes)\\nKIRK: Uh... uh.. hold on a second! Oh no. Don\\'t worry I... Oh. No, no!\\n(Kirk sees that Scott\\'s pipe route takes him directly into a spinning turbine area, and he quickly finds a computer to open the release valve)\\nCOMPUTER VOICE: Turbine release valve activated.\\n(Scott falls out of the release valve)\\nKIRK: You alright? You alright?!\\nSCOTT: My heads buzzing, and I\\'m soaked, but otherwise I\\'m fine!\\n[Bridge]\\nCHEKOV: Captain Spock, detecting unauthorized access to water turbine control board.\\nSPOCK: Bring up the video.\\n(Video of Kirk and Scott is shown)\\nSPOCK: (to communicator) Security, seal the engineering deck. We have intruders in turbine section three. Set phasers to stun.\\n[Engineering]\\n(Kirk and Scott run wildly out of Engineering until security catches up with them)\\nCUPCAKE: Halt! Come with me, cupcake!\\n[Bridge]\\n(Kirk and Scott are escorted onto the bridge)\\nSPOCK: (to Scott) Who are you?\\nSCOTT: I\\'m with him.\\nKIRK: He\\'s with me.\\nSPOCK: We\\'re travelling at warp speed. How did you manage to beam aboard this ship?\\nKIRK: You\\'re the genius, you figure it out.\\nSPOCK: As Acting Captain of this vessel, I order you to answer the question.\\nKIRK: Well I\\'m not telling, Acting Captain. What di... What, now, that doesn\\'t frustrate you, does it? My lack of cooperation. That, that doesn\\'t make you angry.\\nSPOCK: (to Scott) Are you a member of Starfleet?\\nSCOTT: I.. um.. yes. Can I get a towel, please?\\nSPOCK: Under penalty of court martial, I order you to explain to me how you were able to beam aboard this ship while moving at warp.\\nSCOTT: Well...\\nKIRK: Don\\'t answer him.\\nSPOCK: You will answer me.\\nSCOTT: I\\'d rather not take sides.\\nKIRK: What is it with you, Spock? Hmm? Your planet was just destroyed, your mother murdered, and you\\'re not even upset.\\nSPOCK: If you\\'re presuming that these experiences in any way impede my ability to command this ship, you are mistaken.\\nKIRK: And yet you were the one who said fear was necessary for command. Did you see his ship? Do you see what he did?\\nSPOCK: Yes, of course I did.\\nKIRK: So, are you afraid or aren\\'t you?\\nSPOCK: I will not allow you to lecture me about the merits of emotion.\\nKIRK: Then why don\\'t you stop me.\\nSPOCK: Step away from me, Mister...\\nKIRK: What is it like not to feel anger or heartbreak or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the death of the woman who gave birth to you?\\nSPOCK: Back away from me...\\nKIRK: You feel nothing! It must not even compute for you! You never loved her!\\n(fight between Spock and Kirk breaks out, ending up with Spock nearly strangling Kirk on the helm console)\\nSAREK: Spock!\\nSPOCK: I am no longer fit for duty. I hereby relinquish my command, based on the fact that I have been emotionally compromised. Please note the time and date in the ship\\'s log.\\n(Spock leaves the bridge, followed by Sarek)\\nSCOTT: I like this ship! You know, it\\'s exciting.\\nMCCOY: Well, congratulations, Jim. Now we\\'ve got no Captain and no goddamn first officer to replace him.\\nKIRK: Yeah we do.\\n(Kirk takes the Captain\\'s chair)\\nMCCOY: What?\\nSULU: Pike made him first officer.\\nMCCOY: You\\'ve got to be kidding me.\\nKIRK: Thanks for the support.\\nUHURA: I sure hope you know what you\\'re doing, Captain.\\nKIRK: So do I. (to communicator) Attention crew of the Enterprise, this is James Kirk.\\n[Corridor]\\n(Spock is walking through the corridor)\\nKIRK: (over comm) Mister Spock has resigned commission and advanced me to Acting Captain. I know you were all expecting to regroup with fleet, but I\\'m ordering a pursuit course of the enemy ship to Earth. I want all departments at battle stations and ready in ten minutes.\\n[Bridge]\\nKIRK: (to communicator) Either we\\'re going down, or they are. Kirk out.\\n[Transporter room]\\n(Spock is staring at the transporter pad as Sarek enters)\\nSAREK: Speak your mind, Spock.\\nSPOCK: That would be unwise.\\nSAREK: What is necessary is never unwise.\\nSPOCK: I\\'m as conflicted as I once was as a child.\\nSAREK: You will always be a child of two worlds. I am grateful for this. And for you.\\nSPOCK: I feel anger for the one who took mother\\'s life. An anger I cannot control.\\nSAREK: I believe, as she would say, do not try to. You asked me once why I married your mother. I married her because I loved her.\\n[Bridge]\\n(as the crew talks, Chekov does calculations on a board)\\nKIRK: Whatever the case, we need to get aboard Nero\\'s ship undetected.\\nMCCOY: And just go in there guns blazing, Jim. No...\\nSULU: I\\'m telling you the math doesn\\'t support...\\nCHEKOV: Captain Kork, Captain Kork!\\nKIRK: Yes, Chekov. What is it?\\nCHEKOV: Based on the fastest course from Wulcan, I have projected that Nero will travel past Saturn. Like you said, we need to stay inwisible to Nero or he\\'ll destroy us. If Mister Scott can get us to warp factor four, and if we drop out of warp behind one of Saturn\\'s moons, say, Titan, the magnetic distortion from the planet\\'s rings will make us inwisible to Nero\\'s sensors. From there, as long as the drill is not actiwated we can beam aboard the enemy ship.\\nSCOTT: Aye, that might work.\\nMCCOY: Wait a minute, kid, how old are you?\\nCHEKOV: Seventeen, sir.\\nMCCOY: Oh, oh good, he\\'s seventeen.\\nSPOCK: Doctor, Mister Chekov is correct. I can confirm his telemetry. If Mister Sulu is able to maneuver us into position, I can beam aboard Nero\\'s ship, steal back the black hole device, and if possible, bring back Captain Pike.\\nKIRK: I won\\'t allow you to do that, Mister Spock.\\nSPOCK: Romulans and Vulcans share a common ancestry. Our cultural similarities will make it easier for me to access the ship\\'s computer to locate the device. Also, my mother was Human, which makes Earth the only home I have left.\\nKIRK: I\\'m coming with you.\\nSPOCK: I would cite regulation, but I know you will simply ignore it.\\nKIRK: See, we are getting to know each other.\\n[Narada]\\nNERO: Prepare the drill.\\n(the platform lowers to Earth)\\n[Enterprise Bridge]\\nSULU: All stop in three... two... one. Give me one quarter impulse burst for five seconds. I\\'ll do the rest with thrusters, on my mark.\\nCHEKOV: Aye.\\nSULU: Fire. (to comm) Transporter room.\\n[Transporter room]\\nSULU: (on comm) We are in position above Titan.\\nSCOTT: Really? Fine job, Mister Sulu. Well done.\\n(Spock, Kirk, and Uhura enter)\\nKIRK: How are we, Scotty?\\nSCOTT: Unbelievably, sir, the ship is in position.\\nKIRK: (to comm) Whatever happens, Mister Sulu, if you think\\nyou have the tactical advantage, you fire on that ship, even if we\\'re still onboard. That\\'s an order.\\n[Bridge]\\n\\nSULU: Yes, sir.\\nKIRK: (on comm) Otherwise, we\\'ll contact the Enterprise when we\\'re ready to be beamed back.\\nSULU: Good luck.\\n[Transporter room]\\n(Kirk gets on the transporter pad with Spock. Spock and Uhura have an intimate moment)\\nSPOCK: (to Uhura) I will be back.\\nUHURA: You better be. I\\'ll be monitoring your frequency.\\nSPOCK: Thank you, Nyota.\\n(Uhura leaves)\\nKIRK: So her first name\\'s Nyota?\\nSPOCK: I have no comment on the matter.\\nSCOTT: Okey-dokey then. If there\\'s any common sense in the design of the enemy ship, I should be putting you somewhere in the cargo bay. There shouldn\\'t be a soul in sight.\\nKIRK: Energize.\\n[Narada \"cargo bay\"]\\n(Kirk and Spock beam into an area with many Romulans. Screaming in the Romulan language is heard as they notice the away team\\'s presence and a firefight begins)\\nROMULAN: (to comm) Captain, we have Starfleet officers aboard the ship. One of them is Vulcan.\\n[Narada Bridge]\\nNERO: No. (he runs to get his lieutenant) Ayel!\\n[Narada cargo bay]\\nKIRK: (to Spock) I\\'ll cover ya.\\nSPOCK: Are you certain?\\nKIRK: Yeah, I got ya.\\n(Spock melds with an injured Romulan)\\nKIRK: Do you know where it is?

Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Your ship is compromised. Your too close to the singularity to provide assistance, which we will provide.\\nSPOCK: (to Kirk) Captain, what are you doing?\\nKIRK: You show them compassion may be the only way to earn peace with Romulus. It\\'s logic, Spock. Thought you\\'d like that.\\nSPOCK: No, not really. Not this time.\\nNERO: (on viewscreen) I would rather suffer the end of Romulus a thousand times.

There are so few Vulcans left, we cannot afford to ignore each other.\\nSPOCK: Then why did you send Kirk aboard, when you alone could have explained the truth?\\nSPOCK PRIME: Because, you needed each other. I could not deprive you of the revelation of all that you could accomplish together. Of a friendship, that would define you both, in ways you cannot yet realize.\\nSPOCK: How did you persuade him to keep your secret?\\nSPOCK PRIME: He inferred that universe-ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise.\\nSPOCK: You lied.\\nSPOCK PRIME: Oh, I... I implied.\\nSPOCK: A gamble.\\nSPOCK PRIME: An act of faith. One I hope that you will repeat in the future at Starfleet.\\nSPOCK: In the face of extinction, it is only logical I resign my Starfleet commission and help rebuild our race.\\nSPOCK PRIME: And yet, you can be in two places at once. I urge you to remain in Starfleet. I have already located a suitable planet on which to establish a Vulcan colony. Spock, in this case, do yourself a favor. Put aside logic. Do what feels right. Since my customary farewell would appear oddly self-serving, I shall simply say good luck.\\n[Starfleet Academy hearing]\\nBARNETT: This assembly calls Captain James Tiberius Kirk.

There you go with that word.\\nRuphylin. What the hell is a Ruphylin?\\n\\n\\n  \\nWow, you are\\nthe world\\'s shittiest drug dealer.\\n\\n\\n  \\nRuphylin, for your information, is the\\ndate rape drug.

I must have mixed up the bags.\\nMy fault, Alan.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDamn, Marshall gonna be\\npissed off at me on that one.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Whatever.\\n- It\\'s funny, because just the other day...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...me and my boy, we was wondering\\nwhy they even call them roofies.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- You know what I\\'m talking about?\\n- No. Don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhy not floories, right?\\nBecause when you take them...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...you\\'re more likely\\nto end up on the floor than the roof.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhat about groundies?\\nThat\\'s a good new name for them.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOr, how about rapies?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Wait, what did you just say?\\n- Rapies.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNot you. Doug,\\nwhat did you say before?\\n\\n\\n  \\nI said groundies.\\n\\n\\n  \\nNo, before that.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou said, \"You\\'re more likely to wind up\\non the floor than...\"\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Phil.\\n- Listen, Trace, I\\'m really sorry. l...\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Phil?

Come on.\\n- Sorry.\\n\\n\\n  \\nCan someone tell me\\nwhere white Doug is?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- He\\'s on the roof, Alan.\\n- Yes.\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s on the roof. We must have\\ntaken him up there as a prank...\\n\\n\\n  \\n...so he\\'d wake up on the roof.\\n- Like that time in summer camp.\\n\\n\\n  \\nWe moved his sleeping bag\\nout in the jetty at the lake?\\n\\n\\n  \\nHa, ha, ha. Which was hilarious.\\n\\n\\n  \\nIt\\'s not so funny now, though,\\nbecause we forgot where we put him.\\n\\n\\n  \\nYou guys are retarded, you know that?\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Holy shit. You think he\\'s still up there?\\n- There\\'s only one way to find out.\\n\\n\\n  \\nDoug!\\n\\n\\n  \\nDoug!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Doug!\\n- Doug, you up here, buddy?\\n\\n\\n  \\nWhere you at, Doug?\\n\\n\\n  \\nDoug!\\n\\n\\n  \\nHey, guys!\\n\\n\\n  \\nHe\\'s over here!\\n\\n\\n  \\n- Hey, I found him!

My skin burns.\\n\\n\\n  \\nOh, ow! God.\\n\\n\\n  \\n- It\\'s okay. It\\'s not your fault, Doug.\\n- Don\\'t touch me.

Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a curtained object. MUNTZ Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster of Paradise Falls! He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON. CROWD Ooh! Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And golly, what a swell monster this is. But what\\'s this? Skeptical scientists analyze the bones. 3. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Scientists cry foul! The National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton! YOUNG CARL No! Muntz\\'s portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other famous explorers. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The organization strips Muntz of his membership. Muntz\\'s \"Explorer\\'s Society\" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED from his jacket. Carl GASPS. Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield. He grimly addresses the crowd. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast... alive! MUNTZ I promise to capture the beast... alive! In the theater, young Carl smiles. MUNTZ And I will not come back until I do! The crowd CHEERS. Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible lifts off. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And so the explorer is off to clear his name. Bon voyage Charles Muntz, and good luck capturing the Monster of Paradise Falls! Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle. DISSOLVE TO: 4. EXT.

He... goes around Mount Everest! Is there nothing he cannot do? TITLE CARD: UP NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Yes, as Muntz himself says: \"Adventure is--\" GIRL\\'S VOICE (O.S.) \"Adventure is out there!\" Carl stops. Who said that? The voice comes from a dilapidated HOUSE, windows boarded up and lawn overgrown with weeds. The weather vane atop the house turns, pulled by ropes. GIRL\\'S VOICE (O.S.) Look out! Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard. Must get the Spirit of Adventure over Mount Rushmore... 5. Carl walks toward the voice. GIRL\\'S VOICE (O.S.) Hold together old girl. How\\'re my dogs doing? Ruff ruff! INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Carl squeezes through the broken door into the foyer. He follows the voice toward the living room. GIRL\\'S VOICE (O.S.) All engines ahead full! Let\\'s take her up to 26,000 feet! Rudders eighteen degrees towards the south. INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Carl rounds the corner to see... ELLIE, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles. Bare footed, her overalls are patched and dirty. The old house has been transformed into a make-believe dirigible cockpit. Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty old bicycle. YOUNG ELLIE It\\'s a beautiful day, winds out of the east at ten knots. Visibility... unlimited. (yells a command) Enter the weather in the logbook! The navigator (her hamster) skitters in its cage. Ellie uses two tied-together Coke bottles as binoculars. YOUNG ELLIE Oh! There\\'s something down there! I will bring it back for science. Awwww, it\\'s a puppy! Carl is distracted by the Muntz newspaper clippings taped to the wall. YOUNG ELLIE (O.S.) No time! A storm! Lightning! Hail! Ellie pops up in front of Carl. 6. YOUNG ELLIE What are you doing!?! Carl screams. He lets go of his balloon. It floats through a broken part of the ceiling and disappears. Ellie circles Carl accusingly. YOUNG ELLIE Don\\'t you know this is an exclusive club? Only explorers get in here. Not just any kid off the street with a helmet and a pair of goggles. Do you think you got what it takes? Well, do you?!? Carl FUMPHERS. YOUNG ELLIE Alright, you\\'re in. Welcome aboard. She offers her hand. Carl looks down, embarrassed. YOUNG ELLIE What\\'s wrong? Can\\'t you talk? Carl is frozen. Ellie softens. YOUNG ELLIE Hey, I don\\'t bite. She takes off her helmet. Her hair frizzes out in all directions. She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and pins it on Carl. YOUNG ELLIE You and me, we\\'re in a club now. Carl smiles. YOUNG ELLIE I saw where your balloon went. Come on, let\\'s go get it! Carl watches her stride out of the room. She pops back in. YOUNG ELLIE My name\\'s Ellie. She grabs his hand. Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room. 7. INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, UPSTAIRS YOUNG ELLIE There it is. Carl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon. Between them the floor has collapsed, save one rickety beam. Carl GULPS. YOUNG ELLIE Well, go ahead. She pushes him out onto the beam. YOUNG ELLIE Go on. Carl steels his courage. He puts on his goggles, starts forward... and FALLS through the floor. CUT TO: EXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY Ambulance. SIREN blaring. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE - NIGHT One lone light on upstairs. INT. CARL\\'S ROOM Carl in bed, reading a book by flashlight, his arm in a CAST. Into the room floats Carl\\'s lost BLUE BALLOON.

YOUNG CARL Ow!! 8. Ellie climbs in the window. YOUNG ELLIE Thought you might need a little cheerin\\' up. I got somethin\\' to show ya! INT. CARL\\'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight. Ellie whispers, as if to protect a National Secret. YOUNG ELLIE I am about to let you see something I have never shown to another human being. Ever. In my life. Carl\\'s eyes widen in alarm. YOUNG ELLIE You\\'ll have to swear you will not tell anyone. Carl nods. YOUNG ELLIE Cross your heart. Do it! Carl crosses. Ellie unveils... YOUNG ELLIE My Adventure Book! It\\'s a reused photo album with the words \"My Adventure Book\" written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz. YOUNG ELLIE You know him. Carl smiles excitedly. YOUNG ELLIE Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get big, I\\'m going where he\\'s going: South America. She turns the page to a map. YOUNG ELLIE It\\'s like America... but south. Wanna know where I\\'m gonna live? 9. She turns to an engraving of a large waterfall. A small hand- drawn picture of Ellie\\'s clubhouse is glued to the top. YOUNG ELLIE (reading caption) \"Paradise Falls, a land lost in time.\" I ripped this right out of a library book. Carl GASPS in horror. YOUNG ELLIE I\\'m gonna move my clubhouse there, and park it right next to the falls. Who knows what lives up there? And once I get there... She flips through her book, revealing a page marked, \"STUFF I\\'M GOING TO DO.\" Past that, the pages are blank. YOUNG ELLIE Well, I\\'m saving these pages for all the adventures I\\'m gonna have. Only... I just don\\'t know how I\\'m gonna get to Paradise Falls. Ellie closes the book, disappointed. Carl has a thought. He looks at his toy dirigible. YOUNG ELLIE That\\'s it! You can take us there in a blimp! Swear you\\'ll take us. Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross your heart. Carl does. YOUNG ELLIE Good. You promised. No backing out. Carl shakes his head \"no.\" YOUNG ELLIE Well, see you tomorrow kid! Bye. Ellie hops up and jumps out the window. YOUNG ELLIE \"Adventure is out there!!\" She pops back in. 10. YOUNG ELLIE You know, you don\\'t talk very much. I like you. Carl looks out the window after her in amazement. He rests his head on his balloon. YOUNG CARL Wow. The balloon pops. CUT TO: INT. CHURCH - DAY FLASH! A photo is taken of the wedding couple: Carl and Ellie, now 19. She jumps at him and gives him a big kiss. Ellie\\'s side of the church erupts like wild frontiersmen.

A SERIES OF SHOTS The jar slowly fills as Carl and Ellie toss in spare change. Their car blows a tire. The two stand by the jar, reluctant. Carl BREAKS the jar. New tire. Carl in the hospital with a broken leg. Breaking jar. A storm rages. A tree falls, crushing the roof. Breaking jar. INT. CARL AND ELLIE\\'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - MORNING Carl struggles to tie his tie. Ellie helps. They walk out the front door arm in arm. INT. CARL AND ELLIE\\'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 3 YEARS LATER Ellie struggles to tie Carl\\'s tie as they rush out the door.

He grabs his cane, with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom spokes. INT. CARL\\'S STAIRCASE - LATER Now dressed, Carl rides his ELDERLY ASSISTANCE CHAIR down the staircase.

Carl scoffs. 16. CARL Shady Oaks Retirement. Oh brother. Carl notices DUST on his mailbox. CARL Hm. He pulls up a LEAF BLOWER. He revs it and blasts off the dust. TOM, the CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, notices. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM Hey! `Morning, Mr. Fredricksen! Need any help there? CARL No. Yes. Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house. He points across the lot to a business man in a suit talking on a cell phone - the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM Well just to let you know, my boss would be happy to take this old place off your hands, and for double his last offer. Whaddya say to that? The leaf blower blasts off his hat. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM Uh, I take that as a no, then. CARL I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM You poured prune juice in his gas tank. CARL Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let me talk to him. Tom hands Carl his MEGAPHONE. CARL (in megaphone) You in the suit. Yes, you. Take a bath, hippy! Tom grabs the megaphone. 17. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM (to Boss, re Carl) I am not with him! (to Carl) This is serious. He\\'s out to get your house! Carl walks to his front door.

CARL\\'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER Carl sits in his chair watching TV. A KNOCK at the door. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY The door opens. A Wilderness Explorer stands, reading from a Wilderness Explorer Manual. He is in uniform, complete with sash, neckerchief, hat, and an enormous backpack stuffed with every piece of equipment there is. This is RUSSELL, age 8. Russell, nose buried in his MANUAL, reads to Carl. RUSSELL \"Good afternoon. My name is Russell. And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12. Are you in need of any assistance today, sir?\" As he finishes the script, Russell smiles up at Carl. CARL No. 18. RUSSELL I could help you cross the street. CARL No. RUSSELL I could help you cross your yard. CARL No. RUSSELL I could help you cross your... porch? CARL No. RUSSELL Well, I gotta help you cross something. CARL Uh, no. I\\'m doing fine. Carl closes the door in Russell\\'s face. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS Carl listens through the door. Is the kid gone? He opens it. RUSSELL \"Good afternoon. My name is Russell.\" CARL Uh... kid... RUSSELL \"And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12.\" CARL Kid. KID!! Russell stops... but goes back to reading. RUSSELL \"Are you in need of any assistance today Sir?\" CARL Thank you, but I don\\'t need any help! 19. Carl swings the door shut, but a small camping boot stops it. RUSSELL Ow. Carl opens the door. Russell stands at attention. CARL (RESIGNED) Proceed. RUSSELL \"Good afternoon. My-\" CARL But skip to the end! Russell points to his SASH. It is covered with badges except for one glaringly empty space. RUSSELL See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer badges. You may notice one is missing. It\\'s my Assisting the Elderly badge. If I get it I will become a Senior Wilderness Explorer! Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a \"W\", his fingers the \"wings\" of a bird, then the \"claws\" of a bear. RUSSELL \"The wilderness must be explored! CAW-CAW! RAAAR!\" This sets Carl\\'s hearing aid off. Carl GRUMBLES in pain. RUSSELL It\\'s gonna be great! There\\'s a big ceremony, and all the dads come, and they pin on our badges... CARL So you want to assist an old person? RUSSELL Yep! Then I will be a Senior Wilderness Explorer! Carl leans in close to Russell. 20. CARL (CONSPIRATORIALLY) You ever heard of a snipe? RUSSELL Snipe? CARL Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I\\'m elderly and infirm. I can\\'t catch it. If only someone could help me... RUSSELL Me! Me! I\\'ll do it! CARL Oh, I don\\'t know, it\\'s awfully crafty. You\\'d have to clap your hands three times to lure it in. RUSSELL I\\'ll find it, Mr. Fredricksen! CARL I think its burrow is two blocks down. If you go past -- RUSSELL Two blocks down! Got it! Russell runs down the block clapping and calling. RUSSELL Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey... CARL (calls after Russell) Bring it back here when you find it! Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door. He stops short. A large truck is backing up, getting dangerously close to ELLIE\\'S MAILBOX. CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE Okay, keep her coming... And... stop. Stop! STOP!! The truck hits Ellie\\'s mailbox, crushing the front. 21. Carl is shocked. He runs to the box. CARL What? Hey! Hey you! What do you think you\\'re doing? CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE I am so sorry, sir... The worker bangs on the mailbox, trying to fix it. CARL Don\\'t touch that! CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE No no, let me take care of that for you. Carl grabs the mailbox, trying to wrestle it from the worker. CARL (STRUGGLING) Get away from our mailbox! CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE Hey sir, I... CARL I don\\'t want you to touch it! Carl HITS the worker with his cane. He falls to the sidewalk. The worker rubs his head. Blood. Carl backs up toward his door, cradling his mailbox. What has he done? Passerbys stare. Workers gather, as does the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER. Carl backs into his house. INT. CARL\\'S LIVING ROOM Carl shuts his door. He closes the curtains. He peeks out the window. The injured worker is helped to his feet. A police car pulls up. The Real Estate Developer looks toward Carl\\'s house. His hand rests on Carl\\'s fence. 22. INT.

She hands him a pamphlet for SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE. OFFICER EDITH The guys from Shady Oaks will be by to pick you up in the morning, okay? The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone. Carl faces the house. He touches Ellie\\'s dented mailbox. CARL What do I do now, Ellie? INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT All is quiet but the slow ticking of the clock. The empty hall. The front hall mirror. The kitchen. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, CLOSET Carl pulls out a suitcase. A book tips over. Ellie\\'s Adventure Book. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl sits in his chair slowly paging through the book. 23. He turns to the page marked \"STUFF I\\'M GOING TO DO.\" He closes the book and sighs. Carl looks at the Adventure Shrine, and the PAINTING of their house by Paradise Falls. He holds the Shady Oaks pamphlet. Carl\\'s brows furrow. He looks up at the shrine, and crosses his heart. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE - NIGHT Lights are on inside the house. MATCH DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE - MORNING A SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE van pulls up. Nurses GEORGE and A.J. walk to Carl\\'s door and KNOCK. Carl answers, holding a suitcase. CARL Morning gentlemen. NURSE GEORGE Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen. You ready to go? CARL Ready as I\\'ll ever be. Would you do me a favor and take this? Carl hands over his suitcase. CARL I\\'ll meet you at the van in just a minute. I... want to say one last goodbye to the old place. NURSE GEORGE Sure. Take all the time you need, sir. Carl closes the door. Rather sharply. The nurses head back to the van. 24. NURSE A.J. Typical. He\\'s probably going to the bathroom for the eightieth time. Empty helium tanks are strewn on the front lawn. NURSE GEORGE You\\'d think he\\'d take better care of his house. A SHADOW falls over the nurses. They turn to look. A giant tarp rises behind Carl\\'s house. It unfolds to reveal THOUSANDS OF BALLOONS. The balloons rise up like some massive multi-colored cumulus cloud forming a thunderhead above the house. Strings tug at the chimney. The house strains. Pipes bend, then break. Electrical wires spark and snap. The house rips away from its foundation. The nurses duck and YELL as the house soars over them. Carl looks out the window and LAUGHS. CARL So long boys! I\\'ll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls! INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Balloons spill colored light into a little girl\\'s room as the house floats past. EXT. TOWN The shadow of the house drifts through an intersection. EXT. SHOP WINDOW A family watches the house float down the street. EXT. ABOVE THE TOWN Carl waves at a high-rise window washer, who tentatively waves back. The house crests the top of a building, drifting over and away from the city. Carl looks out his window. Good riddance. 25. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl sets a compass next to the map of South America. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, BEDROOM WINDOW Sails made from stitched-together curtains emerge from the windows and billow in the wind. Carl steers using ropes attached to the weather vane. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM The compass needle rotates to point SOUTH. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE The house turns. Carl looks out the window, satisfied. He checks the balloons. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl kisses a photo of Ellie. CARL We\\'re on our way, Ellie. Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings tied to the grate. He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair. He closes his eyes and smiles. SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, FLOATING The house drifts through the clouds. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl relaxes in his chair. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. CARL Huh? 26. He stares at the front door. Nothing. CARL Hm. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. He bolts up and approaches the door.

Russell?!! RUSSELL Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It\\'s me, Russell. CARL What are you doing out here, kid? Russell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and holding on for dear life. RUSSELL I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse. The flag on Russell\\'s backpack blows off and falls through the clouds. RUSSELL Please let me in? CARL No. Carl slams the door, leaving Russell alone. Beat. The door opens again. CARL Oh, alright, you can come... Russell runs into the house past Carl. CARL ...in. 27. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Russell PANTS, panicked. He looks into living room. RUSSELL Huh. I\\'ve never been in a floating house before. Carl follows Russell into the living room. Russell chuckles and points at the photo of young Ellie. RUSSELL Goggles. Look at this stuff! Russell finds Ellie\\'s house drawing sitting on the pages of the open atlas. RUSSELL Wow, you going on a trip? (reads from the engraving) \"Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in Time.\" You going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen? Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket. CARL Don\\'t touch that. You\\'ll soil it. RUSSELL You know, most people take a plane, but you\\'re smart because you\\'ll have all your TV and clocks and stuff. Russell runs over to the steering rig. RUSSELL Whoah. Is this how you steer your house? Does it really work? CARL Kid, would you stop with the -- Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and forth. RUSSELL Oh, this makes it go right, and that way\\'s left. CARL Let go of the -- knock it off! Russell looks out the window in front of him. 28. RUSSELL Hey look, buildings! EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, WINDOW - CONTINUOUS Russell and Carl arrive at the window. RUSSELL That building\\'s so close I could almost touch it. That gives Carl an idea. CUT TO: Carl lowers Russell on a rope below the floating house. RUSSELL Wow! This is great! You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there\\'s a bus that could take me home two blocks away! (looking up) Hey, I can see your house from here! CARL (struggling to hold on) Don\\'t jerk around so much, kid! The rope slips through Carl\\'s hands. Russell FALLS. CUT TO: Carl stands beside Russell at the window. Russell\\'s fall had been a daydream. CARL Well, that\\'s not gonna work. Carl leaves Russell at the window. RUSSELL I know that cloud, it\\'s a Cumulo Nimbus. Did you know that the Cumulo Nimbus... INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS GRUMBLING, Carl kneels at the fireplace to cut a few balloon strings with his housekeys. 29. CARL Stayed up all night blowing up balloons, for what? RUSSELL ...warm air goes by cool air, and the airs go by each other and that\\'s how we get lightning. CARL That\\'s nice, kid. Carl turns off his hearing aid. Silence. He smiles. Russell tries to get Carl\\'s attention. A storm is brewing in the distance. RUSSELL (nearly silent) Mr. Fredricksen, there\\'s a big storm coming. It\\'s starting to get scary. We\\'re gonna get blown to bits! We\\'re in big trouble, Mr. Fredricksen! A huge lightning bolt flash lights up the room. Carl turns on his hearing aid. CARL What are you doing over there? RUSSELL Look! EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, WINDOW - CONTINUOUS Carl joins Russell at the window. RUSSELL See? Cumulo Nimbus. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS The tiny house is heading for a MASSIVE STORM. Carl STRUGGLES to steer the house away but is blown into the storm. The steering mechanism recoils and sends Carl flying. Plates fall from the walls and furniture slides as the house is rocked in the storm. Russell\\'s backpack slides toward the front door. 30. RUSSELL My pack! Russell HOPS on top of the backpack. RUSSELL Got ya! The pack slides toward the OPEN FRONT DOOR. Russell screams. He\\'s about to slide out when the house tilts and the door swings shut. The Paradise Falls jar rolls past Carl. He chases after it. Ellie\\'s chair slides across the room. Carl gasps and runs to protect it. The photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall. Carl lunges to catch it. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, FLOATING The storm rages. The house is tossed into the storm clouds. All goes black. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MORNING Carl is asleep. A finger pokes Carl\\'s face. Nothing. The finger pokes Carl\\'s face again. Carl WAKES UP. RUSSELL Whew! I thought you were dead. CARL Wha... what happened? Carl STRUGGLES to rise from the pile of Ellie\\'s things he\\'d been protecting. RUSSELL I steered us. I did! I steered the house! CARL Steered us? 31. RUSSELL After you tied your stuff down you took a nap, so I went ahead and steered us down here. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, WINDOW Carl opens the window and looks out. CARL Huh? EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, FLOATING The house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, WINDOW CARL Can\\'t tell where we are. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM RUSSELL Oh we\\'re in South America all right. It was a cinch, with my Wilderness Explorer GPS. Russell holds up his WILDERNESS EXPLORER GPS UNIT. CARL GP-what? RUSSELL My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby, we\\'ll never be lost! Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, FLOATING Carl and Russell watch the tiny GPS unit descend into the clouds. RUSSELL Oops. 32. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl kneels by the fireplace and cuts at the balloon strings. CARL We\\'ll get you down, find a bus stop. You just tell the man you want to go back to your mother. RUSSELL Sure, but I don\\'t think they have busses in Paradise Falls. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, FLOATING A small cluster of balloons fly up and away from the house. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM CARL There. That ought to do it. Here, I\\'ll give you some change for bus fare. Russell follows Carl toward the front door. RUSSELL Nah, I\\'ll just use my city bus pass. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, FLOATING The house lowers into the fog. RUSSELL (O.S.) Whoah, that\\'s gonna be like a billion transfers to get back to my house. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, PORCH Carl and Russell stand on the porch as the house moves down into and through the thick, dark clouds. RUSSELL Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer? CARL Well, we\\'re up pretty high. Could take hours to get down. Something flashes by them in the fog. Carl leans forward. 33. CARL (MUMBLING) ...that thing was...building or something. Another dark object whooshes past them. Carl ducks. RUSSELL What was that, Mr. Fredricksen? CARL We can\\'t be close to the ground yet. A brief view of rocks directly below them. Carl GASPS. EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE BAM!!! The house CRASHES into the ground. Russell and Carl fly off the porch and onto the ground. They land hard. Carl\\'s house is floating away! Carl runs after the GARDEN HOSE dragging across the ground. CARL Wait, wait! No don\\'t, don\\'t, don\\'t! Carl grabs the hose and is PULLED UP in the air. CARL Whoah! Hey, hey! Russell JUMPS onto Carl\\'s leg and the extra weight pulls them to the ground. CARL Russell, hang on! Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE. RUSSELL Whoah! They slide toward the edge... and stop. The drop is thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED. CARL Walk back! Walk back! 34. RUSSELL Okay! Russell PULLS Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge. Carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around. Fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only scattered rocks. CARL (out of breath) Where... where are we? RUSSELL This doesn\\'t look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen. The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it. CARL (to house) Don\\'t worry, Ellie. I got it. The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped, flat-topped mountain on which they stand. Across it, some ten miles away, is PARADISE FALLS. Carl stares. He can\\'t believe it. CARL There it is. Ellie, it\\'s so beautiful. The landscape is stunning. Carl shows Russell the engraving with the Ellie drawing of the house atop the falls. CARL We made it. We made it! Russell, we could float right over there. Climb up. Climb up! RUSSELL You mean assist you? CARL Yeah, yeah. Whatever. RUSSELL Okay, I\\'ll climb up! Russell CLIMBS Carl, stepping on his leg, arms, and face. 35. CARL Watch it. RUSSELL Sorry. The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame. CARL Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up! Got it?! Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen. CARL You on the porch yet?! Russell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb. He slides down onto Carl\\'s head, exhausted. CARL What? That\\'s it?! I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? Aw, great! Carl paces. RUSSELL Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge? CARL What are you talking about? RUSSELL We could walk your house to the falls! CARL Walk it? RUSSELL Yeah, after all, we weigh it down. We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon. Carl considers this. 36. EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE, DAY - LATER The house floats against the sky. The hose descends from the house and \"Y\"s to tie to both Carl and Russell. They wear the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk. CARL Now, we\\'re gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing. Russell inspects his surroundings. RUSSELL (DISTRACTED) Uh-huh. CARL We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we\\'re not at the falls when that happens... RUSSELL Sand! CARL ...we\\'re not getting to the falls! RUSSELL I found sand! Carl ROLLS HIS EYES. He looks up at the house. CARL Don\\'t you worry, Ellie. We\\'ll get our house over there. Russell looks up at the house. Who\\'s Carl talking to? RUSSELL Huh. (shrugs it off) This is fun already, isn\\'t it? By the time we get there, you\\'re gonna feel so assisted... Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!! The WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL sets off Carl\\'s hearing aid. 37. RUSSELL Wait. Why are we going to Paradise Falls again? CARL Hey, let\\'s play a game. It\\'s called: \"See who can be quiet the longest.\" RUSSELL Cool! My mom loves that game! They head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape. Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks. Two dark shapes are chasing the prey. Each has a light. Hunters. EXT. MOUNTAIN, GROVE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire. The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end. EXT. MOUNTAIN, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS. They surround the prey. Escape looks impossible. WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the three dogs and escaping in a flash. The dogs head off in pursuit. A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears wincing in pain. They whimper and run off. 38. EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - DAY - CONTINUOUS Carl steps out from behind a shrub. The SQUEALING is in fact his HEARING AID. CARL Darn thing. (calling back) C\\'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up? Russell plods forward, dragging his feet. RUSSELL I\\'m tiiiired. And my knee hurts. CARL Which knee? RUSSELL My elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom. CARL I asked you about that five minutes ago! RUSSELL Well, I didn\\'t have to go then! Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt. RUSSELL I don\\'t want to walk anymore. Can we stop? CARL Russell! If you don\\'t hurry up, the tigers will eat you. RUSSELL There\\'s no tigers in South America. Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge. RUSSELL Zoology. CARL Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into the bushes and do your business. RUSSELL Okay! Here, hold my stuff. 39. Somehow energized, Russell jams his pack into Carl\\'s hands, secures his rope to a tree and tromps off into the shrubs. He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand and a pile of leaves in another. RUSSELL I\\'ve always wanted to try this! Carl waits, standing by the tree his house is tied to. RUSSELL (O.S.) Mr. Fredricksen? Am I supposed to dig the hole before or after? CARL Eugh! None of my concern! Beat. RUSSELL (O.S.) Oh. It\\'s before! Carl covers his ears. EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS Russell pats down a mound and SIGHS in satisfaction. He is about to return to Carl when he spots some TRACKS. RUSSELL Huh? Tracks?! (REALIZING) Snipe! Russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle, clapping. RUSSELL Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe. Snipe! The footprints continue for a time, then stop. RUSSELL Huh. Russell munches on a chocolate bar. Something RUSTLES in the bushes behind him. He turns to look. Behind him, A BEAK takes a nibble of the chocolate and zips out. 40. Russell turns. Nothing there. Another nibble! Zip! RUSSELL Ha! Gotcha! Russell peers into the shrub. RUSSELL Don\\'t be afraid, little snipe. I am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a friend to all of nature. Want some more? Russell holds out the chocolate. The beak pokes out and nibbles. RUSSELL Hi boy. Don\\'t eat it all. Come on out. The beak zips back into the bushes. RUSSELL Come on. Don\\'t be afraid little snipe. Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice... A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell. RUSSELL ...giant snipe! EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING Carl checks the knot on his hose harness. Russell and the massive creature step up behind him. RUSSELL I found the snipe! CARL (humoring him) Oh, did you? RUSSELL Are they tall? CARL Oh yes, they\\'re very tall. 41. RUSSELL Do they have a lot of colors? CARL They do indeed. RUSSELL Do they like chocolate? CARL Oh ye- Chocolate? Carl turns to look. Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall, multicolored BIRD. Carl SCREAMS. CARL What is that thing?! RUSSELL It\\'s a snipe! CARL There\\'s no such thing as a snipe! RUSSELL But you said snipes eat-- Carl grabs Russell, pulling him away from the bird. The bird HISSES at Carl and grabs Russell back. It cradles Russell like a baby. RUSSELL Whoah! Russell GIGGLES. Carl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off. CARL Go on, get out of here. Go on! Shoo! The bird HISSES. It takes Russell up into a tree, swinging him around playfully. It looks scary and fun. RUSSELL (LAUGHING) Whoah! Whoah! 42. CARL Careful, Russell! RUSSELL (LAUGHING) Hey, look Mr. Fredricksen, it likes me! CARL Russell! The bird grooms Russell. RUSSELL (LAUGHING) No stop, that tickles! Carl pokes the bird with his cane. CARL Get out of here. Go on, git! The bird sets Russell down. It stalks Carl, HISSING and ruffling its feathers. CARL Aaaah! RUSSELL Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it\\'s okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice! Russell pats Carl on the head. CARL \"Kevin\"? RUSSELL Yeah, that\\'s his name I just gave him. The bird pats Carl on the head with its beak. CARL Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram! Carl waves his cane. The bird eats it. CARL Hey! That\\'s mine! The bird chokes and the cane comes back up. 43. CARL Aaah! Shoo, shoo! Get out of here. Carl shoos the bird away. The bird mimics him. CARL Go on, beat it. GRUMBLING, Carl gives up and throws his hands in the air. The bird mimics this as well. RUSSELL Can we keep him? Please?? I\\'ll get the food for him, I\\'ll walk him, I\\'ll change his newspapers... CARL No. RUSSELL (RECITING) \"An Explorer is a friend to all, be it plants or fish or tiny mole.\" CARL That doesn\\'t even rhyme. RUSSELL Yeah it does. Russell points up to the roof of Carl\\'s house. RUSSELL Hey, look! Kevin! CARL What? Get down! You\\'re not allowed up there! The bird is on Carl\\'s roof. It swallows a balloon. It POPS. The bird coughs up the deflated balloon. Russell GIGGLES. CARL You come down here right now! The bird jumps down and hides behind Russell. CARL Sheesh! Can you believe this, Ellie? RUSSELL Ellie? (gets idea) (MORE) 44. RUSSELL (cont\\'d) Uh, hey Ellie, could I keep the bird? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (to Carl) She said for you to let me. CARL (to Ellie) But I told him no -- (catches himself) I told you no! N-O. The bird HISSES at Carl. EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE - DAY Carl and Russell pull the house through the mist. Russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail. The bird follows, eating. CARL I see you back there! It \"hides\" behind a rock, still totally visible. CARL Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while. VOICE (O.S.) Hey, are you okay over there? The bird dashes away. CARL Uh, hello? Carl and Russell look around. In the midst, some 100 feet away, they see the FIGURE OF A MAN. CARL Oh! Hello sir! Thank goodness. Carl walks toward the man. CARL It\\'s nice to know someone else is up here! VOICE I can smell you. 45. Carl stops. CARL What? You can smell us? VOICE I can smell you. As they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a ROCK. CARL Hey. Russell GIGGLES. RUSSELL You were talking to a rock. Russell points to another rock shape. RUSSELL Hey, that one looks like a turtle! Sure enough. RUSSELL Look at that one! That one looks like a dog! The \"rock\" walks forward. RUSSELL It is a dog! CARL What? RUSSELL Uh, we\\'re not allowed to have dogs in my apartment. The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it. RUSSELL Hey, I like dogs! CARL (calls out) We have your dog! (to self) Wonder who he belongs to? RUSSELL Sit boy. 46. The dog sits. RUSSELL Hey look, he\\'s trained! Shake! The dog raises his paw and Russell shakes it. RUSSELL Uh-huh. Speak. DUG Hi there. Carl and Russell freeze. CARL Did that dog just say \"Hi there?\" DUG Oh yes. Carl JUMPS back. DUG My name is Dug. I have just met you and I love you. Dug jumps up on to Carl. CARL Uh..wha? Dug wears a high-tech collar. The dog\\'s thoughts come out of it as words through a speaker. It can talk. Unfortunately, it talks non-stop. DUG My master made me this collar. He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk -- SQUIRREL!! Dug stares transfixed at a tree. False alarm. DUG My master is good and smart. CARL It\\'s not possible. DUG Oh it is, because my master is smart. 47. RUSSELL Cool! What do these do, boy? He inspects the collar and twists a dial. DUG Hey would you- (CLICK) -cuerdo con tigo- (CLICK) I use that collar- (CLICK) -watashi wa hanashi ma- (CLICK) -to talk with, I would be happy if you stopped. CARL Russell, don\\'t touch that. It could be radioactive or something. Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell. DUG I am a great tracker. My pack sent me on a special mission all by myself. Have you seen a bird? I want to find one and I have been on the scent. I am a great tracker, did I mention that? BAM! The bird tackles Dug and HISSES. DUG Hey, that is the bird! I have never seen one up close but this is the bird. (to Carl) May I take your bird back to camp as my prisoner? CARL Yes! Take it! And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog! DUG Oh I can bark! Dug BARKS. DUG And here\\'s howling! Dug HOWLS. The bird HISSES at Dug. 48. RUSSELL Can we keep him? Please please please? CARL No. Russell falls to his knees, pleading. RUSSELL But it\\'s a talking dog! CARL It\\'s just a weird trick or something. Let\\'s get to the falls. Carl grabs Russell. The bird follows, as does Dug. DUG Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh please be my prisoner. EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Footprints. A dog\\'s nose follows the tracks. This is GAMMA, a bulldog. GAMMA Oh, here it is. I picked up the bird\\'s scent! A second dog: BETA, a Rottweiler. BETA Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is this? Chocolate. I smell chocolate. GAMMA I\\'m getting prunes and denture cream! Who are they? BETA Ah man, Master will not be pleased. We\\'d better tell him someone took the bird, right Alpha? ALPHA, a Doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them. ALPHA (high-pitched voice) No. Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again. 49. Alpha\\'s voice is high and squeaky, as if he\\'s breathed in helium. ALPHA (CONT\\'D) Find the scent, my compadres and you two shall have much rewardings from Master for the toil factor you wage. Beta and Gamma look at each other. BETA Hey Alpha, I think there\\'s something wrong with your collar. You must have bumped it. GAMMA Yeah, your voice sounds funny! Beta and Gamma LAUGH. Alpha turns. They stop laughing. ALPHA Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire to -- SQUIRREL! All three dogs look for the squirrel. False alarm. ALPHA (CONT\\'D) Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning? BETA No no. But maybe Dug would. You might want to ask him. Beta and Gamma SNICKER derisively. GAMMA Yeah, I wonder if he\\'s found the bird on his very special mission. ALPHA Do not mention Dug to me at this time. His fool\\'s errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied indeed. Ha ha ha. Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now? BETA Sure, but the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat. 50. ALPHA You are wise, my trusted Lieutenant. Alpha powers up a video screen on Beta\\'s collar. ALPHA (CONT\\'D) This is Alpha calling Dug. Come in, Dug. The screen shows ground moving past: the view from Dug\\'s collar. DUG Hi Alpha. Hey, your voice sounds funny. ALPHA I know, I know! Have you seen the bird? DUG Why yes, the bird is my prisoner now. GAMMA Yeah, right. The screen view adjusts to see the bird. It hisses. ALPHA Impossible! Where are you?! DUG I am here with the bird and I will bring it back and then you will like me. Oh, gotta go. On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a boy\\'s face. It\\'s Russell. RUSSELL (on video screen) Hey Dug! Who you talking to? The video screen goes blank. The dogs BARK excitedly. BETA What\\'s Dug doing? GAMMA Why\\'s he with that small mailman? 51. BETA Where are they? Alpha pushes a button on Beta\\'s collar. A TRACKING DEVICE locates Dug. ALPHA There he is. Come on! The dogs sprint off into the jungle. EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE - DAY The bird drags Dug, still clamped onto it\\'s leg. DUG Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my prisoner! RUSSELL Dug, stop bothering Kevin! DUG That man there says I can take the bird and I love that man there like he is my master. The bird HISSES. CARL I am not your master! The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg. Dug jumps up on it. DUG I am warning you, once again, bird! RUSSELL Hey! Quit it! DUG I am jumping on you now, bird. Russell tries to separate them, which pulls on Carl\\'s tether. CARL Russell! At this rate we\\'ll never get to the falls! Carl pulls on the tether, knocking Russell over. Carl falls, pulling the house into a tall rock. SMASH! Carl GASPS. He turns his anger to the group. 52. CARL I am nobody\\'s master, got it? (points to bird) I don\\'t want you here, (points to Dug) ...and I don\\'t want you here. (points to Russell) I\\'m stuck with you. And if you two don\\'t clear out of here by the time I count to three- Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl\\'s cane. DUG A ball! Oh boy oh boy! A ball! CARL Ball? Carl pops off one of the tennis balls. CARL You want it boy? Huh? Huh? Yeah? DUG Oh oh oh! Yes, I do. I do ever so want the ball! CARL Go get it!! Carl throws the ball far away. Dug chases after it. DUG Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and then bring it back! CARL (WHISPERS) Quick Russell, give me some chocolate. RUSSELL Why? CARL Just give it to me! Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird. CARL Bird. Bird! Carl THROWS the chocolate. The bird runs after it. 53. Carl grabs Russell and runs. CARL C\\'mon Russell! RUSSELL Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen. EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE Carl pulls them down a slope. He slips. EXT. MOUNTAIN TREETOPS Above the tree line, the house SMASHES into a tree. CARL Daah! EXT. MOUNTAIN STREAM Carl and Russell crossing the river balance on rocks. Carl slips and his foot goes into the water. CARL Aaahh... EXT. MOUNTAIN JUNGLE RUSSELL What are we doing? Carl pushes through thick jungle leaves. BUGS buzz around him. EXT. MOUNTAIN STEEP HILLSIDE Carl climbs up the hill. He FALLS over a dead branch. RUSSELL Hey, uh, we\\'re pretty far now. Kevin\\'s gonna miss me. EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS They climb over a ridge. Dug and the bird are nowhere in sight. Carl sits down on a rock, BREATHING HARD. 54. CARL I think that did the trick. He turns. Dug. With the ball in his mouth. DUG Hi, Master. CARL Afternoon. Carl turns the other way. The bird. It HONKS at him. Dug drops the slobbery ball on Carl\\'s lap. EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - NIGHT A clap of thunder. Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring down on the house. Beneath it, Carl and Russell are kept dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire. Carl looks at Dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird\\'s leg. He rolls his eyes and looks up at the house. CARL Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, Ellie. RUSSELL (O.S.) Which one\\'s the front? Russell struggles to set up the tent. He reads his manual. RUSSELL Is this step three, or step five? Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell\\'s ineptness. RUSSELL There! Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into place. Carl can\\'t watch. An off screen SMACK! Russell walks to Carl. Miraculously, he looks unscathed. RUSSELL All done. Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face. 55. RUSSELL (pointing to tent) That\\'s for you! The tent pole springs loose, catapulting the tent over the cliff. RUSSELL Awh. Tents are hard. CARL Wait, aren\\'t you \"Super Wilderness Guy?\" With the GPM\\'s and the badges? RUSSELL Yeah, but... can I tell you a secret? CARL No. RUSSELL Alright, here goes. I never actually built a tent before. There. I said it. CARL You\\'ve been camping before, haven\\'t you? RUSSELL Well, never outside. CARL Well, why didn\\'t you ask your Dad how to build a tent? RUSSELL I don\\'t think he wants to talk about this stuff. CARL Why don\\'t you try him sometime? Maybe he\\'ll surprise you. RUSSELL Well, he\\'s away a lot. I don\\'t see him much. CARL He\\'s got to be home sometime. 56. RUSSELL Well, I called, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much. CARL Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name? RUSSELL Phyllis isn\\'t my mom. Carl realizes he put his foot in it. CARL Oh. The two sit silently together, watching the fire. RUSSELL But he promised he\\'d come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge, so he can show me about tents then, right? Carl studies Russell\\'s sad optimism. He looks at the missing badge on Russell\\'s sash. CARL Hey, uh, why don\\'t you get some sleep. Don\\'t want to wake up the traveling flea circus. Dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird\\'s leg. RUSSELL Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him! Russell YAWNS and lies down on the rock next to Carl. RUSSELL Can Kevin go with us? CARL Alright. He can come. RUSSELL Promise you won\\'t leave him? CARL Yeah. 57. RUSSELL Cross your heart? Carl looks down at Russell. CARL Cross my heart. Carl sits at the campfire, the others asleep. He shakes his head and looks up at the house. CARL What have I got myself into, Ellie? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - MORNING A frog sits next to Carl\\'s glasses. It CROAKS. Carl\\'s hand smacks it like an alarm clock. The frog hops away. Carl rises, looking up at the house. CARL Morning Sweetheart. The balloons on the house are wilting. CARL We better get moving. He scans the camp. The bird is gone. CARL Huh. Bird\\'s gone. Maybe Russell won\\'t notice. (calls out) Alright, everybody up! Russell sits up with a SNORT. RUSSELL Where\\'s Kevin? He\\'s wandered off! Kevin! Dug, find Kevin! Dug crazily searches and sniffs, looking for the bird. DUG Find the bird. Find the bird... POINT! Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and \"points\" to the left. 58. RUSSELL Oh, look! There he is. Russell points to the right. The bird is on top of Carl\\'s house. Dug turns around. DUG POINT! The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl\\'s roof. CARL Hey, that\\'s my food! Get off my roof! DUG Yeah, get off of his <>! In the distance, BABY BIRDS call out. The bird CALLS back. CARL What is it doing? DUG The bird is calling to her babies. RUSSELL Her babies! Kevin\\'s a girl? The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof. DUG Her house is over there in those twisty rocks. Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the LABYRINTH. The baby birds call from somewhere inside. DUG She has been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them. The bird \"hugs\" Russell goodbye and pats Carl on the head with her beak. She HISSES at Dug. RUSSELL Wait, Kevin\\'s just leaving? But you promised to protect her! RUSSELL Her babies need her, we gotta make sure they\\'re together. 59. The bird hurries off toward the labyrinth. Carl gathers up the hose tether. CARL Sorry Russell. We\\'ve lost enough time already. RUSSELL Yeah... EXT. MOUNTAIN, EDGE OF JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER The bird rounds a corner and hears rustling in the bushes ahead. She scampers back toward the house. EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA Russell chews on some chocolate. RUSSELL This was her favorite chocolate. Because you sent her away, there\\'s more for you. Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS. They hear rustling from the bushes behind them. CARL Huh? RUSSELL Kevin? Beta and Gamma, run toward Carl and Russell, viciously barking and growling. Carl protects Russell with his cane. Dug is conflicted. Alpha walks forward and stares menacingly at Carl. He turns toward Dug. ALPHA (high-pitched voice) Where\\'s the bird? You said you had the bird. DUG Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have said that, I can see how you would think that. 60. ALPHA Where is it? DUG Uh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and then I will again have the bird. Yes. Alpha BARKS angrily. ALPHA You lost it. Why do I not have a surprised feeling? Well, at least you now have lead us to the small mailman and The One Who Smells of Prunes. Carl and Russell look at Dug. He turned on them! Dug shamefully lowers his head. ALPHA Master will be most pleased we have found them, and will ask of them many questions. (commanding, to Carl) Come! CARL Wait, we\\'re not going with you. We\\'re going to the falls! Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl. CARL Get away from me! Get down! The dogs lead Carl and Russell like prisoners. Dug follows. The house is pulled after them, and on the roof: THE BIRD. EXT. MOUNTAIN, DESOLATE ROCKY AREA - DAY Alpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon. Dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls. Four more large dogs join the group. Carl and Russell watch warily and continue their march. They round a bend. Before them is a MASSIVE CAVE OPENING. 61. EXT. MOUNTAIN, CAVE ENTRANCE The house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group approaches the huge cave opening. DOZENS OF DOGS step out of the cave. Carl and Russell stop. More dogs approach from the side. Every way Carl turns there are more dogs! Growling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell. Closer... closer... From the darkness a voice: VOICE (O.S.) Stay! The dogs stop. A figure peers out from the darkness. It examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house. VOICE You came here in that? CARL Uh... yeah. VOICE In a house? A floating house? The man laughs. Carl and Russell laugh along nervously. VOICE That is the darndest thing I\\'ve ever seen! You\\'re not after my bird, are you? But if you need to borrow a cup of sugar, I\\'d be happy to oblige! The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man\\'s joke. VOICE Well, this is all a misunderstanding. My dogs made a mistake. The figure walks out toward Carl into the light. Carl recognizes him! CARL Wait, are you Charles Muntz?! MUNTZ Well... Yes. 62. CARL The Charles Muntz? Muntz gives him the \"thumbs up.\" MUNTZ \"Adventure is out there!\" Carl GIGGLES with glee. CARL It\\'s really him! (to Russell) That\\'s Charles Muntz! RUSSELL (EXCITED) It is?!? (CONSIDERS) Who\\'s Charles Muntz? CARL Him! DOG WALLA Yes! It is him! He is! CARL I\\'m Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans! Carl rushes to shake Muntz\\'s hand. Muntz is charmed. MUNTZ Well, you\\'re a man of good taste! Muntz LAUGHS at his joke. Carl joins in. MUNTZ You must be tired. Hungry? RUSSELL Uh-huh. MUNTZ (to dogs) Attention everyone! These people are no longer intruders. They are our guests. The dogs CHEER. 63. DOG WALLA Follow me! I like you temporarily. You do smell like prunes. I will not bite you. Muntz walks into the cave. Carl and Russell excitedly follow. INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS CARL Wow. Carl\\'s eyes adjust to the dark. Muntz\\'s dirigible the \"Spirit of Adventure\" is tethered in the cave. MUNTZ (O.S.) I\\'m sorry about the dogs -- hope they weren\\'t too rough on you. GAMMA (O.S.) We weren\\'t! MUNTZ Go ahead and moor your airship right next to mine. Muntz gestures to a pylon, where Carl ties off the house. Muntz and the dogs walk up the gangplank of the dirigible. CARL We\\'re not actually going inside the \"Spirit of Adventure\" itself?! MUNTZ Oh. Would you like to? CARL Would I?!?! Carl GIGGLES like a little boy. CARL Wait up, Mr. Muntz! Carl and Russell follow up the ramp. CARL Jiminy Cricket. Dug follows, but is blocked by Alpha and Beta. BETA Not you. 64. GAMMA What do we do with Dug? ALPHA He has lost the bird. Put him in the Cone of Shame. Dug WHIMPERS. EXT. DIRIGIBLE GANGPLANK - MOMENTS LATER Alpha, Gamma and Beta walk into the dirigible. Dug sits forlornly with a PLASTIC CONE around his neck. DUG I do not like the Cone of Shame. INT. DIRIGIBLE - TROPHY ROOM Carl and Russell are speechless as they walk into the room. It\\'s a treasure trove of giant skeletons, stuffed creatures, and rare cultural artifacts. Various servant dogs dust and polish as Muntz leads Carl and Russell through the room. MUNTZ Most of the collection is housed in the world\\'s top museums: New York, Munich, London... `Course I kept the best for myself. CARL Did you ever! Will you look at that? MUNTZ Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast charged while I was brushing my teeth. Used my shaving kit to bring him down. A dog approaches carrying a menu. Muntz waves it off. MUNTZ Oh, surprise me. (to Carl) Only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as \"dental equipment!\" Muntz LAUGHS. Behind him, a dog can\\'t resist gnawing at one of the bones. 65. CARL Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian Leopard Tortoise! MUNTZ Oh, you recognize it? I\\'m impressed! That\\'s an interesting story there... A dog approaches with a bottle of champagne in his mouth. Muntz glances at the bottle. MUNTZ Hm, excellent choice. (to Carl) I found it on safari with Roosevelt. Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle. POP! They sloppily pour two glasses. MUNTZ He and I fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings. And did he cheat? Oh, he was horrible! Muntz and Carl LAUGH. Alpha interrupts. ALPHA (high-pitched voice) Master, dinner is ready. MUNTZ Oh dear, broken translator. It\\'s that loose wire again. (leans down, fixes it) There you go big fella. ALPHA (deep scary voice) Thank you Master. Russell reacts. RUSSELL I liked his other voice. Muntz LAUGHS. MUNTZ Well, dinner is served! Right this way. 66. INT. DIRIGIBLE, DINING ROOM Muntz leads Carl and Russell into the dining room and up to a large table. MUNTZ So how are things stateside? Almost tempted to go back a few times, but I have unfinished work here... Please. Dogs pull back chairs for them. They sit. Dog waiters place napkins on their laps. MUNTZ I hope you\\'re hungry because Epsilon is the finest chef I\\'ve ever had. Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look delicious. MUNTZ Oh, Epsilon, you\\'ve done it again! RUSSELL Yes!! Russell is served a hot dog. His waiter can\\'t resist and eats a bite. RUSSELL Hey! Another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his glass. RUSSELL Hey! Carl looks around, still enthralled. CARL Oh my Ellie would have loved all this. You know, it\\'s because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls. He gestures toward HIS HOUSE, tethered outside the porthole window. 67. MUNTZ I\\'m honored. And now you\\'ve made it! CARL You\\'re sure we\\'re not a bother? I\\'d hate to impose. MUNTZ No no! It\\'s a pleasure to have guests -- a real treat. The dogs erupt into excited barking. DOG WALLA Treat?! Treat! I want a treat! MUNTZ No no, quiet! Calm down. Calm down... In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell\\'s hot dog. RUSSELL Hey! MUNTZ (CONT\\'D) Shouldn\\'t\\'ve used that word... Having guests is a delight. More often I get thieves, come to steal what\\'s rightfully mine. CARL No! Muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room. MUNTZ They called me a fraud, those... dah! But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared. The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples, feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin. This is Muntz\\'s obsession. He looks over to a full size skeleton. MUNTZ Beautiful, isn\\'t it? I\\'ve spent a lifetime tracking it. Sometimes years go by between sightings... (MORE) 68. MUNTZ (cont\\'d) I\\'ve tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives... Can\\'t go in after it. Once in, there\\'s no way out. Lost so many dogs... Muntz is lost in reverie. MUNTZ And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take! But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place. Distracted Russell finally notices the skeleton. RUSSELL Hey, that looks like Kevin! MUNTZ \"Kevin?\" RUSSELL Yeah! That\\'s my new giant bird pet. I trained it to follow us. Muntz and Alpha exchange glances. MUNTZ Follow you? Impossible. How? RUSSELL She likes chocolate. Russell holds up a chocolate bar to show Muntz. MUNTZ Chocolate? RUSSELL Yeah, I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it. Carl swipes the chocolate from Russell and pockets it. CARL But it ran off! It\\'s gone now. Muntz stares. He walks to a table full of flight helmets. 69. MUNTZ You know, Carl. These people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories. A \"Surveyor\" making a map. Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table. It rolls across the floor. MUNTZ A \"Botanist\" cataloguing plants. Muntz topples another helmet. He lifts a third to show Carl. MUNTZ An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls. He drops the helmet. It rolls to Carl\\'s feet. MUNTZ That\\'s the best one yet. I can\\'t wait to hear how it ends. Carl glances around nervously. Out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits THE BIRD! CARL Well! It\\'s been a wonderful evening, but we\\'d better be going. Carl gets up and pulls Russell from the table. MUNTZ Oh, you\\'re not leaving? CARL We don\\'t want to take advantage of your hospitality. Come on Russell. Carl leads Russell toward the door. RUSSELL But we haven\\'t even had dessert yet. Muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly. 70. MUNTZ No, the boy\\'s right. You haven\\'t had dessert. Epsilon here makes a delicious Cherries Jubilee. Carl pulls Russell along, Muntz following behind like something out of a bad dream. MUNTZ Oh, you really must stay. I insist! We have so much more to talk about! A distant HAUNTED WAIL. Everyone stops. RUSSELL Kevin? Muntz walks to the window and looks out. Atop the roof he sees THE BIRD. MUNTZ It\\'s here. He turns back to Carl... but they\\'re gone. MUNTZ (to dogs) Get them! INT. CAVE Carl and Russell untie Carl\\'s house from the pylon. CARL Hurry! RUSSELL I am hurrying! Dogs descend down the ramp behind them. RUSSELL They\\'re coming! Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening. Dogs block the cave opening. Carl stops short. DUG (O.S.) Master, over here! 71. Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave. Carl and Russell run toward him. The cave leads to a steep incline. The dogs are getting closer. There\\'s no choice but to JUMP. The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell to leap down the incline, like astronauts. DUG Go toward the light, master! Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell. The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts Carl and Russell on her back. She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her. Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life. BANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the ceiling. The house lowers. Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto the ground. CARL Russell! Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly. EXT. MOUNTAIN, CANYON - CONTINUOUS The dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels. Carl fends off Alpha with his cane. CARL Get back!! Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down! The dogs stop short. Carl looks back as the bird keeps running. Dug is up on the canyon wall. He caused the avalanche! DUG Go on Master! I will stop the dogs! Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs. 72. DUG Stop you dogs!! The dogs run around Dug. Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path. The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind. She rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss. The bird jumps from rock spire to spire. Russell swings back and forth wildly in the air. RUSSELL Help! Help! Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL. CARL Gimme your hand! Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl PULLS him back onto the bird. Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE. A river winds 100 feet below. Carl looks above to see the house\\'s momentum pulling forward. RUSSELL Hang on to Kevin! Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar. Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house\\'s momentum carries them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but is kicked loose and falls into the river below. Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm. The dogs are stuck on the other side. Carl painfully gets up. He looks up at his house. It\\'s still intact. He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF. RUSSELL (O.S.) Kevin! The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back to the ground. Russell rushes to her side. 73. The bird\\'s leg has been injured badly by the dog bite. She can\\'t stand. Russell applies a bandage. From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call. Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can\\'t. Russell runs to her side. RUSSELL No no no! Kevin! Stay down. (to Carl) She\\'s hurt real bad. Can\\'t we help her get home? Carl looks at the bird\\'s wounds. He looks to the rock maze, then to his house. He knows the right thing to do. And he hates himself for it. CARL Alright. But we\\'ve got to hurry. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT Dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing Muntz. MUNTZ You lost them? BETA Uh, it was Dug. GAMMA Yeah, he\\'s with them. He helped them escape! Muntz snarls in anger. MUNTZ Wait. Wait a minute. Dug... He leans over a RADAR TRACKING DEVICE. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS DUG\\'S COLLAR SCREEN powers on, and a signal zeroes in on Dug\\'s location. 74. Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing. Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree. CARL See anything? DUG No, my pack is not following us! Boy they are dumb. Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house from behind a tree canopy. CARL This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood hero and he\\'s trying to kill us! What a joke. DUG Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel walks up to a tree and says I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny because the squirrel gets dead. They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees. CARL Careful Russell. The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the porch. RUSSELL You okay, Kevin? Kevin goes back to sleep. Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG. RUSSELL You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? The wilderness isn\\'t quite what I expected. CARL Yeah? How so? RUSSELL It\\'s kinda... wild. I mean, it\\'s not how they made it sound in my book. CARL Hmm, get used to that, kid. 75. RUSSELL My dad made it sound so easy. He\\'s really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. He used to come to all my Sweatlodge meetings. Russell smiles at the thought. RUSSELL And afterwards we\\'d go get ice cream at Fentons. I always get chocolate and he gets butter- brickle. Then we\\'d sit on this one curb, right outside, and I\\'ll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins. I like that curb. He looks up at Carl. RUSSELL That might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most. They walk in silence. Carl understands. The bird babies CALL OUT in the distance. Kevin CALLS BACK. RUSSELL Look, there it is! Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by. He tries to run but is pulled back by his tether. LAUGHING, Carl unclips Russell\\'s tether. CARL Hold on Russell, stand still! Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house. Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward the labyrinth entrance. Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies. She runs off ahead. Carl and Russell LAUGH. CARL Look at that bird go! CARL Wait up, you overgrown chicken! 76. RUSSELL That\\'s it, go Kevin! Go find your babies! Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce spotlight hits them. MUNTZ\\'S DIRIGIBLE lowers overhead. RUSSELL Run Kevin! Run! A net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT. RUSSELL Oh no! The net catches on a rock. Carl and Russell run to her aid. CARL Russell, give me your knife! Carl saws frantically at the net. MUNTZ (O.S.) Get away from my bird! Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible. Beside them, a group of dogs drag forward CARL\\'S HOUSE. Muntz hurls a lit lantern. Flames burst up beneath the house. Heat waves ripple up. Balloons POP. Carl\\'s house LOWERS into the fire. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Inside the living room, Ellie\\'s photo crashes to the floor. EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - CONTINUOUS CARL No! Carl panics. He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife. Muntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking him down and grabbing the bird in the net. RUSSELL No! Carl pulls his house away from the flames. 77. The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the dirigible. Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible. MUNTZ Careful. We want her in good shape for my return. RUSSELL Let her go! Stop! Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes. The dirigible flies off. RUSSELL Kevin! Carl beats out the flames with his jacket. He extinguishes the flames. Carl collapses on the side of his house. RUSSELL You gave away Kevin. You just gave her away. CARL This is none of my concern. I didn\\'t ask for any of this! DUG Master. It\\'s alright. CARL I am not your master! And if you hadn\\'t a shown up, none of this would have happened! Bad dog! Bad dog! Dug slinks off, tail between his legs. Carl angrily puts on the harness. CARL Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me. He walks off. Russell falls in behind. An angry dawn breaks. 78. EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky landscape. Russell\\'s harness drags along side, empty. Russell walks behind. EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE - MORNING With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place. The house groans as it comes to rest. Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff. EXT. PARADISE FALLS - MORNING He looks over. He\\'s finally made it: Paradise Falls. Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge. Carl takes out Ellie\\'s childhood drawing. Next to him stands the real house, just like Ellie wanted. RUSSELL (O.S.) Here. Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground. RUSSELL I don\\'t want this anymore. Russell walks away. He sits on a rock, alone. Carl picks up the sash. He walks up the steps of his house. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS The door opens. Carl steps in. He\\'s back in his house for the first time in days. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Carl and Ellie\\'s things are strewn across the floor, a mess from the rough journey. Carl rights Ellie\\'s chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the table into position. He pushes their two chairs back into their place. 79. Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits. Quiet. Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside. Carl surveys the room. The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him. He opens it and puts Ellie\\'s drawing back. He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie. He turns to the page marked: STUFF I\\'M GOING TO DO. Carl sighs. He managed to bring the house to the falls, but Ellie never made it. He closes the book. But as he does, Carl sees something he hadn\\'t before. The blank pages at the end are no longer blank. A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them. On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another... photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs. Carl\\'s face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw adventure in everyday life. A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in their chairs. Beneath it, Ellie has written: \"THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE! LOVE, ELLIE.\" Carl smiles. He looks over to Ellie\\'s empty chair. On the arm is Russell\\'s sash. Carl picks it up. He looks to Ellie\\'s chair. He crosses his heart. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Carl walks from the house and calls from the porch. CARL Russell? 80. But Russell is nowhere to be seen. A shadow crosses Carl. He looks up to see Russell floating off, hanging from a BUNCH OF BALLOONS. CARL Russell! RUSSELL I\\'m gonna help Kevin even if you won\\'t! Russell fires up a LEAF BLOWER and steers himself off into the sky. CARL No, Russell! No! Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift it. He struggles, but the house doesn\\'t budge. The balloons have lost too much helium. Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch. It lands atop the mountain rocks with a thud. This gives him an idea. CUT TO: The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground. Chairs, dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house. Slowly, one corner of the house lifts. Then another. Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch. It teeters... and falls. The house lifts off! CARL Wahhoo! The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of things. Beside it sits Carl and Ellie\\'s chairs, side by side atop Paradise Falls. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, FLOATING The house soars into the air, sails billowing. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Inside the house, Carl adjusts his steering, scans the skies. 81. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Carl\\'s eyes go wide. CARL Russell? INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS The door swings open. CARL Dug! DUG I was hiding under your porch because I love you. Can I stay? CARL Can you stay? Well, you\\'re my dog aren\\'t you? And I\\'m your master! DUG You are my master?! Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses. DUG Oh boy. Oh boy! EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, FLOATING - CONTINUOUS The house flies off into the sky. CARL (O.S.) Good boy, Dug. You\\'re a good boy! EXT. OPEN SKY - DAY Russell steers through the clouds toward the DIRIGIBLE. INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS Dogs play poker. Behind them, Russell flies past with the leaf blower. They turn to look. EXT. DIRIGIBLE Russell steers wobbly toward an open dirigible window. He smashes into the wall. 82. RUSSELL Ooph! He tries again and TUMBLES through the window. INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS Russell releases the balloons and picks up the leaf blower, ready for action. RUSSELL Yes! Don\\'t worry Kevin! I\\'ll save - Growling dogs move toward him. Russell blows the leaf blower at the dogs. INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM Muntz stares into the bird\\'s cage, mesmerized. She\\'s miserable and scared. MUNTZ And they wouldn\\'t believe me. Just wait till they get a look at you. Alpha enters. ALPHA Master! The small mailman has returned. MUNTZ What? INT. DIRIGIBLE Dogs tie Russell to a chair. RUSSELL Let me go! Muntz enters. MUNTZ Where\\'s your elderly friend? Russell blows the leaf blower in Muntz\\'s face. RUSSELL He\\'s not my friend anymore. 83. Muntz grabs the leaf blower and drags Russell out. MUNTZ Well, if you\\'re here, Fredricksen can\\'t be far behind. INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM Muntz drags Russell through the trophy room. RUSSELL Where are you keeping Kevin!? INT. DIRIGIBLE, RAMP ROOM - CONTINUOUS Muntz sets Russell down and walks to a control panel. RUSSELL Let me go! BETA Scream all you want, small mailman. GAMMA None of your mailman friends can hear you. RUSSELL I\\'ll unleash all my Wilderness Explorer training! Muntz is about to throw a switch when he looks out the porthole. Flying toward him is CARL\\'S HOUSE! MUNTZ Alpha! Fredricksen\\'s coming back. Guard that bird. If you see the old man, you know what to do. Muntz pulls the switch and walks out of the room. RUSSELL Hey, where are you going? I\\'m not finished with you! MUNTZ Nice talking with you. Muntz slams the door. Light emerges from the floor. Russell is on the ramp, which is opening. Russell REACTS. 84. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT Muntz enters the cockpit and takes the wheel. MUNTZ Where are you, Fredricksen? EXT. DIRIGIBLE The dirigible turns, revealing Carl\\'s house sneaking up behind. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl steers toward the cockpit. He dons Russell\\'s sash, then hooks his cane onto his back. He\\'s fighting for a cause. He hears SCREAMING. It\\'s Russell! Tied to his chair, he slides down the ramp as it lowers, closer and closer to the edge. CARL Russell! Carl steers his house to the dirigible. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, RAMP - CONTINUOUS Carl flings the hose, HOOKING it to the ramp railing. Using his cane as a zip line, Carl slides to Russell, catching him just as Russell slides off the ramp edge. They land safely together. RUSSELL Mr. Fredricksen! CARL Dug! Bring `er over! Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to the dirigible ramp. Carl carries Russell into the house. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Carl sets Russell, still bound, down in the front hall. 85. RUSSELL You came back for Kevin! Let\\'s go get her. CARL I\\'m getting Kevin. You stay here! RUSSELL But I want to help! CARL I don\\'t want your help. I want you safe! Carl leaps back into the dirigible. Dug follows. Russell STRUGGLES against his bonds. INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY Carl and Dug sneak down a hall. They see dogs ahead and hide. CARL How do we get past these dogs? DUG Uh... POINT! Dug points to a grate in the wall. INT. DIRIGIBLE, GAS CELL AREA Dug leads Carl \"backstage\" through a vent shaft into the dirigible. They sneak past two biplanes. INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM They emerge through a grate near the ceiling. They look down into the room where the bird is kept in a cage. CARL Kevin! The bird recognizes Carl and CRIES OUT. CARL Don\\'t worry Kevin, we\\'re on our way! Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above. 86. ALPHA Allow no one to be entering through these doors. Guard well that bird, my minions. CARL (WHISPERS) What do we do now, Dug? Dug is lost in ecstacy, chomping on a tennis ball on the end of Carl\\'s cane. INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Carl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage. He bangs his cane. All the dogs turn. He grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air. CARL Who wants the ball? DOGS Me! I do! I want the ball! CARL Then go get it! Carl throws the ball. The dogs scramble after it. INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit. DOGS I\\'m gonna get there first! Oh gonna get the ball! I\\'m gonna get it! Gamma catches it.. GAMMA I got it!! Behind them Carl shuts the door. The dogs realize their mistake. GAMMA Uh-oh. 87. INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM Carl opens the cage door. CARL I\\'m sorry Kevin. Let\\'s get you out of here. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT Muntz scans the horizon. Suddenly the in-ship communicator comes to life. DOG WALLA (on radio) Master! He\\'s gone! The old man! He\\'s here! He\\'s got the bird! The bird\\'s gone! MUNTZ What? Calm down! One at a time! EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, FRONT PORCH Russell STRUGGLES to break free of the chair. RUSSELL I want to help! He manages to get his arms free. RUSSELL Ha ha! Except that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on the porch and fall off. Russell SCREAMS as he falls. The hose unspools. Russell reaches the end of the hose. Russell grabs onto it and the chair jostles free, falling thousands of feet down. The house drifts away from the dirigible. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT The melee of conflicting reports from the dogs continues. DOG WALLA He\\'s in Hall D! He\\'s in Hall B! It\\'s the old man! 88. MUNTZ Does anyone know where they are?!?! On cue, Russell SPLATS into the dashboard window of the control room and SQUEEGEES across, dangling from the hose. Muntz stares, slack-jawed. RUSSELL Whoooaaah! The house floats off. MUNTZ (into radio) Grey leader! Take down the house! EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE Russell clings to the end of the hose, swaying in the wind. What\\'s that noise? From beneath the dirigible emerges... EXT. OPEN SKY - CONTINUOUS From beneath the dirigible, three spitfire airplanes emerge. As they get closer, it is clear they are being flown by DOGS. BETA (into radio) Grey leader, checking in. GAMMA Grey 2, checking in. OMEGA Grey 3, checking in. The planes fall into formation and fly toward the house. BETA Target sighted. The Dog Squadron Leader bites down on a squeaky bone chew toy that fires poison darts. The biplanes fire and strafe Carl\\'s house with darts. Russell SCREAMS, swaying beneath it on the hose. INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM Carl, Dug and the bird escape through the trophy room. 89. CARL Come on, Kevin. Behind the door, Muntz is waiting for them. He grabs a sword from the wall display and attacks. Dug hears and BITES Muntz on the leg. Muntz kicks Dug loose and out the door. He slams it shut. INT. DIRIGIBLE, OUTSIDE OF TROPHY ROOM - CONTINUOUS Locked out, Dug jumps on the door and barks. He hears growling and turns around. There stands Alpha and the other dogs. DUG Hi. INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY Dug runs. The dogs give chase. INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM Muntz swings his sword at Carl but misses. Carl uses his cane to defend himself. OLD MAN SWORD FIGHT! Muntz smashes his trophy collection as he swings for Carl. His sword gets stuck in a mounted skeleton. Carl swings his cane and hits Muntz on the head. The tennis balls bounce the cane off Muntz and smack Carl in the face. Muntz pulls the sword free. He raises the sword over his head to strike and his back CRACKS loudly. He\\'s stuck! Carl raises his cane over his head and his back CRACKS too. Carl and Muntz STRUGGLE to move. Muntz CRACKS his back free and kicks Carl in the chest, knocking him against a trophy. He has the upper hand now. He throttles him with his arm and lifts his sword. MUNTZ Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on, spit it out! Carl spits his FALSE TEETH at Muntz. He falls backwards. 90. Carl collects his teeth and motions for Kevin. CARL Come on! Muntz advances on Carl, who struggles to protect the bird. Muntz is a wild man now, smashing and destroying anything that gets in his way. MUNTZ Enough! I\\'m taking that bird back with me alive or dead! Carl trips and falls to the floor. Muntz is about to deal the final blow. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT Meanwhile Alpha backs Dug into the control panel. He bumps a a LEVER. EXT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS The entire dirigible rocks wildly to the side. INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM Muntz is knocked off balance. He slides to one side. Trophy cases slide after him. The dirigible tilts to the other side. The broken trophy cases barrel straight toward Carl! Carl is thrown into a window which bursts open. Carl falls through but manages to grab the frame with his cane. He dangles out over open air. He sees the biplanes circling the house, Russell hanging beneath it. The ship corrects again. Carl climbs back inside. Muntz comes at Carl. CARL Come on, Kevin! 91. EXT. SIDE OF DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS Carl climbs the work ladder up the side of the dirigible. He pushes the bird along as he goes. Muntz follows up. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT Alpha throws Dug viciously across the room. Alpha throws him again and Dug crashes into the steering wheel, knocking a radar shade off the control panel. Alpha moves in. Dug hides behind the steering wheel. ALPHA I will have many enjoyments for what I am about to do, Dug. Alpha lunges at Dug through the steering wheel. Dug cowers, but then notices the RADAR SHADE. As Alpha lunges again, Dug jams the shade over Alpha\\'s head. Alpha\\'s head is stuck, trapped by the cone. The dogs all GASP. MISC DOG He wears the Cone of Shame! ALPHA (high-pitched voice) What? Do not just continue sitting! Attack! The bump caused his collar to go funny again. The dogs all howl with laughter. ALPHA (high pitched voice) No! No! Stop your laughing! Get this off of me! DUG Listen you dog! Sit! Surprised at Dug\\'s moxy, Alpha sits. All other dogs sit too. DOG WALLA Yes, Alpha. 92. DUG Alpha? I am not Alpha, he is- (REALIZING) Oohhhh! EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE Russell TRIES TO CLIMB the hose. His hands are about to give out. The biplanes head straight at Russell. RUSSELL (out of breath) I can\\'t do it! Behind him, Carl is climbing the side of the dirigible for dear life, Muntz closing in. CARL (far in the distance) Russell! RUSSELL Huh? Carl calls for help: the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL. RUSSELL You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone! Russell CLIMBS! He\\'s more machine than boy now. Biplanes shooting the whole way, he climbs up onto the porch. The biplanes close in. Russell yells to them. RUSSELL Hey! (pointing down) Squirrel! All the dog pilots snap to attention. GAMMA Squirrel? OMEGA Where\\'s the squirrel?! 93. The planes dive, crash into each other. The dog pilots parachute out. GAMMA I hate squirrels. EXT. SIDE OF DIRIGIBLE Carl climbs. Muntz grabs Carl\\'s foot. Carl defends himself with his cane, knocking Muntz off the ladder. Muntz catches on to a rung of the ladder. He watches Carl and the bird climb. Muntz descends the ladder. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP - DAY Carl and the bird make it to the top of the dirigible. Suddenly, a trap door opens. Carl GASPS... but it\\'s Dug! CARL Dug! Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face. DUG Master! The house bears down on them. They run to meet it. CARL Russell!! Over here!! Let\\'s go! Russell steers the house toward Carl. RUSSELL Mr. Fredricksen! The house slows and lowers atop the airship. Carl HOISTS the bird up onto the porch. CARL Come on, Kevin! Carl helps Dug onto the porch. He climbs up himself... BLAM! Muntz appears on top of the dirigible with a rifle! A bullet blasts through Carl\\'s balloon strings. A third of them break or shoot skyward. The house plummets, crashing onto the dirigible. 94. Carl is THROWN from the house onto the airship. The house slides toward the edge, Russell, Dug and Kevin still inside. CARL No! Carl SCRAMBLES to grab the hose trailing from the sliding house. The house slides on to the dirigible\\'s tail fin. Holding the hose, Carl digs in his heels and is just able to stop it. The house teeters on the very edge of the tail fin. CARL Russell! Get out of there! Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch. BLAM! A bullet smashes the door jam next to them. Muntz storms toward the house. Carl holds desperately to the hose. CARL No! Leave them alone! Russell and others duck inside and slam the door. The house tilts, threatening to tip off at any second. Carl holds on for his life. Muntz POUNDS on the door with the butt of the rifle. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, HALLWAY Russell, Dug and Kevin back away from the door. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP The house slides farther over the edge. Carl struggles to hold on. The hose caddy is ripping free from the house! The bolts pop from the wooden siding... it\\'s about to go! INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE Russell, Dug and Kevin run into the living room. 95. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP Muntz KICKS the door. Suddenly, Carl has an idea. CARL Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don\\'t let go of her! INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Confused, Russell follows Carl\\'s directions. He Dug and the bird huddle together. Muntz breaks through the door. He lifts his rifle and sights the bird... Through the window, Carl yells out. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP CARL Kevin! Chocolate! Carl holds aloft a bar of chocolate. INT. CARL\\'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Kevin lunges, pushing past Muntz and knocking the rifle from his hands. Muntz lunges after them. EXT. CARL\\'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The hose caddy breaks free. Kevin leaps through the window, Russell and Dug hanging from her side. Muntz leaps after them. But balloon strings tangle around his leg and pull him back. Muntz hangs for a moment... It\\'s thousands of feet from the ground.... He falls. 96. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP PANTING, Carl is left holding the hose. He PULLS himself toward the edge. The hose curves beneath the tail fin. Finally it swings out... RUSSELL That was cool! Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin. The bird holds on to the hose with her beak. Carl LAUGHS, relieved. CARL Don\\'t jerk around so much, kid! Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug. DUG Oh I am ready to not be up high. Carl LAUGHS heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face. Carl looks into the distance. His house, now empty, floats softly down into the clouds, and disappears. RUSSELL Sorry about your house, Mr. Fredricksen. Carl smiles. He puts his arm around Russell. CARL You know, it\\'s just a house. Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship floating off over the clouds. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - AFTERNOON Carl and Russell hold and cuddle the baby birds. The babies peck at Carl\\'s head. Carl and Russell LAUGH. CARL Ow! Ow! Ow! RUSSELL Look at you. You\\'re so soft. 97. Kevin CALLS OUT, waiting for the babies at the gate to the LABYRINTH. Time to go. CARL/RUSSELL (DISAPPOINTED) Awwww! RUSSELL I wish I could keep one. The babies run to the bird. One stops to HISS at Dug. Carl has misplaced something. CARL Huh, where\\'s my cane? I just had it here... Kevin starts HACKING. She COUGHS up the cane. Babies start HACKING too. They COUGH up tennis balls. CARL You know what? Keep `em. A little gift from me to you. The bird family enters the labyrinth. Carl and Russell wave. RUSSELL Bye Kevin! The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one last time before disappearing into the mist. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT - LATER Carl and Russell both wear matching leather flight helmets and goggles. RUSSELL Ready? Carl gives a thumbs up. CARL Ready! 98. EXT.

(hands badge to dad) For Wild Animal Defensive Arts... Congratulations, Brandon. (hands badge) For Assisting the Elderly... Russell is tanned and dirty. And alone. CAMP MASTER STRAUCH Uh, Russell? Is there... someone that... uh... The Camp Master CLEARS HIS THROAT uncomfortably. Russell looks for his dad in the audience. CARL (O.S.) Excuse me. Pardon me. Old man coming through. Carl takes his place next to Russell. CARL (to Camp Master) I\\'m here for him. CAMP MASTER STRAUCH Congratulations, Russell. Sir... The Camp Master hands Carl the badge and continues down the line. 99. CARL Russell, for assisting the elderly, and for performing above and beyond the call of duty, I would like to award you the highest honor I can bestow: The Ellie Badge. Carl pins the badge onto the missing spot on Russell\\'s sash. It\\'s Ellie\\'s GRAPE SODA PIN. RUSSELL Wow. Carl smiles. They salute each other. Russell gives Carl a hug. Carl returns it. Russell\\'s mom sits in the audience with Dug. Russell proudly shows her the badge. CAMP MASTER STRAUCH Alright, I think that covers everybody... So let\\'s give a big Explorer Call to our brand new Senior Wilderness Explorers! Ready everybody? The Camp Master leads the audience in the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL. Muntz\\'s dogs sit in the back, BARKING in approval. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CURB OUTSIDE FENTONS ICE CREAM PARLOR - DAY Carl and Russell sit on a curb licking ice cream cones.

CARL It\\'s red, isn\\'t it? RUSSELL Mr. Fredricksen, you\\'re cheating. CARL No, I\\'m not. Red one. RUSSELL That\\'s a fire hydrant. They LAUGH. CARL Maybe I need new glasses.
