Shut the fuck up. \\nBreacher up! \\nI got a military-age male... \\n...that\\'s on a cell phone, \\nwatching the convoy. Over. \\nIf he\\'s reporting troop movement... ...you have a green light. Your call. Over. \\nMaybe he\\'s just calling his old lady. Heh. He stepped off. \\nHold on, I got a woman and a kid 200 yards out, moving towards the convoy. \\nHer arms aren\\'t swinging. \\nShe\\'s carrying something. \\nShe\\'s got a grenade. She got a RKG Russian grenade she just handed to the kid. A woman and a kid? \\nYou got eyes on this? Can you confirm? Negative. You know the R.O.E. \\nYour call. \\nThey fry you if you\\'re wrong. \\nThey send your ass to Leavenworth. - You got him. \\n- Heh. \\nNow get back here. \\nYou don\\'t ever leave your ri?e in the dirt. Yes, sir. \\nIt was a hell of a shot, son. \\nYou got a gift. \\nYou\\'re gonna make a fine hunter someday. Here in the Book of Acts... \\n...several times, \\nPaul stands in judgment... \\n...for what he believes. \\nAt times, we all have to do that. I mean, we don\\'t see with his eyes... ...so we don\\'t know the glory of his plan. Our lives unfold before us like \\npuzzling reflections in a mirror. - What are you doing? \\nPage 2/54\\n- Shh. Shh. \\nBut on the day we rise, \\nwe will see with clarity... \\n...and understand the mystery of his ways. Let us pray. \\nWAYNE\\'. \\nThere are three types of people in this world. Sheep, wolves and Sheepdogs. \\nNow, some people prefer to believe \\nthat evil doesn\\'t exist in the world. And if it ever darkened their doorstep, they wouldn\\'t know how to protect themselves. Those are the sheep. \\nAnd then you got predators. \\nThey use violence to prey on the weak. They\\'re the wolves. \\nCome on, Jeff, punch him. \\nAnd then there are those who\\'ve been blessed with the gift of aggression... ...and the overpowering need \\nto protect the flock. \\nThese men are a rare breed... \\n...that live to confront the wolf. \\nThey are the sheepdog. \\nNow, we\\'re not raising any sheep \\nin this family. \\n- I will whup your ass if you turn into a wolf. - Wayne. \\nBut we protect our own. \\nIf someone tries to fight you... \\n...or tries to bully your little brother, you have my permission to finish it. The guy was picking on Jeff. \\nIs that true? \\nYes, sir. Yes, he was. \\nDid you finish it? \\nThen you know who you are. \\nYou know your purpose. \\nANNOUNCER\". Chris Kyle draws the horse Big Business here this evening. \\nI\\'m doing all right. \\nThat\\'s good. \\nSo tonight he needs to beat \\nthe leading score of 86. \\nPage 3/54\\nThe louder you cheer, \\nthe longer he\\'ll ride! \\nCome on! Yeah! \\nI don\\'t think- He\\'ll walk it off. Jeff, looks like your brother did it again! All right, ladies and gentlemen, \\nChris Kyle! \\nMan, wasn\\'t nobody there, \\nand you come outwith a belt buckle. - What are you supposed to with it? - Supposed to get laid with it. \\nI\\'ll wear it, \\nsee if it puts Sarah in the mood. Shit, a strong wind\\'ll put Sarah \\nin the mood. \\n- Is that what they say? \\n- You know what they called her... - ...in high school \\n- Don\\'t say it. \\n- Sarah Sucks-a-Lotta- \\n- What I say?! \\nShit, Chris. \\nGoddamn it. \\nOh, buckle bunny, those are two girls. No, he kept looking- He had his eyes on her, and that\\'s why the last time... Wait till you see what this does. Let\\'s see him go! \\nBaby, who wants \\nto fuck a rodeo sta-? What the fuck?! You said you wasn\\'t coming home \\nuntil tomorrow. \\n- I said what? \\n- Leave him alone. He didn\\'t do anything! Easy! I didn\\'t know shit, man. \\nCome out here! \\nChris, leave him alone! Fucking Chris, leave him alone! Goddamn it! \\n- He didn\\'t know, all right?! \\n- Oh, he didn\\'t know. \\n- What didn\\'t you know? \\n- I didn\\'t know. Just give me my hat. He didn\\'t know. \\n- Get his hat, babe. \\nPage 4/54\\nWhose rifles did you think those were? Them men\\'s clothes were hers? \\nYou didn\\'t know, \\nyou fucking son of bitch? \\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you? You don\\'t have to fucking punch everyone! Put that fucking hat on \\nand get the fuck out. \\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you? - Get out. \\n- You know what... \\n...I don\\'t know \\nwhat you expect from me. \\nYou just drag me out here and then you run off with your brother every damn weekend. Why do you think I did this, huh? I do this to get attention, \\ndon\\'t you get that? \\nGet your stuff and get out. \\nFine. You know what? Fuck you. Fine. You think you\\'re a cowboy \\nbecause you rodeo. \\nYou\\'re not a cowboy. \\nYou\\'re just a lousy ranch hand. \\nAnd you\\'re a shitty fucking lay! Don\\'t say it. \\nWhen\\'s the wedding? \\nI understand what you\\'re saying... ...but, you know, \\nwe get to travel over the whole state. Different city every weekend. \\nBroncs and steers. \\nI don\\'t know, maybe she\\'s right, though. \"She\\'s right\"? \\nRight about what, Chris? \\nShe\\'s not right, man. \\nWe\\'re cowboys, we\\'re living the dream. This is a special report. \\nKOPPEL\\'. Those explosions \\nset to go off at the U.S. embassies... ...in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania \\nand Nairobi, Kenya... \\n...were clearly a part of someone\\'s war against the United States. \\nPage 5/54\\nMore than 80 dead... \\n...more than 1700 injured \\nin two bomb blasts today... \\nHey, Jeff. Jeff. \\n...which exploded just minutes \\nand 450 miles apart. \\nLook at this. \\nIt is still unclear who our enemy is. Although the embassies were obviously the targets... Look what they did to us. \\n...most of the dead and injured \\nare not Americans. \\nStill, eight Americans, including one child, are dead and five are still missing. - So you\\'re from Texas. \\n- Yes, sir. \\n- And you\\'re a patriot. \\n- Yes, sir. \\nAnd you\\'re pissed off. \\nI\\'m looking to be of service. \\n- Do you like to fight? \\n- Yes, sir. \\nYou like to fight. Okay, well, \\nI want you to meet the warrior elite. SEALS. \\nYup. Sea, Air and Land. \\nWell, I\\'m not much for the water, sir. No? Well, this ain\\'t for the faint-a-heart. Most men, they wash out, they quit. Well, I\\'m not most men, sir. I don\\'t quit. This is where the fun stops! \\nTake it, girls. \\nIt\\'s gonna get harder from here on out. That\\'s it. Take it. Take it. \\nOnly hurts the first time. \\nWhat we got here? You a quitter, boy? - Hooyah, no, Instructor Rolle. \\n- Bullshit! Your ass is fleet meat... ...if I ever did see it! \\nDon\\'t turn away from me, son. \\nYou look at me and you take this shit. Hooyah, yes! \\nYou old as fuck! You join the Navy because you had such a good goddamn time on Noah\\'s ark? \\nPage 6/54\\nHow old are you, boy? \\n- Hooyah, 30! \\n-30?! \\nYour fart dust could\\'ve fathered half these boys! \\nWe gonna weed through the quitters. Yeah, we gonna find us \\na goddamn warrior or two today. Dauber, you sure you from Connecticut? I ain\\'t never met no hick \\nfrom Hartford before. \\nHooyah, Instructor Friday. \\nCountry\\'s countrywide. \\nI came here to kill terrorists. Who the fuck told your ass to giggle? Hooyah, no one, Instructor Rolle! - Did I ask you to open up your mouth? Hooyah, no, Instructor Rolle. \\nLook at your fat, pasty, giggly ass. Damn, son. \\nYou a big Dr. Pepper, \\nCheeto-eating motherfucker! \\nYeah! That\\'s what I\\'m talking about. Biggles! That\\'s your name \\nfrom now on, sunshine. \\nAnd that\\'s your ticket home. \\n\"D\"! What are you still doing in my line trying to make this team? Everybody knows black guys don\\'t swim. It\\'s all right, sir. I\\'m not black! - No? \\n- No, I\\'m the new black. \\nWe run slow, we jump low, we swim good and we shop at Gap. \\nAnd I make the white folk proud when I hose down their ladies. I dick them down! \\nChicken! \\nThere it is. \\nThat is a quitter. \\nYou say goodbye, I say good riddance. He quits on you here, \\nhe gonna quit in the field of battle. When shit gets hairy, he won\\'t step up. \\nPage 7/54\\nYour ass gets shot, he won\\'t pull you out. Six. \\nI\\'m looking for warriors! \\n- Seven. \\n- Keep counting! \\n- Eight! \\n- I can\\'t hear you! \\nNine! \\nWant me to call your mama? \\nMaybe she can come and take your place! This is foreplay! \\nI\\'m about to turn on some Marvin Gaye and get in that ass! \\nThat\\'s what I\\'m talking about! \\nSquirrel, Squirrel, Squirrel, \\nwhere the fuck are your nuts? \\nOh, they\\'re gone for good, sir. \\nThey crawled back up inside. \\nBut they are warm! \\nBig talk from a little man! \\nNow, you. \\nHow about you, old man? Huh? \\nHow you feeling? \\nHooyah! Dangerous. Feeling dangerous. Hooyah! Kyle\\'s feeling dangerous! Move! \\nTake seats! \\nYeah! 56 degrees! So fresh, so clean! Here she comes! \\nMother Nature\\'s got something for you! Only a few more hours \\nand you\\'re Navy SEALs! \\nGrease gun, dive knife by my side TONY\". \\nThese are the tools that\\'ll make a man die These are the tools that\\'ll make a man die I\\'m the only one who\\'s hit one, so... Boom! \\nOh, yeah! Chris, your turn, man. - You got one more. \\nI got one more? All right. \\nAll right. One more. Here we go. Hey, we want a smaller target \\nwe\\'ll use your arm, man. \\nPage 8/54\\nHello. \\nHi. \\nHow you doing? \\nGood. Thank you. \\nCan I get you a drink? \\nWill a drink make you \\nsix inches taller and charming? Will it make you not married? \\nI\\'m not ma \\nYeah, I just watched you \\ntake your ring off, okay? \\nDon\\'t be a scumbag. Go home. \\nOh, my God. \\nIt may have been the leather pants. Oh, yeah? \\nWhat kind of pants does a girl \\nhave to wear to be left alone? \\nWell, maybe corduroy. \\nI mean, is that how it is with you guys? You\\'re suddenly single after three beers? Oh, no, after three beers \\nall I know is to get a fourth. \\nThat\\'s great. That\\'s great. \\nReal redneck. \\n- Oh, I\\'m not a redneck, I\\'m from Texas. - Mm. \\nWhat\\'s the difference? \\nWell, we ride horses... \\n...and they ride their cousins. \\nWhat do you do for work? \\nYou\\'re obviously military. \\nOh, uh, I polish dolphins. \\nThey\\'re in captivity. \\nWhat I do is just sort of scrape off the crustaceans \\nDo I look stupid to you? \\nNo, honestly, you look a little sad. Am I tall enough to buy you a drink? Not until you tell me what you do. Okay, how about this. Hey, Greg? Get two shots? \\nHow about we do a shot for a question. Every time you ask me a question that I answer, do a shot. \\nPage 9/54\\n- Same, vice versa. \\n- Game on. \\nYou can leave the bottle too. \\nOkay, shoot. \\nAll right. Ahem. \\nYou\\'re obviously military. \\nWhat branch? \\nI just finished BUD/S, \\nheading to sniper school. \\nAre you kidding me? You\\'re a SEAL? Yes, ma\\'am. \\nThat\\'s two questions. \\n- Shit. \\n- Ha, ha. \\nReally? \\nOh, I didn\\'t really mean \\nyou had to do that. Heh. \\nOkay. Shit. \\nI know all about you guys. \\nMy sister was engaged to a SEAL. - Oh, was she? \\n- Yeah. \\n- Mm. \\n- Mm-hm. \\nHold on, how you know all about us? What do you mean? \\nWhat I mean is, you\\'re a bunch \\nof arrogant, self-centered pricks... ...who think you can lie and cheat and do whatever the fuck you want. I\\'d never date a SEAL. \\nWait, why would you say I\\'m self-centered? I\\'d lay down my life for my country. Why? \\nIt\\'s the greatest country on Earth. I\\'d do everything I can to protect it. Look, I\\'m sorry what happened \\nto your sister, but that\\'s not me. It\\'s nice to meet you. \\nWhere you going? \\nJust gonna go home because \\nyou said you wouldn\\'t date a SEAL, so... I said I\\'d never marry one. \\nOh. Okay. Well, then, maybe, hello. Page 10/54\\nNice to meet you. \\n- What\\'s your name? \\n- Taya. \\nTaya. \\nChris. I\\'m Chris Kyle. \\nNice to meet you. \\nPleasure. \\nI mean, it\\'s pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all. Isn\\'t it, Chris? Well, our BUD/S office commander said that it\\'s three \\n0K8)\\'- \\nHe said there\\'s three things we gotta \\nworry about: \\nWell... \\n...it sounds like you\\'re under attack. You\\'re pretty. \\nYou\\'re so beautiful. \\nHeY- I got you. \\nI\\'m not going home with you, \\nso don\\'t even think about it. \\nFeel breath filling every cell in your body. This is our ritual. \\nWe master our breath, \\nwe master our mind. \\nPulling the trigger \\nwill become an unconscious effort. \\nYou will be aware of it, \\nbut not directing it. \\nAnd as you exhale, \\nfind your natural respiratory pause... ...and the space between heartbeats. Hey, this is Taya. [can\\'t get to the phone. - Leave a message. I\\'ll call you back. Hey, it\\'s me again. \\nThat guy whose shoes you puked on. \\nSo, yeah, I was thinking maybe \\nyou didn\\'t get that last message? \\nThe last message I left \\nor the one before that? \\n- So I figured that- \\n- You figured what? \\nHey. How are you? How you been? \\nPage 11/54\\nGood. \\nGood. Wow, what are you up to? \\nNot a lot. You? \\nNo, just excited to talk to you. \\nAim small, miss small. \\nIf you aim for a shirt button, \\nyou might miss by two inches. \\nIf you aim for a shirt, \\nyou might miss by two feet. \\nYou better close those groupings, Kyle. Yes, sir. \\nCome on. Whoo! \\nNot bad. \\n- What do we get for that? \\nTop shelf. \\nI like that one. The brown one. \\n- Here you go. \\n- Great. \\n- Thank you. \\n- Thank you, sir. Have a good day. Hello. \\nGood. That looks good on you. \\nSo did you always want to be a soldier? Oh. Uh, no, I wanted to be a cowboy, but... I don\\'t know. I did that. \\nI thought I was meant for something more. So you started rescuing girls from bars? - I think I rescued that bar from you. - Ha, ha. \\nYou like country music? \\nOnly when I\\'m depressed. \\nHow about kids. You want kids? \\nYeah, someday. \\nMy mom says I have a nose \\nfor picking the wrong men. \\nWell, that\\'s a shitty thing to say to a girl. Well, I\\'ve proven her right. \\nThem wrong picks put you here... \\n...made you who you are. \\nI like who you are. \\nYou ever think about what happens when there\\'s a real person on the end of that gun? I don\\'t know. I just hope \\nI can do my job when that day comes. Page 12/54\\nAre we looking at the same target? \\nYou\\'re spitting dust. \\nAnd don\\'t worry. We can always use \\ncorpsmen for the guys who can\\'t shoot. Oh, fuck. \\nYou\\'re trembling. \\nI know it. \\n- We don\\'t have to do this. \\n- No, I want to. I do. \\n- Yeah? \\n- You just feel real and it scares me. You got your off-eye shut? \\nWell, if I close my off-eye \\nthen I can\\'t see what\\'s out there. \\n- There\\'s nothing out there but the target. - Negative, sir. There is something out there. Punch it. \\nWill pushups help? \\nGive me 50, Kyle. Clear and safe. \\nI\\'m better when it\\'s breathing. \\nOh, my God. Chris. \\n- What\\'s wrong? \\n- No! \\nHere\\'s the tape. \\nYou see the first plane coming in \\nfrom what looks like the east side. And it goes into the building \\nwith the flames... \\n...and the smoke billowing out \\nthe other side of the tower. \\nIt\\'s hard for me to tell exactly which is the north side and which is the south side. It appears it\\'s coming out \\nof the north side. \\nAnd then, moments ago, \\nthese incredible images. \\nI believe that\\'s the first one. \\nThat\\'s the south tower collapsing. \\nIt almost looks like one of those implosions of buildings that you see... \\n...except there is nothing controlled about this. This is devastation. \\nYou hardly even know me. \\nI know enough. \\nPage 13/54\\nYou are a package deal, babe. \\nWhat are you so afraid of? \\nNothing. \\nEverything, I don\\'t know. \\nWhat if it doesn\\'t work out? \\nWe\\'re gonna get married \\nand then we\\'re gonna start a family. You got it all planned out, don\\'t you? I\\'m done. \\nI love you. \\nYou\\'re gonna need a ring if you \\nwanna talk all tough like that. \\n0K8)\\'- \\nLadies and gentlemen, \\nMr. and Mrs. Chris Kyle! \\n- What the hell is on your neck? \\n- Hm? \\nYour neck. You got, like, \\ngreen paint all over you. \\nWould you believe me, babe, \\nif I told you... \\n...that I had an IV and I was \\nall green about two hours ago? \\nWhat? \\nIt\\'s a package deal, babe. \\nOh, my God. \\nCome here, you. \\nCheers to that. \\nWhat\\'s the word, chief? \\nJust got the call, boys. \\nIt\\'s on! \\nHooyah! Ha-ha-ha. \\nShots! \\nYeah! Whoo! \\n- Only six weeks, baby. \\n- I\\'m so afraid, baby. \\nThat\\'s what they say. \\nYou got nothing to be afraid of. \\nIt\\'s all part of the plan. \\nYour heart is beating out of your chest. That\\'s just because I\\'m not \\nthe only one who\\'s going to war, that\\'s all. Welcome to Fallujah. \\nThe new Wild West of the old Middle East. Page 14/54\\nAQI put a price on your heads, and now extremists from around the globe... ...are flooding the borders to collect on it. You snipers, you\\'re gonna be paired with a Marine to watch your back... ...and inserted along the main road to do oven/vatch for 1st Marines going door to door. Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs. \\nThe city has been evacuated. \\nAny military-age male \\nwho is still here... \\n...is here to kill you. \\nLet\\'s bring these boys in safe \\nand get our asses back home. \\nOut of my truck! Out, out, out! \\nI\\'d keep that head down, Tex. \\nMuj got snipers, too, you know. \\nA sniper won\\'t aim for your head. \\nMan, they got this one sniper that\\'s been hitting headshots from 500 yards out. They call him Mustafa. \\nHe\\'s in the Olympics. \\nThey got sniping in the Olympics now? Hold on, I got a woman and a kid, \\n200 yards out, moving towards the convoy. Her arms aren\\'t swinging. \\nShe\\'s carrying something. \\nShe\\'s got a grenade. She got a RKG \\nRussian grenade she just handed to the kid. You say a woman and a kid? \\nYou got eyes on this? Can you confirm? Negative. You know the R.O.E. Your call. Man, they fry you if you\\'re wrong. \\nThey send your ass to Leavenworth. \\nFuck, that was gnarly. \\nFucking evil bitch. \\nNice shooting. Hell of a call. \\nRoger. Good looking out, Navy. \\n- Fuck, you hear that, man? \\n- Get the fuck off me. \\nWhere is everybody? \\n- We\\'re just picking our dicks. \\n- We\\'re training those fucking Haji soldiers. Page 15/54\\n- Hey, why aren\\'t you out there? \\nWell, I have the shits. \\nWhat... \\n...from reading a comic book? \\nIt\\'s a fucking graphic novel, man. It\\'s a big difference. \\nI heard you were on fucking fire out there. Marc Lee came in, \\nsaid you popped your cherry. \\nIs that right? \\nThere was a kid \\nwho barely had any hair on his balls. Mother gives him a grenade. \\nSends him out there to kill Marines. Dude, that was evil like I never seen before. Yeah, but, hey, man... \\n...you know that kid could\\'ve taken out, like, ten fucking Marines, right? \\n- Yeah, but I killed him. \\n- You did your job. \\nThat\\'s the end of the story. \\nYeah, it\\'s just not how I envisioned that first one to go down. \\nOh! \\nFuck, man. \\nWhat the hell? \\nThat was your overvvatch, Einstein. You can thank him later. \\nLet\\'s move! \\nKeep it going. \\nKeep it going. \\nHurry up. \\nContact! Front disperse! \\nCease fire! \\nWhoa. \\nEyes on the rooftop. \\nKeep your eyes up there. \\nBreacher up! \\nMan down! Man down! \\nWe need a corpsman over here now. \\nEnemy sniper located. \\nApproximate grid: \\nQuebec-Romeo-155604. \\nSmells like piss in here. \\nPage 16/54\\nYeah, well... \\nYou covered our asses out there, \\nman. Some ballsy shots. \\nUhn. Fuck. They were clean, right? Hell, yeah, they were. \\nFucking sniper went right up our ass. I already chewed out security detail. Won\\'t happen again. \\nIt better not happen again. \\nThere\\'s a hot spot 400 meters out. I\\'m gonna go write up \\nsome shooter statements. \\nHow many did you get? \\nI got six \\nWell, that\\'s not true. I got eight... ...but they dragged two off. \\nYou got six? \\n- Yeah, why? What\\'s wrong? \\n- Nothing. \\nYou got more \\nthan the rest of the snipers combined. Yeah, but they got one of us. \\nYou can\\'t shoot what you can\\'t see. His wife said he was carrying a Koran. Look, I don\\'t know what a Koran looks like... ...but I can tell you what he was carrying. It was pressed metal, shot 7.62s, \\nand it looked just like an AK-47. \\nSo you tell me what he was carrying. Oh, here he comes. \\nLadies and genitals, listen up! \\nWe have a legend in our midst. \\nRound of applause for the legend. \\nThere we go. We\\'re so proud of you back home on the range, boy. \\nNow, it\\'s been said that the legend here... ...can kill 100 men with one blow. \\nOr, no, it was- No, fuck, what was it? It was one blow from a single man. He blew 100 men. \\nAnd he\\'s single. \\nAnd so \\nGoddamn it! Shit! \\nOh, shit! \\nPage 17/54\\nDamn, man! \\nYou want a food fight? \\nCome on. Shit. \\nOnly way to shut you up. \\nHave you killed anyone yet? \\nThat is not the way the call home is supposed to go, babe. \\nDon\\'t be weird with me. \\nSeriously. \\nI want you to tell me everything. Well, there\\'s certain things \\nyou just can\\'t say over the phone. Okay, you knocked me up, right? And I\\'m sitting here by myself, literally assembling baby cribs... ...and you can\\'t talk to me? \\nThat\\'s your big plan? \\nYou guys almost done over there, yet? I can\\'t stop thinking about that little pink number you wore on our honeymoon. Yeah, it\\'s called a nightgown. \\nYeah. \\nAnd three days? \\nThree days is not a honeymoon. \\nYou know, it was a good three days. I miss you real bad. \\nI miss you too. \\nHey, you want me to talk dirty to you? Yeah. \\nHold on. Hold on a second. \\nBut I got a phone in one hand \\nand a gun in the other... \\n...so I don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna do. Well, you\\'re gonna have to decide what\\'s more important, baby. \\nYou\\'re horny preggers. \\nFat and horny. \\n- It\\'s fucking disgusting. \\n- Ha-ha-ha. \\nIf you were 300 pounds, I\\'d still do you. So romantic. \\nHow\\'s my boy? \\nNobody said it\\'s a boy. \\nI can\\'t wait to see \\nPage 18/54\\nthe way you\\'re gonna be with him. How do you know? \\nI just know. \\nI can sense it. \\nI hope you\\'re right. \\nBaby, I am right. \\nHey, did your dad get ahold of you? No, I haven\\'t checked my e-mails. Shit. \\nOkay, you need to hang up \\nand call him, all right? \\nWhy, what\\'s wrong? \\nFuck, I\\'m so selfish. \\nI wasn\\'t even thinking. \\nTaya, what\\'s wrong? \\nWhat happened? \\nYour little brother deployed. \\nWhat? What happened to jump school? No, he didn\\'t get in. \\nYou just hang up and call your dad, okay? What do you mean? Deployed? \\nWhere is he? \\nOver there. \\nHe\\'s headed to Iraq. \\nI\\'m sorry, honey. \\nThe man with the blade? \\nHe\\'s a Jordanian militant. \\nHe\\'s funded by bin Laden. \\nHe\\'s trained by bin Laden. \\nHe is loyal to bin Laden. \\nHis name... \\n...is Zarqawi. \\nNow this asshole... \\n...is right now the crown prince of al-Qaeda in Iraq. \\nHis mercenary army, AQI? \\nThey\\'re 5000 strong. \\nNow, these guys \\nare not your average shit-kickers. These guys are well-trained, \\nthey are well-paid... \\n...and right now, they are waging the largest urban assault since Vietnam. Zarqawi and his lieutenants, \\nPage 19/54\\nthese are our top priority. \\nNow, there is only one way \\nto root these guys out... \\n...and that is to go door to door, \\nhouse to house... \\n...until we find them or we find someone \\nwho will give us their whereabouts. \\nSo we are going to need to clear \\nten structures an hour... \\n...which, I know, is a lot. \\nIt\\'s aggressive. \\nWe\\'re gonna be loosening things up \\nwith air support. \\nThis is the highest priority target \\nwe have to date. \\nI want this asshole dead or captured. \\nDo you understand? \\nAre there any questions? \\nThese Marines keep rushing in \\nlike they\\'re doing... \\n- ...they\\'ll have their asses shot off. \\n- They\\'re Marines. \\nThey don\\'t get the training we do. Half \\nthese guys were civilians six months ago. \\nLet\\'s coach them. I\\'ll show them how guys do it. I\\'ll lead the unit on the street. \\nNo, we can\\'t do that. \\nWe need you on overwatch. \\nCome on. If I\\'m on the street, Marc \\nHouse to house is \\nthe deadliest job here, man. \\n- You got some sort of savior complex? \\n- I want to get the bad guys. \\nIf I can\\'t see them, I can\\'t shoot them. \\nAll these guys? They know your name, \\nand they feel invincible with you up there. \\n- They\\'re not. \\n- They are if they think they are. \\nJust keep banging on the long gun. \\nWe\\'ll let these clogs sniff out Zarqawi. \\nYou said AQI has a sniper \\nin the Olympics... \\n...but Iraq hasn\\'t qualified a shooter \\nin three games. \\nPage 20/54\\nWell, that\\'s because Mustafa\\'s not Iraqi. He\\'s from Syria. \\nBreacher up! \\nHey, once you all gain entry \\nI can\\'t see shit... \\n...so take it slow \\nand move through your target. \\nUnderstood. \\nFire in the hole! \\nMan down! \\nYou better back him down! \\nOh, fuck this. \\nI\\'m gonna go clear houses with Marines. - You coming? \\n- Fuck, no, I\\'m not coming. \\nNo, man, I like my life. \\nI\\'d actually like to make it home alive. It\\'s not my job \\nto go fucking knocking down doors. Those guys picked the wrong fucking job. I\\'m not doing that shit. \\nAll right. \\nWell, if I don\\'t see you down there... ...you make sure I don\\'t see you again. - Hey. You all mind if I roll with you? - Hey, man. Any SEAL is cool by me. Breacher up! \\nYou\\'re the one they\\'re calling the Legend. You got 24 confirmed kills. \\nWell, who\\'s counting? \\nThat\\'s fucking badass. \\nYeah, I heard some motherfucker \\nin Bravo\\'s catching up, yo. \\nI know y\\'all are meat-eaters, \\nbut I know a couple things. \\nSimple shit I could show you. Maybe keep us above ground. What do you say? Yeah. All right. \\nRight on. \\n- Hey, what\\'s that mean, bro? \\n- Breacher up. \\nCome on! Go! \\nMoving. \\nGet down! Get down \\nPage 21/54\\non the ground right now! \\nGet your fucking ass down! \\n- No, no! \\n- He no understand! \\nGet down! \\nWhy are you here?! \\nYou\\'re supposed to be evacuated. Why are you still here? \\nI am Sheikh al-Obeidi! \\n- Sheikh alla-who?! Who the fuck are you?! - This my home! I stay! \\nI don\\'t give a fuck it\\'s your home! This is a war zone, sir! \\n- Sir, please! \\nGet that kid down! \\nCome on! Let\\'s go! Move it! \\n- Found these bitches in the back closet. - You are welcome here. You are my guest! - How many more do you have here?! - But tell the soldiers to come in. This Haji just wants us \\nall in here so he can blow us up. - If he see American, he know we speak. Who? \\n- Please. \\n- Who says talking of us\\'? \\n- Please come in. \\n- Who knows we\\'re talking?! \\nWho?! \\nHe come. He \\nHe very bad. Please. \\n- Target secure? \\nTarget\\'s secure. \\nBring them in. Get your head down on the ground. Hands behind your back. - Now! Move now! \\n- Please, please. \\nYou gonna talk, we\\'ll talk to you. Bring him in the other room. \\nIf he talks to U.S. soldiers, \\nthey will come and make examples of them. He? Who\\'s he? Who\\'s he? \\nThe man who comes they call \\n\"The Butcher.\" He\\'s the despaired one. Page 22/54\\nSon of Shaytan, son of Devil. \\nOh, he\\'s like an enforcer? \\n- Yes, enforcer. \\n- Number one soldier Zarqawi. \\nZarqawi? Yeah, we\\'d like to know \\nwhere Zarqawi is. \\nDo you know where he is? \\nYou tell us where he is right now. How can we get him? \\nYou have information for us \\nabout Zarqawi, tell us right now. Find The Butcher, you find Zarqawi. He reports to him. \\nOkay, well, how do we find him? \\nAll right, look at me when I\\'m talking to you. Where do we find him? \\nWe must understand the risk to them, but he will ask for money. \\nHe need $100,000. \\nYou need $100,000? \\nI have no proof this guy exists. \\nFatima! \\nHello. \\n- This is the proof. \\n- Look, I wanna help you out. I do. But I need something. I need \\nphone numbers, address, names. \\nYou have to give me something. \\nSir! First platoon\\'s pinned down. Move out! \\nSheikh, look at me when I\\'m talking to you. Hey! Look at me! \\nI need something. \\nI can help you out, sheikh. \\nYou give me a name, \\nand we will take care of it. \\nI can promise you that. \\nWe will give you safety. Tell me right now! - Emile Anafanoos? \\n- Amir Khalaf Fanus. \\nThis is given name of The Butcher. We believe that The Butcher\\'s \\nZarqawi\\'s number two man. \\nThis is your guy right here. \\nPage 23/54\\nBut you don\\'t know his real name. Otherwise, you\\'d have written it up there. We got several aliases. \\nNow, if \"Fanus\" is legit... \\n...we\\'ll go see the sheikh. \\nHe\\'s asking for 100,000. \\nFigures. \\nBut if he delivers The Butcher, \\nhe\\'s gonna get it. \\nThis is Agent Snead, DIA. \\nI need a name check \\non an \"Amir Khalaf Fanus.\" \\nYeah, I\\'ll wait. \\nIf we\\'re gonna go back out there, Team 3 can pull security. \\nWon\\'t happen. Head-shed will want contractors if we\\'re humping money. Yeah, I\\'m here. What do you got? \\nAll right. Okay. \\nLet\\'s go see the sheikh. \\nRoad kill. \\nYou know The Butcher \\nis Zarqawi\\'s enforcer? \\nThey say his weapon of choice \\nis a fucking drill. \\nWent to seminary school \\nbefore I joined the Navy. \\nWas close to being a preacher. \\nAnd why didn\\'t you? \\nI love to gamble, man. \\nI love those dice. \\nThat\\'s my kind of preacher. \\nIt\\'s like that now, huh? \\nHaven\\'t you heard? I\\'m the Legend. Hey, babe. \\nYou were right. The doctor says it\\'s a boy. What? \\nIt\\'s a boy! \\n\"\\'8 a boy?! \\n- Hell, yeah, man. Congratulations! - Ha-ha-ha. \\nChris?! \\nDown! Grab the money! Get to the truck! Let\\'s go! Let\\'s go! Grab the bag! \\nPage 24/54\\nGrab the bag! \\nChris. \\nGo!

You completely failed \\nto secure the battlefield. \\nI\\'m shutting this whole thing down pending an inquiry. Get back to base! Hey, we gotta set up a squad \\nand pursue him. \\nNope, they\\'re shutting us down. What do you mean? \\nCan\\'t leave the wire till \\nthey figure this shit out. \\nWell, he can\\'t just leave us like that. Hey! \\nI go home in three weeks! \\nPage 25/54\\nMan, that\\'s gonna be a long three weeks. Hey. \\nHey, baby. \\nI thought you were dead. \\nYeah, I know. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. I thought you were dead. \\nI\\'m not. I\\'m right here. \\n- You all right? \\n- Yeah. \\nYou\\'re the most beautiful thing \\nI\\'ve ever seen. \\nI have an alien growing inside me. And there\\'s a strange man in my bedroom. It\\'s our bedroom. \\nYour hands feel different. \\nOh, no. They\\'re my hands. \\n- Why am I so fucking nervous? \\n- Well, I am too. \\n- No, you\\'re not. \\n- Yes, I am. \\n- You\\'re lying. \\n- I swear. \\nHow do I know some alien in there is not gonna come out and grab me... ...in the middle of the night? \\nI\\'m gonna have to... \\n...choke him out. \\nIt\\'s gonna be okay. \\n- Promise? \\n- Yeah, of course. \\nWhy\\'re you so good with me? \\nHey, babe. \\nIt might be nice to get out. \\nYou listening to me\\'? \\n- Chris. \\n- Huh? \\nWhat do you wanna do today, hon? I thought we could just relax here. Okay, we do that. \\nLet\\'s relax. \\nWhat are you doing? \\nPutting my foot on you. \\nWell, you know that\\'s the way to my heart. I\\'m coming over. \\nPage 26/54\\nAnd that looks great. \\nOh, look. \\nLook. He\\'s touching his nose. \\n- How are you feeling? \\n- I\\'m all right.

Uh, I think if you wanna check anything out, you may wanna check out these knees. Are you a smoker? \\n- No, ma\\'am. \\n- You drink? \\n- Only when I\\'m thirsty. \\nIt\\'s 170/110. \\nJesus Christ, Chris. \\nIs that high? \\nNot if you\\'ve just had 14 cups of coffee. But for someone who is sitting down, yes. Oh, I appreciate you taking a look at that. I\\'ll look into it. Thank you. \\nWill you look into it? \\nYeah. \\nYou sabotaged me back there. \\nWhat am I supposed to do? You\\'re not talking. You act like it\\'s all okay. - It is okay.

Those are American soldiers. \\nThat day that we were on the phone, was that him? \\nWas it? \\nChris, just talk about it. You\\'re not protecting me by not talking about it. No, I don\\'t want you \\ngetting that in your head. \\n- My imagination is so much worse. - Oh, no, it\\'s not. They\\'re savages. \\nPage 28/54\\n- Chris. \\n- Babe, they\\'re fucking savages.

Doctor said he could be 6\\'4\". \\nPage 48/54\\n- Isn\\'t that insane? \\n- Mm. \\nCan\\'t wait for you to see him play. I go crazy when the other kids jump on him. I need you there as, like, \\na leveler, you know what I mean? \\nHey, maybe you could even coach, \\nyou know? \\n\\'Kenna\\'s gonna lose that tooth. \\nI\\'m so worried she\\'s gonna swallow it, like, in her sleep or something. \\nAnd she said she\\'d let you pull it, but only you. Would you do that? \\nChris! \\nYou know, I got a very interesting phone call. It\\'s from your wife. \\nShe told me about the barbecue. \\nYeah, that was unfortunate. Yeah. Things seem like they got \\na little out of hand. Are you worried? No, sir. \\nSo you\\'re not worried about what \\nhappened, or what might happen? \\nNo, sir, I\\'m not worried about that. Let me ask you a question, Chris. How much time did you spend in-country? Uh, well, four tours, so... \\nThat\\'s like, what, 1000 days? \\nYeah, sounds about right. \\nWould you be surprised if I told you that the Navy has credited you... - ...with over 160 kills? \\n- Mm. \\nDo you ever think... \\n...that you might have seen things or done things over there that you wish you hadn\\'t? Oh, that\\'s not me. No. \\nWhat\\'s not you? \\nI was just protecting my guys. \\nThey were trying to kill our soldiers... ...and I\\'m willing to meet my Creator and answer for every shot that I took. The thing... \\n...that haunts me are all the guys Page 49/54\\nthat I couldn\\'t save. \\nYou know, I\\'m willing and able \\nto be there but I\\'m not. I\\'m here. I quit. So you wish you could\\'ve \\nsaved more guys? \\nYes, sir. \\nYou know, you can walk down any hall in this hospital. \\nWe got plenty of soldiers need saving. Mm-hm. \\nWanna take a walk? \\nSure. \\nAll right. \\nI wanna show you something. \\nI still smoke, but can\\'t be too mad at it because it kind of saved my right hand. How so? \\nWhen I got blown up, I had both of my hands on the bottom of the steering wheel. And right before the explosion went off, I took my hand off... \\n...grabbed a cigarette, \\nstuck it in my mouth. \\nWhen I went to go light it, \\nthe explosion happened. \\nAnd it took the whole bottom of the steering wheel and my left hand off. And I was lucky that I had this. I mean, it still fucked up my right hand, but... \\nYeah. \\n- I still got it. \\nAnd you still smoke? \\nYeah, I still smoke. \\nMiss. Three inches to the right. Come on, Wynn. \\nYou can do better than that. \\nBring this to the right. \\nMake sure you keep both eyes open. Let that trigger surprise you. \\nWe\\'re not shooting bad guys, \\nwe\\'re shooting paper. \\nHow about the Legend stops \\ntrying to fuck up my shot? \\nPage 50/54\\nHow about you hit one? \\n- Hit! \\nThere you go. \\nBull\\'s-eye, boy. \\nDamn, if that don\\'t feel like \\nI got my balls back. \\nWhy you spending \\nall this time with us, man? \\nI know you got a family. \\nI heard you had a boot collection before the war? \\nI saw we were about the same size. Seriously, man. \\nWhy do you do it? \\nWell, we take care of each other, right? Let\\'s see if you can\\'t hit two in a row. Come on, man. You got this. \\n- Hit! \\n- Nice. \\n- Hit! \\n- Whoo! \\nGoddamn. \\nWho\\'s the legend now? \\nThat\\'s a title you don\\'t want. \\nTrust me. \\nYo, will you hop down? \\nI\\'ll give them to you. \\n- You got one more? \\n- Yeah. \\n- All right, take them inside. \\n- All right. \\nCome here. Tsk, tsk, tsk. \\nIt\\'s not a bad life out here, is it? Got a smile on his face. \\nLooks cheery to me. \\nJust doing his thing. \\nWave goodbye to him. \\nOh! Fuck, who is that?! \\nOh, babe, is that you? \\nYep-a-doo-dew.! \\nBaby, I fucking hurt myself. Shit. - What? \\n- No, I\\'m all right. I\\'m all right! I\\'m all right. Fuck. \\nPage 51/54\\n- Baby, I\\'m sorry. \\n- It\\'s okay. \\nWhat happened? \\nDon\\'t you-! Ooh! \\nYou know that it\\'s a heck of thing to stop a beating heart. \\nYeah. \\nThat\\'s why we\\'re gonna do it together for your first time. \\nAll right. \\nNow remember, you gotta be calm... ...confident... \\n...and you never hesitate. \\nAll right. \\n- You got it, bubba? \\n- I got it. \\n- You feel good? \\n- Yeah. \\n- Shh. \\n- Shh. \\nHands in the air, little lady. - No way. \\n- Hands in the air. \\nNow, you drop them drawers. \\nBut you drop them nice and easy. Oh, baby, look at you. \\nLook at you. \\nLook at you. \\nCan I tell you something, Chris? - Tell it to the judge. \\n- Stop it. \\nNo, I am so proud of you, \\nand I don\\'t tell you enough. \\nI\\'m so proud of you. \\nYou\\'re such a great father. \\nAnd I am so happy \\nthat I\\'ve got my husband back. And I also know how hard you fought to get here. \\nYou\\'re worth fighting for. \\nNow tell me one other thing. \\n- Did you pleat those jeans? \\n- Hm? \\nYes, ma\\'am. \\nPage 52/54\\nI believe they\\'re right down the middle. - Oh, you\\'re just a regular, old cowboy again. - Mm-hm. That\\'s right. And- \\n- Why don\\'t you really drop them drawers. - I\\'m not wearing any drawers, baby. I got four minutes. \\nHa-ha-ha. Is that all it takes? \\nNo, it takes two minutes. \\nBut then I want two minutes to look at you. Aren\\'t you going to the range? \\nWho are you taking out? \\nThis Marine. \\nHis mama kept asking me. \\nShe parks cars at the elementary school, and she said, \"Can you help out my son?\" And I just thought today\\'s the only day I can really do it, so... \\nIt\\'ll be just a bit of the afternoon. I\\'ll be back. \\nYes! Ha-ha-ha. \\nMake sure you keep them drawers \\nWhat\\'s up? \\n- Dad, you wanna play \"Skylanders\"? - No, I can\\'t play right now. \\nI\\'ll do it when I get back, boy. \\nSee you\\'re on Level 8, and that \\ndoesn\\'t work.

I was alerted to the need \\nfor medical attention \\nwhen you said, \"ow.\" \\nA robotic nurse. \\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, \\nhow would you rate your pain? \\nPhysical or emotional? \\nI will scan you now. \\nScan complete. \\nYou have a slight epidermal \\nabrasion on your forearm. \\nI suggest an anti-bacterial spray. What\\'s in the spray, specifically? The primary ingredient is bacitracin. That\\'s a bummer. \\nI\\'m actually allergic to that. You are not allergic to bacitracin. You do have a mild allergy to \\npeanuts. \\nNot bad. \\nYou\\'ve done some serious \\ncoding on this thing, huh? \\nProgramed him with \\nover 10,000 medical procedures. This chip is what \\nmakes baymax, baymax. \\nVinyl? \\nYeah, going for a non-threatening, huggable kind of thing. \\nLooks like a walking marshmallow. -No offense. \\n-I am a robot. \\nI cannot be offended. \\n-Hyperspectral cameras? \\n-Yep. \\n-Titanium skeleton? \\n-Carbon fiber. \\nPage 7/38\\nRight. Even lighter. \\nKiller actuators. \\nWhere did you get those? \\nMachined them right here, in-house. -Really? \\n-Yup. \\nHe can lift 1,000 pounds. \\nShut up. \\nYou have been a good boy. \\nHave a lollipop. \\nNice. \\nI cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care. Well then, I\\'m satisfied with my care. He\\'s going to help a lot of people. Hey, what kind of battery does it use? Lithium ion. \\nYou know, supercapacitors \\nwould charge way faster. \\nBurning the midnight oil, Mr. hamada? Hey, Professor. \\nActually, I was just finishing up. You must be Hiro. \\nBot-fighter, right? \\nWhen my daughter was younger, \\nthat\\'s all she wanted to do. \\nMay I? \\nSure. \\nMagnetic-bearing servos. \\nPretty sick, huh? \\nWanna see how I put \\'em together? Hey, genius! \\nHe invented them. \\nYou\\'re Robert Callaghan? \\nLike, as in, \\nthe Callaghan-catmull spline, \\nand Callaghan\\'s \"laws of robotics?\" That\\'s right. \\nEver think about applying here? Your age wouldn\\'t be an issue. I don\\'t know. \\nHe\\'s pretty serious about \\nhis career in bot-fighting. \\nWell, kind of serious. \\nPage 8/38\\nI can see why. \\nWith your bot, winning must come easy. Yeah, I guess. \\nWell, if you like things easy, \\nthen my program isn\\'t for you. \\nWe push the boundaries \\nof robotics here. \\nMy students go on to shape the future. Nice to meet you, Hiro. \\nGood luck with the bot-fights. \\nWe gotta hurry if you \\nwant to catch that bot-fight. \\nI have to go here. \\nIf I don\\'t go to this nerd school, I\\'m gonna lose my mind. \\nHow do I get in? \\nEvery year, the school has \\na student showcase. \\nYou come up with something \\nthat blows Callaghan away, you\\'re in. But, it\\'s gotta be great. \\nTrust me. \\nIt will be. \\nNothing! \\nNo ideas! Useless, empty brain! Wow. Washed up at 14. \\nSo sad. \\nI got nothing! I\\'m done. \\nI\\'m never getting in. \\nHey, I\\'m not giving up on you. \\nWhat are you doing? \\nShake things up. \\nUse that big brain of yours \\nto think your way out. \\n-What? \\n-Look for a new angle. \\nWow, a lot of sweet tech here today. How are you feeling? \\nYou\\'re talking to an ex-bot fighter. Takes a lot more than this to rattle me. Yep, he\\'s nervous. \\nYou have nothing to fear, little fellow. -He\\'s so tense. \\n-No, I\\'m not. \\nPage 9/38\\nRelax, Hiro. \\nYour tech is amazing. Tell him, go go. -Stop whining. Woman up. \\n-I\\'m fine! \\nWhat do you need, little man? \\nDeodorant? Breath mint? \\nFresh pair of underpants? \\nUnderpants? You need serious help. Hey, I come prepared. \\nI haven\\'t done laundry in six months. One pair lasts me four days. \\nI go front, I go back, I go inside-out. Then I go front and back. \\nWow. That is both \\ndisgusting and awesome. \\nDon\\'t encourage him. \\nIt\\'s called \"recycling.\" \\nNext presenter, Hiro hamada. \\nOh, yeah. This is it. \\nI guess I\\'m up. \\nOkay, photo, photo! \\nEverybody say, \"Hiro.\" \\n-Hiro! \\n-Yeah! \\nWe love you, Hiro. Good luck! \\n-Don\\'t mess it up. \\n-Break a leg, little man. \\nScience, yeah! \\nAll right, bro. This is it. \\nCome on. Don\\'t leave me hanging. What\\'s going on? \\nI really want to go here. \\nHey. \\nYou got this. \\nHi. \\nMy name is Hiro... \\nSorry. \\nMy name is Hiro hamada, \\nand I\\'ve been working on something that I think is pretty cool. \\nI hope you like it. \\nThis is a microbot. \\nBreathe. \\nIt doesn\\'t look like much, \\nPage 10/38\\nbut when it links up \\nwith the rest of its pals... \\n...things get a little more interesting. The microbots are controlled \\nwith this neural transmitter. \\nI think what I want them to do... They do it. \\nThe applications for this tech \\nare limitless. \\nConstruction. \\nWhat used to take teams \\nof people working by hand \\nfor months or years, \\ncan now be accomplished \\nby one person. \\nAnd that\\'s just the beginning. \\nHow about transportation? \\nMicrobots can move \\nanything anywhere, \\nwith ease. \\nIf you can think it, \\nthe microbots can do it. \\nThe only limit is your imagination. Microbots! \\nThat\\'s my nephew! \\nYes! \\nMy family! I love my family! \\nNailed it! \\n-You did it! \\n-Not bad! \\nYeah! You just blew my mind, dude! They loved you. That was amazing! Yes. \\nWith some development, \\nyour tech could be revolutionary. Alistair krei! \\nMay I? \\nExtraordinary. \\nI want your microbots at krei tech. Shut up. \\nMr. krei is right. \\nYour microbots are \\nan inspired piece of tech. \\nYou can continue to develop them, Page 11/38\\nor you can sell them to a man \\nwho\\'s only guided \\nby his own self-interest. \\nRobert, I know how you feel about me, but it shouldn\\'t affect... \\nThis is your decision, Hiro. \\nBut you should know \\nMr. krei has cut corners \\nand ignored sound science \\nto get where he is. \\nThat\\'s just not true. \\nI wouldn\\'t trust krei tech \\nwith your microbots, \\nor anything else. \\nHiro, I\\'m offering you more money than any 14-year-old could imagine. I appreciate the offer, Mr. krei, but they\\'re not for sale. \\nI thought you were smarter than that. Robert. \\nMr. krei. \\nThat\\'s my brother\\'s. \\nThat\\'s right. \\nI look forward to seeing you in class. Unbelievable! \\nThat\\'s what I\\'m talking about. All right, geniuses, \\nlet\\'s feed those hungry brains. Back to the caf! \\nDinner is on me! \\nYes! Nothing is better than free food! -Aunt cass? \\n-Unless it\\'s moldy. \\nWe\\'ll... we\\'ll catch up, okay? Sure. I\\'m so proud of you. \\nBoth of you. \\nThanks, aunt cass. \\nI know what you\\'re going to say. \"I should be proud of myself,\" \\n\"because I\\'m finally using my gift for something important.\" \\nNo, no. I was just gonna tell you your fly was down for the whole show. Ha-ha-hilarious. \\nPage 12/38\\nWhat? \\nWelcome to nerd school, nerd. \\nHey, I, um... \\nI wouldn\\'t be here \\nif it wasn\\'t for you. So, \\nyou know, \\nthanks for not giving up on me. \\nAre you okay? \\nYeah. I\\'m okay. \\nBut Professor Callaghan is still in there. Tadashi, no! \\nCallaghan\\'s in there. \\nSomeone has to help. \\nTadashi! \\nTadashi! \\nHere. Have some tea. \\nHey, sweetie. \\nHey, aunt cass. \\nMrs. matsuda\\'s in the caf. \\nShe\\'s wearing something \\nsuper inappropriate for an 80-year-old. That always cracks you up. \\nYou should come down. \\nMaybe later. \\nThe university called again. \\nIt\\'s been a few weeks \\nsince classes started. \\nBut they said it\\'s not too late to register. Okay. Thanks. I\\'ll think about it. Hey, Hiro. \\nWe just wanted to check in, \\nand see how you\\'re doing. \\nWe wish you were here, buddy. \\nHiro, if I could have only \\none superpower right now, \\nit would be the ability \\nto crawl through this camera, \\nand give you a big hug. \\nOw! \\nHello. I am baymax, \\nyour personal healthcare companion. Hey, baymax. \\nI didn\\'t know you were still active. I heard a sound of distress. \\nPage 13/38\\nWhat seems to be the trouble? \\nI just stubbed my toe a little. I\\'m fine. \\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, \\nhow would you rate your pain? \\nA zero. I\\'m okay, really. \\nThanks. You can shrink now. \\nDoes it hurt when I touch it? \\nThat\\'s okay. No touching. \\nI\\'m fine... \\nOw. \\nYou have fallen. \\nYou think? \\n-On a scale of 1 to... \\n-Ow! \\nOn a scale... \\nOn a sca... \\nOn a scale of 1 to 10... \\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, \\nhow would you rate your pain? \\nZero. \\n-It is all right to cry. \\n-No. No, no, no, no. \\nCrying is a natural response to pain. I\\'m not crying. \\n-I will scan you for injuries. -Don\\'t scan me. \\n-Scan complete. \\n-Unbelievable. \\nYou have sustained no injuries. However, your hormone \\nand neurotransmitter levels \\nindicate that you are \\nexperiencing mood swings \\ncommon in adolescence. \\nDiagnosis, puberty. \\nWhat? \\nOkay. Time to shrink now. \\nYou should expect an increase \\nin body hair, \\nespecially on your face, \\nchest, armpits, and... \\nThank you! That\\'s enough. \\nYou may also experience \\nPage 14/38\\nstrange and powerful new urges. Okay! Let\\'s get you \\nback in your luggage. \\nI cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care. Fine. I\\'m satisfied with my... My microbot? \\nThis doesn\\'t make any sense. \\nPuberty can often be a confusing time for a young adolescent \\nflowering into manhood. \\nNo. The thing is attracted \\nto the other microbots, \\nbut that\\'s impossible. \\nThey were destroyed in the fire. Dumb thing\\'s broken. \\nYour tiny robot \\nis trying to go somewhere. \\nOh, yeah? \\nWhy don\\'t you find out \\nwhere it\\'s trying to go? \\nWould that stabilize \\nyour pubescent mood swings? \\nAbsolutely. \\nBaymax? \\nBaymax? \\nBaymax? \\nWhat? \\n-Hiro? \\n-Hey, aunt cass! \\nWow. You\\'re up and... \\nYeah! I figured it was time. \\nAre you registering for school? Yes. \\nI thought about what you said. Really inspired me. \\nOh, honey, that\\'s so great. \\nOkay, \\nspecial dinner tonight. \\nI\\'ll whip up some chicken wings. You know, with the hot sauce \\nthat makes our faces numb. \\n-Okay, sounds good. \\n-Great! \\nPage 15/38\\nLast hug. \\nBaymax! \\n-Baymax! \\n-Hey! \\nWatch it! \\nBaymax! \\nBaymax! \\nAre you crazy? What are you doing? I have found where \\nyour tiny robot wants to go. \\nI told you, it\\'s broken. \\nIt\\'s not trying to go... \\nLocked. \\nThere is a window. \\nPlease exercise caution. \\nA fall from this height \\ncould lead to bodily harm. \\nOh, no. \\nExcuse me while I let out some air. Are you done? \\nYes. \\nIt will take me a moment to re-inflate. Fine, just keep it down. \\nMy microbots? \\nSomeone\\'s making more. \\nHiro? \\nYou gave me a heart attack! \\nMy hands are equipped \\nwith defibrillators. Clear. \\nStop, stop, stop! It\\'s just an expression. Oh, no. \\nRun! \\nOh, come on! \\nI am not fast. \\nYeah, no kidding! \\nGo! Go! Come on. \\nKick it down! \\nThen punch it! \\nGo! Go! \\nOh, come on! Go, go, go! \\nMove it! \\nCome on! \\nNo, no. \\nCome on! The window! \\nPage 16/38\\nSuck it in! \\nBaymax! \\nHiro? \\nCome on, let\\'s get out of here. Go! Hurry! \\nAll right, let me get this straight. A man in a kabuki mask attacked you, with an army of miniature flying robots. \"Microbots.\" \\n-Microbots. \\n-Yeah. \\nHe was controlling them telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter. So, Mr. kabuki was using esp \\nto attack you and balloon man. \\nDid you file a report \\nwhen your flying robots were stolen? No. I thought they were all destroyed. Look, I know it sounds crazy, \\nbut baymax was there, too. \\n-Tell him. \\n-Yes, officer. \\nHe\\'s telling the truth. \\nWhat the... what\\'s wrong with you? Low battery. \\nTry to keep it together. \\nI\\'m healthcare, \\nyour personal baymax companion. Kid, how about we call your parents -and get them down here? \\n-What? \\nWrite your name and number down on this piece of paper, and we can... I\\'ve gotta get you home \\nto your charging station. \\nCan you walk? \\nI will scan you now. Scan complete. Healthcare. \\nOkay. \\nIf my aunt asks, \\nwe were at school all day. Got it? We jumped out a window. \\nNo! Quiet! \\nWe jumped out a window. \\nPage 17/38\\nYou can\\'t say things like that \\naround aunt cass. \\nHiro? \\nYou home, sweetie? \\nThat\\'s right. \\nI thought I heard you. Hi. \\nHey, aunt cass. \\nLook at my little college man. \\nI can\\'t wait to hear all about it! And wings are almost ready. \\nWhee! \\nWill you be quiet? \\nYeah, wings! Whee! \\nAll right, get ready to have \\nyour face melted. \\nWe are gonna feel \\nthese things tomorrow. \\nYou know what I\\'m saying? \\nOkay. \\nSit down. Tell me everything. \\nThe thing is that, \\nsince I registered so late, \\nI\\'ve got a lot of school stuff \\nto catch up on. \\nWhat was that? \\nMochi. \\nThat darn cat. \\nAt least take a plate for the road, okay? -Don\\'t work too... \\n-Thanks for understanding. \\nHairy baby. Hairy baby. \\nAll right, come on. \\nI\\'m healthcare, \\nyour personal baymax companion. One foot in front of the other. This doesn\\'t make any sense. \\nTadashi. \\nWhat? \\nTadashi. \\nTadashi\\'s gone. \\nWhen will he return? \\nHe\\'s dead, baymax. \\nTadashi was in excellent health. With a proper diet and exercise, \\nPage 18/38\\nhe should have lived a long life. Yeah, he should have. \\nBut there was a fire and... \\nNow, he\\'s gone. \\n-Tadashi is here. \\n-No. \\nPeople keep saying \\nhe\\'s not really gone. \\nAs long as we remember him. \\nIt still hurts. \\nI see no evidence of physical injury. It\\'s a different kind of hurt. \\nYou are my patient. \\nI would like to help. \\nYou can\\'t fix this one, buddy. \\nWhat are you doing? \\nI am downloading \\na database on personal loss. \\nDatabase downloaded. \\nTreatments include contact \\nwith friends and loved ones. \\nI am contacting them now. \\nNo, no, no! I... don\\'t do that. \\nYour friends have been contacted. Unbelievable. \\nNow, what are you doing? \\nOther treatments include \\ncompassion and physical reassurance. I\\'m okay. Really. \\nYou will be all right. There, there. Thanks, baymax. \\nI am sorry about the fire. \\nIt\\'s okay. It was an accident. \\nUnless... \\nUnless it wasn\\'t. \\nAt the showcase, \\nthat guy in the mask \\nstole my microbots. And... \\nAnd then set the fire to cover his tracks. He\\'s responsible for tadashi. \\nWe gotta catch that guy. \\nIt\\'s alive! \\nIt\\'s alive, it\\'s alive! It\\'s alive! If we\\'re gonna catch that guy, \\nPage 19/38\\nyou need some upgrades. \\nWill apprehending the man in the mask improve your emotional state? \\nAbsolutely. \\nLet\\'s work on your moves. \\nNow, let\\'s take care of this. \\nI have some concerns. \\nThis armor may undermine \\nmy non-threatening, huggable design. That\\'s kind of the idea, buddy. You look sick. \\nI cannot be sick. I am a robot. It\\'s just an expression. \\nData transfer complete. \\nI fail to see how karate makes me a better healthcare companion. You want to keep me healthy, \\ndon\\'t you? \\nPunch this. \\nYes! Hammerfist! \\nSide kick! \\nKnifehand! \\nBack kick! \\nGummy bears! \\nYes! \\nYeah! Fist bump! \\n\"Fist bump\" is not in \\nmy fighting database. \\nNo, this isn\\'t a fighting thing. It\\'s what people do sometimes \\nwhen they\\'re excited or pumped up. Hey, now you\\'re getting it. \\nI will add \"fist bump\" \\nto my care-giving matrix. \\nAll right. Let\\'s go get that guy. Come on! \\nGet him, baymax! \\nWe\\'re too late. \\nYour tiny robot \\nis trying to go somewhere. \\nCome on. \\nAlways wait one hour after eating before swimming. \\nHey! \\nPage 20/38\\nCome on! \\nYour heart rate has \\nincreased dramatic... \\nOkay, baymax, \\ntime to use those upgrades. \\n-Hiro? \\n-No, no, no! \\nGet out of here! Go! \\nDude, what are you doing out here? Nothing! Just out for a walk. \\nHelps my pubescent mood swings. Is that baymax? \\nYeah, but you really... \\nWhy is he wearing \\ncarbon fiber underpants? \\nI also know karate. \\nYou guys need to go. \\nNo, don\\'t push us away, Hiro. \\nWe\\'re here for you. \\nThat\\'s why baymax contacted us. Those who suffer a loss, \\nrequire support \\nfrom friends and loved ones. \\nOkay, but I... \\nWho would like \\nto share their feelings first? I\\'ll go. Okay. \\nMy name is Fred, and it has \\nbeen 30 days since my last... \\nHoly mother of megazon! \\nAm I the only one seeing this? Oh, my gosh! Oh, no! \\nGo! \\nBaymax, get him! \\nNo, no, no, no, no! What are you doing? I\\'m saving your life. \\nBaymax can handle that guy! \\nOh, no. \\nWasabi! \\nGoodbye! \\nHiro. Explanation. Now. \\nHe stole my microbots. \\nHe started the fire. \\nI don\\'t know who he is! \\nPage 21/38\\nBaymax, palm-heel strike! \\nHard left! \\nThat mask, the black suit... \\nWe\\'re under attack \\nfrom a super villain, people! \\nI mean, how cool is that? \\nI mean, it\\'s scary, obviously. But how cool! \\nWhy are we stopped? \\nThe light\\'s red! \\nThere are no red lights in a car chase! Why is he trying to kill us? \\nWhy are you trying to kill us? It\\'s classic villain. \\nWe\\'ve seen too much! \\nLet\\'s not jump to conclusions. We don\\'t know he\\'s trying to kill us. Car! \\nHe\\'s trying to kill us! \\nDid you just put your blinker on? You have to indicate your turn! It\\'s the law! \\nThat\\'s it. \\nStop the car! \\nBaymax and I can take this guy! Seatbelts save lives. \\nBuckle up, every time. \\nWhat are you doing? \\nWhat are you doing? \\nWhat are you doing? \\nWhat are you doing? \\n-Did we lose him? \\n-Look out! \\nBaymax, hold on! \\n-We\\'re not gonna make it! \\n-We\\'re gonna make it! \\n-We\\'re not gonna make it! \\n-We\\'re gonna make it! \\n-We\\'re not gonna make it! \\n-We\\'re gonna make it! \\nWe made it! Yes! \\nI told you we\\'d make it! \\nYour injuries require my attention. And your body temperatures are low. \\nPage 22/38\\nWe should get out of here. \\nI know a place. \\nWhere are we? \\nFred. \\nWhere are you going? \\nWelcome to mi casa. \\nThat\\'s French for \"front door.\" \\nIt\\'s really not. \\nListen, nitwit. \\nA lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us. I\\'m not in the mood for any... \\nWelcome home, master Frederick. \\nHeathcliff, my man! \\nCome on in, guys. We\\'ll be safe in here. Gimme some. \\nFreddie, \\nthis is your house? \\nI thought you lived under a bridge. Well, technically, \\nit belongs to my parents. \\nThey\\'re on a vacay on the family island. You know, we should \\ntotally go some time. Frolic. \\nYou gotta be kidding me. \\nIf I wasn\\'t just attacked \\nby a guy in a kabuki mask, \\nI think this would be \\nthe weirdest thing I\\'ve seen today. My brain hates my eyes for seeing this. Your body temperature is still low. Yeah. \\nIt\\'s like spooning a warm marshmallow. It\\'s so nice. \\nOh, yeah, that\\'s toasty. \\nGood robot. \\nDoes this symbol \\nmean anything to you guys? \\n-Yes! It\\'s a bird! \\n-No! \\nThe guy in the mask was carrying something with this symbol on it. Apprehending the man in the mask will improve Hiro\\'s emotional state. Apprehend him? \\nPage 23/38\\nWe don\\'t even know who he is. \\nI have a theory. \\n\"Dr. slaughter, md\"? \\nActually, millionaire weapons designer, Malcolm chazzletick. \\n\"The annihilator\"? \\nBehind the mask, \\nindustrialist reid axworthy. \\n\"Baron Von destruct\"? \\nJust get to the point! \\nDon\\'t you guys get it? \\nThe man in the mask who attacked us is none other than... \\nVoil! \\nAlistair krei. \\n-What? \\n-Think about it. \\nKrei wanted your microbots, \\nand you said no. \\nBut rules don\\'t apply to a man like krei. There\\'s no way. \\nThe guy is too high profile. \\nThen who was that guy in the mask? I don\\'t know. \\nWe don\\'t know anything about him. His blood type is ab-negative. \\nCholesterol levels are... \\nBaymax, you scanned him? \\nI am programed to assess \\neveryone\\'s healthcare needs. \\nYes! \\nI can use the data \\nfrom your scan to find him. \\nYou\\'d have to scan \\neveryone in San fransokyo. \\nThat might take, I don\\'t know, forever. No, no, no, no. I... \\nI just have to look for another angle. Got it! \\nI\\'ll scan the whole city at the same time. I just have to upgrade baymax\\'s sensor. Actually, if we\\'re gonna catch this guy, I need to upgrade all of you. \\nUpgrade who, now? \\nPage 24/38\\nThose who suffer a loss require support from friends and loved ones. \\nOkay, I like where this is heading! We can\\'t go against that guy! \\nWe\\'re nerds! \\nHiro, we want to help, \\nbut we\\'re just us. \\nNo. \\nYou can be way more. \\nTadashi hamada was our best friend. We\\'re in. \\nCan you feel it? \\nYou guys, do you feel this? \\nOur origin story begins. \\nWe\\'re gonna be superheroes! \\nArms up. \\nThe neurotransmitter \\nmust be in his mask. \\nWe get the mask, \\nand he can\\'t control the bots. Game over. \\nThey say \\n\"we are what we are\" \\nbut we don\\'t have to be \\nI\\'m bad behavior \\nbut I do it in the best way \\nI\\'ll be the watcher \\nof the eternal flame \\nI\\'ll be the guard dog \\nof all your fever dreams \\nI am the sand in the bottom \\nhalf of the hourglass \\n\\'cause we could be immortals \\nimmortals \\njust not for long \\nfor long \\nlive with me forever now \\npull the blackout curtains down just not for long \\nfor long \\nwe could be immortals \\nimmortals \\nimmortals \\nimmortals \\nPage 25/38\\nsometimes the only payoff \\nfor having any faith \\nis when it\\'s tested again \\nand again \\nevery day \\nI\\'m still comparing your past \\nto my future \\n\\'cause we could be immortals \\nimmortals \\njust not for long \\nfor long \\nsuper jump! \\nSuper jump! \\nAnd live with me forever now \\npull the blackout curtains down -I breathe fire. \\n-Just not for long \\nfor long \\nwe could be immortals \\nimmortals \\nimmortals \\nimmortals \\nimmortals \\nimmortals \\nimmortals \\nimmortals \\nimmortals \\nI love it! \\nNot bad. \\nAnybody else\\'s suit riding up on them? Hey, guys! \\nCheck this out. \\nI\\'d like to introduce, \\nbaymax 2.0. \\nHe\\'s glorious. \\nHello. \\nHold up. Focus. \\nShow \\'em what you got, buddy. \\nThe fist, show them the fist. \\nNo, not that. \\nThe thing, the other thing. \\nRocket fist make Freddie so happy! That\\'s just one of his new upgrades! Baymax, wings. \\nPage 26/38\\nNo way! \\nThrusters. \\nI fail to see how flying \\nmakes me a better \\nhealthcare companion. \\nI fail to see how you fail to see that it\\'s awesome! \\nFull thrust. \\nSteady, big guy. \\nLook, let\\'s just take this slow. Up, up, up, up, up! \\nThrust, thrust, thrust! \\nToo much thrust! Too much thrust! Too much thrust! \\nNo, no, no, no! \\nBack on! Back on! \\nOn! On! On! \\nZoom... \\nGo up! Up, up, up! \\nUp! \\nOh, man! \\nMaybe... \\nMaybe enough flying for today. What do you say? \\nYour neurotransmitter levels \\nare rising steadily. \\nWhich means what? \\nThe treatment is working. \\nOh, no! \\nNo, no, no, no, no! \\nWhoa, baymax! \\nYes! \\nYeah! \\nYes! \\nWow! \\nThat was... \\nThat was... \\nSick. \\nIt is just an expression. \\nThat\\'s... that\\'s right, buddy. I am never taking the bus again. Your emotional state has improved. I can deactivate if you say \\nyou are satisfied with your care. Page 27/38\\nWhat? \\nNo, I don\\'t want you to deactivate. We still have to find that guy. So, fire up that super-sensor. \\nFunctionality improved. \\n1000% increase in range. \\nI have found a match... \\n...on that island. \\n-Killer view. \\n-Yeah. If I... \\nIf I wasn\\'t terrified of heights, I\\'d probably love this. \\nBut I\\'m terrified of heights, \\nso I don\\'t love it. \\nThere. Baymax, take us in. \\nAwesome! \\nOur first landing together as a team. Guys, come on. \\n\"Quarantine\"? \\nDo you people know \\nwhat \"quarantine\" means? \\n\"Quarantine.\" Enforced isolation to prevent contamination \\nthat could lead to disease, \\nor, in some cases, death. \\nThere\\'s a skull face on this one. A skull face! \\nBe ready. \\nHe could be anywhere. \\nFire! \\nSpitting fire! Spitting fire! \\nThat was a bird. \\nWell, at least we know our gear works.

Page 28/38\\nGuys. \\nAny sign of him, baymax? \\nThis structure is \\ninterfering with my sensor. \\nPerfect. The robot\\'s broken. \\nGuys, you might want to see this. What do you think it is, genius? I\\'m not sure. But look. \\nHiro. \\nKrei. \\nThat\\'s right. \\nWe were asked to do the impossible. That\\'s what we did. \\nWe\\'ve reinvented \\nthe very concept of transportation. Friends, I present \\nproject silent sparrow. \\nGeneral, may I? \\nMagic hat! \\nTeleportation. \\nThe transport of matter \\ninstantaneously through space. \\nNot science fiction anymore. \\nNow, we didn\\'t spend billions \\nof tax dollars \\nto teleport hats. \\nLadies and gentlemen, \\nyou\\'re here to witness history. \\nReady to go for a ride, Abigail? We\\'ve invited all these people. \\nMight as well give \\'em a show. \\nT-minus 30 seconds to launch. \\n-29... 28... \\n-This is argo. \\n-Capsule\\'s in position. \\n-27... \\nSir, we\\'ve picked up a slight irregularity in the magnetic containment field. Mr. krei, is there a problem? \\nNo. No problem. \\nIt\\'s well within the parameters. Let\\'s move forward. \\n3... 2... 1... \\nCabin pressure is go. \\nPage 29/38\\nPod engaged. \\nField breach! Abort! \\nWe\\'ve lost all contact with the pod. Oh, no. \\n-It\\'s breaking up! \\n-The pilot is gone. \\nPortal two is down. \\nThe magnetic \\ncontainment field\\'s down! \\nKrei, shut it down now! \\nI want this island sealed off! The government shut down \\nkrei\\'s experiment. \\nAnd he\\'s using your microbots \\nto steal his machine back. \\nKrei is the guy in the mask. \\nOh, no. \\nBaymax, get us out of here. \\nGo for the transmitter. \\nBehind his mask. \\nBaymax! \\nAll right, what\\'s the plan? \\nIt\\'s Fred time. \\nSuper jump! \\nGravity crush! \\nFalling hard. \\nSeriously, what is the plan? \\n-Get the mask. \\n-Right behind you. \\nFor real, what is the plan? \\nHey! \\nHey! \\nYou want to dance, masked man? \\'Cause you\\'ll be dancing with these. Hand over the mask, \\nor you\\'ll get a taste of this! And a little bit of that! \\nHey! I did all right. \\nIs that all you got? \\nYou got that, too? \\nIt\\'s back into the fire! \\nIt\\'s over, krei. \\nPro... Professor Callaghan? \\nThe explosion... \\nPage 30/38\\nYou died. \\nNo. I had your microbots. \\nBut, tadashi. \\nYou just let him die. \\nGive me the mask, Hiro. \\nHe went in there to save you! \\nThat was his mistake! \\nBaymax, destroy. \\nMy programing prevents me \\nfrom injuring a human being. \\nNot anymore. \\nHiro, this is not what... \\nDo it, baymax! Destroy him! \\nNo! Stop, baymax! \\nNo, stop! He\\'s getting away! \\nBaymax! \\nMy healthcare protocol \\nhas been violated. \\nI regret any distress I may have caused. How could you do that? I had him! What you just did, \\nwe never signed up for. \\nWe said we\\'d catch the guy. \\nThat\\'s it. \\nI never should have let you help me! Baymax, find Callaghan. \\nMy enhanced scanner \\nhas been damaged. \\nWings. \\nHiro, this isn\\'t part of the plan. Fly! \\nHiro! \\nYour blood pressure is elevated. You appear to be distressed. \\nI\\'m fine! \\nThere. Is it working? \\n-My sensor is operational. \\n-Good. \\nThen let\\'s get... \\nWhat? \\nAre you going to remove \\nmy healthcare chip? \\nYes. Open! \\nMy purpose is to heal \\nPage 31/38\\nthe sick and injured. \\nBaymax, open your access port. \\nDo you want me to terminate \\nProfessor Callaghan? \\nJust open! \\nWill terminating Professor Callaghan improve your emotional state? \\nYes! No! I don\\'t know! \\nOpen your access! \\n-Is this what tadashi wanted? \\n-It doesn\\'t matter! \\nTadashi programed me to aid and... Tadashi\\'s gone! \\nTadashi\\'s gone. \\nTadashi is here. \\nNo. He\\'s not here. \\nTadashi is here. \\nThis is tadashi hamada. \\nAnd this is the first test \\nof my robotics project. \\nHello, I am baymax. \\nStop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! The seventh test of my robotics project. Hello, I... \\nWhat? What? \\nWait, wait, wait, stop! \\nStop scan! Stop... \\nTadashi hamada again, \\nand this is the 33rd test \\nof my robotics project. \\nI\\'m not giving up on you. \\nYou don\\'t understand this yet, \\nbut people need you. \\nSo, let\\'s get back to work. \\nThis is tadashi hamada, \\nand this is the 84th test. \\nWhat do you say, big guy? \\nHello, I am baymax, \\nyour personal healthcare companion. It works. \\nIt works! \\nThis is amazing! You... you work! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it. I knew it. Oh, you work. \\nPage 32/38\\nI can\\'t believe it! I can\\'t... Okay. All right, big moment, here. Scan me. \\nYour neurotransmitter \\nlevels are elevated. \\nThis indicates that you are happy. I am. I really am. \\nOh, man. Wait till my brother sees you. You\\'re gonna help \\nso many people, buddy. \\nSo many. \\nThat\\'s all for now. \\nI am satisfied with my care. \\nThank you, baymax. \\nI\\'m so sorry. \\nI guess I\\'m not like my brother. Hiro. \\nGuys, I... I... \\nWe\\'re going to catch Callaghan, and, this time, we\\'ll do it right. But maybe don\\'t leave your team stranded on a spooky island next time. -Oh, man. \\n-Nah, it\\'s cool. \\nHeathcliff picked us up \\nin the family chopper. \\nHiro, we found something \\nyou should see. \\nYou almost got us all killed! \\nKrei! You did this! \\nYou knew it wasn\\'t ready! \\nCallaghan? He was there? \\nHe was such a good man. \\nWhat happened? \\nI don\\'t know. \\nBut the answer\\'s here somewhere. Wait, wait! Stop. \\nThere he is. \\nWith the pilot. \\nHang on. \\nWe\\'ve invited all these people... The pilot was Callaghan\\'s daughter. Callaghan blames krei. \\nThis is a revenge story. \\nPage 33/38\\nSo, what are we waiting for? \\nIt\\'s all set up. \\nThis beautiful new campus \\nis the culmination of a lifelong dream. But none of this \\nwould\\'ve been possible \\nwithout a few bumps in the road. Those setbacks made us stronger, and set us on the path \\nto a bright future. \\nWhat is that? \\n-What? \\n-Setback? \\nWas my daughter a \"setback\"? \\nCallaghan! But you... \\nYour daughter, that... \\nThat was an accident. \\nNo! You knew it was unsafe. \\nMy daughter is gone \\nbecause of your arrogance. \\nWhat are you doing? \\nYou took everything from me when you sent Abigail into that machine. Now I\\'m taking everything from you. No! \\nNo! No! You can\\'t! \\nYou\\'re going to watch \\neverything you\\'ve built disappear. Then, it\\'s your turn. \\nProfessor Callaghan! \\nLet him go! \\nIs this what Abigail would\\'ve wanted? Abigail is gone! \\nThis won\\'t change anything. \\nTrust me, I know. \\nListen to the kid, Callaghan. \\nPlease, let me go. \\nI\\'ll give you anything you want! I want my daughter back! \\nGo for the mask! \\nBaymax! \\nLeaping into action! \\nOh, no! \\nGetting a little tight. \\nPage 34/38\\n-No! \\n-He\\'s too strong! \\n-There\\'s no way out! \\n-You can\\'t beat him! \\nHelp! I can\\'t beat him. \\nHiro! \\n-Hiro? Hiro? \\n-Help! \\n-That\\'s it! \\n-Hiro. \\n-I know how to beat him. \\n-Hiro. \\nListen up! \\nUse those big brains of yours \\nand think your way \\naround the problem. \\nLook for a new angle. \\nMy arms! They can\\'t go any further! Wait a second, it\\'s a suit. \\nHello, sign. \\nCare to go for a little spin? \\nDouble spin! \\nBehind-the-back spin! \\nYeah! \\nYeah! \\nBaymax! \\nHiro. \\nI love that robot! \\nOkay, new plan. Forget the mask. Take out the bots. \\nThey\\'ll get sucked up into the portal. Now that is a plan! \\nHoney, Fred, \\ncan you give us some cover? \\nLike you have to ask. \\nLet\\'s do this, Freddie! \\nSmokescreen! \\nReady and \\ndive! \\nWhoa, the gravity\\'s getting \\na little weird here, guys! \\nWait. \\nLet\\'s use this! \\nThese are green blades of fury! Page 35/38\\nWoman up! \\nDouble sign-spin. \\nNow my signs are on fire! \\nNow that\\'s a chemical reaction! Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse. Hammerfist. \\nThis ends now! \\nLooks like you\\'re out of microbots. What? \\nBaymax! \\nNo! \\nOur programing prevents us \\nfrom injuring a human being. \\nBut we\\'ll take that. \\nIt\\'s still on! We have to shut it down! We can\\'t! \\nThe containment field is failing. The portal is gonna tear itself apart! We need to get out of here, now! Baymax! \\nMy sensor is detecting signs of life. -What? \\n-Coming from there. \\nThe life signs are female. \\nShe appears to be in hyper-sleep. Callaghan\\'s daughter. She\\'s still alive. Abigail. \\nLet\\'s go get her. \\nThe portal is destabilizing. \\nYou\\'ll never make it. \\nShe\\'s alive in there. \\nSomeone has to help. \\nWhat do you say, buddy? \\nFlying makes me \\na better healthcare companion. \\nCareful! There\\'s krei \\ntech debris everywhere. \\nLook out! \\nI have located the patient. \\nHurry! \\nCome on, buddy, let\\'s get her home. I\\'ll guide you out of here. Let\\'s go! Veer right! \\nOkay, to the left. \\nPage 36/38\\nHard right! \\nUp and over. \\nOkay, level off. Easy. \\nNice flying! \\nAlmost there! \\nBaymax! \\nBaymax! \\nMy thrusters are inoperable. \\nJust grab hold. \\nThere is still a way \\nI can get you both to safety. \\nI cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care. No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you? -You are my patient. \\n-Baymax. \\nYour health is my only concern. Stop! I\\'m gonna figure out... \\nAre you satisfied with your care? No. There\\'s gotta be another way. I\\'m not gonna leave you here. \\nI\\'ll think of something. \\nThere is no time. \\nAre you satisfied with your care? Please! No... \\nI can\\'t lose you, too. \\nHiro, \\nI will always be with you. \\nI\\'m satisfied with my care. \\nHiro! \\nYeah! They made it! \\nBaymax? \\nMiss, can you hear me? \\nWhat is your name? \\nAbigail Callaghan. \\nOkay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine. We\\'re taking you to the hospital. Move it! \\nGet in there. \\nA massive cleanup continues today at the headquarters \\nof krei tech industries. \\nReports are still flooding in about a group of unidentified individuals, \\nPage 37/38\\nwho prevented what could have been a major catastrophe. \\nThe whole city \\nof San fransokyo is asking, \\n\"who are these heroes? \\nAnd where are they now?\" \\n-Hey. \\n-Hi. \\nIt\\'s so exciting. \\nHey, sweetie! \\nOkay. \\nLast hug. \\nBye! \\n-And just then I was like... \\n-Get out of here. \\nOw? \\nI am baymax, \\nyour personal healthcare companion. Hello, Hiro. \\nWe didn\\'t set out to be superheroes, but sometimes life doesn\\'t go \\nthe way you planned. \\nThe good thing is, my brother \\nwanted to help a lot of people, \\nand that\\'s what we\\'re gonna do. \\nWho are we? \\nDad, I just wish I could share \\nmy accomplishments with you. \\nYou mean so much to me, and honestly, I\\'ve always felt a distance \\nwhat with you being \\non the family island all the time, and I just wish you could see how... Fred. \\nSon. \\nDad? \\nI wear \\'em front, I wear \\'em back. I go inside out, then I go front and back. Dad! \\nWe have a lot to talk about. \\nPage 38/38\\n\\n\\nScripts.com \\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier \\nBy Christopher Markus \\nPage 1/48\\nOn your left. \\nOn your left. \\nOn my left. Got it. \\nDon\\'t say it. Don\\'t you say it. - On your left. \\n- Come on! \\nNeed a medic? \\nI need a new set of lungs. \\nDude, you just ran, like, \\n13 miles in 30 minutes. \\nI guess I got a late start. \\nReally? You should \\nbe ashamed of yourself. \\nYou should take another lap. \\nDid you just take it? \\nI assume you just took it. \\nWhat unit you with? \\n58th Pararescue. \\nBut now I\\'m working down at the VA. - Sam Wilson. \\n- Steve Rogers. \\nI kind of put that together. \\nMust have freaked you out, coming home after the whole defrosting thing. It takes some getting used to. It\\'s good to meet you, Sam. \\nIt\\'s your bed, right? \\nWhat\\'s that? \\nYour bed, it\\'s too soft. \\nWhen I was over there, \\nI\\'d sleep on the ground, \\nuse rock for pillows, \\nlike a caveman. \\nNow I\\'m home, lying in my bed, and it\\'s like... \\nLying on a marshmallow. \\nFeel like I\\'m gonna sink \\nright to the floor. \\nHow long? \\nTwo tours. \\nYou must miss the \\ngood old days, huh? \\nWell, things aren\\'t so bad. \\nFood\\'s a lot better. \\nPage 2/48\\nWe used to boil everything. \\nNo polio is good. \\nInternet, so helpful. \\nI\\'ve been reading that a lot, \\ntrying to catch up. \\nMarvin Gaye, 1972, \\nTrouble Man soundtrack. \\nEverything you missed \\njammed into one album. \\nI\\'ll put it on the list. \\nAll right, Sam, duty calls. \\nThanks for the run. \\nIf that\\'s what you \\nwant to call running. \\nThat\\'s how it is? \\n- That\\'s how it is. \\n- Okay. \\nAny time you want to stop by the VA, make me look awesome \\nin front of the girl at the \\nfront desk, just let me know. \\n- I\\'ll keep it in mind. \\n- Yeah. \\nHey, fellas. \\nEither one of you \\nknow where the Smithsonian is? I\\'m here to pick up a fossil. \\nThat\\'s hilarious. \\n- How you doing? \\n- Hey. \\nCan\\'t run everywhere. \\nNo, you can\\'t. \\nTarget is a mobile \\nsatellite launch platform, \\nthe Lemurian Star. \\nThey were sending up their last payload when pirates took them, 93 minutes ago. \\n- Any demands? \\n- Billion and a half. \\n- Why so steep? \\n- Because it\\'s S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s. So it\\'s not off-course. \\nIt\\'s trespassing. \\nPage 3/48\\nI\\'m sure they have a good reason. You know, I\\'m getting a little \\ntired of being Fury\\'s janitor. \\nRelax. It\\'s not that complicated. How many pirates? \\n25. Top mercs led by this guy. \\nGeorges Batroc. \\nEx-DGSE, Action Division. \\nHe\\'s at the top of \\nInterpol\\'s Red Notice. \\nBefore the French demobilized \\nhim, he had 36 kill missions. \\nThis guy\\'s got a rep \\nfor maximum casualties. \\nHostages? \\nMostly techs. One officer. \\nJasper Sitwell. \\nThey\\'re in the galley. \\nWhat\\'s Sitwell doing \\non a launch ship? \\nAll right, I\\'m gonna \\nsweep the deck and find Batroc. Nat, you kill the engines \\nand wait for instructions. \\nRumlow, you sweep aft, \\nfind the hostages, \\nget them to the life-pods, \\nget them out. Let\\'s move. \\nS.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap. Gear up. \\nSecure channel seven. \\nSeven secure. \\nDid you do anything fun \\nSaturday night? \\nWell, all the guys \\nfrom my barbershop quartet are dead, so, no, not really. \\nComing up on the drop zone, Cap. You know, if you ask Kristen out, from Statistics, she\\'d probably say yes. That\\'s why I don\\'t ask. \\nToo shy, or too scared? \\nToo busy! \\nWas he wearing a parachute? \\nPage 4/48\\nNo. \\nNo, he wasn\\'t. \\nHey! \\nThanks. \\nYeah. You seemed pretty \\nhelpless without me. \\nWhat about the nurse that \\nlives across the hall from you? She seems kind of nice. \\nSecure the engine room, \\nthen find me a date. \\nI\\'m multi-tasking. \\nYou want a bullet in your head? Okay. \\nHey, sailor. \\nHey! \\nTargets acquired. \\nS.T.R.I.K.E. in position. \\nNatasha, what\\'s your status? \\nStatus, Natasha. \\nHang on! \\nEngine room secure. \\nOn my mark. \\nThree... \\nTwo... One. \\nI told you, S.H.I.E.L.D. \\ndoesn\\'t negotiate. \\nHostages en route to extraction. Romanoff missed \\nthe rendezvous point, Cap. \\nHostiles are still in play. \\nNatasha, Batroc\\'s on the move. Circle back to Rumlow \\nand protect the hostages. \\nNatasha. \\nWell, this is awkward. \\nWhat are you doing? \\nBacking up the hard drive. \\nIt\\'s a good habit to get into. Rumlow needed your help. \\nWhat the hell are you doing here? You\\'re saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel. Whatever I can get my hands on. Our mission is to rescue hostages. \\nPage 5/48\\nNo, that\\'s your mission, \\nand you\\'ve done it beautifully. You just jeopardized \\nthis whole operation. \\nI think that\\'s overstating things. Okay. \\nThat one\\'s on me. \\nYou\\'re damn right. \\nYou just can\\'t stop yourself \\nfrom lying, can you? \\nI didn\\'t lie. \\nAgent Romanoff \\nhad a different mission than yours. Which you didn\\'t feel \\nobliged to share. \\nI\\'m not obliged to do anything. Those hostages could \\nhave died, Nick. \\nI sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didn\\'t happen. Soldiers trust each other. \\nThat\\'s what makes it an army. \\nNot a bunch of guys \\nrunning around shooting guns. \\nLast time I trusted someone, \\nI lost an eye. \\nLook, I didn\\'t want you doing \\nanything you weren\\'t comfortable with. Agent Romanoff is comfortable \\nwith everything. \\nI can\\'t lead a mission \\nwhen the people I\\'m leading \\nhave missions of their own. \\nIt\\'s called compartmentalization. Nobody spills the secrets, \\nbecause nobody knows them all. Except you. \\nYou\\'re wrong about me. \\nI do share. \\nI\\'m nice like that. \\n- Insight bay. \\n- Captain Rogers does not have clearance for Project Insight. Director override. \\nPage 6/48\\nFury, Nicholas J. \\nConfirmed. \\nYou know, they used to play music. Yeah. \\nMy grandfather operated one \\nof these things for 40 years. \\nGranddad worked in a nice building. Got good tips. \\nHe\\'d walk home every night, \\na roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag. He\\'d say, \"Hi.\" \\nPeople would say, \"Hi\" back. \\nTime went on, \\nthe neighborhood got rougher. \\nHe\\'d say, \"Hi.\" \\nThey\\'d say, \"Keep on steppin\\'.\" Granddad got to gripping that \\nlunch bag a little tighter. \\nDid he ever get mugged? \\nEvery week some punk would say, \"What\\'s in the bag?\" \\nWhat would he do? \\nHe\\'d show them. \\nBunch of crumpled ones, \\nand a loaded .22 Magnum. \\nYeah, Granddad loved people. \\nBut he didn\\'t trust them very much. Yeah, I know. \\nThey\\'re a little bit \\nbigger than a .22. \\nThis is Project Insight. \\nThree next-generation helicarriers synced to a network \\nof targeting satellites. \\nLaunched from the Lemurian Star. Once we get them in the air, \\nthey never need to come down. \\nContinuous sub-orbital flight, \\ncourtesy of our new repulsor engines. Stark? \\nHe had a few suggestions \\nonce he got an up-close look \\nat our old turbines. \\nThese new long-range precision guns Page 7/48\\ncan eliminate 1,000 \\nhostiles a minute. \\nThe satellites can read a terrorist\\'s DNA before he steps outside his spider hole. We\\'re gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen. Thought the punishment \\nusually came after the crime. \\nWe can\\'t afford to wait that long. Who\\'s \"we\"? \\nAfter New York, I convinced \\nthe World Security Council \\nwe needed a quantum surge \\nin threat analysis. \\nFor once, we\\'re way \\nahead of the curve. \\nBy holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection. \\nYou know, I read those SSR files. \"Greatest Generation\"? \\nYou guys did some nasty stuff. \\nYeah, we compromised. \\nSometimes in ways that \\nmade us not sleep so well. \\nBut we did it \\nso that people could be free. \\nThis isn\\'t freedom. This is fear. S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is, not as we\\'d like it to be. And it\\'s getting damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap. Don\\'t hold your breath. \\nWelcome to the Smithsonian. \\nVisitor information booths are \\navailable on the second level. \\nA symbol to the nation. \\nA hero to the world. \\nThe story of Captain America \\nis one of honor, bravery and sacrifice. Denied enlistment \\ndue to poor health, \\nSteven Rogers was chosen \\nfor a program \\nunique in the annals \\nPage 8/48\\nof American warfare. \\nOne that would transform him \\ninto the world\\'s first Super-Soldier. In this rare footage, \\neveryone\\'s favorite war hero, \\nCaptain America... \\nBattle tested, \\nCaptain America \\nand his Howling Commandos \\nquickly earned their stripes. \\nTheir mission: \\ntaking down HYDRA, \\nthe Nazi rogue science division. Best friends since childhood, \\nBucky Barnes and Steven Rogers were inseparable \\non both schoolyard and battlefield. Barnes is the only Howling \\nCommando to give his life \\nin service of his country. \\nThat was a difficult winter. \\nA blizzard had trapped half \\nour battalion behind the German line. Steve, Captain Rogers, \\nhe fought his way \\nthrough a HYDRA blockade \\nthat had pinned our allies \\ndown for months. \\nHe saved over 1,000 men. \\nIncluding the man who would... Who would become my husband, \\nas it turned out. \\nEven after he died, \\nSteve was still changing my life. You should be \\nproud of yourself, Peggy. \\nI have lived a life. \\nMy only regret is that \\nyou didn\\'t get to live yours. \\nWhat is it? \\nFor as long as I can remember, I just wanted to do what was right. I guess I\\'m not quite sure \\nPage 9/48\\nwhat that is anymore. \\nAnd I thought I could throw \\nmyself back in and follow orders. Serve. \\nIt\\'s just not the same. \\nYou\\'re always so dramatic. \\nLook, you saved the world. \\nWe rather mucked it up. \\nYou didn\\'t. \\nKnowing that you helped found \\nS.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay. Hey. \\nThe world has changed, \\nand none of us can go back. \\nAll we can do is our best. \\nAnd sometimes the best that \\nwe can do is to start over. \\nSteve. \\nYeah? \\nYou\\'re alive. \\nYou came back. \\nYeah, but... \\nIt\\'s been so long. \\nSo long. \\nWell, I couldn\\'t \\nleave my best girl. \\nNot when she owes me a dance. \\nSecure office. \\nOpen Lemurian Star\\'s \\nsatellite launch file. \\nAccess denied. \\nRun decryption. \\nDecryption failed. \\nDirector override. \\nFury, Nicholas J. \\nOverride denied.

I appreciate your wit, \\nSecretary Pierce. \\nBut this Council takes things like international piracy fairly seriously. Really? I don\\'t. \\nI don\\'t care about one boat, \\nI care about the fleet. \\nIf this Council is going \\nto fall to rancor \\nevery time someone pushes us \\non the playing field, \\nmaybe we need someone \\nto oversee US. \\nMr. Secretary, nobody \\nis suggesting... \\nExcuse me. \\nMore trouble, Mr. Secretary? \\nDepends on your definition. \\nI work 40 floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit? \\nA nuclear war would do it, too. You busy in there? \\nNothing some earmarks can\\'t fix. I\\'m here to ask a favor. \\nI want you to call for a vote. Page 11/48\\nProject Insight has to be delayed. Nick, that\\'s not a favor, \\nthat\\'s a sub-committee hearing. Along one. \\nIt could be nothing. \\nIt probably is nothing. \\nI just need time \\nto make sure it\\'s nothing. \\nBut if it\\'s something? \\nThen we\\'ll both be damn glad \\nthose helicarriers aren\\'t in the air. Fine. \\nBut you got to get Iron Man \\nto stop by my niece\\'s birthday party. Thank you, sir. \\nAnd not just a flyby. \\nHe\\'s got to mingle. \\nThe thing is, \\nI think it\\'s getting worse. \\nA cop pulled me over last week.

Caught the last few minutes. \\nIt\\'s pretty intense. \\nYeah, brother, \\nwe all got the same problems. \\nGuilt, \\nregret. \\nYou lose someone? \\nMy wingman, Riley. \\nFlying a night mission. \\nStandard PJ rescue op. \\nNothing we hadn\\'t done \\nPage 12/48\\n1,000 times before. \\nUntil an RPG knocked Riley\\'s \\ndumb ass out of the sky. \\nNothing I could do. \\nIt\\'s like I was up \\nthere just to watch. \\n- I\\'m sorry. \\n- After that, \\nI had a really hard time finding a reason for being over there, you know? But you\\'re happy now, \\nback in the world? \\nThe number of people giving me \\norders is down to about zero. \\nSo, hell yeah. \\nAre you thinking about getting out? No. \\nI don\\'t know. \\nTo be honest, I don\\'t know \\nwhat I would do with myself if I did.

Give me the wheel! \\nGet me Agent Hill. \\nCommunications array damaged. \\nWell, what\\'s not damaged? \\nAir conditioning is \\nfully operational. \\nTraffic ahead. \\nGive me an alternate route. \\nTraffic alert on Roosevelt Bridge. AH vehicles stopped. \\n17th Avenue clear in three \\nblocks, directly ahead. \\nWarning. Approaching intersection. Get me off the grid! \\nCalculating route \\nto secure location. \\nSo sweet. That is so nice. \\nHi. \\nI got to go, though. \\nOkay. Bye. \\nMy aunt, she\\'s kind \\nof an insomniac. \\nYeah. \\nHey, if you want... \\nIf you want, \\nyou\\'re welcome to use my machine. Page 14/48\\nMight be cheaper \\nthan the one in the basement. \\nYeah? What\\'s it cost? \\nA cup of coffee? \\nThank you, but \\nI already have a \\nload in downstairs, \\nand you really don\\'t want \\nmy scrubs in your machine. \\nI just finished a rotation \\nin the infectious disease ward, so... Well, I\\'ll keep my distance. \\nHopefully, not too far. \\nAnd I think you left \\nyour stereo on. \\nRight. Thank you. \\nYeah. \\nI don\\'t remember giving you a key. You really think I\\'d need one? My wife kicked me out. \\nI didn\\'t know you were married. A lot of things you \\ndon\\'t know about me. \\nI know, Nick. That\\'s the problem. I\\'m sorry to have to do this, \\nbut I had no place else to crash. Who else knows about your wife? Just... \\nMy friends. \\nIs that what we are? \\nThat\\'s up to you. \\nDon\\'t trust anyone. \\nCaptain Rogers? \\nCaptain, \\nI\\'m Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D. \\nSpecial Service. \\nKate? \\nI\\'m assigned to protect you. \\nOn whose order? \\nHis. \\nFoxtrot is down, he\\'s unresponsive. I need EMTs. \\nDo we have a 20 on the shooter? Tell him I\\'m in pursuit. \\nPage 15/48\\nIs he gonna make it? \\nI don\\'t know. \\nTell me about the shooter. \\nHe\\'s fast. Strong. \\nHad a metal arm. \\nBallistics? \\nThree slugs, no rifling. \\nCompletely untraceable. \\nSoviet-made. \\nYeah. \\nHe\\'s in V-tach. \\n- Crash cart coming in. \\n- Nurse, help me with the drape. - BP\\'s dropping. \\n- Defibrillator! \\nI want you to charge him at 100. Don\\'t do this to me, Nick. \\nStand back. \\nThree, two, \\none. Clear. \\n- Pulse? \\n- No pulse. \\nOkay, 200, please. \\nStand back! \\nThree, two, one. Clear! \\nGet me epinephrine! \\nPulse? \\nNegative. \\nDon\\'t do this to me, Nick. \\nDon\\'t do this to me. \\nWhat\\'s the time? \\n1: \\nTime of death, 1:03 a.m. \\nI need to take him. \\nNatasha. \\nNatasha! \\nWhy was Fury in your apartment? I don\\'t know. \\nCap, they want you \\nback at S.H.I.E.L.D. \\nYeah, give me a second. \\nThey want you now. \\nOkay. \\nPage 16/48\\nYou\\'re a terrible liar. \\nS.T.R.I.K.E. team, \\nescort Captain Rogers \\nback to S.H.I.E.L.D. \\nimmediately for questioning. \\nI told him. \\n- Let\\'s go. \\n- Yeah. \\nS.T.R.I.K.E., move it out. \\nCaptain Rogers. \\nNeighbor. \\nCaptain. \\nI\\'m Alexander Pierce. \\nSir, it\\'s an honor. \\nThe honor\\'s mine, Captain. \\nMy father served in the 101st. \\nCome on in. \\nThat photo was taken \\nfive years after Nick and I met, when I was at State Department \\nin Bogota. \\nE.L.N. rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, \\nbut the rebels took hostages. \\nNick was Deputy Chief \\nof the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there, and he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building \\nthrough the sewers. \\nI said, \"No, we\\'ll negotiate.\" \\nTurned out, the E.L.N. didn\\'t negotiate, so they put out a kill order. \\nThey stormed the basement, \\nand what do they find? \\nThey find it empty. \\nNick had ignored my direct order, and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil, and saved the lives of \\na dozen political officers, \\nincluding my daughter. \\nSo you gave him a promotion. \\nI\\'ve never had any \\ncause to regret it. \\nPage 17/48\\nCaptain, why was Nick \\nin your apartment last night? \\nI don\\'t know. \\nDid you know it was bugged? \\nI did, because Nick told me. \\nDid he tell you \\nhe was the one who bugged it? \\nI want you to see something. \\nWho hired you, Batroc? \\nIs that live? \\nYeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers. Are you saying he\\'s a suspect? Assassination isn\\'t Batroc\\'s line. No, no. It\\'s more \\ncomplicated than that. \\nBatroc was hired anonymously \\nto attack the Lemurian Star. \\nAnd he was contacted by email \\nand paid by wire transfer, \\nand then the money was run \\nthrough 17 fictitious accounts. The last one going to \\na holding company \\nthat was registered \\nto a Jacob Veech. \\nAm I supposed to know who that is? Not likely. Veech \\ndied six years ago. \\nHis last address was \\n1435 Elmhurst Drive. \\nWhen I first met Nick, \\nhis mother lived at 1437. \\nAre you saying \\nFury hired the pirates? Why? \\nThe prevailing theory \\nwas that the hijacking was \\na cover for the acquisition \\nand sale of classified \\nintelligence. \\nThe sale went sour \\nand that led to Nick\\'s death. \\nIf you really knew Nick Fury, \\nyou\\'d know that\\'s not true. \\nPage 18/48\\nWhy do you think we\\'re talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to, \\nbut because Nick asked me to, \\nbecause we were both realists. We knew that, despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, to build a really better world sometimes means having \\nto tear the old one down. \\nAnd that makes enemies. \\nThose people that call you dirty because you got the guts \\nto stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today \\nmakes me really, really angry. Captain, you were the last \\none to see Nick alive. \\nI don\\'t think that\\'s an accident. And I don\\'t think you do, either. So, I\\'m gonna ask again. \\nWhy was he there? \\nHe told me not to trust anyone. I wonder if that included him. I\\'m sorry. \\nThose were his last words. \\nExcuse me. \\nCaptain, \\nsomebody murdered my friend \\nand I\\'m gonna find out why. \\nAnyone gets in my way, \\nthey\\'re gonna regret it. \\nAnyone. \\nUnderstood. \\nOperations Control. \\nConfirmed. \\nKeep all S.T.R.I.K.E. \\npersonnel on site. \\n- Understood. \\n- Yes, sir. \\n- Forensics. \\n- Confirmed. \\nPage 19/48\\nCap. \\nRumlow. \\nEvidence Response found some fibers on the roof they want us to see. You want me to get \\nthe tac team ready? \\nNo, let\\'s wait and see \\nwhat it is first. \\nRight. \\nWhat\\'s the status so far? \\n- Administrations level. \\n- Confirmed. \\nExcuse me. \\nI\\'m sorry about \\nwhat happened with Fury. \\nIt\\'s messed up, what \\nhappened to him. \\nThank you. \\nRecords. \\nConfirmed. \\nBefore we get started, \\ndoes anyone want to get out? \\nMobilize S.T.R.I.K.E. \\nunits, 25th floor. \\nWhoa, big guy.- \\nI just want you to know, Cap, \\nthis isn\\'t personal! \\nIt kind of feels personal. \\nDrop the shield \\nand put your hands in the air! Give it up, Rogers! \\nGet that door open! \\nYou have nowhere to go! \\nAre you kidding me? \\nHe\\'s headed for the garage. \\nLock down the bridge. \\nStand down, Captain Rogers. \\nStand down. \\nRepeat, stand down. \\nEyes here. \\nWhatever your op is, bury it. \\nThis is Level One. \\nContact DOT. \\nAll traffic lights in \\nPage 20/48\\nthe district go red. \\nShut all runways at BWI, \\nIAD and Reagan. \\nAll security cameras in the city go through this monitor right here. Scan all open sources, \\nphones, computers, \\nPDAs. Whatever. \\nIf someone tweets about this \\nguy, I want to know about it. \\nWith all due respect, \\nif S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting \\na manhunt for Captain America \\nwe deserve to know why. \\nBecause he lied to us. \\nCaptain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury. He refused to share it. \\nAs difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive \\nfrom S.H.I.E.L.D. \\n- Where is it? \\n- Safe. \\n- Do better. \\n- Where did you get it? \\nWhy would I tell you? \\nFury gave it to you. Why? \\n- What\\'s on it? \\n- I don\\'t know. \\nStop lying \\nI only act like \\nI know everything, Rogers. \\nI bet you knew Fury hired \\nthe pirates, didn\\'t you? \\nWell, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you. I\\'m not gonna ask you again. \\nI know who killed Fury. \\nMost of the intelligence community doesn\\'t believe he exists. \\nThe ones that do \\ncall him the Winter Soldier. \\nHe\\'s credited with over \\ntwo dozen assassinations \\nPage 21/48\\nin the last 50 years. \\nSo he\\'s a ghost story. \\nFive years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran. Somebody shot out \\nmy tires near Odessa. \\nWe lost control, \\nwent straight over a cliff. \\nI pulled us out. \\nBut the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer \\nso he shot him \\nstraight through me. \\nSoviet slug. \\nNo rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis. \\nYeah, I bet you look terrible \\nin them now. \\nGoing after him is a dead end. I know, I\\'ve tried. \\nLike you said, he\\'s a ghost story. Well, let\\'s find out \\nwhat the ghost wants. \\nNick Fury was murdered \\nin cold blood. \\nTo any reasonable person, \\nthat would make him a martyr, \\nnot a traitor. \\nYou know what makes him a traitor? Hiring a mercenary \\nto hijack his own ship. \\nNick Fury used your friendship to coerce this Council \\ninto delaying Project Insight. A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations. \\nAt best, he lied to you. \\nAt worst... \\nAre you calling for my resignation? I\\'ve got a pen and \\npaper right here. \\nThat discussion can be tabled \\nfor a later time. \\nBut you do want to \\nhave a discussion? \\nPage 22/48\\nWe\\'ve already had \\nit, Mr. Secretary. \\nThis Council moves to \\nimmediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time. \\nFirst rule of going on the run is don\\'t run, walk. \\nIf I run in these shoes, \\nthey\\'re gonna fall off. \\nThe drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up S.H.I.E.L.D. will know \\nexactly where we are. \\nHow much time will we have? \\nAbout nine minutes from \\nnow. \\nFury was right about that ship. Somebody\\'s trying \\nto hide something. \\nThis drive is protected \\nby some sort of AI. \\nIt keeps rewriting itself \\nto counter my commands. \\nCan you override it? \\nThe person who developed this \\nis slightly smarter than me. \\nSlightly. \\nI\\'m gonna try running a tracer. This is a program \\nthat S.H.I.E.L.D. developed \\nto track hostile malware, \\nso if we can\\'t read the file, \\nmaybe we can find out \\nwhere it came from. \\nCan I help you guys with anything? No. My fianc was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations. Right. We\\'re getting married. \\nCongratulations. Where are \\nyou guys thinking about going? New Jersey. \\nI have the exact same glasses. Wow, you two are practically twins. \\nPage 23/48\\nYeah, I wish. \\nSpecimen. \\nIf you guys need anything, \\nI\\'ve been Aaron. \\nThank you. \\n- You said nine minutes. Come on. - Relax. \\nGot it. \\nYou know it? \\nI used to. Let\\'s go. \\nStandard tac team. \\nTwo behind, two across, \\nand two coming straight at us. \\nIf they make us, I\\'ll engage, \\nyou hit the south escalator to the metro. Shut up and put your arm around me. Laugh at something I said. \\n- What? \\n- Do it. \\nNegative at the source. \\nGive me a floor rundown. \\nNegative on three. \\nNegative on two. \\nSnake the upper levels. \\nWork down to me. \\n- Kiss me. \\n- What? \\nPublic displays of affection \\nmake people very uncomfortable. Yes, they do. \\nYou still uncomfortable? \\nIt\\'s not exactly the \\nword I would use. \\nWhere did Captain America \\nlearn how to steal a car? \\nNazi Germany. \\nAnd we\\'re borrowing. \\nTake your feet off the dash. \\nAll right, I have a question for you, which you do not have to answer. I feel like, if you \\ndon\\'t answer it though, \\n- you\\'re kind of answering it, you know. - What? \\nPage 24/48\\nWas that your first \\nkiss since 1945? \\n- That bad, huh? \\n- I didn\\'t say that. \\nWell, it kind of sounds like \\nthat\\'s what you\\'re saying. \\nNo, I didn\\'t. \\nI just wondered \\nhow much practice you\\'ve had. \\n- You don\\'t need practice. \\n- Everybody needs practice. \\nIt was not my first \\nkiss since 1945. \\nI\\'m 95, I\\'m not dead. \\nNobody special, though? \\nBelieve it or not, \\nit\\'s kind of hard \\nto find someone with \\nshared life experience. \\nWell, that\\'s all right. \\nYou just make something up. \\n- What, like you? \\n- I don\\'t know. \\nThe truth is a matter \\nof circumstance. \\nIt\\'s not all things to all people, all the time. \\nNeither am I. \\nThat\\'s a tough way to live. \\nIt\\'s a good way not to die, though. You know, it\\'s kind of hard \\nto trust someone, \\nwhen you don\\'t know \\nwho that someone really is. \\nYeah. \\nWho do you want me to be? \\nHow about a friend? \\nWell, there\\'s a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers. This is it. \\nThe file came from \\nthese coordinates. \\nSo did I. \\nThis camp is where I was trained. Page 25/48\\nChange much? \\nA little. \\nPick up the pace, ladies! \\nLet\\'s go! Let\\'s go! \\nDouble time! \\nCome on, Rogers, move it! \\nCome on, fall in! \\nRogers! \\nI said fall in! \\nThis is a dead end. \\nZero heat signatures, \\nzero waves, not even radio. \\nWhoever wrote the file must \\nhave used a router to throw people off. What is it? \\nArmy regulations \\nforbid storing munitions \\nwithin 500 yards of the barracks. This building is in \\nthe wrong place. \\nThis is S.H.I.E.L.D. \\nMaybe where it started. \\nAnd there\\'s Stark\\'s father. \\nHoward. \\nWho\\'s the girl? \\nIf you\\'re already working \\nin a secret office, \\nwhy do you need to \\nhide the elevator? \\nThis can\\'t be the data point. \\nThis technology is ancient. \\nY-E-S spells yes. \\nShall we play a game? \\n- It\\'s from a movie that was really... - I know, I saw it. \\nRogers, Steven, \\nborn 1918. \\nRomanoff, Natalia Alianovna, \\nborn 1984. \\nIt\\'s some kind of recording. \\nI am not a recording, Fraulein. I may not be the man I was \\nwhen the Captain took \\nme prisoner in 1945. \\nPage 26/48\\nBut I am. \\nYou know this thing? \\nYou know this thing? \\nArnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull. \\nHe\\'s been dead for years. \\nFirst correction, I am Swiss. \\nSecond, look around you. \\nI have never been more alive. \\nIn 1972, I received a \\nterminal diagnosis. \\nScience could not save my body. My mind, however, \\nthat was worth saving, \\non 200,000 feet of databanks. \\nYou are standing in my brain. \\n- How did you get here? \\n- Invited. \\nIt was Operation Paperclip \\nafter World War II. \\nS.H.I.E.L.D. recruited German \\nscientists with strategic value. They thought I could \\nhelp their cause. \\nI also helped my own. \\nHYDRA died With the Red Skull. Cut off one head, \\ntwo more shall take its place. Prove it. \\nAccessing archive. \\nHYDRA was founded on \\nthe belief that humanity \\ncould not be trusted \\nwith its own freedom. \\nWhat we did not realize was \\nthat if you try \\nto take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. \\nHumanity needed to surrender \\nits freedom willingly. \\nAfter the war, \\nS.H.I.E.L.D. was founded, \\nand I was recruited. \\nThe new HYDRA grew. \\nPage 27/48\\nA beautiful parasite \\ninside S.H.I.E.L.D. \\nFor 70 years, \\nHYDRA has been secretly \\nfeeding crisis, reaping war, \\nand when history did not cooperate, history was changed. \\nThat\\'s impossible. S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you. \\nAccidents will happen. \\nHYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom \\nto gain its security. \\nOnce a purification process \\nis complete, \\nHYDRA\\'S new world order will arise. We won, Captain. \\nYour death amounts to \\nthe same as your life. \\nA zero sum. \\nAs I was saying... \\nWhat\\'s on this drive? \\nProject Insight requires insight. So, I wrote an algorithm. \\nWhat kind of algorithm? \\nWhat does it do? \\nThe answer to your question \\nis fascinating. \\nUnfortunately, you shall \\nbe too dead to hear it. \\nSteve, we got a bogey. \\nShort range ballistic. \\n- 30 seconds tops. \\n- Who fired it? \\nS.H.I.E.L.D. \\nI am afraid \\nI have been stalling, Captain. Admit it. \\nIt\\'s better this way. \\nWe are, both of us, \\nout of time. \\nCall in the asset. \\nI\\'m going to go, Mr. Pierce. \\nPage 28/48\\nYou need anything before I leave? No... It\\'s fine, Renata, \\nyou can go home. \\nOkay. Night-night. \\nGood night. \\nWant some milk? \\nThe timetable has moved. \\nOur window is limited. \\nTwo targets, Level Six. \\nThey already cost me Zola. \\nI want confirmed death in 10 hours. Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I... \\nI forgot my \\nphone. \\nRenata, I wish you \\nwould have knocked. \\nHey, man. \\nI\\'m sorry about this. \\nWe need a place to lay low. \\nEveryone we know is \\ntrying to kill us. \\nNot everyone. \\n- You okay? \\n- Yeah. \\nWhat\\'s going on? \\nWhen I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D. I thought I was going straight. But I guess I just traded in \\nthe KGB for HYDRA. \\nI thought I knew whose \\nlies I was telling, \\nbut I guess I can\\'t tell \\nthe difference anymore. \\nThere\\'s a chance you might be \\nin the wrong business. \\nI owe you. \\nIt\\'s okay. \\nIf it was the other way around, and it was down to me \\nto save your life, \\nnow you be honest with me, \\nwould you trust me to do it? \\nI would now. \\nAnd I\\'m always honest. \\nPage 29/48\\nWell, you seem pretty chipper \\nfor someone who just found out \\nthey died for nothing. \\nWell, guess I just like to \\nknow who I\\'m fighting. \\nI made breakfast. \\nIf you guys eat that sort of thing. So, the question is, \\nwho at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch a domestic missile strike? \\nPierce. \\nWho happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world. But he\\'s not working alone. \\nZola\\'s algorithm \\nwas on the Lemurian Star. \\nSo was Jasper Sitwell. \\nSo, the real question is, \\nhow do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap \\na S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight? The answer is, you don\\'t. \\n- What\\'s this? \\n- Call it a rsum. \\nIs this Bakhmala? \\nThe Khalid Khandil mission, \\nthat was you? \\nYou didn\\'t say he was a Pararescue. - Is this Riley? \\n- Yeah. \\nI heard they couldn\\'t bring in the choppers because of the RPGs. \\nWhat did you use? A stealth chute? No. \\nThese. \\nI thought you said \\nyou were a pilot. \\nI never said pilot. \\nI can\\'t ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason. \\nDude, Captain America \\nneeds my help. \\nThere\\'s no better \\nreason to get back in. \\nPage 30/48\\nWhere can we get our hands on \\none of these things? \\nThe last one is at Fort Meade. Behind three guarded gates \\nand a 12-inch steel wall. \\nShouldn\\'t be a problem. \\nListen, I got to fly home tonight because I got some \\nconstituency problem \\nand I got to press the flesh. \\nAny constituent in particular, Mr. Senator? \\nNo, not really. \\nTwenty-three, kind of hot. \\nReal hot, you know? \\nWants to be a reporter, I think. I don\\'t know. \\nWho listens at that point? \\nDoesn\\'t sound like \\nmuch of a problem to me. \\nReally? Because she\\'s \\nkilling my back. \\nBut this isn\\'t the place \\nto talk about it. \\nThis is a nice pin. \\n- Thank you. \\n- Come here. \\nHail HYDRA. \\n- See, it\\'s right there... \\n- Yeah, I just saw that. \\n- Should I get it checked? \\n- I think you should. \\nI need a minute. \\nBring the car around. \\nYes, sir? \\nAgent Sitwell, how was lunch? \\nI hear the crab cakes here \\nare delicious. \\nWho is this? \\nThe good-looking guy in the \\nsunglasses, your 10 o\\' clock. \\nYour other 10 o\\'clock. \\nThere you go. \\nWhat do you want? \\nPage 31/48\\nYou\\'re gonna go around \\nthe corner to your right. \\nThere\\'s a gray car two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride. And why would I do that? \\nBecause that tie looks \\nreally expensive, \\nand I\\'d hate to mess it up. \\nTell me about Zola\\'s algorithm. Never heard of it. \\nWhat were you doing \\non the Lemurian Star? \\nI was throwing up. I get seasick. Is this little display meant to insinuate that you\\'re gonna throw me off the roof? Because it\\'s really not \\nyour style, Rogers. \\nYou\\'re right. \\nIt\\'s not. \\nIt\\'s hers. \\nWait. What about that girl \\nfrom Accounting, Laura... \\nLillian. Lip piercing, right? \\nYeah, she\\'s cute. \\nYeah. I\\'m not ready for that. \\nZola\\'s algorithm is a program \\nfor choosing \\n- insight\\'s targets. \\n- What targets? \\nYou! \\nA TV anchor in Cairo, \\nthe Under Secretary of Defense, a high school Valedictorian \\nin Iowa City, \\nBruce Banner, Stephen Strange, \\nanyone who\\'s a threat \\nto HYDRA. \\nNow, or in the future. \\nIn the future? How could it know? How could it not? \\nThe 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it. Your bank records, \\nmedical histories, voting patterns, Page 32/48\\nemails, phone calls, \\nyour damn SAT scores! \\nZola\\'s algorithm \\nevaluates people\\'s past \\nto predict their future. \\nAnd what then? \\nOh, my God. Pierce \\nis gonna kill me. \\nWhat then? \\nThen the Insight helicarriers \\nscratch people off the list. \\nA few million at a time. \\nHYDRA doesn\\'t like leaks. \\nThen why don\\'t you try \\nsticking a cork in it? \\nInsight\\'s launching in 16 hours. We\\'re cutting it a \\nlittle bit close here. \\nI know. We\\'ll use him \\nto bypass the DNA scans \\nand access the \\nhelicarriers directly. \\nWhat? Are you crazy? \\nThat is a terrible, terrible idea. Shit! \\nHang on! \\nGo! I got this! \\nTaking fire above \\nand below expressway. \\nCivilians threatened. \\nRepeat, civilians threatened. \\nI make an LZ, 2300 block \\nof Virginia Avenue. \\nRendezvous, two minutes. \\nGet out of the way! \\nStay out of the way! \\nBucky? \\nWho the hell is Bucky? \\nDrop the shield, Cap! \\nGet on your knees! \\nGet on your knees! \\nGet down, get down! \\nGet on your knees! \\nDown! \\nPage 33/48\\nDon\\'t move. \\nPut the gun down. \\nNot here. Not here! \\nIt was him. \\nHe looked right at me \\nlike he didn\\'t even know me. \\nHow is that even possible? \\nIt was, like, 70 years ago. \\nZola. \\nBucky\\'s whole unit \\nwas captured in \\'43. \\nZola experimented on him. \\nWhatever he did \\nhelped Bucky survive the fall. They must have found him and... None of that\\'s your fault, Steve. Even when I had \\nnothing, I had Bucky. \\nWe need to get a doctor here. \\nIf we don\\'t put \\npressure on that wound, \\nshe\\'s gonna bleed out \\nhere in the truck. \\nThat thing was squeezing my brain. Who is this guy? \\nThree holes. Start digging. \\nGSW. She\\'s lost at least a pint. Maybe two. \\n- Let me take her. \\n- She\\'ll want to see him first. About damn time. \\nLacerated spinal column, \\ncracked sternum, \\nshattered collarbone, \\nperforated liver, \\nand one hell of a headache. \\nDon\\'t forget your collapsed lung.

Didn\\'t work so great for him, \\nbut we found a use for it. \\nWhy all the secrecy? \\nWhy not just tell us? \\nAny attempt on the Director\\'s \\nlife had to look successful. \\nCan\\'t kill you if \\nyou\\'re already dead. \\nBesides, \\nI wasn\\'t sure who to trust. \\nSergeant Barnes. \\nBucky, no! \\nThe procedure has already started. You are to be the \\nnew fist of HYDRA. \\nPut him on ice. \\nSir. \\nHe\\'s unstable. \\nErratic. \\nMission report. \\nMission report now. \\nThe man on the bridge. \\nWho was he? \\nYou met him earlier this week \\non another assignment. \\nI knew him. \\nYour work has been \\na gift to mankind. \\nYou shaped the century. \\nAnd I need you to do \\nit one more time. \\nSociety\\'s at a tipping point \\nbetween order and chaos. \\nAnd tomorrow morning, \\nwe\\'re gonna give it a push. \\nBut, if you don\\'t do your part, I can\\'t do mine. \\nAnd HYDRA can\\'t give the world the freedom it deserves. \\nBut I knew him. \\nPrep him. \\nHe\\'s been out of cryo \\nfreeze too long. \\nPage 35/48\\nThen wipe him and start over. \\nThis man declined \\nthe Nobel Peace Prize. \\nHe said peace wasn\\'t \\nan achievement, \\nit was a responsibility. \\nSee, it\\'s stuff like this \\nthat gives me trust issues. \\nWe have to stop the launch. \\nI don\\'t think the Council\\'s \\naccepting my calls anymore. \\nWhat\\'s that? \\nOnce the helicarriers \\nreach 3,000 feet, \\nthey\\'ll triangulate with Insight satellites, becoming fully weaponized. \\nWe need to breach those carriers \\nand replace their targeting \\nblades with our own. \\nOne or two won\\'t cut it. \\nWe need to link all three \\ncarriers for this to work, \\nbecause if even one of those \\nships remains operational, \\na whole lot of people \\nare gonna die. \\nWe have to assume everyone aboard \\nthose carriers is HYDRA. \\nWe have to get past them, \\ninsert these server blades. \\nAnd maybe, just maybe \\nwe can salvage what\\'s left... \\nWe\\'re not salvaging anything. \\nWe\\'re not just \\ntaking down the carriers, Nick. \\nWe\\'re taking down S.H.I.E.L.D. \\nS.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing \\nto do with this. \\nYou gave me this mission. \\nThis is how it ends. \\nS.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s been compromised. \\nYou said so yourself. \\nHYDRA grew right under your nose \\nand nobody noticed. \\nPage 36/48\\nWhy do you think we\\'re meeting in this cave? I noticed. \\nHow many paid the price \\nbefore you did? \\nLook, I didn\\'t know about Barnes. Even if you had, \\nwould you have told me? \\nOr would you have \\ncompartmentalized that, too? \\nS.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA, \\nit all goes. \\nHe\\'s right. \\nDon\\'t look at me. \\nI do what he does, just slower. Well... \\nIt looks like you\\'re giving \\nthe orders now, Captain. \\nWe looked for you, after. \\nMy folks wanted to give you \\na ride to the cemetery. \\nI know, I\\'m sorry. \\nI just kind of wanted to be alone. How was it? \\nIt was okay. \\nShe\\'s next to Dad. \\nI was gonna ask... \\nI know what you\\'re gonna say, Buck. I just... \\nWe can put the \\ncouch cushions on the floor \\nlike when we were kids. \\nIt\\'ll be fun. All you got \\nto do is shine my shoes, \\nmaybe take out the trash. \\nCome on. \\nThank you, Buck, \\nbut I can get by on my own. \\nThe thing is, you don\\'t have to. I\\'m with you to the \\nend of the line, pal. \\nHe\\'s gonna be there, you know. I know. \\nLook, whoever he used to be \\nand the guy he is now, \\nPage 37/48\\nI don\\'t think he\\'s \\nthe kind you save. \\nHe\\'s the kind you stop. \\nI don\\'t know if I can do that. Well, he might not \\ngive you a choice. \\nHe doesn\\'t know you. \\nHe will. \\nGear up. It\\'s time. \\nYou gonna wear that? \\nNo. If you\\'re gonna fight a war, you got to wear a uniform. \\nOh, man. \\nI am so fired. \\nWe are in final launch sequence. We are go on guidance. \\nAH personnel to launch stations. And how was your flight? \\nLovely. \\nThe ride from the airport, less so. Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can\\'t \\ncontrol everything. \\nIncluding Captain America. \\nThis facility is \\nbiometrically controlled. \\nAnd these will give you \\nunrestricted access. \\nI\\'ve been parking \\nthere for two months. \\n- But it\\'s his spot. \\n- So where\\'s he been? \\nI think Afghanistan. \\nNegative DT Six. The \\npattern is full. \\nWell, he could\\'ve said something. Must be the dish. \\nI\\'ll check it out. \\nTriskelion command request \\nwe clear the area for launch. \\nExcuse us. \\nI know the road \\nhasn\\'t exactly been smooth, \\nand some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way. \\nPage 38/48\\nFinally, we\\'re here. \\nAnd the world should be grateful. Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, this is Steve Rogers. \\nYou\\'ve heard a lot about me \\nover the last few days. \\nSome of you were even ordered \\nto hunt me down. \\nBut I think it\\'s time \\nyou know the truth. \\nS.H.I.E.L.D. is not \\nwhat we thought it was. \\nIt\\'s been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. \\nI don\\'t know how many more, \\nbut I know they\\'re in the building. They could be standing \\nright next to you. \\nThey almost have what they want. Absolute control. \\nThey shot Nick Fury. \\nAnd it won\\'t end there. \\nIf you launch those \\nhelicarriers today, \\nHYDRA will be able to kill \\nanyone that stands in their way. Unless we stop them. \\nI know I\\'m asking a lot. \\nBut the price of freedom is high. It always has been. \\nAnd it\\'s a price I\\'m \\nwilling to pay. \\nAnd if I\\'m the only \\none, then so be it. \\nBut I\\'m willing to bet I\\'m not. Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head? You smug son of a bitch. \\nArrest him. \\nI guess I\\'ve got the floor. \\nPreempt the launch sequence. \\nSend those ships up now. \\nPage 39/48\\nIs there a problem? \\nIs there a problem? \\nI\\'m sorry, sir. \\nI\\'m not gonna launch those ships. Captain\\'s orders. \\nMove away from your station. \\nLike he said... \\nHold it right there. \\nPut the gun down! \\nCaptain\\'s orders. \\nYou picked the wrong side, Agent. Depends on where you\\'re standing. Close the bay door! \\nClose the bay door now! \\nClose the bay door! \\nThey\\'re initiating launch. \\nHey, Cap, how do we know \\nthe good guys from the bad guys? If they\\'re shooting \\nat you, they\\'re bad. \\nHey, Cap, \\nI found those bad guys \\nyou were talking about. \\nYou okay? \\nI\\'m not dead yet. \\nLet me ask you a question. \\nWhat if Pakistan marched \\ninto Mumbai tomorrow \\nand you knew that they were \\ngoing to drag your daughters \\ninto a soccer stadium \\nfor execution, \\nand you could just stop it, \\nwith a flick of the switch. \\nWouldn\\'t you? \\nWouldn\\'t you all? \\nNot if it was your switch. \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nDid I step on your moment? \\nSatellites in range at 3,000 feet. Falcon, status? \\nEngaging \\nAll right, Cap. I\\'m in. \\nOh, shit. \\nPage 40/48\\nEight minutes, Cap. \\nWorking on it. \\nWhat are you doing? \\nShe\\'s disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets \\nonto the Internet. \\n- Including HYDRA\\'S. \\n- And S.H.I.E.L.D.\\'s. \\nIf you do this, \\nnone of your past is \\ngonna remain hidden. \\nAre you sure you\\'re ready \\nfor the world to see you \\nas you really are? \\nAre you? \\nAlpha lock. \\nFalcon, where are you now? \\nI had to take a detour. \\nOh, yeah! \\nI\\'m in. \\nBravo lock. \\nTwo down, one to go. \\nAll S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

Did you get my flowers? \\n- I\\'m glad you\\'re here, Nick. \\n- Really? \\nBecause I thought \\nyou had me killed. \\nYou know how the game works. \\nSo why make me head \\nof S.H.I.E.L.D.? \\nBecause you were the best, \\nand the most ruthless person \\nI ever met. \\nI did what I did to protect people. Our enemies are your enemies, Nick. Disorder. War. \\nIt\\'s just a matter of time \\nPage 41/48\\nbefore a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMF\\' fries Chicago. \\nDiplomacy? \\nA holding action, Nick. A band-aid. And you know where \\nI learned that. Bogota. \\nYou didn\\'t ask. \\nYou just did what had to be done. I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people \\nby sacrificing 20 million. \\nIt\\'s the next step, Nick. \\nIf you have the courage to take it. No. I have the courage not to.

This way. Come on. \\nYou\\'re going to fly me out of here. You know, there was a time \\nI would\\'ve taken a bullet for you. You already did. \\nYou will again, when it\\'s useful. Romanoff. \\nNatasha. \\nNatasha! Come on! \\nThose really do sting. \\nHail HYDRA. \\nYou\\'re out of your depth, kid. \\nSon of a bitch! \\nPlease tell me you got \\nthat chopper in the air! \\nSam, where are you? \\n41st floor! Northwest corner! \\nWe\\'re on it! Stay where you are! Not an option! \\n41st floor! 41st! \\nIt\\'s not like they put the floor numbers on the outside of the building. Hill! Where\\'s Steve? \\nYou got a location on Rogers? \\nPage 44/48\\nYou know me. \\nNo, I don\\'t! \\nBucky. \\nYou\\'ve known me your whole life. Your name is James Buchanan Barnes. Shut up! \\nI\\'m not gonna fight you. \\nYou\\'re my friend. \\nYou\\'re my mission. \\nYou\\'re my mission! \\nThen finish it. \\nBecause I\\'m with you \\nto the end of the line. \\nOn your left. \\nDo you solemnly swear to tell \\nthe truth, the whole truth, \\nand nothing but the truth? \\nI do. \\nWhy haven\\'t we yet heard \\nfrom Captain Rogers? \\nI don\\'t know what there is \\nleft for him to say. \\nI think the wreck in \\nthe middle of the Potomac \\nmade his point fairly eloquently. Well, he could explain how \\nthis country is expected to maintain its national security \\nnow that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus. HYDRA was selling you lies, \\nnot intelligence. \\nMany of which you seemed to have had a personal hand in telling. \\nAgent, you should know \\nthat there are some \\non this committee \\nwho feel, given your \\nservice record, \\nboth for this country \\nand against it, \\nthat you belong in a penitentiary. Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill. You\\'re not going to \\nPage 45/48\\nput me in a prison. \\nYou\\'re not going to put any of us in a prison. You know why? \\nDo enlighten us. \\nBecause you need us. \\nYes, the world is a \\nvulnerable place, \\nand yes, we help make it that way. But we\\'re also the ones \\nbest qualified to defend it. \\nSo, if you want to \\narrest me, arrest me. \\nYou\\'ll know where to find me. \\nSo, you\\'ve experienced \\nthis sort of thing before. \\nYou get used to it. \\nWe\\'ve been data \\nmining HYDRA\\'S files. \\nLooks like a lot of rats \\ndidn\\'t go down with the ship. \\nI\\'m headed to Europe tonight. \\nWanted to ask if you\\'d come. \\nThere\\'s something I \\ngot to do first. \\nHow about you, Wilson? \\nCould use a man with your abilities. I\\'m more of a soldier than a spy. All right, then. \\nAnybody asks for me, tell them they can find me, right here. \\nYou should be honored. \\nThat\\'s about as close as he gets to saying thank you. \\nNot going with him? \\nNo. \\n- Not staying here. \\n- Nah. \\nI blew all my covers. \\nI got to go figure out a new one. That might take a while. \\nI\\'m counting on it. \\nThat thing you asked for, \\nI called in a few favors from Kiev. Will you do me a favor? \\nPage 46/48\\nCall that nurse. \\nShe\\'s not a nurse. \\nAnd you\\'re not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. - What was her name again? \\n- Sharon. \\nShe\\'s nice. \\nBe careful, Steve. \\nYou might not want to \\npull on that thread. \\nYou\\'re going after him. \\nYou don\\'t have to come with me. I know. \\nWhen do we start? \\nIt\\'s over. Fury has released \\neverything to the public. \\nEverything he knows about. \\nHerr Strucker, if they get \\nword of our work here, \\nif they find out we serve HYDRA... HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D. \\nTwo sides of a coin \\nthat\\'s no longer currency. \\nWhat we have \\nis worth more than \\nany of them ever knew. \\nWe\\'ve only scratched \\nthe surface and already, \\nthere are other facilities doing HYDRA\\'S good work around the world. We\\'ll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends, \\nand keep them off our scent. \\nWhat about the volunteers? \\nThe dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts won\\'t \\nbe able to find them. \\nAnd the survivors? \\nThe twins. \\nSooner or later, they \\nwill meet the twins. \\nIt\\'s not a world of spies anymore.

I escaped. Peeta... Peeta was left behind. \\nMiss Everdeen? \\nYou can\\'t be in here. \\nI had a nightmare. \\nJust five more minutes. \\nYou need to sleep. \\nWe can help you sleep. \\nJust five more minutes. \\nNo. \\nNo, please, don\\'t. \\nIt\\'s just five more... \\nDon\\'t touch me! Don\\'t! \\nNo! No! Get off of me! \\nFinnick. \\nI wanted to go back \\nfor Peeta and Johanna, \\nbut I... \\nI couldn\\'t move. \\nThey have Annie, too. They took her. She\\'s... \\nShe\\'s in the Capitol. \\nI wish she was dead. \\nI wish they were all dead \\nand we were, too. \\nMiss Everdeen. \\nColonel Boggs, \\nDistrict 13\\'s head of security. \\nI know you\\'ve been discharged, but President Coin\\'s requested to meet with you first. Is there any news? \\nI\\'m just here to escort you. \\nWe were always told \\nthere was nothing left of 13. \\nCapitol bombed the surface to rubble. But we\\'re military, \\nso we learned to survive down here. Preparing, training. \\nThe war never stopped for us. \\nPage 2/40\\nThere she is. Our Girl on Fire. \\nMadam President, \\nmay I present you with The Mockingjay. What an honour it is to meet you. You\\'re a courageous young woman. I know how disorienting this must be. And I can\\'t imagine what it\\'s like to live through the atrocities of those Games. Katniss, President Alma Coin. \\nPlease know how welcome you are. I hope you\\'ll find some comfort with us. We\\'ve known loss in 13, too. \\nThis is history. \\nRight here at this table. \\nI apologize. I wish you had \\nmore time to recover, but unfortunately, we don\\'t have that luxury. \\nPlease, have a seat. \\nAre you aware of what\\'s happened? When you fired your arrow \\nat the force field \\nyou electrified the nation. \\nThere have been riots and uprisings and strikes in seven districts. \\nWe believe that if we \\nkeep this energy going \\nwe can unify the districts \\nagainst the Capitol. \\nBut if we don\\'t, if we let it dissipate, we could be waiting another \\n75 years for this opportunity. \\n- Everyone in 13 is ready for this. - What about Peeta? Is he alive? I don\\'t know. And I wish that I did. But there\\'s no way for me to contact my operatives inside the Capitol. The Capitol has always suppressed communication between the districts. But I know their system very well. I managed to break through. \\nAll we need now is the perfect message. Katniss, here\\'s what we need to do. We need to show them that \\nThe Mockingjay\\'s alive and well \\nPage 3/40\\nand willing to stand up \\nand join this fight. \\n\\'Cause we need every district \\nto stand up to this Capitol. \\nThe way you did. \\nSo we\\'re gonna shoot \\na series of propaganda clips, \\npropos, I like to call them, \\non The Mockingjay. \\nSpreads the word \\nthat we\\'re gonna stoke \\nthe fire of this rebellion. \\nThe fire that The Mockingjay started. You left him there. \\n- You left Peeta in that arena to die. - Katniss, there are so many... \\nPeeta was the one \\nwho was supposed to live. \\nMiss Everdeen. \\nThis revolution is about everyone. It\\'s about all of us. \\nAnd we need a voice. \\nThen you should\\'ve saved Peeta. \\nMaybe you should have \\nrescued the boy instead. \\nOh, no. \\nNo, listen to me. \\nNo one else can do this but her. \\nThis is not the girl you described. Obviously, we need to make it personal. Remind her who the real enemy is. She knows who the enemy is. \\nThat\\'s not the issue. \\nUnless she\\'s forgotten. \\nThere\\'s explaining and there\\'s showing. Let her see what the Capitol did to 12. She can\\'t handle it. \\nThe Games destroyed her. \\nThis is the only choice you have. People don\\'t always show up the way you want them to, Madam President. But that anger, that anger-driven defiance, that\\'s what we want. \\nAnd we can redirect it. \\nPage 4/40\\nWe need to unite these people out there that have been doing nothing but killing each other in an arena for years. We have to have a lightning rod. They\\'ll follow her. \\nShe\\'s the face of the revolution. Let her see it. Let her go home. Send her. \\nI can\\'t believe \\nyou\\'re going through with this. You can say \"no.\" \\nI need to see it for myself. \\nThis way. \\n13 swept everything, top to bottom so you\\'d be safe. \\nYou sure you don\\'t \\nwant me to go with you? \\nYeah. I\\'m sure. \\nWe\\'ll have our eyes on you from above. Figures. \\nHey! \\nCome on. \\nDon\\'t you wanna see Prim? \\nThere you go. You\\'re breakin\\' my heart. Egeria! \\nWe need to fix these lines. \\nI won\\'t say \"rebels.\" \\nThese are senseless acts of defiance. And I won\\'t legitimize them. \\nWe\\'ll call them \"criminals.\" \\n\"Radicals.\" \\nOtherwise we\\'re breaking my oldest rule. Never let them see you bleed. \\nCitizens, \\ntonight I address all of Panem as one. Since the Dark Days, \\nPanem has had an \\nunprecedented era of peace. \\nIt is a peace built upon cooperation. And a respect for law and order. In the past weeks, \\nyou have heard of sporadic violence following the actions of a few \\nradicals in the Quarter Quell. \\nPage 5/40\\nThose who choose this destructive path, your actions are based \\non a misunderstanding \\nof how we have survived. Together. It is a contract. \\nEach district supplies the Capitol. Like blood to a heart. \\nIn return, the Capitol provides order and security. \\nTo refuse work \\nis to put the entire system in danger. The Capitol is the beating \\nheart of Panem. \\nNothing can survive without a heart. The criminals that kneel before you use symbols for the purpose of sedition. Which is why all images \\nof The Mockingjay \\nare now forbidden. \\nPossessing them will be \\nconsidered treason. \\nPunishable by death. \\nJustice shall be served swiftly. Order shall be restored. \\nTo those who ignore \\nthe warnings of history, \\nprepare to pay the ultimate price. It\\'s okay. \\nWe\\'re okay. \\nWe\\'re all here now. \\nButtercup! \\nI smuggled him in. \\nI got Dad. \\nAnd I got some of your herbs \\nfrom the kitchen. \\nThey have strict rules. \\nI don\\'t know what they\\'ll do \\nif they find him here. \\nYou should try to eat something. Hello. Good evening. \\nAnd a big welcome to all in Panem. I\\'m Caesar Flickerman. And whoever you are, whatever it is you\\'re doing, if you\\'re working, put down your work. If \\nPage 6/40\\nyou\\'re having dinner, stop having dinner. Because you are going to want \\nto witness this tonight. \\nThere has been rampant speculation about what really happened in the Quarter Quell. And here to shed a little light on the subject for us is a very special guest. Please welcome Mr. Peeta Mellark. Peeta, a lot of people \\nfeel as though they are in the dark. Yeah, I know how they feel. \\nNow, so set the stage for us. \\nTalk us through what really happened on that final and controversial night. Well, first off, you have to understand that when you\\'re in the Games \\n- you only get one wish. It\\'s very costly. - You\\'re alive. \\n- It costs your life. \\n- I think it costs more than your life. How do you mean? \\nWhat\\'s more than your life? \\nI mean to murder innocent people, that costs everything that you are. Yes. \\nSo you hold on to that one wish. And that night my wish \\nwas to save Katniss. \\nYes. \\nI should\\'ve just run off with her earlier in the day like she\\'d wanted. But you didn\\'t. Why? \\nWere you caught up in Beetee\\'s plan? No, I was caught up \\ntrying to play allies. \\nAnd then they separated us and... that\\'s when I lost her. \\nAnd then the lightning hit... \\nand the whole force field \\naround the arena just blew out. \\nYes, but, Peeta, \\nKatniss is the one who blew it out. - No. \\n- You saw the footage. \\nPage 7/40\\nNo, she didn\\'t know what she was doing. Neither of us knew there was a \\nbigger plan going on. We had no idea. - You had no idea? \\n- No. \\nAll right. Well, Peeta, there are many who find this suspicious to say the least. It seems as though \\nshe was part of a rebel plan. \\nDo you think it was part of her plan to be almost killed by Johanna? \\nOr part of the plan to be \\nparalysed by lightning? \\nNo, we were not part of any rebel plan. We had no idea what was going on. All right. I believe you, \\nPeeta Mellark. Thank you. \\nYeah. \\nAnd I was going to ask you \\nto speak about the unrest \\n- but I think you might be too upset. - No, I can. \\n- Are you sure? \\n- Yeah, absolutely. \\n- Thank you. \\n- Yeah. \\nI want everyone who\\'s watching to stop and to think about \\nwhat a civil war could mean. \\nWe almost went extinct once before. And now our numbers are even fewer. - He\\'s one of them. \\n- Is this really what we wanna do? - He\\'s a traitor. \\n- Kill ourselves off? \\n- Killing is not the answer. \\n- I can\\'t believe he\\'s doing this. Everyone needs to lay down \\ntheir weapons immediately. \\n- Traitor! \\n- He\\'s not one of us! \\nThis is treason! \\nAre you calling for a ceasefire? Yeah. I am. \\nPage 8/40\\n- You\\'re a puppet! \\n- Hang him! \\nI want everyone to stop \\nthe senseless violence. \\n- This is not the path to change. - Traitor! \\nIt\\'s not the path to justice. \\nThere can\\'t be a ceasefire. \\nNot after everything Snow\\'s done. He could have done \\na lot of damage tonight. \\nMost districts, people are still too afraid to join. They need the courage. \\nWhy do you think he said that? \\nI don\\'t know. Maybe he was forced. He didn\\'t look that bad. \\nMaybe he made some kind \\nof deal to protect you. \\nHe\\'s still playing the game. \\nNo! No! No! \\nI\\'m sorry. It\\'s just a nightmare. That\\'s okay. I get \\'em, too. \\nPeeta, \\nwill you stay with me? \\nYeah. \\nAlways. \\nHey. \\nCan\\'t sleep? \\nTell me what\\'s happening. \\nI\\'m good at keeping secrets. \\nEven from Mum. \\nNo one hates the Capitol more than me. And I wanna help. \\nBut I just keep thinking, \\neven if we win this war, \\nwhat happens to Peeta? \\nI know he\\'s not safe there, \\nbut he\\'s definitely not safe here. I don\\'t think you know \\nhow important you are to them. \\nIf you want something, \\nyou just have to ask. \\nYou could demand almost anything. They\\'d have to agree to it. \\nPage 9/40\\nI should wake you up \\nmore often, Little Duck. \\nGet some sleep now. \\nYou, too. \\nThank you for agreeing to meet with me. I\\'ve decided I\\'ll be your Mockingjay. But I have some conditions. \\nPeeta and the other Tributes, \\nJohanna Mason and Annie Cresta, will be rescued \\nat the earliest opportunity. \\nIf and when Peeta is liberated, he will receive a full and unconditional pardon. No punishment will be inflicted. And the same goes for the other Tributes. No. \\nIt\\'s not their fault \\nyou abandoned them in the arena. They\\'re doing and saying \\nwhatever they can to survive. \\nIndividuals don\\'t make demands in 13. There will be a tribunal. \\nAnd a fair judgement. \\nThank you. \\nThe Victors will be granted immunity. And you will announce that \\nin front of the entire population of 13. You will hold yourself \\nand your government responsible or you will find another Mockingjay. That\\'s it. That\\'s her. Right there. Isn\\'t that who I promised you? \\nShe wears the costume. \\nGunfire in the background. \\nA hint of smoke. \\nOur Mockingjay. \\nMadam President, we\\'re losing ground, because the people are losing heart. This is worth the risk. \\nShe\\'s worth the risk. \\nPardons, tribunals. Power of the people. It can all be the bedrock \\nof the new Panem, but, \\nin wartime I think even the noblest of Page 10/40\\ncauses can be bent a little bit. Right? Do you have any other conditions? My sister gets to keep her cat. Go away. \\nIs it visiting hours again? \\nMiss Trinket, \\nyou see this door. \\nIt opens. From the inside. \\nI\\'ve told you, these are the standard living quarters. Same as everyone. You\\'re not a prisoner. \\nYou\\'re free to join the rest of 13. Not looking like this. \\nThank you very much. \\nWe have a bigger issue \\nthan wardrobe, Miss Trinket. \\nKatniss has agreed to be The Mockingjay. - That poor thing. \\n- And your Girl on Fire is burnt out. I need you to join this team now. - I need someone she trusts. \\n- What about Haymitch? \\nHe\\'s drying out in some \\nfacility a mile down. \\nAiding rebels is not really my forte. Miss Trinket, your days \\nin the Capitol are over, \\nno matter what happens here. \\nIf you wanna play \\na prisoner of war, fine. \\nStay here and rot. I\\'ll find someone else to be The Mockingjay\\'s escort. Who? \\nAnyone can be replaced. \\nNot your Mockingjay. \\nThere isn\\'t a soul in this dungeon who knows the first thing about Katniss. You honestly believe one of these cave dwellers is going to take my place? No. \\nGood afternoon. \\nThank you for interrupting \\nyour schedules. \\nThey have already been \\nPage 11/40\\nadjusted to compensate... \\nI hardly ever see children around here. Please, check in with your unit... \\nA lot of them were lost in \\nan epidemic a few years ago. \\n- I have an announcement for the citizens of 13. - Coin lost her family, too. \\nDaughter and a husband. \\nAnd our welcome guests from 12. \\nKatniss Everdeen has consented \\nto be the face of our cause \\nto help unite the districts \\nagainst the Capitol. \\nIn exchange, I have promised \\nseveral concessions. \\nFirst, we\\'ll assess all opportunities for the extraction of the Victors \\nheld hostage in the Capitol. \\nPeeta Mellark, \\nJohanna Mason... \\n- Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too. - And Annie Cresta. \\nOnce freed, they will be granted \\nfull pardon for any and all crimes \\ncommitted against the rebel cause. \\nGood. \\nThat\\'s good, Katniss. \\nIf Katniss Everdeen \\nfails to fulfil her duties \\nthe deal will be off. \\nThank you for your attention. \\nPlease, resume your daily schedules. \\n- Madam President. \\n- Effie Trinket. \\nWelcome to 13. \\nMadam President, \\nmay I say you are so very... \\nconcise. \\nYou believe that \\nthere\\'s more to be said? \\n- May I speak freely? \\n- You don\\'t appear to do anything else. I\\'m only talking about salesmanship. \\nThe thing with revolutions, \\nPage 12/40\\nthey\\'re a tender flame. \\nThey need to be nurtured with \\na little kindling and warmth. \\n- Bit of oxygen. \\n- Oxygen. \\nOne sure way to put it out \\nis to smother it. \\nOr to use up all the air in the room. Excuse me. \\nYou know what could use \\na revolution? That hair. \\nEffie? \\n- What are you doing here? \\n- I\\'m a political refugee. \\n- Plutarch rescued you? \\n- Rescued, yes, that\\'s what he calls it. You and I were both in the dark. Now I\\'m condemned \\nto this life of jumpsuits. \\nIt is wonderful to see you again. Can you believe this place? \\nI miss coffee. \\nI never knew anyplace \\ncould be so strict. I mean, \\nI thought at least \\nin the higher ranks there\\'d be some... side action. I miss my wigs. \\nLuckily, I remembered that this was all the rage when I was coming up. You know, everything old \\ncan be made new again. \\nLike democracy. \\nWhich brings me to this. \\nCinna. \\nHe\\'s dead, isn\\'t he? \\nYes, dear. \\nHe made Plutarch promise \\nnot to show you this \\nuntil you\\'d decided to be \\nThe Mockingjay on your own. \\nHe knew the risks. As we all do. He believed in this revolution. He believed in you. \\nThey\\'re beautiful. \\nPage 13/40\\nThey have it. \\nThey have the Mockingjay outfit. \\nThere\\'s not much of a prep team \\nhere in 13 but we will make you \\nthe best-dressed rebel in history. Okay. \\nBring up the lights. \\nCinna\\'s final touch. \\nEveryone\\'s either gonna wanna \\nkiss you, kill you, or be you. \\nPerfect. \\nAbsolutely perfect. \\nOkay. Let\\'s bring up the setting. Little wind. \\nOkay, Katniss, we\\'re gonna \\nstart you down on one knee. \\nAnd as you rise up, you\\'re gonna hold your flag in the air and deliver your line. And remember you\\'ve just stormed \\nthe outskirts of the Capitol \\narm-in-arm with your \\nbrothers and sisters. \\nOkay. \\nWhenever you\\'re ready. \\nPeople of Panem, \\nwe fight, we dare, we... \\nDoes she know the line? \\n- I know it. I got it. I\\'m sorry. - Okay, All right. \\n- Let\\'s do it again. \\n- She\\'s warming up. \\nAll right. With energy. Go. \\nPeople of Panem, we fight! \\nWe dare to end this hunger for justice! You\\'ve just been in battle! \\nI\\'m sorry. Excuse my outburst. \\nYou\\'ve just been in battle. \\nLet\\'s try it again. \\nWhenever you\\'re ready. \\nPeople of Panem, we fight! \\nWe dare to end this hunger for justice. And that, my friends, \\nis how a revolution dies. \\nHello, Katniss. \\nPage 14/40\\nThis how you greet an old friend? Maybe I don\\'t recognize you sober. I guess it looks as bad as it feels. People of Panem, we fight! \\nWe dare! We end this hunger for justice! Madam President, \\nindulge me for a moment, if you would. Let\\'s everybody think of one incident where Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you. Not where you were jealous of her hairstyle or her dress went up in flames \\nor she made a halfway \\ndecent shot with an arrow. \\nAnd not where Peeta made you like her. No, I\\'d like you all to think of one moment where she made you feel something real. When she volunteered \\nfor her sister at the Reaping. \\nExcellent example. \\nOkay. \\nI hope that wasn\\'t important. \\nOkay. \"Volunteer for sister.\" \\nGood. What else? \\nWhen she sang that song for little Rue. Oh, yeah. \\nWho didn\\'t get choked up at that? You know, I like you better, Effie, without all that make up. \\nWell, I like you better sober. \\nWhen she chose Rue as an ally, as well. - Yes. \\n- Now, what do all these have in common? No one told her what to do. \\nUnscripted, yes. So maybe we \\nshould just leave her alone. \\nAnd wash her face. \\nShe\\'s still a girl. \\nYou made her look 35. \\nThe opportunities for spontaneity are obviously lacking below ground. So what you\\'re suggesting \\nis we toss her into combat? \\nI can\\'t sanction putting \\nan untrained civilian \\nPage 15/40\\nin battle just for effect. \\nThis is not the Capitol. \\nThat is exactly what I\\'m suggesting. Put her in the field. \\n- No, we can\\'t protect her. \\n- It has to come from her. \\nThat\\'s what people respond to. \\nYou want a symbol for the revolution? She cannot be coached into it. \\nTrust me, I know. \\nMaybe there\\'s someplace \\nthat\\'s less dangerous. \\nDistrict 8. They reported heavy bombing last week. There are no military targets left. - We can\\'t guarantee her safety. \\n- You\\'ll never be able to guarantee my safety. - I wanna go. \\n- And if you\\'re killed? \\nMake sure you get it on camera. \\nI\\'ve made you some surprises. \\nMaybe you wanna try one out. \\nIf you\\'re gonna be a part of Katniss\\' propo team, you may as well look the part. And this one is for you. \\nPlutarch wanted you to have a weapon for the sake of the propos but... \\nI couldn\\'t just make you \\na fashion accessory. \\nIt\\'s beautiful. \\nAnd look here. \\nRegular. Incendiary. Explosive arrows. All colour-coded. \\nAnd tell Finnick \\nI\\'ve got a trident for him \\nwhen he\\'s ready. \\nMight just cheer him... Cheer him up. Let\\'s not fire the red ones in here. You had all of this and you just left the districts to fend for themselves? It\\'s not that simple, Katniss. \\nWe barely survived. \\nWe weren\\'t in any kind of shape \\nto launch a counter-attack. \\nYeah, we could\\'ve bombed the Capitol Page 16/40\\nbut they would\\'ve retaliated \\nwith at least twice the firepower. Then what? \\nThere would\\'ve been nobody \\nleft to claim victory. \\nSounds like exactly what Peeta said and then you all called him a traitor. This way, soldier. \\nYou are camera-ready. \\nDoesn\\'t your comrade look handsome? Let\\'s go. \\nCome back safe. \\nQuick introductions, Katniss. \\nThese people have come a long way to support the cause. This is Cressida. In my opinion one of the best \\nup-and-coming directors in the Capitol. - Until I up and left. Hey. \\n- Hey. \\nLet\\'s see what you can do. Be careful. - This is my assistant, Messalla. - It\\'s an honour to meet you. \\n- And your cameramen over there, Castor. - Hello. \\nAnd Pollux. \\nLet\\'s get locked in. \\nYou\\'re all from the Capitol? \\nPlutarch got you out? \\nDon\\'t expect much chitchat from him. He\\'s an Avox. \\nCapitol cut his tongue out years ago. And, no, it wasn\\'t any sort of rescue, if that\\'s what you mean. \\nWe all fled on our own. For this. For you. \\nThis has gotta be fast. In and out. Move out. \\nYou\\'re alive then. We weren\\'t sure. Katniss, Commander Paylor, District 8. Katniss has been recovering, \\nbut she insisted on coming out \\n- and seein\\' some of your wounded. - Well, we\\'ve got plenty of those. We have a mass grave \\nPage 17/40\\na few blocks west, but, \\nI can\\'t spare the manpower \\nto move them yet. \\nHospital\\'s past that curtain. \\nAny hope you can give them, \\nit\\'s worth it. \\nThe Capitol\\'s done everything \\nthey can to break us. \\nAren\\'t you worried about having all your wounded in one place? I think it\\'s better \\nthan leaving them to die. \\n- That\\'s not what I meant. \\n- Well, that\\'s my only other option. If you can come up with another, I\\'m all ears. \\nIt\\'s right through here. \\nDon\\'t film me in there. \\nI can\\'t help them. \\nJust let them see your face. \\nExcuse me. \\n- Yeah. \\n- You all right? \\nIt\\'s okay. Here, it\\'s okay. \\nI\\'ve got you. I\\'ve got you. \\nIt\\'s all right. \\nKatniss Everdeen? \\nWhat are you doing here? \\nI came to see you. \\nWhat about the baby? \\n- I lost it. \\n- Are you fighting, Katniss? \\nYou here to fight with us? \\nI am. \\nI will. \\nTighter. \\nTighter, tighter. \\nSir, some cameras \\nwere damaged in the bombings, \\nbut we confirmed it\\'s her. \\nZoom in. \\nShe was visiting a makeshift hospital. We\\'re not sure if she\\'s still there. We can scramble hovercraft \\nPage 18/40\\nfrom the border of 11. \\nWe may be able to target her. \\nKill the wounded. \\nSir... \\nYou wrote that speech yourself, Egeria. Any association with \\nthe Mockingjay symbol \\nis forbidden. \\nEveryone inside that hospital \\nhas committed treason. \\nShow them what it costs \\nto be friends with Katniss Everdeen. Your mom\\'s gonna be proud of you \\nwhen she sees the footage. \\n- Will this play in the districts? - It\\'ll be tattooed on their eyes. - There\\'s a problem. \\n- What kinda problem? \\nIncoming bombers from the north. \\n- We need to find cover now. \\n- There\\'s a bunker in there. \\nStraight ahead and down the stairs. Katniss! \\nKatniss! \\nEverdeen! \\nEverdeen! \\nGale, back away from the wall! \\nYou okay? \\nMove! \\n- They\\'re going after something to the south. - That\\'s towards the hospital. \\nThey\\'re circling back around. Come on! That\\'s the hospital. \\nThey\\'re targeting the hospital. \\nHelp them! \\nHelp them! Get them out! \\nKatniss? \\nKatniss, can you tell everyone \\nwhat you\\'re seeing right now? \\nKatniss, what do you wanna say? \\nI want the rebels \\nto know that I\\'m alive. \\nThat I\\'m in District 8 \\nwhere the Capitol just bombed a hospital Page 19/40\\nfilled with unarmed men, \\nwomen and children. \\nAnd there will be no survivors. If you think for one second that the Capitol will ever treat us fairly you are lying to yourselves. \\nBecause we know who they are \\nand what they do. \\nThis is what they do! \\nAnd we must fight back. \\nI have a message for President Snow. You can torture us and bomb us \\nand burn our districts to the ground. But do you see that? \\nFire is catching. \\nAnd if we burn, you burn with us! We know who they are and what they do. This is what they do! \\nAnd we must fight back. \\nYou can torture us and bomb us \\nand burn our districts to the ground. Plutarch\\'s faith in you \\nwasn\\'t misplaced. \\n- But do you see that? \\n- Thank you. \\n- Fire is catching. \\n- Come up with me for the beginning. And if we burn, you burn with us! There is no progress without compromise. No victory without sacrifice. \\nBut I stand here with The Mockingjay to announce that our moment has arrived. Beetee has increased \\nour use of the airwaves tenfold. We will broadcast this message \\nto all the districts tonight. \\nThe Mockingjay\\'s words inspiring everyone to join the rebellion. Together, we will become \\nan alliance to be reckoned with. Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah! \\nYou don\\'t like hearing \\na fight song at a funeral? \\nThe more people on our side, \\nPage 20/40\\nthe closer we are to Peeta and Annie. Yeah. \\nBy order of President Snow daily production quotas have been increased. \\nAll work shifts will be extended \\nby an extra two hours. \\nFailure to meet these quotas \\nwill not be tolerated. \\nBy order of President Snow daily \\nproduction quotas have been increased. If we burn, you burn with us! \\nYeah! \\nYeah! \\n- I got good news. \\n- What? \\nCoin agreed to let us hunt above ground. He\\'s not even afraid of us. \\nIt\\'s \\'cause they\\'ve \\nnever been hunted before. \\nIt\\'s almost not fair. \\nThey want us back. \\n- They asked us to head for Command. - All right. I gotta drop these off. She was arguably \\nour favourite Tribute. \\nAnd I think that\\'s what \\nwe all find most astonishing, \\nis that this girl was \\nadored in the Capitol. \\nAnd I think for you, Peeta, \\nit must be particularly painful. \\nI wish I could give \\nthis rose to you, Katniss. \\nHe\\'s changed so much already. \\nWhat are they doing to him? \\nA sweet gesture for a girl \\nwho has inspired such violence. \\nYou must love her very much \\nto be able to forgive her. \\n- He\\'s shaking. \\n- I don\\'t think that I could. \\nUnless, of course, Peeta, \\nyou think that perhaps she\\'s being forced into saying things that \\nPage 21/40\\nshe doesn\\'t even understand. \\nYeah. Yeah, that\\'s exactly what I think. - Even his voice is different. \\n- I think they\\'re using her to whip up the rebels. I doubt she even knows what\\'s happening. And what\\'s really at stake. \\nNow, Peeta, I doubt that the rebels \\nwill ever let her see this. \\nBut if they do, \\nwhat would you say to her? \\nTo Katniss Everdeen, the once sweet Katniss Everdeen. What would you say to her? \\nI would... I would tell her \\nto think for herself. \\nYes. \\nDon\\'t be a fool, Katniss. \\nI know you never wanted the rebellion. The things that you did in the Games \\nwere never intended to start all of this. The rebels have made you \\ninto something that you\\'re not. \\nSomething that could destroy all of us. So if you have any power or any say \\nin what they do or how they use you, \\nplease, please, urge them to stop \\nthis war before it\\'s too late. \\nAnd ask yourself, can you trust \\nthe people you\\'re working with? \\n- Do you know what they really want? \\n- We need to respond. \\nThank you, Peeta Mellark, for these \\nrevelations about the real Mockingjay. - Did you see what he looks like? \\n- I saw a coward. \\n- You don\\'t have any idea what he\\'s going through. - I don\\'t care. \\nI would never say what he just said. \\nNot if they tortured me. \\nNot with a gun to my head. \\nThat is the same Peeta that \\ndefended you at the whipping post. \\nNo, it\\'s not. \\nNow he\\'s only defending himself. \\nCoin\\'s called a meeting. \\nPage 22/40\\nWe need to respond. \\nWhen did \"we\" become you and Coin? Everyone has a choice. \\nHow can he sit there in the Capitol and defend the people who destroyed his home and murdered his family? \\nHe doesn\\'t know. \\nHow could he? Nobody\\'s seen \\nwhat the Capitol did to 12. \\nI have to show them. \\nSo I wanna start with you \\nin front of the Justice Building, okay? Bang. First shot. \\nKatniss, tell us what happened here. We were all standin\\' right here \\nwatchin\\' the Games \\nwhen you fired that arrow. \\nThe screens just went dark. \\nNobody had any idea what happened. Peacekeepers forced us \\nback into our homes. \\nFor maybe an hour, \\nthe town was just dead quiet. \\nLittle past 9: \\nwe heard their trucks pullin\\' out. All of them. Every single Peacekeeper. And I knew what that meant. \\nMe and a couple of guys from the mines, we started pulling people from their houses and tried to get \\'em to the fence line but a lotta people were scared of the forest. So they headed up onto the road. \\nMake a break for it that way. \\nStay with Gale. \\n915 of us made it to the fence. \\nThen we watched as... \\nbombers circled back towards the road. They firebombed them as they ran away. 915 outta 10,000. \\nI should\\'ve grabbed people. \\nI should\\'ve dragged \\'em with me. \\n- Some of the kids I could\\'ve carried. - You saved so many people, Gale. \\nPage 23/40\\nWithout you, there would be no District 12. Not even the memory of it. \\nThis is where you kissed me. \\nI didn\\'t think you remembered that. I\\'d have to be dead to forget that. Maybe not even then. \\nI knew you\\'d do that. \\nHow? I didn\\'t. \\n\\'Cause I\\'m in pain. \\nThat\\'s the only way \\nthat I can get your attention. \\nDon\\'t worry, Katniss. It\\'ll pass. Hey. \\nYeah, that\\'s a Mockingjay. \\nWell, now they\\'ll never shut up. \\nYou want me to sing? \\nAre you, are you. \\nComing to the tree. \\nThey strung up a man. \\nThey say who murdered three. \\nStrange things did happen here \\nNo stranger would it be. \\nIf we met at midnight. \\nIn the hanging tree. \\nAre you, are you. \\nComing to the tree. \\nWhere the dead man called out \\nfor his love to flee. \\nStrange things did happen here \\nNo stranger would it be. \\nIf we met at midnight. \\nIn the hanging tree. \\nAre you, are you. \\nComing to the tree. \\nWhere I told you to run. \\nSo we\\'d both be free. \\nStrange things did happen here \\nNo stranger would it be. \\nIf we met at midnight. \\nIn the hanging tree. \\nThat line was originally \\n\"necklace of rope.\" \\nI had it changed to \"necklace of hope.\" Wow. You are a true wordsmith. \\nPage 24/40\\nLittle on the nose, but, \\nof course, so is war. \\n- Every district\\'s seeing this? - Yes. But not the Capitol. \\nI designed this signal \\ndefence system for them. \\nBut I can\\'t find my way through it. Guess I did my job too well. \\nAt the time, I was just thinking of the science of it all. \\nWe\\'ll get through it. \\nMoves and countermoves. \\nKatniss, you\\'re wanted in Command. Tonight, we\\'ve received reports of derailed trains, \\nof granaries on fire, \\nand of a savage attack on the \\nhydroelectric dam in District 5. What have they done to you? \\nI\\'m begging for restraint and decency. We interrupt your regularly \\nscheduled horse manure \\nto bring you... \\n- That\\'s it. That\\'s our footage. - Beetee\\'s in. \\n- Katniss? \\n- He sees it. He sees our propo. - Katniss, are you there? \\n- Peeta. \\nKatniss? \\nPeeta, please continue. \\nYou were telling us about \\nthese savage attacks. \\nYeah. \\nThe attack on the dam \\nwas a callous \\nand inhuman act of destruction... Think about it. \\nHow will this end? What will be left? No one can survive this. \\nNo one is safe now. \\nNot here in the Capitol. \\nNot in any of the districts. \\nThey\\'re coming, Katniss. \\nPage 25/40\\nThey\\'re gonna kill everyone. \\nAnd in District 13 \\nyou\\'ll be dead by morning. \\n- He\\'s warning us. That was a warning. - Yes, it was. \\nWe have to get him out \\nbefore they kill him. \\n- Is there anything in the air? \\n- Nothing on Doppler, ma\\'am. \\nHe was in the mansion. \\nHe could have overheard something. Possibly. \\nIt\\'s time for an air raid drill. This is a code red alert. Please, remain calm and begin evacuation protocol. - Prim! Prim! \\n- Proceed to your nearest stairwell and descend to level 40. \\nBlast doors will be \\nsealed in six minutes. \\nThis is a code red alert. Please, remain calm and begin evacuation protocol. Proceed in an orderly fashion to your nearest stairwell and descend to level 40. Madam President, three Capitol \\nsquadrons just entered our airspace. - How much time do we have? \\n- They\\'re a few seconds from range. - Prepare to scramble the fleet. - Copy that. \\nOpen up short-range air defence. Arm long-range missiles \\nfor counter-attack. \\nThis is a code red alert. Please, remain calm and begin evacuation protocol. Proceed in an orderly fashion to your nearest stairwell and descend to level 40. Blast doors... \\nThis is a code red alert. \\nPlease, remain calm... \\nThis is a code red alert. \\nProceed in an orderly fashion... Come on. Come on, hon. \\nContinue to the Supply Station \\nPage 26/40\\nand claim one pack \\nfor each member of your compartment. Please keep all personal items \\nwithin your assigned area. \\nBe courteous to your fellow citizens. This is a code red alert. \\nAll citizens should be \\ninside the bunker. \\n- Blast doors will close in two minutes. - Mum! \\n- Where\\'s Prim? \\n- I thought she went to find you. - She must still be on the stairs. - There\\'s no one on the stairs. She went back for the cat. \\nThis is a code red alert. \\nAll citizens should be \\ninside the bunker. \\nHey, stop! Stop! \\nBlast doors will close in one minute. They hit the far edge of the \\nNorthwest quadrant. Penetrated 40 feet. Missed the living quarters. \\nOnly minor damage to corridors 2 and 3. - Is there any radiation? \\n- None detected. \\nDoppler shows a fourth wave approaching. - Blast doors will close in 30 seconds. - Prim! \\n- Prim! \\n- Katniss! \\n- This is a code red alert. \\n- Katniss! \\n- Blast doors will close in 15 seconds. - Keep moving, keep moving! \\nGet down here! \\n- Hurry! \\n- This is a code red alert. \\n- Come on! \\n- Blast doors will close in 10 seconds. Nine... \\n- Eight... \\n- Come on! \\nSeven... \\nPage 27/40\\nSix... \\n- Five... \\n- Hold the doors! \\nFour... \\nThree... \\n- Two... \\n- Wait! Hold the doors! \\nOne. \\nYou went back for the cat? \\nWhat were you thinking? \\nI wasn\\'t gonna leave him behind. I couldn\\'t live with myself. \\nBlast doors are now sealed. \\nI know, Prim. \\nLet\\'s go. \\nDamage to the aquifer in the Northwest quadrant. We lost a transport corridor. There\\'s nothing else in the Northwest. Our surface-to-air launchers \\njust took a direct hit in sector 3. Because we revealed ourselves. They saw us firing there. \\nStand down. Don\\'t launch the fleet. Another 12 Capitol bombers approaching sector 3 in attack formation. \\nHold fire on their approach. \\nWhat\\'d they hit? \\nBedrock. But there\\'s debris \\nin the ventilation shaft. \\n- They\\'re not targeting our fleet. - Or our Special Weaponry. \\nThey don\\'t know what we have \\nor where we have it. \\nCan you confirm that everyone\\'s safely in the bunker? \\nAlready done. \\nConceal all remaining \\nanti-aircraft guns. \\nSeal launching pads \\nand ventilation corridors. \\nWe are gonna wait this out. \\nThis is what we\\'re built for. \\nThey\\'ll seal us in here like a tomb. The Capitol\\'s working off \\nPage 28/40\\nsome outdated information. \\n- I\\'d rather not update it for them. - Madam President, I know it\\'s not my place... It\\'s not. You\\'re a welcome guest, \\nbut you\\'re out of your depth down here. - Reduce oxygen to 14% to conserve it. - Copy that. \\nTake a deep breath, Mr. Heavensbee. It\\'s gonna be a long night. \\nPrim, talk about something. Anything. They promoted me at the hospital. \\nI forgot to tell you. \\nThey\\'re training me to be a doctor. They\\'d be stupid not to. \\nHey. \\n- Can I sit? \\n- Yeah. \\nSnow\\'s using Annie to punish you. \\nHe\\'s taunting us with them. \\nI didn\\'t understand until just now \\nwatching that stupid cat. \\nAfter your first Games, \\nI thought the whole romance was an act. We all expected you \\nto continue that strategy. \\nBut it wasn\\'t until \\nPeeta\\'s heart stopped \\nand he nearly died that... \\nI knew I\\'d misjudged you. \\nYou love him. \\nI\\'m not saying in what way. \\nMaybe you don\\'t even know yourself. But anyone paying attention can see it. How do you live with it? \\nI drag myself outta nightmares \\nand there\\'s no relief in waking up. But... it\\'s better not to give in to it. Takes 10 times longer to put yourself back together than it does to fall apart. Katniss? Katniss? \\nCome with me. \\nWe took their best shot. Didn\\'t we? Yeah. \\n- Your mother and sister okay? \\nPage 29/40\\n- Yeah, they\\'re fine. \\nI need you to do something for us. I need you to tell Panem that we survived an attack by the Capitol with no casualties. \\nAnd we remain fully operational. Okay. \\nYou should know something. \\nWe had eight extra minutes of civilian evacuation because of Peeta\\'s warning. I won\\'t forget that. \\nThank you. \\nSo Katniss, it\\'s \"13 is alive \\nand well and so am I.\" \\nKatniss? \\nKatniss. \\nNever one to waste it \\nin rehearsal, I know. \\nWhy would they drop these? \\nFor me. \\nReady to go, Katniss? \\nWe\\'re gonna do this, \\njust like District 8. \\nTell me about the roses. \\nTell Snow 13 is alive and well. He\\'s gonna kill Peeta. \\nLet\\'s try again. Can you speak up? We don\\'t have a mic on you. \\n\"13 is alive and well and so am I.\" He\\'s gonna kill Peeta. \\n- I can\\'t. \\n- Katniss? \\n- You can do it, Katniss. \\n- I can\\'t do this. \\n\"13 is alive and well and so am I.\" He\\'s just gonna keep... \\nHe\\'s never gonna stop. \\n- Cressida, we should cut the cameras. - It\\'s okay, Katniss. \\nNo. He warned me. \\nHe warned me about this. \\nHe\\'s doing this because \\nI\\'m The Mockingjay. \\nHe\\'s punishing Peeta to punish me. Page 30/40\\nNo. \\n- No, I can\\'t do this. \\n- Katniss. \\n- Don\\'t make me do this! \\n- Let her go. \\nI got... I gotta get out of here. So this is the end? \\nI suppose you\\'re just gonna \\nhide down here forever? \\nI can\\'t be The Mockingjay. \\nNot The Mockingjay. Just Katniss. You know, you\\'re the only \\nreal friend I have down here. \\nI don\\'t suppose they gave you \\nany kind of medication? \\n- You\\'re unbelievable. \\n- Okay, but I meant what I said. Look, the reason I\\'m here \\nis to let you know \\nthey\\'re rescuing Peeta. \\n- What? \\n- The dam went down in District 5, took out most of the power to the Capitol. Knocked out their signal defence. Beetee\\'s inside their system now, wreaking all kinds of havoc. \\nA window is open to us. \\nHow much longer? I don\\'t know. \\nI guess until the Capitol \\ncan get the power back on. \\nAnd President Coin? \\nYou know, I can never fully support that woman in light of the... \\nprohibition they have \\ngoing on around this place, but... Plutarch got word that Peeta and the others are in the Tribute Centre. And with the power out, \\nCoin sees this as an opportunity. She knows that Peeta is the Capitol\\'s weapon. The same way you\\'re ours. And as opposed to having you two pointing at each other, \\nshe\\'s going to get him. \\nPage 31/40\\n- I have to go help. \\n- Hey, hey, whoa, kiddo. Wait. \\nCome on. What, are you just gonna jump out of the vent and go storm the Capitol? Besides, it\\'s already under way. Six soldiers went in. Volunteer only. And guess who was \\nthe first brave soul to sign up. Gale. \\n- Okay, Finnick? \\n- Yeah. Yeah. \\nGo in the centre there. \\nThose rocks. \\nCastor, to the left. \\nPollux, you\\'re with me. \\nSo we\\'ll go straight to camera. \\nOkay? Finnick? \\nYeah. \\nOkay. Take your time. \\nJust remember to keep talking \\nand don\\'t stop. \\nThis is Finnick Odair. \\nWinner of the 65th Hunger Games. And I\\'m coming to you \\nfrom District 13, alive and well. We\\'ve survived an assault \\nfrom the Capitol. \\nBut I\\'m not here \\nto give you recent news. \\n- Why is Finnick doing a propo? \\n- It\\'s a lot more than that. \\n- Beetee\\'s commandeered the system. - Now that they\\'re down to generator power there\\'s a more limited range of \\nfrequencies available to them. \\nAnd I\\'m filling them \\nall up with Finnick. \\nNot many will see it, but whoever does will think it\\'s another propo. \\nWhat they don\\'t know is this broadcast is jamming their entire system with noise. Early defence warning, \\ninternal communications, everything. As long as the broadcast goes through, \\nPage 32/40\\nour team should be able \\nto get in and out undetected. \\nThe truth. \\nNot the myths about a life of luxury. Not the lie about glory \\nfor your homeland. \\nYou can survive the arena. \\nThe moment you leave, you\\'re a slave. Mockingjay One, Mockingjay One, you are one minute out from perimeter defence. - Going dark. \\n- Stay low in case they\\'re online. President Snow used to sell me. \\nOr my body, at least. \\nI wasn\\'t the only one. \\nIf a Victor is considered desirable, the President gives them as a reward or allows people to buy them. \\nIf you refuse, he kills someone you love. Mockingjay One, you are 20 seconds from perimeter defence. \\nTen seconds. \\nNine... Eight... \\nSeven... Six... Five... \\nFour... Three... Two... \\nOne. \\nNo response from perimeter defence. We\\'re inside Capitol airspace. \\nTo make themselves feel better, my patrons would make presents of money or jewellery. But I found a much more \\nvaluable form of payment. \\nSecrets. \\nGear up. \\nSwitching to Night View. \\nThere. \\nCommand, we have visual \\non the Tribute Centre. \\nInitiating final approach. \\nMasks on. \\nSee, I know all the depravity, \\nthe deceit and the cruelty \\nof the Capitol\\'s pampered elite. But the biggest secrets are about \\nPage 33/40\\nour good President, Coriolanus Snow. Open the door. \\nCommand, this is Team Leader. \\nPrepare to deploy gas. \\nWe will confirm once inside. \\nSuch a young man when he rose to power. Such a clever one to keep it. \\nHow, you may ask, did he do it? One word. \\nPoison. \\nGet ready to drop. \\nHe stopped every mutiny \\nbefore it even started. \\nClear. \\nClear. Command, we\\'re inside. \\nHeading toward target number one. Cell P45 lower level 2C. \\nGas. \\nThere are so many mysterious deaths to adversaries. \\nEven to allies who were threats. Snow would drink from the same cup, to deflect suspicion. \\nBut antidotes don\\'t always work, which is why he wears roses \\nthat reek of perfume. \\nHelp cover the scent of blood from sores in his mouth that will never heal. Gale. \\nBut he can\\'t hide the scent of who he really is. He kills without mercy. He rules with deception and fear. His weapon of choice \\nis the only thing suited to such a man. Poison. The perfect weapon for a snake. What is this place? \\n- Beetee? \\n- I\\'m losing them. \\nPowering back up. \\nMa\\'am, the Capitol air defence system is rebooting. It\\'s coming back online. Must be diverting power \\nfrom another source. \\nAnd filtering transmissions. \\nPage 34/40\\nAnother 60 seconds and we\\'ll be cut off. Madam President, should we \\ncall back the hovercraft? \\nBroadcast me. \\nIf Snow\\'s watching this, maybe he\\'ll let the signal in, if he sees me. Put me on the air so he can see me. - Yes. Yes. \\n- Put her on. \\nCan we do this? Can we still get in? Yes. For the moment. The line\\'s open. He will only see you. \\nOkay, Katniss, go. \\nPresident Snow? \\nPresident Snow. It\\'s Katniss. \\n- There\\'s no guarantee he\\'s even watching. - President Snow? \\n- I know, but he might be. \\n- President Snow, I need to speak with you. Are you there? \\nPresident Snow, it\\'s Katniss. \\nCan you hear me? \\nI need to speak with you. \\nPresident Snow, it\\'s Katniss. \\nPresident Snow, are you there? \\nCan you hear me? \\n- President Snow... \\n- Miss Everdeen. What an honour. \\nI don\\'t imagine you\\'re calling \\nto thank me for the roses. \\nI never asked for this. \\nI never asked to be in the Games. - Boggs? Come in. Boggs? \\n- I never asked to be The Mockingjay. Just wanted to save my sister. \\nAnd keep Peeta alive. \\nCome in. Boggs? \\nPlease, just let him go. \\nAnd I will stop being The Mockingjay. I will disappear. You will never \\nhave to see me ever again. \\nMiss Everdeen. \\n- Boggs, come in. \\n- You couldn\\'t run from this... \\nPage 35/40\\nany more than you could have \\nrun from the Games. \\n- Command, I need a situation report. - Boggs, we\\'re running out of time. Hurry. Let\\'s move. \\nPlease. \\nYou\\'ve won. \\nYou\\'ve already beaten me. \\nRelease Peeta. And take me instead. We\\'re long past the opportunity \\nfor noble sacrifice. \\nThen tell me what to do. \\nI\\'ve always kept my promises, haven\\'t I? You said you didn\\'t want a war. \\nAnd that\\'s just what\\'s happened. I told you what a fragile \\nthing peace was. \\nAnd still, like a child, \\nyou took pleasure in breaking it. I know what you are. \\nI know you can\\'t see \\npast your narrowest concerns. \\nBut please, Miss Everdeen. \\nI doubt you know \\nwhat honesty is anymore. \\nCommand, we\\'re at the first target. Preparing to extract Peeta. \\nWill confirm when he\\'s in hand. \\nMockingjay One, \\nprepare hovercraft for evac. \\nYou asked me to convince you \\nthat I was in love with Peeta. \\nHaven\\'t I at least done that? \\nMiss Everdeen, \\nit\\'s the things we love most \\nthat destroy us. \\nI want you to remember \\nthat I said that. \\nDon\\'t you think I know your friends are in the Tribute Centre? \\nCut them off. \\n- Boggs, come in. \\n- What happened? \\nBoggs, come in. Do you read me? \\nPage 36/40\\n- He knows that they\\'re in there. It\\'s a trap. - Katniss, hold it. \\nWe have to get a hold of them. \\nWe have to tell them to get out. He knows. There\\'s no signal. \\nWe can\\'t contact them. \\nNo. Haymitch, he knew the whole time. He was taunting me. \\n- No, Haymitch. They\\'re in there. \\n- No, we don\\'t know that. \\nDid I lose them both tonight? \\nDid I lose them both tonight? \\nDid I lose them both tonight? \\nDid I lose them? I lost them both. \\nNo! No! \\nThere\\'s no news. \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nIt\\'s the worst torture in the world. Waiting, when you know \\nthere\\'s nothing you can do. \\nEspecially for people like us. \\nBut whatever \\nstrength, courage, \\nmadness, \\nkeeps us going, you find it, \\nat times like these. \\nYou have it, soldier. \\nIt\\'s what\\'s kept you \\nalive all this time. \\nAnd it won\\'t fail you now. \\nThey\\'re back. \\nI don\\'t want that. \\nJohanna. \\nFinnick! \\nFinnick! \\nAnnie? Annie! Annie! \\nYou\\'re safe. You\\'re safe. \\nGale! \\nAre you okay? \\nWhat? What is it? \\nI don\\'t get it. Every gun was back online and on us and we flew right past them. They let us go. \\nHe\\'s in there. \\nPage 37/40\\nThe gas we used on the guards knocked him out, too, but it\\'s wearing off now. You should be there when he wakes up. Thank you. \\nThank you. \\nPeeta. \\nPeeta! \\nPeeta! Get off! Get off of her! Let go! \\nNo, Katniss. \\nNo, you\\'re swollen. Don\\'t touch. No, no, no. Calm down. \\nCalm down. You\\'re okay. \\nTell her she\\'s awake. \\n- Pee... \\n- Don\\'t try to talk. \\nPeeta\\'s okay. I promise. \\nI just had to get him off you. \\nIt\\'s called hijacking. \\nWe don\\'t know how long the Capitol\\'s been doing this to Peeta. \\nIt\\'s fear conditioning. \\nEnhanced with tracker jacker venom. You were stung your first Games. Remember? \\nThe venom puts the subject \\nin a dissociative state. \\nAnd they torture him. \\nWith shocks and beatings, \\nand strip down his identity. \\nAnd then all of that suffering \\nand fear is redirected. \\nAssociated with other memories \\nor a person. \\nThey can change his memories of Katniss? To make her seem life-threatening. They turned him into a weapon, Katniss. To kill you. \\nBut you can reverse it? \\nThe fear is the most difficult \\nthing to overcome. \\nWe\\'re hardwired to remember fear best. It\\'s new terrain. \\nBut we\\'ve put together a team. \\nPage 38/40\\nI\\'m optimistic. \\nGood evening. \\nYesterday, I authorized a covert rescue mission inside the Capitol. I am pleased to announce \\nthat the Victors have been liberated! Let this day mark an historic change. With The Mockingjay \\nand the Victors beside us, \\nwe have sent a clear message \\nto the Capitol. \\nThat we will never again \\nendure injustice. \\nToday, a day on which \\nwe reunited family, \\nfriends, and loved ones. \\nLet all of Panem come together. Not to battle for the amusement of the Capitol. \\nBut to join hands in this fight. Let today be the day we promise never to give up, \\nnever to give in \\nuntil we have made a new Panem, where leaders are elected, \\nnot imposed upon us. \\nAnd where the districts are free to share the fruits of their labours and not fight one another for scraps! This new Panem is on the horizon. But we must take it for ourselves. The road there leads through \\nthe sharp mountains \\nand deep ravines of District 2. There in the heart of Panem\\'s \\nsteepest mountain range \\nlies the Capitol\\'s principal \\nmilitary facility. \\nWe can conquer this stronghold because we are one people, \\none army, one voice. \\nBecause today is our new beginning. Today we have freed the Victors. Tomorrow, Panem! \\nPage 39/40\\nHoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah! \\nPage 40/40\\n\\n\\n\\nScripts.com \\nMaleficent By Linda Woolverton \\nPage 1/21\\n1 \\nLet us tell an old story anew, and we will see how well you know it. Once upon a time, \\nthere were two kingdoms \\nthat were the worst of neighbors. So vast was the discord between them that it was said only a great hero or a terrible villain \\nmight bring them together. \\nIn one kingdom \\nlived folk like you and me, \\nwith a vain and greedy king \\nto rule over them. \\nThey were forever discontent, \\nand envious of the wealth \\nand beauty of their neighbors. For in the other kingdom, the Moors, lived every manner of strange \\nand wonderful creature. \\nAnd they needed \\nneither king nor queen, \\nbut trusted in one another. \\nIn a great tree \\non a great cliff in the Moors \\nlived one such spirit. \\nYou might take her for a girl, but she was not just any girl. She was a fairy. \\nThere you go. \\nAnd her name \\nwas Maleficent. \\nGood morning, Mr. Chanterelle! I love your cap! \\nNo. No, don\\'t do it! \\nYou missed me! \\n- Good morning. \\n- Good morning. \\nLovely work, girls! \\nWhat\\'s all the fuss about? \\nThe border guards have discov... Why do you get to tell her? \\nI want to tell her! \\nI want to! \\nPage 2/21\\nThere are rules, Flittle. \\nI tell this time, you tell next time. No, you told last time, \\nso I should tell this time, \\nand Thistlewit next time. \\nTell me what? \\nFine! \\nThank you. \\nMaleficent, the border guard... The border guards have found \\na human thief at the pool of jewels. I\\'m sorry. \\nShe\\'s always in a hurry, \\nwith her big wings. \\nHumans, here. \\nI hope there\\'s not another war. I\\'m not afraid. \\nBesides, \\nI have never seen a human up close. Come out! \\nNo. They mean to kill me. \\nAnd besides, they\\'re hideous to look at. That\\'s extremely rude. \\nDon\\'t listen to him, Balthazar. You\\'re classically handsome. \\nIt\\'s not right to steal, \\nbut we don\\'t kill people for it. Come out. \\nCome out this instant! \\nAre you fully grown? \\nNo. \\nI believe he\\'s just a boy. \\nAnd you\\'re just a girl. \\nI think. \\nWho are you? \\nI\\'m called Stefan. \\nWho are you? \\nI\\'m Maleficent. \\nYes, right. \\nYou have to give it back. \\nGive what back? \\nIf I knew you would throw it away, I would have kept it. \\nI didn\\'t throw it away. \\nPage 3/21\\nI delivered it home, \\nas I\\'m going to do for you. \\nSomeday, you know, I\\'ll live there. In the castle. \\nWhere do you live now? \\nIn a barn. \\nSo your parents are farmers, then? My parents are dead. \\nMine, too. \\nWe\\'ll see each other again. \\nYou really shouldn\\'t \\ncome back here, you know. \\nIt\\'s not safe. \\nAnd if I made that choice, \\nif I came back, would you be here? Perhaps. \\n- What\\'s wrong? \\n- Your ring. \\nIron burns fairies. \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nI like your wings. \\nMaleficent thought of how \\nStefan cast away his ring, \\nhe who had so little in the world, so that their hands might touch again, and her heart was moved. \\nThus did the young thief \\nwho had hoped to steal a jewel... Maleficent! \\n...steal something far more precious. Maleficent? \\nMaleficent! \\nAfter all these weeks, \\nlook who came back. \\nI thought it worth the risk. \\nSo, what do you do for fun? \\nStefan and Maleficent became \\nthe most unlikely of friends. \\nAnd for a time it seemed as if, in them at least, \\nthe old hatred between men and fairies had been forgotten. \\nAs it will, friendship slowly \\nturned into something else. \\nPage 4/21\\nAnd on her 16th birthday, \\nStefan gave Maleficent a gift. He told her it was true love\\'s kiss. But it was not to be. \\nAs the years passed, Stefan\\'s ambition pulled him away from Maleficent, and towards the temptations \\nof the human kingdom. \\nWhile Maleficent, \\nthe strongest of the fairies, \\nrose to become \\nthe protector of the Moors. \\nMaleficent often wandered alone and sometimes wondered \\nwhere Stefan might be, \\nfor she had never understood \\nthe greed and envy of men. \\nBut she was to learn. \\nFor the human king had heard \\nof a growing power in the Moors, and he sought to strike it down. Guard, halt! \\nGuard, halt! \\nThere they are, \\nthe mysterious Moors \\nwhere no one dares to venture \\nfor fear of the magical creatures that lurk within. \\nWell, I say crush them! \\nGo no further! \\nA king \\ndoes not take orders from a winged elf. You are no king to me. \\n- Bring me her head. \\n- Battalion! \\nAdvance! \\nArise and stand with me! \\nHold the line! \\n- It\\'s the dark creatures! \\n- It\\'s the dark creatures! \\nCharge! \\nYou! \\nTo the king! \\nYou will not have the Moors! \\nPage 5/21\\nNot now, nor ever! \\nYou... \\nWhen I ascended to the throne, I promised the people \\none day we would take \\nthe Moors and its treasures. \\nEach of you \\nswore allegiance to me \\nand to that cause. \\nYour Majesty. \\nDefeated in battle. \\nIs this to be my legacy? \\nI see you waiting for me to die. It won\\'t be long. But what then? I will choose a successor \\nto take the throne \\nand care for my daughter. \\nWho among you \\nis worthy? \\nKill the winged creature. \\nAvenge me, \\nand upon my death \\nyou will take the crown. \\nMaleficent. \\nMaleficent! \\nSo, how is life with the humans? Maleficent, I\\'ve come to warn you. They mean to kill you. \\nKing Henry will stop at nothing. Please, you have to trust me. \\nThey spoke of many things, \\nand the years faded away. \\nAnd she forgave Stefan \\nhis folly and his ambition, \\nand all was as it had been long ago. You thirsty? \\nMaleficent? \\nWhat is this? \\nI have avenged you, sire. \\nShe is vanquished? \\nYou have done well, my son. \\nYou have done \\nwhat others feared to do. \\nYou will be rewarded. \\nPage 6/21\\nI shall do my best \\nto be a worthy successor, \\nYour Majesty. \\nI\\'ve got you! \\n- You wicked bird! \\n- lnto a man. \\nIt\\'s a... \\nIt\\'s a demon! \\nWhat have you done \\nto my beautiful self? \\nWould you \\nrather I let them beat you to death? I\\'m not certain. \\nStop complaining. \\nI saved your life. \\nForgive me. \\nWhat do I call you? \\nDiaval. \\nAnd in return for saving my life, I am your servant. \\nWhatever you need. \\nWings. \\nI need you to be my wings. \\nI present to you the first of his line, His Royal Highness King Stefan. He did this to me so he would be king. Now what, Mistress? \\nHer wings! \\nIt\\'s a girl! \\nIt\\'s a girl! It\\'s a girl! \\nWell? \\nWell, I saw nothing. \\nBut there\\'s been a... \\nWhat? \\nChild. \\nKing Stefan and the Queen \\nhave had a child. \\nThere will be a christening. \\nThey say it\\'s to be a grand celebration. A grand celebration for a baby. How wonderful. \\nAll manner of folk \\ncame to the christening, \\neven a trio of fairies who sought Page 7/21\\nto foster peace and goodwill. \\nLook, there\\'s the baby! \\nI love babies! \\nCan you just concentrate, please? I\\'m not telling you again. \\nGreetings, Your Majesty. \\nI am Knotgrass \\nof the Moorland Fair Folk. \\nI\\'m Flittle, Your Kingship. \\nAnd I\\'m Thistlewit, Your Royalnesses. They bring gifts for our daughter. These are not just any old gifts, for, you see, we\\'re magic! \\nAnd very good with children. \\nVery well. \\nSweet Aurora, I wish for you \\nthe gift of beauty. \\nMy wish is that you will never be blue, only happy, all the days of your life. Sweet baby, \\nmy wish for you is that you find... - Maleficent! \\n- Maleficent! \\nWell, well. \\nWhat a glittering assemblage, \\nKing Stefan. \\nRoyalty, nobility, the gentry, and... How quaint. \\nEven the rabble. \\nI must say \\nI really felt quite distressed \\nat not receiving an invitation. You\\'re not welcome here. \\nOh, dear. \\nWhat an awkward situation. \\nYou\\'re not offended? \\nWhy, no. \\nAnd to show I bear no ill will, I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child. No! We don\\'t want your gift! \\nStay away from the princess! \\nYes, stay away! \\nListen well, all of you. \\nListen well, all of you. \\nPage 8/21\\nThe princess shall indeed \\ngrow in grace and beauty, \\nbeloved by all who meet her. \\nThat\\'s a lovely gift. \\nDon\\'t do this. \\nBut \\nbefore the sun sets \\non her 16th birthday, \\nshe will prick her finger \\non the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a sleep like death, a sleep from which \\nshe will never awaken. \\nMaleficent, please don\\'t do this, I\\'m begging you. \\nI like you begging. \\nDo it again. \\nI beg you. \\nAll right. \\nThe princess can be woken \\nfrom her death sleep, \\nbut only by \\ntrue love\\'s kiss. \\nThis curse will last till the end of time! No power on Earth can change it. King Stefan ordered his men \\nto seize every spinning wheel \\nin the kingdom. \\nThe wheels were broken and burned, that they might never be used, \\nand thrown into the deepest dungeon in the castle. \\nSecretly, he entrusted \\nthe safety of the child \\nto the magic of the pixies, \\nwho would take her to a remote \\nhideaway for 16 years and a day. Stefan shut himself behind \\nthe walls of his castle \\nwhile his soldiers rode far and wide to hunt Maleficent down. \\nBut she made walls of her own, \\nthat the Moors might \\nnever again suffer the touch \\nPage 9/21\\nof any human. \\nAnd she reveled in the sorrow \\nthat her curse had brought. \\nThe fairies began their charge \\nto raise Aurora in a snug little cottage in the woods. \\nNo! Is this it? \\nLooks dreadful. \\nCome on. \\nWe need a smaller... \\nBaby \\nOr bigger bodies. \\nNo, what we need is a proper disguise. What do you mean? \\nWell, we have to blend in, don\\'t we? We have to be big enough \\nto look after this baby. \\nSo, gather around, ladies. \\nGet ready. One, two, three, grow! That\\'s worked quite well. \\nThat\\'s very nice. \\nNow, there will be no questions asked. We are no longer fairies. \\nWe are three peasant women \\nraising our orphan child in the woods. - Yes. \\n- So, no more flying. \\n- No flying? \\n- No, no, and no magic. \\n- No magic? \\n- Yes, you heard. \\nIt\\'s in the middle of nowhere. \\nAt least no one will find us here. There you are. \\nWhy are you always hiding? \\nCome on. There you go. \\nIt\\'s so ugly, you could \\nalmost feel sorry for it. \\nI hate you. Beasty. \\nThe fairies were \\nperhaps unequal to their task. \\nWhy is she crying? \\nI think she might be hungry. \\nThen feed her! \\nPage 10/21\\nThere you are. \\nThere you go. \\nIt\\'s going to starve \\nwith those three looking after it. It tickles. \\n- What? \\n- You\\'re cheating. \\nI saw that! \\n- We\\'re starting again. \\n- Suit yourself. \\nGreedy, bloated goat! \\n\"Bloated goat.\" \\nStop doing that. \\nI\\'m not doing anything. \\nWell, someone is. \\nIt\\'s not me. \\nYou two are having a go at me, and I will not tolerate... \\nStop it! \\nWhy... \\nNo! \\nThis is all your fault! \\nCome on. That\\'s funny. \\nAs the days went on, Stefan darkened, further consumed \\nby paranoia and vengeance. \\n- Burn it all down! \\n- Yes, sir! \\nFlame! \\nRelease! \\nRun! \\nYou failed me. \\nThe wall cannot be burned. \\nIt is indestructible. \\nNothing is indestructible! \\nNot the wall! Not Maleficent! \\nNot even her curse! \\nBring me the iron workers. \\nYou! \\nLook. \\nThe little beast is about \\nto fall off the cliff. \\nWhat? \\nHello. \\nPage 11/21\\nGo away. \\nGo. \\nGo away. \\nI don\\'t like children. \\nUp, UP \\nGo along. Go, go, go. \\nAs Maleficent had said, \\nAurora did grow in grace and beauty. Pretty bird. \\nFar away from the lofty palace that she remembered not. \\nAnd as the seasons changed \\nand the flowers grew, \\nso did she. \\nHello. \\nThat\\'s it. \\nThere you go. \\nShe wondered at the world about her, and at what lay beyond \\nthe fearsome wall of thorns. \\nCurious little beasty. \\nBut she was not the only one \\nwho wished to get through. \\nLook. \\n- Is that her? Is that Maleficent? - I don\\'t know. \\nBring them to me. \\nNo, it\\'s just a silly peasant girl. Steady. \\n- It\\'s her! \\n- It\\'s her! \\nHow could you do that to me? \\nYou said anything I need. \\nYeah, but not a dog. \\nIt was a wolf, not a dog. \\nIt\\'s the same thing. \\nThey\\'re dirty, vicious, \\nand they hunt birds. \\nFine. Next time I\\'ll turn you \\ninto a mealy worm. \\nWell, I\\'ll be a mealy worm, gladly. Anything but a filthy, stinking... I wonder. \\nI know you\\'re there. \\nPage 12/21\\nDon\\'t be afraid. \\nI am not afraid. \\nThen come out. \\nThen you\\'ll be afraid. \\nNo, I won\\'t. \\nI know who you are. \\nDo you? \\nYou\\'re my Fairy Godmother. \\nWhat? \\nFairy Godmother. \\nYou\\'ve been watching over me \\nmy whole life. \\nI\\'ve always known you were close by. How? \\nYour shadow. It\\'s been following me ever since I was small. \\nWherever I went, \\nyour shadow was always with me. I remember you. \\nPretty bird. \\nThis is Diaval. \\nHello, Aurora. \\nI have known you \\nsince you were a little one. \\nIt\\'s everything I imagined it would be. It\\'s just so beautiful! \\nI\\'ve always wanted to come... \\nGood night, beasty. \\nYou mock me. \\nI know what you\\'re doing. \\nI know exactly what you\\'re doing. Sire? \\nYour presence has been \\nrequested by the Queen. \\nLeave me. \\nSire, she is not well. \\nThe nurses are fearful \\nthat she won\\'t make it through the night. Can you not see \\nwe\\'re having a conversation? \\nWhen the curse fails, \\nMaleficent will come for me. \\nAnd on that day, I will be ready. They\\'re so beautiful. \\nPage 13/21\\nI revoke the curse. \\nLet it be no more. \\nI revoke the curse. \\nLet it be no more. \\nI revoke my curse! \\nLet it be no more! \\nI revoke my curse! \\nLet it be no more! \\nLet it be no more! \\nThis curse will last till the end of time. No power on Earth can change it. Do all the Fair People have wings? Most do. \\nThen why don\\'t you? \\nAll the other fairies fly. \\nI had wings once. \\nThey were stolen from me. \\nThat\\'s all I wish to say about it. What color were they? \\nWere they big? \\nSo big \\nthey dragged behind me when I walked. And they were strong. \\nThey could carry me above the clouds and into the headwinds. \\nAnd they never faltered, not even once. I could trust them. \\nShe\\'s coming. She\\'s coming. \\nWhere are your workers? \\nIn their beds, Majesty. \\nGet them back to work without delay. They\\'re exhausted, sire. \\nBut I\\'ll have them \\nback to work at first light. \\nI need them back to work now. \\nIt\\'s the wee hours. \\nAye. \\nAye. \\nIt is the wee hours. \\nSo wake them up. \\nSire? \\nSo wake them up, \\nand get them back to work now! \\nWe\\'re running out of time! Go, now! Page 14/21\\nAurora? \\nCome here. \\nSit. \\nThere\\'s something I need to tell you. What is it? \\nThere is an evil in this world, \\nand I cannot keep you from it. \\nI\\'m almost 16, Godmother. \\nI can take care of myself. \\nI understand. \\n- But that\\'s not what I have to tell you. - I have a plan. \\nWhen I\\'m older, \\nI\\'m going to live here \\nin the Moors with you. \\nThen we can look after each other. You don\\'t have to wait until you\\'re older. You could live here now. \\nThen I Will. \\nI\\'ll sleep in a tree \\nand eat berries and black nuts \\nand all the Fair People \\nwill be my friends. \\nI\\'ll be happy here for the rest of my life. I\\'m going to tell my aunties tomorrow. Until tomorrow. \\nI\\'m so excited! \\nAunties, I\\'m almost 16. \\nI need a life of my own. \\nNo. I love you very much, \\nbut it\\'s time to say goodbye. \\nYou\\'ve been very good to me, \\nexcept the time \\nyou accidentally fed me spiders. \\nHello. \\nI\\'m sorry to bother you, \\nbut I\\'m on my way \\nto King Stefan\\'s castle \\nand I\\'ve become hopelessly lost. \\nCan you help me? \\nI\\'m sorry. That was my fault. \\nI rushed in too... \\nForgive me. \\nIt\\'s that way. \\nPage 15/21\\nThe castle. \\nWhat\\'s your name? \\nIt\\'s Philip. \\nHello, Philip. \\nWhat\\'s yours? \\nAurora. \\nHello, Aurora. \\nWell, it was nice meeting you. And once again, my apologies \\nfor being such a clumsy fool. \\nYou\\'re forgiven. \\nThat\\'s good. \\nI\\'d best be off, then. \\nGood bye. \\nWill you be back this way? \\nNothing could stop me. \\nThen I\\'ll see you soon. \\nVery soon. \\n- Goodbye, Philip. \\n- Goodbye, for now. \\nStop doing that. \\nWell? \\nThat boy\\'s the answer. \\n- No, Diaval. \\n- Yes! \\nTrue love\\'s kiss, remember? \\nIt can break the spell. \\nTrue love\\'s kiss? \\nHave you not worked it out yet? I cursed her that way \\nbecause there is no such thing. Well, that might be how you feel, but what about Aurora? \\nThat boy could be her only chance. It\\'s her fate, anyway. \\nGo ahead. \\nTurn me into whatever you want. A bird, a worm. \\nI don\\'t care anymore. \\nI\\'m so happy we\\'re leaving tomorrow. We are not leaving tomorrow. \\nTomorrow is Aurora\\'s 16th birthday. And Stefan told us to take her back the day after her birthday. \\nPage 16/21\\nNo. He said on her birthday. \\nNo. The day after her birthday. \\n- On. \\n- After. \\n- On. \\n- After. \\n- On, on, on! \\n- After, after, after! \\nStop it! \\nWhat? \\nHow could you? \\nI need to talk to you about something. Yes, sweetie, what is it? \\nI\\'m sorry to have to tell you this, but I\\'ll be 16 tomorrow. \\nYes. \\nI\\'m leaving home. \\nSee here, young lady. \\nI did not spend 16 years \\nin this miserable hovel \\nwith these two imbeciles... \\nSo that you could ruin it on the last day. We are taking you back \\nto your father with... \\nMy father? \\nYou told me my parents were dead. I think you better come and sit down. Fairy Godmother! \\nI\\'m here. \\nWhen were you going to tell me \\nthat I\\'m cursed? \\nIs it true? \\nIt is. \\nMy aunts said it was an evil fairy. I... I can\\'t remember her name. \\nThey said \\nit was... \\nMaleficent. \\nIs that you? \\nAre you Maleficent? \\nNo! \\nDon\\'t touch me. \\nYou\\'re the evil that\\'s in the world. It\\'s you! \\nPage 17/21\\nFind the boy! \\nI need every available man \\non the east wing now. \\nThere should be no guards at the gate. I want her to walk right in. \\nSorry to disturb, Your Majesty. We found this urchin at the gate. She claims to be the princess. Father. \\nIt\\'s me, Aurora! \\nYou look just like your mother. They brought you back a day too soon. I told those three idiots! \\nLock her up in her room. \\nGo. \\nPrepare the men. Maleficent\\'s coming. It\\'s so good to be small again! Look at my feet! \\nI love my tiny little feet! \\nPay attention! We have to find Aurora, or the king will have our heads! Aurora. \\nWait! \\nPrincess? \\nI\\'m looking for a girl. \\nOf course you are. \\nI need a horse. \\n...into a sleep like death. \\nAurora. \\nCome on, Diaval! \\nAurora. \\nFaster, Diaval, faster! \\nShe will prick her finger \\non the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a sleep like death. No power on Earth... \\nA sleep like death. \\nIt\\'s done. \\nThey pulled the guards. \\nHe\\'s waiting for you in there. If we go inside those walls, \\nwe\\'ll never come out alive. \\nThen don\\'t come. It\\'s not your fight. Thank you very much. \\nPage 18/21\\n\"I need you, Diaval. \\nI can\\'t do this without you, Diaval.\" I can hear you. \\nLook at her. \\nLook at what you\\'ve done. \\nShe\\'s only sleeping. \\nShe\\'s only sleeping, you say? \\nShe\\'s only sleeping. \\nShe\\'s only sleeping forever! \\n- What about the kiss? \\n- Yes! True love\\'s kiss! \\nTrue love does not exist. \\nBut it\\'s her only chance, Your Majesty. Mistress. \\nWhat are we going to do? \\nWe can\\'t give up, can we? \\nCome on, girls. \\nBut we don\\'t even know where to start. True love doesn\\'t just fall \\nfrom trees, you know. \\nPardon me. \\nI\\'m embarrassed to say \\nI don\\'t know where I am. \\nIn King Stefan\\'s castle. \\nThis is where I\\'m meant to be. Odd that I can\\'t recall how I got here. Why have you come? \\nMy father sent me to see the King. Who is your father? \\nKing John of Ulstead. \\nA Prince! \\nAurora. \\nHe knows her. \\nWhy is she sleeping? \\nShe\\'s trapped in an enchantment. Isn\\'t she beautiful? \\nThe most beautiful girl I\\'ve ever seen. Do you want to kiss her? \\nVery much. \\nGo on, then. \\nI wouldn\\'t feel right about it. I barely know her. We\\'ve only met once. Haven\\'t you ever heard \\nof love at first sight? \\nPage 19/21\\nKiss her! \\nGo on. \\nAn enchantment, you say? \\nKiss her! \\nYou didn\\'t do it properly! \\nIt\\'s supposed to be true love\\'s kiss! I was certain he was the one. \\n- What are you doing? \\n- We have to keep looking. \\nI told you. \\nI will not ask your forgiveness because what I have done to you is unforgivable. \\nI was so lost \\nin hatred and revenge. \\nSweet Aurora, \\nyou stole what was left of my heart. And now I have lost you forever. I swear, no harm will come to you as long as I live. \\nAnd not a day shall pass \\nthat I don\\'t miss your smile. \\nHello, Godmother. \\nHello, beasty. \\nNo truer love. \\nShe\\'s here, sire. \\nAre we going back to the Moors now? If that is what you wish. \\nWe\\'ve got her! \\n- Stop! \\n- Get back! \\nNo! \\nInto a dragon. \\nTo the other side. \\nRun, Aurora! \\nGet back! Hold it steady! \\nPull to the left! Pull! \\nHold the line! \\nLook out. Hold your line. \\n- Close in. \\n- Bring it down! \\nEnough! \\nHow does it feel? \\nTo be a fairy creature without wings Page 20/21\\nin a world where you don\\'t belong? Kill her! \\nKill her! \\nShoot! \\nShoot her! \\nTake aim! \\nIt\\'s over. \\nMaleficent brought down \\nher wall of thorns \\nand took off her crown. \\nAnd she invited Aurora to see \\nhow the Moors had been once, \\nlong ago, when Maleficent \\nwas but a child \\nand her heart was bright. \\nFor now, it was again. \\nBut that was not all. \\nThere she is. Hurry up. They\\'re waiting. Wait for me! \\nWe present this crown \\nto our little Aurora, \\nfor whom we have sacrificed \\nthe best years of our... \\nNever mind. \\nOur kingdoms have been unified. You have your queen. \\nSo you see, \\nthe story is not quite as you were told, and I should know, \\nfor I was the one \\nthey called Sleeping Beauty. \\nIn the end, my kingdom was united not by a hero or a villain, \\nas legend had predicted, \\nbut by one who was \\nboth hero and villain. \\nAnd her name was Maleficent. \\nPage 21/21\\n\\n\\n\\nScripts.com \\nThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies \\nBy Fran Walsh \\nPage 1/39\\nI warned you. \\nDid I not warn you what would come of dealing with Dwarves? \\nNow they\\'ve done it. \\nThey\\'ve woken the dragon! \\nThey\\'ve brought an apocalypse \\nupon our heads! \\nCome on. Quickly. \\nQuickly. \\nFaster now... \\n...I\\'m trying to evacuate. \\nCareful, man. \\nNever mind the books. Get on! \\nBut, sire, should \\nwe not try to save the town? \\nThe town is lost. \\n- Save the gold! \\n- You heard him. Get a move on. - Da! \\n- Come on. \\nPile them up! \\nWe have no time. We must leave. - Get him up. \\n- Come on. \\n- Come on. Let\\'s go. \\n- I\\'m fine. I can walk. \\n- Fast as you can. \\n- We\\'re not leaving. \\nNot without our father. \\nIf you stay here, your sisters will die. Is that what your father would want? Open... \\n...this door! \\nDo you hear me? \\nI can see him! \\nLook! \\nDown here! Now! \\n- Give me your hand. \\n- We gotta go. \\nQuickly now. Hurry. \\nKili, come on! \\n- It\\'s around the corner! \\n- Keep on going, man! \\nDragon! \\nPage 2/39\\nCome on, come on! \\nFaster! Faster! \\nIf only we could take... \\n...more of these people with us, but they\\'re hardly... \\n- Worth it. I quite agree. \\n- Help! \\nHelp! \\nLook out! \\nMove it! \\nMove it! \\nCome on! Faster! \\nMy gold! My gold! \\nWe\\'re carrying too much. \\nWe need to dump something. \\nQuite right... \\n...Alfrid. \\nFaster! Faster! \\nPoor souls. \\nDa. \\nDa! \\nHe hit it! \\n- He hit the dragon! He did! \\n- No. \\nHe hit his mark! I saw. \\nHis arrows cannot pierce its hide. I fear nothing will. \\nWhat are you doing? \\n- Come back! Bain! \\n- Bain! \\nBain! \\nGet back here! \\n- Bain! \\n- Leave him. \\nWe cannot go back. \\nBain! \\nDad. \\nBain! What are you doing? \\nYou were supposed to leave! \\n- I came to help you. \\n- No! \\nNothing can stop it now. \\nThis might. \\nBain. \\nPage 3/39\\nYou go back. \\nYou get out of here. Now. \\nDad! \\nBain! \\nStop, stop! Halt! \\nHalt! \\nWho are you... \\n...that would stand... \\n...against me? \\nNow, that is a pity. \\nWhat will you do now... \\n...Bowman? \\nYou are... \\n...forsaken. \\nNo help will come. \\nNow\\'s our chance! Go! \\nGo! \\nHead for the open water! \\nHmm. \\nIs that... \\n...your child? \\nYou cannot... \\n...save him from the fire. \\nHe will... \\n...burn! \\nStay still, son. \\nStay still. \\nTell me... \\n...wretch... \\n...how now shall you challenge me? You have nothing left... \\n...but your... \\n...death! \\nBain. \\nLook at me. \\nYou look at me. \\nLittle to your left. \\nThat\\'s it. \\nBain! Hold on! \\nWhat was that? \\nWhat happened? \\nIt fell. I saw it. \\nIt\\'s dead. \\nSmaug is dead. \\nPage 4/39\\nBy my beard... \\n...I think he\\'s right. \\nLook there! \\nThe Ravens of Erebor \\nare returning to the Mountain. \\nAye. \\nWord will spread. \\nBefore long... \\n...every soul in Middle-earth will know... ...the dragon is dead! \\nYou are not... \\n...alone... \\n...Mithrandir. \\nHelp me! \\nWhere\\'s my baby? \\nPlease! \\nSomebody help me! \\nHelp! \\nOver there! \\nDa! \\nDa! \\n- Da! \\n- Da! \\nAah! Why me? \\nTauriel. \\nKili! \\nCome on. \\nWe\\'re leaving! \\nThey are your people. You must go. Come with me. \\nI know how I feel. I\\'m not afraid. You make me feel alive. \\nI can\\'t. \\nTauriel. \\nI don\\'t know what that means. \\nI think you do. \\nOne more! \\nKeep it. \\nAs a promise. \\nThese are dry. You\\'ll need them. - Thank you. \\n- Here. \\nOi! Give me one of them. \\nI\\'ll catch my death... \\nPage 5/39\\n...in this cold. \\nFind your own! \\nYou\\'re not in charge, \\nAlfrid Lickspittle. \\nYou are wrong. \\nIn the absence of the Master... \\n...the power cedes to his deputy... ...which in this instance is my good self. Now give me that blanket! \\nMaster\\'s deputy? \\nDon\\'t make me laugh. \\nYou\\'re a sneak-thief. \\nI\\'ll be dead before... \\n...I answer to you. \\nMaybe that can be arranged. \\nI wouldn\\'t go turning on your own, Alfrid. Not now. \\n- Da! \\n- Come here! \\nYou\\'re alive. \\nIt\\'s all right, darling. \\nIt was Bard! He killed the dragon! I saw it with me own eyes. \\nHe brought the beast down! \\nShot him dead... \\n...with a Black Arrow. \\nThank you, Bard! \\n- Good man. \\n- Thank you! \\nYou\\'ve saved us all! \\nBless you. \\nAll hail to the Dragon-Slayer! \\nAll hail... \\n...King Bard! \\nI have said it many times. \\nThis is a man of noble stock. \\n- A born leader! \\n- Do not call me that. \\nI\\'m not Master... \\n...of this town. \\nWhere is he? \\n- Where\\'s the Master? \\n- Halfway down the Anduin. \\nWith all our coin, I don\\'t doubt. Page 6/39\\nYou would know. \\nYou helped him empty... \\n- ...the treasury. \\n- No. \\nI tried to stop him. \\n- Liar! \\n- Cheat! \\nYou\\'re a mongrel! \\nI begged. I pleaded. \\nAway with him! \\n- Tar him! \\n- I said, \"Master... \\n...no! \\nThink of the children.\" \\nHang him! \\n\"Will nobody think of the children?\" Ow! \\nTo the tree with him! \\n- Hang him hard! \\n- Take him down! \\nEnough! Let him go! \\nLet him go! \\nLook around you! \\nHave you not... \\n...had your fill of death? \\nWinter is upon us. \\nWe must look to our own. \\nTo the sick and the helpless. \\nThose who can stand, \\ntend to the wounded. \\nThose who have strength, follow me. We must salvage what we can. \\nWhat then? What\\'ll we do then? We find shelter. \\nHello! \\nBombur? \\nBifur? \\nAnybody? \\nWait! \\nWait! \\n- It\\'s Bilbo! \\n- He\\'s alive! \\nStop! Stop! \\nStop. \\nPage 7/39\\nYou need to leave. \\nWe all need to leave. \\nWe only just got here. \\nI\\'ve tried talking, but he won\\'t listen. - What do you mean, laddie? \\n- Thorin! \\nThorin. Thorin. \\nHe\\'s been down there for days. \\nHe doesn\\'t sleep. He barely eats. He\\'s not been himself. Not at all. It\\'s this place. Ahem. \\nI think a sickness lies on it. \\nSickness? \\nWhat kind of sickness? \\nFili. \\nFili! \\nFili! \\nGold. \\nGold beyond measure. \\nBeyond sorrow... \\n...and grief. \\nBehold... \\n...the great... \\n...treasure hoard of Thror. \\nWelcome... \\n...my sister-sons... \\n...to the Kingdom... \\n...of Erebor. \\nBalin! \\nKili! \\nThank Durin, you\\'re alive. \\nBombur! \\nYou\\'re alive! \\n- Any sign of it? \\n- Nothing yet. \\nNothing here. \\n- Keep searching! \\n- That jewel could be anywhere. The Arkenstone is in these halls. - Find it! \\n- You heard him. \\n- Keep looking. \\n- All of you! \\nNo one rests until... \\nPage 8/39\\n...it is found. \\nI am almost tempted... \\n...to let you take it. \\nIf only... \\n...to see Oakenshield... \\n...suffer. \\nWatch it... \\n...destroy him. \\nWatch it corrupt... \\n...his heart... \\n...and drive him mad. \\nI\\'ve got you. \\nTake only what you need. \\nWe have a long march ahead. \\nWhere will you go? \\nThere is only one place. \\nThe Mountain. \\nYou are a genius, sire. \\nWe can take refuge inside the Mountain. It might smell a bit of dragon, but the women can clean that up. It\\'ll be safe and warm and dry... ...and full of stores... \\n...bedding, clothing... \\n...the odd bit of gold. \\nWhat gold is in that Mountain is cursed. We will take only \\nwhat was promised to us. \\nOnly what we need to rebuild... ...our lives. \\nHere. Pull your weight. \\nNews of the death of Smaug \\nwill have spread through the lands. Aye. \\nOthers will now look to the Mountain... ...for its wealth... \\n...for its position. \\nWhat is it you know? \\nNothing for certain. \\nIt\\'s what I fear may come. \\nYou saw something out there. \\nThe Orc I pursued out of Lake-town, I know who he is. \\nBolg, spawn of Azog the Defiler. Page 9/39\\nA Warg pack was waiting for him \\non the outskirts of Esgaroth. \\nThey fled into the North. \\nThese Orcs were different \\nfrom the others. \\nThey bore a mark \\nI have not seen for a long time. \\nThe mark of Gundabad. \\nGundabad? \\nAn Orc stronghold... \\n...in the far North of the Misty Mountains. You may tell my father... \\n...if there is no place for Tauriel, there is no place for me. \\nLegolas. \\nIt is your king\\'s command. \\nI ride North. Will you come with me? To where? \\nTo Gundabad. \\nI come for Mithrandir... \\n...and I will leave with him. \\nIf you try to stop me... \\n...I will destroy you. \\nNine... \\n...for mortal Men doomed to die. \\nI am not alone. \\nAre you in need of assistance, my lady? You should\\'ve stayed... \\n...dead. \\nMithrandir... \\n...come back. \\nHe is here. \\nYes. \\nThe darkness has returned. \\nGo on! \\nGandalf! \\nGandalf! \\nClimb on! \\nHe is weak. \\nHe cannot remain here. \\nIt is draining his life. \\nGo! \\nQuickly! \\nCome with me, my lady. \\nPage 10/39\\nGo! \\nYou have no... \\n...power here... \\n...servant of Morgoth. \\nYou... \\n...are nameless. \\nFaceless. \\nFormless. \\nGo back to the void... \\n...from whence you came! \\nThe spirit of Sauron endured. \\nAnd has been banished. \\nHe will flee into the East. \\nGondor... \\n...should be warned. \\nThey must set a watch \\non the walls of Mordor. \\nNo. \\nLook after the Lady Galadriel. She has spent much of her power. Her strength is failing. \\nTake her to Lothlrien. \\nMy Lord Saruman. \\nHe must be hunted down... \\n...and destroyed once and for all. Without the Ring of Power... \\n...Sauron can never again \\nhold dominion over Middle-earth. Go now. \\nLeave Sauron to me. \\n- I need that horse. \\n- What? \\n- Gandalf, where are you going? - To warn Erebor. \\nThey have no idea what is coming. I saw them... \\n...with my own eyes, \\nrank upon rank of Moria Orcs. \\nYou must summon our friends, \\nbird and beast. \\nThe battle for the Mountain \\nis about to begin. \\nWait. \\nTake this. \\nPage 11/39\\nIf what you say is true, \\nthen you\\'ll need it more than I. Thank you. \\nA word of warning, eh? \\nIt can be a bit dicky sometimes. You just have to twiddle with the top. I expect you\\'ll manage. \\nIt is here in these halls. \\nI know it. \\nWe have searched and searched. \\nNot well enough. \\nThorin, we all would see \\nthe stone returned. \\nAnd yet, it is still not found! Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here? The Arkenstone... \\n...is the birthright of our people. It is The King\\'s Jewel. \\nAm I not the king? \\nKnow this: \\nIf anyone should find it... \\n...and withhold it from me... \\n...I will be avenged. \\nDragon-sickness. \\nI\\'ve seen it before. \\nThat look. \\nThe terrible need. \\nIt is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo. It sent his grandfather mad. \\nBalin, if Thorin... \\n...had the Arkenstone... \\n...or if... \\n...it was found... \\n...would it help? \\nThat stone crowns all. \\nIt is the summit of this great wealth... ...bestowing power... \\n...upon he who bears it. \\nWould it stay his madness? \\nNo, laddie. \\nI fear it would make him worse. Perhaps it is best... \\n...it remains lost. \\nPage 12/39\\nWhat is that? \\nIn your hand. \\nIt\\'s nothing. \\nShow me. \\nIt... \\nI picked it up in Beorn\\'s garden. You\\'ve carried it all this way? \\nI\\'m gonna plant it in my garden. \\nIn Bag End. \\nIt\\'s a poor prize to \\ntake back to the Shire. \\nOne day, it\\'ll grow. \\nAnd every time I look at it, I\\'ll remember. Remember everything that happened, the good, the bad... \\n...and how lucky I am that I made it home. Thorin, I... \\nThorin. \\nSurvivors from Lake-town... \\n...they\\'re streaming into Dale. \\nThere\\'s hundreds of them. \\nCall everyone to the gate. \\nTo the gate! \\nNow! \\nCome on. \\n- Keep moving. \\n- Sire! \\nSire! \\nUp here! \\nLook, sire! The braziers are lit. So... \\n...the Company of Thorin Oakenshield survived. \\nSurvived? \\nThere\\'s a bunch of Dwarves \\nwith all that gold? \\nI shouldn\\'t worry, Alfrid. \\nThere\\'s gold enough \\nin that Mountain for all. \\nMake camp here tonight! \\nFind what shelter you can. \\nGet some fires going. \\n- Come on, hurry along now. \\n- Alfrid. \\nPage 13/39\\nYou\\'ll take... \\n...the night watch. \\nUp it goes! \\nThat\\'s it. \\nI want this fortress made safe by sunup. This Mountain was hard-won. \\nI will not see it taken again. \\nThe people of Lake-town have nothing. They came to us in need. \\nThey have lost everything. \\nDo not tell me what they have lost. I know well enough their hardship. Those who have lived through dragon fire... ...should rejoice. \\nThey have much... \\n...to be grateful for. \\nMore stone. \\nBring more stone to the gate! \\nThat\\'s it. \\n- These children are starving. \\n- We need food. \\n- We won\\'t last three days. \\n- Bard... \\n- ...we don\\'t have enough. \\n- Do what you can, Percy. \\nIt\\'ll be all right. Don\\'t worry. \\nWe need more water. \\nThe children, the wounded \\nand the women come first. \\nHere you are. \\nGood morning, Alfrid. \\nWhat news from the night watch? \\nAll quiet, sire. Not much to report. Nothing gets past me. \\nExcept an army of Elves, it would seem. My Lord Thranduil, we did not look... - ...to see you here. \\n- I heard you needed aid. \\nHere you go. \\nPass it back. \\nAnother one. \\nYou have saved us. \\nI do not know how to thank you. \\nYour gratitude is misplaced. \\nPage 14/39\\nI did not come on your behalf. \\nI came to reclaim something of mine. There are gems in the Mountain \\nthat I, too, desire. \\nWhite gems of pure starlight. \\nThe White Gems of Lasgalen. \\nI know an Elf Lord who will pay \\na pretty price for these. \\nWait! Please wait! \\nYou would go to war \\nover a handful of gems? \\nThe heirlooms of my people \\nare not lightly forsaken. \\nWe are allies in this. \\nMy people... \\n...also have a claim \\nupon the riches in that Mountain. Let me... \\n...speak with Thorin. \\nYou would try to reason with the Dwarf? To avoid war? \\nYes. \\nNot a bad night\\'s work. \\nCome on. \\nHail, Thorin, son of Thrain. \\nWe are glad to find you alive beyond hope. Why do you come to the gates... \\n...of the King under the Mountain armed for war? \\nWhy does the King under the Mountain fence himself in... \\n...like a robber in his hold? \\nPerhaps it is because \\nI am expecting to be robbed. \\nMy lord... \\n...we have not come to rob you... ...but to seek fair settlement. \\nWill you not speak with me? \\nI am listening. \\nOn behalf of the people of Lake-town... ...I ask that you honor your pledge. A share of the treasure... \\n...so that they might rebuild their lives. I will not treat with any man... \\nPage 15/39\\n...while an armed host lies before my door. That armed host will attack this Mountain if we do not come to terms. \\nAnd your threats do not sway me. \\nWhat of your conscience? \\nDoes it not tell you our cause is just? My people offered you help. \\nAnd in return, you brought upon them only ruin and death. \\nWhen did Lake-town come to our aid but for the promise of rich reward? A bargain was struck! \\nA bargain? \\nWhat choice did we have \\nbut to barter our birthright... \\n...for blankets and food? \\nTo ransom... \\n...our future in exchange \\nfor our freedom? \\nYou call that a fair trade? \\nTell me... \\n...Bard the Dragon-Slayer... \\n...why should I honor such terms? Because you gave us your word. \\nDoes that mean nothing? \\nBe gone! \\nEre our arrows... \\n...fly! \\nWhat are you doing? \\nYou cannot go to war. \\n- This does not concern you. \\n- Excuse me... \\n...but in case you haven\\'t noticed, there is an army of Elves out there. Not to mention several hundred \\nangry fishermen. \\nWe are, in fact, outnumbered. \\nNot for much longer. \\nWhat does that mean? \\nIt means, Master Baggins... \\n...you should never underestimate Dwarves. We have reclaimed Erebor. \\nNow... \\n...we defend it. \\nPage 16/39\\nHe will give us nothing. \\nSuch a pity. \\nStill... \\n- ...you tried. \\n- I do not understand. \\nWhy? \\nWhy would he risk war? \\nIt is fruitless to reason with them. They understand... \\n...only one thing. \\nWe attack at dawn. \\nAre you with us? \\nAye. \\nMaster Baggins, come here. \\nYou\\'re going to need this. \\nPut it on. \\nThis vest is made of silver steel. Mithril... \\n...it was called by my forebears. No blade can pierce it. \\nI look absurd. \\nI\\'m not a warrior, I\\'m a Hobbit. It is a gift. \\nA token of our friendship. \\nTrue friends are hard to come by. I have been blind... \\n...but now I begin to see. \\nI am betrayed. \\nBetrayed? \\nThe Arkenstone. \\nOne of them has taken it. \\nOne of them is false. \\nThorin... \\n...the Quest is fulfilled, \\nyou\\'ve won the Mountain. \\nIs that not enough? \\n- Betrayed by my own kin. \\n- Now, uh... \\n...you made a promise \\nto the people of Lake-town. \\nNow, is this treasure... \\n...truly worth more than your honor? Our honor, Thorin. I was also there. I gave my word. \\nPage 17/39\\nFor that, I am grateful. \\nIt was nobly done, but the treasure... ...does not belong to the people... ...of Lake-town. \\nThis gold... \\n...is ours. \\nAnd ours alone. \\nBy my life... \\n...I will not part... \\n...with a single coin. \\nNot... \\n...one... \\n...piece of it. \\nGundabad. \\nWhat lies beyond? \\nAn old enemy. \\nThe ancient kingdom... \\n...of Angmar. \\nThis fortress was once its stronghold. It is where they kept their great armories. Forged their weapons of war. \\nA light. I saw movement. \\nWe wait for the cover of night. \\nIt is a fell place, Tauriel. \\nIn another age, our people waged war... ...on those lands. \\nMy mother died there. \\nMy father does not speak of it. \\nThere is no grave. \\nNo memory. \\nNothing. \\n- Unh! \\n- Let me through! \\nMake way! \\nNo, no. \\nNo! Oi! You! \\nPointy hat! \\nYes. \\nYou. We don\\'t want no tramps, beggars... ...nor vagabonds here. \\nWe got enough trouble \\nwithout the likes of you. \\nOff you go. On your horse. \\nWho\\'s in charge here? \\nPage 18/39\\nWho is asking? \\nYou must set aside \\nyour petty grievances with the Dwarves. War is coming! \\nThe cesspits... \\n...of Dol Guldur have been... \\n...emptied. \\nYou\\'re all... \\n...in mortal danger. \\nWhat are you talking about? \\nYou know nothing... \\n...of Wizards. \\nThey are like winter thunder \\non a wild wind... \\n...rolling in from a distance, \\nbreaking hard in alarm. \\nBut sometimes a storm... \\n...is just a storm. \\nNot this time. \\nArmies of Orcs are on the move. These are fighters. \\nThey have been bred for war. \\nOur enemy has summoned his full strength. Why show his hand now? \\nBecause we forced him. \\nWe forced him when the Company of Thorin set out to reclaim... \\n...their homeland. \\nThe Dwarves were never meant \\nto reach Erebor. \\nAzog the Defiler was sent to kill them. His master seeks control of the Mountain. Not just for the treasure within... ...but for where it lies, \\nits strategic position. \\nThis is the gateway... \\n...to reclaiming \\nthe lands of Angmar in the North. If that fell kingdom should rise again... ...Rivendell, Lrien, the Shire... ...even Gondor itself, will fall. These Orc armies you speak of, \\nMithrandir... \\n...where are they? \\nPage 19/39\\nThese bats are bred for one purpose. For what? \\nFor war. \\nCome on, let\\'s get those blades sharpened. Aye. Blasted Elves. \\n- You swing an ax at it? \\n- No, brother. \\nYou should be inside. \\nOut of the wind. \\nNo, I... \\n...needed some air. \\nPlace still stinks of dragon. \\nThe Elves have been moving... \\n- ...their archers into position. - Ah. \\nThe battle will be over... \\n...by tomorrow\\'s eve. \\nThough I doubt we will live \\nto see it. \\nNo, these are dark days. \\nDark days indeed. \\nHmm. \\nNo one could blame a soul \\nfor wishing themselves elsewhere. Must be nearing midnight. \\nBombur\\'s got the next watch. \\nIt\\'ll take a bit to wake him. \\nBofur? \\nI will see you in the morning. \\nGoodbye, Bilbo. \\nSince when has my counsel \\ncounted for so little? \\nWhat do you think I\\'m trying to do? Save your Dwarvish friends, \\nand I admire... \\n...your loyalty to them. \\nBut it does not dissuade me \\nfrom my course. \\nYou started this, Mithrandir. \\nYou will forgive me if I finish it. Are the archers in position? \\n- Yes, my lord. \\n- Give the order. \\nIf anything moves on that Mountain... Page 20/39\\n...kill it. \\nThe Dwarves are out of time. \\nBowman! \\nDo you agree? \\nIs gold so important to you? \\nWould you buy it \\nwith the blood of Dwarves? \\nIt won\\'t come to that. \\n- This is a fight they cannot win. - That won\\'t stop them. \\nYou think the Dwarves will surrender? They won\\'t. \\nThey will fight to the death. \\nBilbo Baggins. \\nIf I\\'m not mistaken... \\n...this is the Halfling \\nwho stole the keys... \\n...to my dungeons from under... ...the nose of my guards. \\nYes. \\nSorry... \\n...about that. \\nI came... \\n...to give you... \\n...this. \\nThe Heart of the Mountain. \\nThe King\\'s Jewel. \\nAnd worth a king\\'s ransom. \\nHow is this... \\n...yours to give? \\nI took it as my 14th share \\nof the treasure. \\nWhy would you do this? \\nYou owe us no loyalty. \\nI\\'m not doing it for you. \\nI know that Dwarves can be obstinate... ...and pigheaded... \\n...and difficult. \\nThey\\'re suspicious and secretive... ...with the worst manners... \\n...imaginable, \\nbut they are also brave... \\n...and kind... \\n...and loyal to a fault. \\nPage 21/39\\nI\\'ve grown... \\n...very fond of them, \\nand I would save them if I can. \\nNow, Thorin... \\n...values this stone above all else. In exchange for its return, \\nhe will give you... \\n...what you are owed. \\nThere will be no need... \\n...for war. \\nRest up tonight. \\n- You must leave on the morrow. \\n- What? \\n- Get as far away from here as possible. - I\\'m not leaving. \\nYou picked me as the 14th man. \\nI\\'m not leaving the Company. \\nThere is no Company. Not anymore. Imagine what Thorin will do \\nwhen he finds out what you\\'ve done. I\\'m not afraid of Thorin. \\nWell, you should be. \\nDon\\'t underestimate... \\n...the evil of gold. \\nGold over which... \\n...a serpent has long brooded. \\nDragon-sickness seeps \\ninto the hearts of all... \\n...who come near this Mountain. \\nAlmost all. Heh. \\nYou there. \\nFind this Hobbit a bed... \\n...and fill his belly with hot food. He\\'s earned it. \\nHey. \\nKeep an eye on him. \\nIf he should try... \\n...to leave, you tell me. \\nMove it! \\nStupid Hobbit. \\nWakey-wakey, Hobbit. Up you get. \\nI will put the next one between your eyes. We have come to tell you... \\n...payment of your debt has been offered... Page 22/39\\n...and accepted. \\nWhat payment? \\nI gave you nothing. \\nYou have nothing. \\nWe have this. \\nThey have the Arkenstone. \\nThieves! \\nHow came you by the heirloom \\nof our house? \\nThat stone belongs to the king! And the king may have it... \\n...with our goodwill. \\nBut first he must honor his word. They are taking us for fools. \\nThis is a ruse. \\nA filthy lie. \\nThe Arkenstone is in this Mountain! It is a trick! \\nIt\\'s no trick. \\nThe stone is real. \\nI gave it to them. \\nYou? \\nI took it as my 14th share. \\nYou would steal from me? \\nSteal from you? No. \\nNo, I may be a burglar, \\nbut I like to think I\\'m an honest one. I\\'ll let it stand against my claim. Against your claim? \\nYour claim. \\nYou have no claim over me, \\nyou miserable rat! \\nI was going to give it to you. - Many times I wanted to, but... - But what... \\n...thief? \\nYou are changed, Thorin. \\nThe Dwarf I met... \\n...in Bag End would never have \\ngone back on his word. \\nWould never have doubted... \\n...the loyalty of his kin! \\nDo not speak to me... \\n...of loyalty. \\nPage 23/39\\nThrow him from the rampart! \\nDid you not hear me? \\nI will do it myself. Curse you! No! \\nCursed be the Wizard... \\n- ...that forced you on us! \\n- If you don\\'t like my burglar... ...then please... \\n...don\\'t damage him. \\nReturn him to me. \\nYou\\'re not making a very splendid figure as King under the Mountain... \\n...are you, Thorin... \\n...son of Thrain? \\nNever again will I have dealings with Wizards! \\nGo. \\nOr Shire rats! \\nAre we resolved? \\nThe return... \\n...of the Arkenstone \\nfor what was promised? \\nWhy should I... \\n...buy back that which is... \\n...rightfully mine? \\nKeep the stone... \\n...sell it. \\nEcthelion of Gondor \\nwill give you a good price for it. I will kill you! \\nBy my oath, \\nI will kill you all! \\nYour oath means nothing. \\nI\\'ve heard enough. \\nThorin... \\n...lay down your arms. \\nOpen these doors. \\nThis treasure... \\n...will be your death. \\nThorin, we cannot... \\n...win this fight. \\nGive us your answer. \\nWill you have peace... \\n...or war? \\nPage 24/39\\nI will have war. \\nIronfoot. \\nHey, Thorin! \\nIronfoot has come! \\nWho is that? \\nHe doesn\\'t look very happy. \\nIt is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills. Thorin\\'s... \\n- ...cousin. \\n- Are they alike? \\nI\\'ve always found Thorin \\nthe more reasonable of the two. Good morning. \\nHow are we all? \\nI have a wee proposition... \\n...if you wouldn\\'t mind giving me a few moments... \\n...of your time. \\nWould you consider... \\n...just sodding off? \\nAll of you! \\nRight now! \\nStand fast. \\nCome now, Lord Dain. \\nGandalf the Grey. \\nTell this rabble... \\n...to leave, or I\\'ll water... \\n...the ground with their blood! \\nNo need for war... \\n...between Dwarves, Men and Elves. A legion of Orcs... \\n...march on the Mountain. \\nStand down. \\nI will not stand down before any Elf. Not least this faithless Woodland sprite. He wishes nothing but ill upon my people. If he chooses... \\n...to stand between me and my kin... ...I\\'ll split his pretty head open! See if he\\'s still smirking then. Dain... \\n...wait! \\nLet them advance. \\nSee how far they get. \\nPage 25/39\\nYou think I give a dead dog \\nfor your threats... \\n...you pointy-eared... \\n...princess? \\nYou hear that, lads? We\\'re on! Let\\'s give these bastards \\na good hammering! \\nStand your men down. \\nI\\'ll deal with Ironfoot and his rabble. Right then. \\nLet\\'s get this done. \\nSend in the goats. \\nThranduil! \\nThis is madness! \\nHow do you like that, \\nthe old twirley-whirlies? \\nHa, ha, you buggers! \\nWere-worms. \\nOh, come on. \\nThe hordes of hell are upon us! Fight to the death! \\nI\\'m going over the wall. \\nWho\\'s coming with me? \\n- Aye! \\n- Come on, let\\'s go! \\n- Stand down. \\n- What? \\nAre we to do nothing? \\nI said, stand down! \\nThe Elves. \\nWill they not fight? \\nCharge! \\nYes! \\nUh, Gandalf? \\nIs this a good place to stand? Azog. \\nHe\\'s trying to cut us off. \\nAll of you! \\nFall back to Dale! \\nNow! \\nTo the city! \\nBilbo! This way! \\nSigrid! \\nTilda! \\nPage 26/39\\nMy children! Where are my children? I saw them! \\nThey were down in the old market! The market? \\nWhere are they now? \\nTilda! Sigrid! \\nBard! Orcs are storming over the causeway! Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet. Hold them off as long as you can. Archers! This way! \\nThe Orcs have taken Stone Street! The market\\'s overrun! \\nThe rest of you... \\n...follow me! \\nCharge! Onward! \\nTo the death! \\nDa! \\nDa! \\n- Here! \\n- We\\'re down here! \\nBain! \\nSigrid! Get down! \\nListen! \\nGather... \\n...the women and children. \\nTake them to the Great Hall... \\n...and barricade the door. \\nYou understand? \\nYou must not come out for any reason. We want to stay with you! \\nShow your father some respect. \\nYou leave it to me... \\n...sire. \\nYou heard him. \\n- We make for the Great Hall. \\n- Alfrid! \\nWomen and children only. \\nI need every man... \\n...fighting. \\nSee that you return. \\nI\\'ll get them to safety, sire. \\nThen my sword is yours to command. Get up! \\nLook after them. \\nPage 27/39\\nShift it, granny! \\nMake for the Great Hall! \\nOut of my way! \\nAbandon the cripples! \\nYou buggers! \\nWhere\\'s Thorin? \\nWe need him! Where is he? \\nFall back! \\nSince when do we forsake... \\n...our own people? \\nThorin... \\n...they are dying... \\n...out there. \\nThere are halls beneath halls \\nwithin this Mountain. \\nPlaces we can fortify... \\n...shore up, make safe. \\nYes. \\nYes... \\n...that is it. \\nWe must move the gold \\nfurther underground... \\n- ...to safety. \\n- Did you hear me? \\nDain is surrounded. \\nThey\\'re being slaughtered, Thorin. Many die in war. \\nLife is cheap. \\nBut a treasure... \\n...such as this cannot be counted... ...in lives lost. \\nIt is worth... \\n...all the blood we can spend. \\nYou sit here in these vast halls... ...with a crown upon your head... ...and yet you are lesser now \\nthan you have ever been. \\nDo not speak to me... \\n...as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord... ...as if... \\n...I were still... \\n...Thorin... \\n...Oakenshield. \\n- I am your king! \\nPage 28/39\\n- You were always my king. \\nYou used to know that once. \\nYou cannot see what you have become. Go. \\nGet out. \\nBefore I kill you. \\nYou sit here... \\n...with a crown upon your head. You are lesser now \\nthan you have ever been. \\nBut a treasure such as this \\ncannot be counted in lives lost. A sickness lies upon that treasure. The blind ambition of a Mountain King. Am I not the king? \\nThis gold... \\n...is ours. \\nAnd ours alone. \\nI will not part... \\n...with a single coin. \\nHe could not see \\nbeyond his own desire! \\nAs if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord... ...Thorin Oakenshield. \\nA sickness which drove \\nyour grandfather mad. \\nThis is Thorin... \\n...son of Thrain, son of Thror! I am not my grandfather. \\nI am not my grandfather. \\nYou are the heir to the Throne of Durin. They are dying out there. \\nTake back Erebor. \\nDain is surrounded. \\nDying. \\nIs surrounded. \\nDying. \\nTake back your homeland. \\nYou are changed, Thorin. \\nI am not my grandfather. \\nIs this treasure truly worth more than your honor? \\nI am not my grandfather. \\nThis treasure will be your death! Page 29/39\\nFall back! \\nFall back... \\n...to the Mountain! \\nFall back! \\nI will not hide... \\n...behind a wall of stone... \\n...while others fight our battles for us! It is not in my blood, Thorin. \\nNo. \\nIt is not. \\nWe are sons of Durin. \\nAnd Durin\\'s Folk... \\n...do not flee from a fight. \\nI have no right to ask this of any of you. But will you follow me... \\n...one last time? \\nThorin. \\nTo the king! \\nTo the king! \\nThe Dwarves. \\nThey\\'re rallying. \\nThey\\'re rallying to their king. \\nAny man who wants to give their last... ...follow me! \\nCome on, Bombur. Get up. \\n- Nori. \\n- Gloin! \\nRight behind you, brother. \\nI say we stand with our men \\nin life and in death. \\n- I\\'m with you. \\n- Arm yourselves. \\n- Come with us. \\n- No, no, no. \\n- You leave an old woman be. \\n- Don\\'t be afraid. \\nI said, get off! \\nAlfrid Lickspittle. \\nYou are a coward. \\n\"Coward\"? \\nNot every man\\'s brave enough \\nto wear a corset. \\nYou\\'re not a man. \\nYou\\'re a weasel. \\nPage 30/39\\nDain! \\nThorin! \\nHold on! \\nI\\'m coming! \\nHey, cousin! \\nWhat took you so long? \\nThere\\'s too many of these buggers, Thorin. I hope you\\'ve got a plan. \\nAye. \\nWe\\'re going to take out their leader. Azog? \\nI\\'m gonna kill that piece of filth. Thorin, you cannot do this. \\nYou\\'re our king. \\nThat is why I must do it. \\nAnd how do you plan to fight your way single-handed to Ravenhill? \\nHalt! \\nIt\\'s been a while since I\\'ve done this. To Ravenhill! \\nHold tight, lads. \\nYou\\'re all mad bastards. \\nI like it. \\nMay Durin save you all. \\nWatch out! \\nEyes front... \\n...lads! \\nHold on! \\nI\\'m out! \\nBring it down! \\n- Shoot it! \\n- Where? \\nIn his jambags! \\nIt doesn\\'t have any jambags! \\n- Duck! \\n- Kili! \\nMove it! \\nHang on, lads! I\\'m coming! \\nBofur, you beauty! \\n- Dwalin! \\n- Go! \\nCome on... \\n...you hairy hedgepig! \\nCome on! \\nPage 31/39\\nYeah! \\n- Yeah! \\n- Yeah! \\nWargs! \\nHold tight, lads. \\nThere\\'s more coming! \\nWe\\'re pulling too much weight. We won\\'t make it. \\nCut the tracers. \\nRide them to Ravenhill. \\nNo, Balin. \\nMy goat-riding days are over. \\nDurin be with you, brother. \\nI am too old for this. \\nHyah! \\nOnwards! \\nLead on! \\nGet up. \\nGet away from me. \\nI don\\'t take orders... \\n...from you. \\nPeople trusted you. \\nThey listened to you. \\nThe Master\\'s mantle... \\n...was there for the taking... \\n...and you threw it all away. \\nFor what? \\nAlfrid... \\n...your slip is showing. \\nWe may yet survive this. \\nGandalf! \\nIt\\'s Thorin. \\nAnd Fili, Kili... \\n...and Dwalin. \\nHe\\'s taking his best warriors. To do what? \\nTo cut the head off the snake. Die! \\nGandalf! \\nLegolas. \\nLegolas Greenleaf. \\nThere is a second army. \\nBolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs. They are almost upon us. \\nPage 32/39\\nGundabad. \\nThis was their plan all along. \\nAzog engages our forces, \\nthen Bolg sweeps in from the North. The North? \\nWhere is the North... \\n- ...exactly? \\n- Ravenhill. \\nRavenhill? \\nThorin is up there. \\nAnd Fili and Kili. They\\'re all up there. Where is he? \\nIt looks empty. \\nI think Azog has fled. \\nI don\\'t think so. \\nFili... \\n...take your brother. \\nScout out the towers. \\nKeep low and out of sight. \\nIf you see something... \\n...report back. Do not engage. \\n- Do you understand? \\n- We have company. \\nGoblin mercenaries. \\nNo more than a hundred. \\nWe\\'ll take care of them. Go! \\nGo! \\nCome on! \\nRecall your company. \\nMy lord, dispatch this force... ...to Ravenhill. \\nThe Dwarves are about... \\n...to be overrun. \\nThorin must be warned. \\nBy all means, warn him. \\nI have spent enough Elvish blood in defense... \\n...of this accursed land. No more. Thranduil? \\nI\\'ll go. \\nDon\\'t be ridiculous. \\nYou\\'ll never make it. \\nWhy not? \\nBecause they will see you coming Page 33/39\\nand kill you. \\nNo, they won\\'t. \\nThey won\\'t see me. \\nIt\\'s out of the question. \\nI won\\'t allow it. \\nI\\'m not asking you to allow it, Gandalf. You will not turn away. \\nNot this time. \\nGet out of my way. \\nThe Dwarves will be slaughtered. Yes, they will die. \\nToday... \\n...tomorrow... \\n...one year hence, \\na hundred years from now. \\nWhat does it matter? \\nThey are mortal. \\nYou think your life is worth more... ...when there is no love in it? There is no love in you. \\nWhat do you know of love? \\nNothing. \\nWhat you feel for that Dwarf... ...is not real. \\nYou think it is love? \\nAre you ready to die for it? \\nI will go with you. \\nPush! \\nBy Durin, you\\'ve lost your ax. \\nNo, he\\'s not. \\nThere you go, cousin. \\nYou know where you can stick that. Hey. Stay here. \\nSearch the lower levels. \\nI\\'ve got this. \\nWhere is that Orc filth? \\nThorin. \\nBilbo. \\nYou have to leave here. Now. \\nAzog has an army attacking \\nfrom the North. \\nThis watchtower will be surrounded. - With no way out. \\n- We are so close. \\nPage 34/39\\nThat Orc scum is in there. \\nI say we push on. \\nNo. That\\'s what he wants. \\nHe wants to draw us in. \\nThis is a trap. \\nAh. \\nFind Fili and Kili. Call them back. Thorin, are you sure about this? Do it. \\nWe\\'ll live to fight another day. Oh... \\nGo. \\nRun! \\nKili! \\nThorin. \\nThorin. No. \\nNo. \\nKili. \\nKili! \\nKili! \\nTauriel! \\nKili. \\nNo! \\nNo! \\nMm. \\nTauriel! \\nThe Eagles are coming. \\nBilbo. \\nDon\\'t move. Don\\'t move. Lie still. Oh. Mm. Mm. \\nI\\'m glad you are here. \\n- Shh, shh. \\n- Unh. \\nI wish to part from you in friendship. No. \\nYou are not going anywhere. \\nYou\\'re going to live. \\nI would take back... \\n...my words and my deeds at the Gate. You did what only a true friend would do. Forgive me. \\nI was too blind to see it. \\nI am so sorry... \\n...that I have led you into such peril. Page 35/39\\nNo, I\\'m glad to have shared \\nin your perils, Thorin. \\nEach and every one of them. \\nIt is far more than any Baggins deserves. Farewell... \\n...Master Burglar. \\nGo back to your books. \\nAnd your armchair. \\nPlant your trees. \\nWatch them grow. \\nIf more people... \\n...valued home... \\n...above gold... \\n...this world would be a merrier place. No. No, no, no. No. \\nThorin. Thorin, don\\'t you dare. Thorin. \\nThorin. Thorin, hold on. \\nHold on, please. \\nThe Eagles... \\nThe Eagles... The Eagles are here. Thorin? \\nThe Ea... \\nI cannot go back. \\nWhere will you go? \\nI do not know. \\nGo north. \\nFind the Dnedain. \\nThere\\'s a young Ranger amongst them. You should meet him. \\nHis father, Arathorn, was a good man. His son... \\n...might grow to be a great one. What is his name? \\nHe\\'s known in the Wild as Strider. His true name... \\n...you must discover for yourself. Legolas. \\nYour mother loved you. \\nMore than anyone. \\nMore than life. \\nThey want to bury him. \\nYes. \\nIf this is love, I do not want it. Page 36/39\\nTake it from me. \\nPlease. \\nWhy does it hurt so much? \\nBecause it was real. \\nThe king is dead. \\nLong live the king! \\nLong live the king! \\nThere is to be a great feast tonight. Songs will be sung. Tales will be told. And Thorin Oakenshield... \\n...will pass into legend. \\nI know that\\'s how you must honor him. But to me, he was never that. \\nHe was... \\nTo me... \\n...he was... \\nI\\'ll slip quietly away. \\nWill you tell the others I said goodbye? You can tell them yourself. \\nIf any of you are ever \\npassing Bag End, uh... \\n...tea is at 4. \\nThere\\'s plenty of it. \\nYou are welcome anytime. \\nUh... \\nDon\\'t bother knocking. \\nAh, the borders of the Shire. \\nIt is here I must leave you. \\nThat\\'s a shame. \\nI quite liked having... \\n...a Wizard around. \\nSeems they bring good luck. \\nYou don\\'t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes... ...were managed by mere luck? \\nMagic rings should not be used lightly, Bilbo. \\nDon\\'t take me for a fool. \\nI know you found one in the Goblin tunnels. And I\\'ve kept my eye on you... \\n...ever since. \\nWell, thank goodness. \\nFarewell, Gandalf. \\nFarewell. \\nPage 37/39\\nYou, uh... \\nYou needn\\'t worry about that ring. Fell out of my pocket during the battle. I lost it. \\nYou\\'re a very fine person, Mr. Baggins.

Put that pouf down! \\nWhat is going on? \\nHello... \\n...Mr. Bilbo. \\nYou\\'re not supposed to be here. What do you mean? \\nOn account of you \\nbeing presumed dead. \\nI am not dead. \\nPresumed or otherwise. \\nI\\'m not sure that\\'s permitted. \\nMr. Bilbo! \\nTwenty-one! Any advance on 21? \\nAny advance on 21? \\nHa, ha! Sold to Mrs. Bolger. \\nSomewhere for Fatty to put his feet on. Any bids for this? \\nThis is Shire-made. \\nNo Dwarvish reproductions here.

It won\\'t come off! It\\'s chasing me! Look, it\\'s not my fault! \\nPage 8/60\\nI have no idea how this thing \\ngot on my back! \\nOf course, buddy. I believe you. Great. Aah! \\nI \"believe\" you too. \\nYou see the quotations \\nI\\'m making with my claw hands? \\nIt means I don\\'t believe you! \\nWhy else would you show up \\nwith that thing on your back... \\n...just three days before \\nPresident Business... \\n...is going to use the Kragle \\nto end the world? \\nPresident Business is gonna end the world? But he\\'s such a good guy. \\nAnd Octan, they make good stuff. Music, dairy products, coffee, TVshows... ...surveillance systems, \\nall history books, voting machines. Wait a minute. \\nCome on, you can\\'t be this stupid. This is a misunderstanding. \\nI\\'m just a regular, normal, ordinary guy. I\\'m late to meet my best friends in the whole world. \\nThey\\'re probably missing me right now. They\\'re probably out looking around. \"Hey, where\\'s Emmet? \\nHey, where\\'s my best friend Emmet?\" Hey, you know what? \\nAsk all my friends. They\\'ll tell you. Oh, we asked them, all right. \\nBoom! \\nThat guy\\'s not a criminal mastermind. See? \\nYeah. You know, he\\'s kind of \\nan average, normal kind of guy. \\nThank you. \\nBut, you know, he\\'s not, like... ...normal like us. No. \\nHe\\'s not that special. \\nWait, I\\'m so confused. \\nWho are we talking about? \\nPage 9/60\\nWait, does he work with us? \\nGail doesn\\'t remember me? \\nLook at Randy here. \\nHe likes sausage. That\\'s something. Gail is perky. That\\'s something. \\nAnd Harry... \\n...well... \\n- When you say Harry, I go: \\nWhen you say the other guy, I go: Harry\\'s the best! \\n- Harry\\'s got personality. \\nHe\\'s weird! He\\'s weird! \\nI know that guy but I know, like, zippy-zap about him. \\nWe just talked earlier. \\nI mean, all he does is say yes... ...to everything everybody else is doing. You know, he\\'s just sort of a \"Hmm!\" Little bit of a blank slate, I guess. That\\'ll be $42, please. \\nWe all have something that makes us something and Emmet is... \\n...nothing. \\nThere you go. \\n- I told you I was a nobody. \\nOh. \\nIt\\'s the perfect cover. \\nCover? Cover for what? \\nI can\\'t break him. \\nTake him to the melting chamber. \\nWhat? Aah! \\nYou\\'re gonna melt me? Am I gonna die? You\\'ll live. You\\'ll be fine. \\nPresident Business. \\nI have him right here, sir. \\nYes, we\\'ve told him he\\'ll live \\nso he doesn\\'t try to escape, but, um... ...we\\'re lying to him. \\nWait, what did he just say? \\nHold still. \\nWait! There\\'s obviously been a mix-up here. You\\'ve got the wrong... \\nOw! Ow, ow, ow! \\nThat is gonna start hurting... \\nPage 10/60\\n...pretty soon. \\nOw, ow, ow! \\nNo, no, no! \\nWhoa. Who are you? \\nIt\\'s you? \\nCome with me if you wanna not die. \\nHi, everybody! How\\'s the melting goi...? Hey, hey, hey! \\nRed alert, red alert. \\nI need everyone, repeat: \\nEveryone, \\nto go after The Special. \\nThe tunnel\\'s that way. \\nOh, boy! \\nOh, sir, you\\'re brilliant. \\n- We\\'ll build a motorcycle out of the alleyway. - Ow. Oh. \\nSo, uh, didn\\'t catch your name... \\n...or anything about what you\\'re, uh, up to. Or what we\\'re doing here. \\nIt\\'s brilliant, sir, that you pretended to be a useless nobody... \\n...but you can drop the act with me. It\\'s cool. \\nOh, the act. \\nWhoa. \\nWhoa! \\nJump on. Let\\'s go! \\nHey, uh, I... \\nHang on, sir. \\nAll units... \\n...cut him off on Elm, now! \\nOr whenever you can. \\n10-4, Bad Cop. \\n- Watch out! \\n- Hold on. \\nWe need to meet up with Vitruvius... ...and tell him the Piece has been found. Uh-huh. \\nThey\\'re up on the monorail. \\nRelease the copper choppers. \\nOh, no! \\nWill you please tell me what is happening? I\\'m rescuing you, sir. \\nPage 11/60\\nYou\\'re the one the prophecy spoke of. You\\'re The Special. \\nMe? \\nYou found the Piece of Resistance. And the prophecy states... \\n...that you are the most important, most talented... \\n...most interesting... \\n...and most extraordinary person \\nin the universe. \\nThat\\'s you. Right? \\nUh, yes. That\\'s me. \\nGreat. You drive. \\nWhat? \\nI wanna go home! \\nThis is not what I meant! \\nOh, no. \\nLook out, Special! \\nUh, sorry. Never driven a motorcycle. Sorry! - Wow, he\\'s amazing. \\n- Aah! \\nThat was incredible! \\nYou\\'re even better \\nthan the prophecy said you\\'d be. \\nOh. Really? \\nI\\'m, uh... I\\'m Wyldstyle. \\n- Oh, I\\'m sorry, what was it? \\n- Wyldstyle. \\n- \"Wyldstyle\"? \\nYep. \\n- What are you, a DJ? \\nNo. \\n- Oh, that\\'s your name? \"Wyldstyle\"? - Yeah. \\nLike on your birth certificate, \\nit says \"Wyldstyle. \" \\nLet\\'s not talk about my name! \\nDon\\'t let The Special get away. \\nSir, we\\'ve blocked the freeway. \\nHang on, sir! \\nWhat are you doing? \\nLet\\'s fly! \\nWhoa! \\nHead for the secret tunnel. \\nPage 12/60\\nUh, these are the city limits. \\nLet\\'s just head for the tunnel. \\nYou want me to drive \\ninto that weird swirly hole? \\nAre you insane? \\nDon\\'t brake! Go! Don\\'t stop! Go! Now! I can\\'t do this! \\nThat is against the instructions! Wait, what\\'s your favorite restaurant? Any chain restaurant. \\nFavorite TV show? \\nWhere Are My Pants? \\nFavorite song? \\nEverything Is Awesome! \\nOh, no! \\nDarn, darn, darn, darny-darn! \\nWait. Where are we? \\nThis is so weir...! Ow! \\nYou\\'re not The Special! You lied to me! It really kind of depends on... \\nYou\\'re not even a MasterBuilder, are you? Uh, I mean, I know what a MasterBuilder is. Why don\\'t you tell me what it is? That way I could see if you\\'re right. You\\'ve ruined the prophecy. \\nLook, I\\'m sorry, okay? You just... You made being special sound so good. And to think I was going to follow you to the end of the universe. \\nYou were? \\nHere\\'s the thing. \\nHow do we know for sure \\nthat I\\'m not The Special? \\n- We just don\\'t know it yet. \\n- Quiet. \\nY\\'all want a giant turkey leg? \\nDo you have any idea \\nwhat that does to your colon? \\n- Oh, my G-O-S-H. \\nJust put the hat on. \\nOh... \\n...and this. And this. And this. \\n- And this. \\n- Aah! \\nPage 13/60\\nAnd, by the way, I have a boyfriend. Uh, I\\'m not sure exactly \\nwhy you\\'d bring that up. \\nIt\\'s super serious. \\nYou do not want to mess with him. \\nOkay. \\nSo don\\'t get any ideas. \\nI never have any ideas. \\nWait! \\nStick them up. \\nHands where I can see them. \\nHey, uh, listen. You think \\nyou can explain why I\\'m dressed like this... ...and what those big words \\nin the sky were all about? \\nAnd, like, where we are in time. \\nYour home, Bricksburg, \\nis one of many realms in the universe. There\\'s also this one... \\n...Pirate\\'s Cove, Knight\\'s Club, \\nViking\\'s Landing, Clown Town... \\n...a bunch of others \\nwe don\\'t need to mention. \\nMm-hm. \\nLord Business, \\nor as you think you know him... \\n...President Business... \\n...stole the Kragle, \\nthe most powerful object in the universe. Blah, blah, blah. \\nProper name. Place name. Backstory stuff. ...Piece of Resistance is The Special. Mm-hm. \\nI\\'m so pretty. I like you. \\nBut I\\'m angry with you for some reason. ...tower at the end of the universe... Mm-hm. \\n...put the Piece of Resistance \\nonto the Kragle... \\n...and disarm it forever. \\nGreat. \\nI think I got it... \\n...butjust in case... \\n...tell me the whole thing again. \\nPage 14/60\\nI wasn\\'t listening. \\nOkay. All the people \\nof the universe were once free to travel... ...and mingle and build \\nwhatever they wanted. \\nBut President Business \\nwas confused by all the chaos. \\nSo he erected walls between the worlds... ...and became obsessed \\nwith order and perfection. \\nAnd he stole the mysterious... \\n...secret super weapon called... \\nThe Kragle! \\n- And he hired Bad Cop... \\n...to hunt down all the MasterBuilders, who were always changing everything. And those of us who remained... \\n...well, we went into hiding. \\nBuilt the tunnels to survive. \\nAnd we search for the Piece of Resistance. The only thing that can stop the Kragle. Kragle. I know that. \\nIt might have been that cop. \\nHe said something about the Kragle. President Business \\nwas going to use the Kragle... \\n...to end the world in three days. I can\\'t make any sense of it. \\nTaco Tuesday. \\nI knew that was suspicious. \\nThere\\'s no time to lose. \\nWe must find Vitruvius and get to the Office Tower before it\\'s too late. Okay. \\nHeh. How scary can someone\\'s office be? President Business, \\nwe\\'re trying to locate the fugitive... ...but his face is so generic it matches every other face in our database. Diabolical. \\nOkay, have Bad Cop meet me in my office... ...in 23 seconds. Ciao. \\n- Will do, sir. \\nCoffee sales are through the roof, sir. Page 15/60\\nGlad to hear it. \\nLet\\'s rebuild that roof to be even higher! - The roof team is on it. \\n- Ha, ha. \\nSir, can you approve this poster \\nfor Taco Tuesday? \\nPerfect. Whoo! \\n- I love everyone in this room. \\nWe love you, sir! \\nGreatjob on the radio station. \\nThank you, sir. \\nWe love listening to this song \\nover and over again. \\nKeep it up, guys. \\nHoney, where are my... \\n...pants? \\nHa-ha-ha! \\nCut! Ha, ha! \\nHilarious. That never gets old. \\nIt does not. \\nBad Cop is waiting for you \\nin your office. \\nWonderful. Fantastic. \\nWould you cancel my 2:00? \\nThis next meeting could run a little bit... ...deadly. \\nActivate helmet. \\nLight sequence. \\nFlame test. \\n- Engage dramatic entrance. \\nAah! \\nBad Cop. \\nLord Business. \\nI know The Special got away, but... Don\\'t be so serious. \\nWhere\\'s the other guy? \\n- Hey, friend. \\nHey, buddy! \\n- I missed you. \\n- Aw, did you really? \\nHave I ever shown you my relic collection? Nope. I don\\'t think you have. \\nNobody knows where this stuff comes from. This one... \\nPage 16/60\\n...is the Cloak of Ban Da\\'Id. \\nI hear it\\'s super painful to take off. - You wanna try it on? \\n- Well, um... \\nNo, but thank you. \\nWe\\'ve done some great work \\nover the years together, Bad Cop... \\n...capturing all those MasterBuilders... ...and torturing them and whatnot. \\nThank you, sir. \\nAlthough... \\n...you did let the Piece of Resistance go. The one thing that can ruin my plans. The one thing that I asked you to take care of. That\\'s super frustrating. \\nIt makes me just wanna pick up whoever... ...is standing closest to me... \\n...and throw them through this window... ...and out into the infinite abyss \\nof nothingness! \\nI wanna do it so bad. \\nI know you do, sir. Please don\\'t. \\nAnd it\\'s not just you, Bad Cop, \\nthat keeps messing up my plans. \\nPeople everywhere \\nare always messing with my stuff. \\nBut I have a way to fix that. \\nA way to keep things exactly \\nthe way they are supposed to be. \\nPermanently. \\nBehold... \\n...the most powerful weapon... \\n...of all the relics: \\nThe Kragle! \\nAs you can see, they\\'re \\nloading the Kragle in a big machine upstairs. I call it... \\n...the Tentacle Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer. Or TAKOS. \\nThe \"S\" is silent. \\nSo on Taco Tuesday... \\n...it\\'s going to spray the Kragle \\nover everyone and everything... \\n...with a bunch of super-scary nozzles Page 17/60\\nlike this one! \\n- I\\'ll show you how it works. \\n- Sir, I don\\'t know if this is necessary. Oh, don\\'t worry. I won\\'t test it on you. I\\'ll do it on your parents! \\nWhat? \\n- Hi, son. \\n- Hi! \\nHow\\'s it going in the big city? \\nMommy. Daddy. \\nWhat are you doing here? \\nOkay, Pa. I just want you to act naturally. - Like you\\'re going about your day. - Gotcha. \\nYeah. Keep your hand up like that. Ma, scoot... \\n...two steps in to the right. \\n- Pa, whenever I talk to Ma... \\n- Uh-huh? \\n...you start to move. \\n- Sorry, sir. \\nGet back to where you were! \\n- Here? \\nPerfect. \\nThat\\'s great. You can\\'t do anything better. No reason why you should move. \\nRight. \\nNow, Ma... \\n...hand on his shoulder. And you... Pa, you just moved... \\n...and you\\'ve just wrecked it! \\n- Uh-huh. \\nYou wrecked it! \\nBad Cop, you see what I\\'m talking about? All I\\'m asking for is total perfection. Send in a Micro-manager! \\nCommencing micro-management. \\nHold still, you guys. \\nAnd then... \\n...I just spray them... \\n...with the TAKOS. \\nOh, Pa, hold me. \\nOh, darling, I can\\'t move me legs. - Does that upset you, Bad Cop? \\nPage 18/60\\n- Um... \\nSurely you feel bad for your parents, and you wanna help them, don\\'t you? We\\'re okay, son. Just a little stuck, is all. Go ahead... \\n...finish the job. \\nOf course, sir. \\nNo, I don\\'t want to. \\n- You have to. \\n- I don\\'t want to. \\n- Would you please be quiet? \\n- I can\\'t. \\n- You must. Shut it! \\n- But they... \\n- It\\'s not nice. \\n- It\\'s yourjob, man. \\nI can\\'t do it. \\n- They\\'re innocent. \\n- Just as I thought. \\nYour Good Cop side\\'s \\nmaking you soft, Bad Cop. \\nRobots! \\nBring me the fleece-crested \\nScepter of Q-Teep... \\n...and the P-Lish Remover of Na-ll. You\\'ve already let The Special \\nget away once. \\nSir. \\nI\\'m just gonna make sure \\nit doesn\\'t happen again. \\nNo more Mr. Nice Guy! \\nOh, son! \\nOn Taco Tuesday, \\nI\\'m going to Kragleize the entire universe... ...so that everyone \\nwill stop messing with my stuff! \\nAre you gonna be with me... \\n...or are you gonna be stuck... \\n...having a tea party \\nwith your mom and dad? \\nSon? \\nSorry, Dad. \\nI have ajob to do. \\nAll you have to do is blend in \\nPage 19/60\\nand act like you belong here. \\nAh, perfect. \\nWell, hi there, I\\'m a cowboy! \\nBang, bang, bang-bang-bang-bang! \\nShoot, shoot, shoot. Bullet, bullet, gun. Zap, zap, zap, pow. Zap, pow. \\nWhat are they looking at? \\nI made a mistake. \\nYou should just be still. Act like a stool. - Wait! \\n- Howdy, guys! \\n- Quiet. Nope, stools don\\'t talk. - Come sit on me. \\nOkay, shh. \\nLet me show you how it\\'s done. \\nWhat a lady! \\nOkay, let me just find the wizard... ...and get this over with. \\n- Ooh! \\n- There he is. \\n- Vitruvius. \\n- Who? \\nI\\'ve never heard of that man, \\nwhom I am not. \\n- Who are you? \\n- It\\'s me. \\nI am a blind man and cannot see. \\n- It\\'s Wyldstyle. \\n- Oof. \\nAre you a DJ? \\n- What? Why does everybody...? \\n- Oh, wait, wait. \\nAre you the student I used to have... ...who was so insecure \\nshe kept changing her name? \\nNo, no, no. \\n- First Darkstorm, then Geminizzle. - No. Never. \\nThen Neversmile, then Freakface, \\nthen Snazzypants. \\nOkay. All right, yes. \\nMeet me upstairs in 10 seconds. \\nOh, man. \\nYou have a very weirdly... \\nPage 20/60\\n...decorated place. \\n- Thank you. \\nVitruvius, we have found \\nthe Piece of Resistance. \\n- Is it true? \\nYes, but... \\nWyldstyle. The prophecy states that... ...you are The Special. \\nThe embodiment of good, \\nfoiler of evil. \\nThe most talented, most brilliant... ...most important person in the universe. That would be great... \\n...but Emmet is the one... \\n...who found the Piece. \\nOh, okay. Emmet! \\nThe prophecy states that... \\n...you are The Special. \\n- The most talented... \\n- I\\'m not sure he\\'s The Special. \\nBecause he\\'s not even \\na MasterBuilder. Watch. \\nEmmet, just given what\\'s around you... ...build something simple. \\n- Okay. \\nLike an awesome race car. \\n- Great. \\nGo. \\n- Do you have the instructions? \\nNo. You must create the instructions in your mind, my liege. \\nAh. Okay. Race car. \\nUm... \\nWell, there\\'s a lot of really cool stuff here. Don\\'t see a wheel... \\n...or... \\n...three more wheels. \\nSee? He can\\'t do it. \\nHe will never be a MasterBuilder. \\nOf course not. \\nNot if you keep telling him he can\\'t. He needs to see that he can. \\nWhat are you doing? \\nWe are entering your mind... \\nPage 21/60\\n- What? \\n...to prove that you have \\nthe unlocked potential... \\n...to be a MasterBuilder. \\nUjjayi breath. \\nWhoa, are we inside my brain right now? - It\\'s big. I must be smart. \\nMm-hm. \\nI\\'m not hearing a lot of activity here. I don\\'t think he\\'s ever had \\nan original thought. In his life. \\nHa, ha. That\\'s not true. \\nFor instance, one time I wanted to have... ...a bunch of my friends over to watch TV... Not unlike this TV \\nthat just showed up magically. \\nAnd not everybody \\ncan fit on my one couch... \\n...and I thought to myself: \\n\"What if there was such a thing \\nas a bunk bed... \\n...but as a couch?\" \\nIntroducing the double-decker couch. So everyone could watch TV together and be buddies! \\nThat is literally the dumbest thing I\\'ve ever heard. \\nPlease, Wyldstyle, let me handle this. That idea is just the worst. \\nThere must be something around here... ...that proves his potential. \\nIf The Man Upstairs \\nchose him to be The Special... \\n...there must be a reason. \\nWho\\'s The Man Upstairs? \\n- See? \\nHe doesn\\'t even know about \\nThe Man Upstairs. \\nDoes he have, like, super-gross hands... ...that look like they\\'re made \\nout of big pink sausages? \\nLike eagle talons mixed with squid? Wait. You\\'ve seen the...? \\nWhoa! \\nPage 22/60\\nThat\\'s what I was just thinking about. How did you...? \\nI had this weird dream \\nwhen I touched the Piece. \\nWell, I mean, I wasn\\'t asleep, \\nso it wasn\\'t really a dream. \\nEmmet, you had a vision. \\nI did? \\nMasterBuilders spend years... \\n...training themselves \\nto clear their minds enough... \\n...to have even a fleeting glimpse \\nof The Man Upstairs... \\n...and yet, your mind is already \\nso prodigiously empty... \\n...that there is nothing in it \\nto clear away in the first place. \\nWith proper training... \\n...you could become a great MasterBuilder. I could? \\nThe prophecy chose you, Emmet. \\nBut I can\\'t do any of the stuff... ...that the prophecy \\nsays I\\'m supposed to do. \\nAll you have to do is to believe. \\nThen... \\n...you will see everything. \\nAre you ready, my son? \\nYes, I am. \\nI think. \\nThen we haven\\'t a moment to lose. \\nWe must assemble... \\n...the MasterBuilders. \\nDo you think Zeppelins \\nare a bad investment? \\nAny of you fellas seen this guy? \\nWait a minute, partner. \\nDraw a cowboy hat on him. \\nThese mechanical birds \\nwill get our message out. \\nThey will go to an Internet caf... ...and e-mail the remaining MasterBuilders... ...who will meet us in the secret realm of Cloud Cuckooland. \\nPage 23/60\\nCuckooland? Wait. \\nWhat happened to that whole training part? Don\\'t worry, Emmet. \\nYour training begins now. \\nPiano man... \\n...open up. \\nYour training begins later! \\nOn three. \\nOne... \\n- Whew. I think we\\'re in the clear. Freeze, turkeys. \\nAll I want is the Piece of Resistance. We would rather he died than give it to you. I would not rather he died. \\nLook, everybody, we can do this \\nthe easy way, or we can do it... \\nGo, run! \\nThey took the hard way. Fire! \\nFire! \\nVitruvius, which way to Cloud Cuckooland? Head for the big bright thing in the sky. You mean the sun? \\nYeah. Yeah, that\\'s it. \\nLet\\'s get out of here. Here, use this. What? Wait, hey... \\n- What are you doing? Aah! \\nLet\\'s go! \\nI don\\'t know what I\\'m doing. \\nGoodbye. \\nBoom! \\nOh, dang! \\nAah! I\\'ve got pigs! I hate pigs! \\nQuit playing around in the mud. \\nI could use your help. \\nWyldstyle, we could really use... \\n...your help! \\nOink, oink, oink. \\nOink! \\nVitruvius, they\\'re \\ngaining on us. Build something! \\nLet Emmet try! \\nNo, let\\'s not let Emmet try! \\nI haven\\'t had any training. \\nThat\\'s okay. \\nPage 24/60\\nWe\\'ll start with \\nhow to become a MasterBuilder. \\nStep one: \\nOkay, okay. Um... \\nBuild something! Build something! Aha. Take that! \\nUnless your instincts are terrible. No! The wheel! \\nI can\\'t control it much longer! Emmet, we need to attach the wheel to something that spins around. Um... \\nWe need to attach the wheel \\nto something that spins around. We need to attach the wheel \\nto something that spins around. We need to attach the wheel \\nto something that spins around. Something that spins around. \\nSpins around. Spins around. \\nOh. \\nEmmet, where are you going? \\nOh, this better work. \\nHang tight! \\nDagnabit! \\nWell done, Emmet. \\nHey! I did it. \\nWow. You actually did it. \\nTrain! \\nOh, no. \\nGet off my train. \\nRun! \\nWyldstyle! \\nOwie! \\nHe\\'s gonna ram us. \\nQuick, quick, quick! That piece! Give me that piece. \\nHuh? \\nBuild a ramp! \\nWhat the heck? \\nRest in pieces. \\n- Uh... \\n- Oh, no. \\nPage 25/60\\nWait. No, no, no. \\nHey. \\nThanks for saving my life back there. Even if, you know... \\n...eventually it turned out to be pointless. Well, for what it\\'s worth... \\n...this has been about the greatest 15 minutes of my life. \\nWhat the...? \\nRelax, everybody, I\\'m here. \\nBatman! \\n- What\\'s up, babe? \\nBabe! \\n- What? \\n- Oh, sorry. Batman, this is Emmet. Emmet, this is my boyfriend, Batman. I\\'m Batman. \\nThat\\'s your boyfriend? Aah! \\nBatman, huh? Where\\'d you guys meet? It\\'s actually a funny story, right, Bat? There he is. \\n- \"Police\" to meet you, Bad Cop. \\n- Batman! \\nThe pleasure... \\n...is all \"spine. \" \\nGuess what... \\n...you big dumb baby. \\nYour car is a baby carriage. \\nOh, no, your boyfriend\\'s gone. \\nHey, babe. \\n- What? \\nLet\\'s hold hands. \\nSo, uh... \\nHey, guys, I think we\\'re about \\nto crash into the sun. \\nYeah, but it\\'s gonna look really cool. Uh, is this Cloud Cuckooland? \\nI don\\'t see any clouds. \\n- Or cuckoos. \\n- No, no, this is... \\n...Middle Zealand. \\nA wondrous land... \\n...full of knights, castles, mutton... ...torture weapons, poverty, \\nPage 26/60\\nleeches, illiteracy... \\n...and, um... \\nDragon! \\nYeah, that too. \\nOnce we arrive at Cloud Cuckooland, we\\'ll raise an army... \\n...of MasterBuilders to... \\nAnyway, you guys gotta check out \\nthese new subwoofers I installed. I call them the dogs. Listen to them bark! Can you turn that down a little bit? This is a song I wrote for Wyldstyle. Darkness \\nIt\\'s about how I\\'m an orphan. \\nNo parents \\nThis is real music, Emmet. \\nBatman\\'s a true artist. Dark, brooding. Well, I\\'m dark and brooding too. \\nGuys, look, a rainbow. \\nSo you\\'re gonna drive up the curved part... Super rich \\n...take it all the way to the top... Kind of makes it better \\n...and park the car. \\nFriends, welcome \\nto Cloud Cuckooland. Now... \\nI just need to give the secret knock. Okay. \\nI\\'m just gonna come right out. \\nI have no idea what\\'s going on... ...or what this place is at all. \\nHi! I am Princess Unikitty... \\n...and I welcome you all \\nto Cloud Cuckooland. \\nThere\\'s no signs or anything. \\nHow does anyone know what not to do? Here in Cloud Cuckooland... \\n...there are no rules. \\nThere\\'s no government... \\n...no babysitters... \\n...no bedtimes... \\n...no frowny faces... \\n...no bushy mustaches... \\n...and no negativity of any kind. Page 27/60\\nYou just said the word \"no\" \\nlike a thousand times. \\nAnd there\\'s also no consistency. I hate this place. \\nAny idea is a good idea... \\n...except the not happy ones. \\nThose you push down deep inside... ...where you\\'ll never, ever, ever... ...ever... \\n...find them. \\nYour fellow MasterBuilders \\nare gathered in the Dog. \\nThe what? \\nAh! Is that Superman? \\nGirl, what are you doing? \\n- Hey, Superman! \\n- Oh, hey. What\\'s up? \\n- Lantern. Green Lantern. \\n- Yeah, yeah. \\nYou wanna sit together at the meeting? Um, I have to go back to Krypton. Didn\\'t Krypton blow up? \\nMy fellow MasterBuilders, \\nincluding but not limited to... ...Robin Hood, Mermaid Lady... \\n...Gandalf... \\n...Swamp Creature... \\n...1980-something Space Guy... \\n- Hello! \\n...2002 NBA All-Stars... \\n...and Wonder Woman. \\n- Unh! \\nYou have traveled far to be here for a moment of great import. \\nWe have learned... \\n...that Lord Business plans to unleash... ...a fully weaponized Kragle... \\n...on Taco Tuesday... \\n...to end the world as we know it. Please, calm yourselves. \\nGreen Ninja... \\n...Milhouse... \\n...Nice Vampire... \\n...Michelangelo, Michelangelo...

You got this. \\nOkay. \\nHello. I\\'m Emmet. \\nOh, and this is the Piece of Resistance. Thank you. \\nWell, uh, I know that I, for one... \\n...am very excited to work with you guys... ...to get into the Octan Tower, \\nfind the Kragle... \\n...and put this thing on the thing. \\nAnd I know it\\'s going to be really hard, but... \"Really hard\"? \\nWiping ye bum with a hook \\nfor a hand is really hard. \\nThis be impossible. \\nThe last time we tried to storm \\nLord Business\\' office... \\n...we used every plan we could conceive. The result was a massacre \\ntoo terrible to speak of. \\nWho are you? \\nThe name be Metal Beard. \\nAnd I\\'ll tell you me tale of woe. \\nOh, great, here we go again. \\nI arrived... \\n...at the foot of the Tower... \\n...with me hearty MasterBuilder crew... ...only to fnd the Kragle was all \\nPage 29/60\\nthe way up on the infnityeth floor... ...guarded by a robot army... \\n...and security measures... \\n...of every kind... \\n...imaginable: \\nLasers... \\n...sharks... \\n...laser sharks... \\n...overbearing assistants... \\n...and strange, dangerous relics... ...that entrap... \\n...snap... \\n...and zap. \\nAnd there be a mysterious room \\ncalled the Think Tank. \\nI barely made it out of that... ...room... \\n...with just me head! \\nAnd organs. \\nOkay. \\nI had to replace every part \\nof my once-strapping... \\n...virile pirate body... \\n...with this useless hunk of garbage ye see before ye. \\nSo if ye think \\nit\\'d be a good idea to return... ...to that forsaken place... \\n...Special... \\n...what idea have ye that be better... ...than the ideas of 100... \\n...of our fallen MasterBuilder brothers? Well, uh... \\nWell, technically I\\'m not exactly a MasterBuilder yet. \\nWhat? \\nPlease! Everyone! Please! \\nRubbish! \\nYes, it\\'s true. \\nI may not be a MasterBuilder. \\nI may not have a lot of experience... ...fighting or leading \\nor coming up with plans. \\nPage 30/60\\nOr having ideas in general. \\nIn fact, I\\'m not all that smart. \\nAnd I\\'m not what you\\'d call \\na \"creative type. \" \\nPlus... \\n...generally unskilled. \\nAlso... \\n...scared and cowardly. \\nI know what you\\'re thinking: \\n\"He is the least qualified person... ...in the world to lead us. \" \\nAnd you are right. \\nThis is supposed to make us feel better? No, there was about to be a \"but. \" - You\\'re a butt! \\n- Yes. \\nYou all be on your own! \\nI be leaving this lost cause! \\nWhy are you leaving? \\nA house divided against itself \\nwould be better... \\n...than this. \\nAbraham Lincoln! \\nYou bring your space chair right back here! Come on, guys! \\nWe can still do this. Right? \\nYou\\'re not even a bit special. \\nWell, you were right about him \\nbeing a ding-dong. \\nYou\\'re a huge disappointment. \\nGet him out of here. \\nI don\\'t wanna look at him. \\nWell, at least it can\\'t get any worse. I was wrong. \\nIt\\'s the Orb of Tee-ti-list! \\nRuh-roh. It\\'s the bad guys. \\nWhoa. How did he...? \\nGo! Run! Come on, everyone! \\nProtect The Special. \\nWhat\\'s that on his ankle? \\nIt\\'s a tracking device. \\nTake the MasterBuilders prisoner. Oh, he led them right to us. \\nGuys, no, no, no. It\\'s not my fault. Page 31/60\\nYou are the worst leader I\\'ve ever seen. To the Batmobile! \\nDang it. \\nTo the invisible jet! \\n- Dang it! \\n- Every man for himself. \\nNo, we must protect the Piece. \\nShaq, do you know what time... \\n...it is? \\n- It\\'s game time. \\nY\\'all ready for this? \\nOh, no! They were ready for that. It didn\\'t break! \\nBecause it\\'s Kragled. Machine gum! Fire! \\nNo! \\nAah! I can\\'t move! \\nDon\\'t worry, Superman. \\n- I\\'ll get you out of there. \\n- No! Don\\'t! \\nAah! Oh, my gosh. My hands are stuck. My legs are stuck as well. \\nI super hate you. \\n- Ow! You\\'re pulling my torso off. - Babe... \\n...help me get him out of here. \\nI said \"every man for himself. \" Hey, you gotta be there for me. \\nFine! \\nFine. Fine. Fine. \\n- I need you to have a better attitude. - I have a great... \\n...attitude. \\n- Ouch. \\nThe Special\\'s in the northwest quadrant. We\\'ve got him cornered. \\nOuch. Ouch. Ouch. \\nWhere\\'d he go? \\nOh, no! \\nThey\\'ve hit our silly cloud stabilizers! Let\\'s go! \\nWe need to get Emmet out of here. Can\\'t we build something? \\n- Hey! I\\'m Ben. But you can call me Benny. Page 32/60\\nI can build a spaceship. Watch. \\nSpaceship, spaceship, spaceship \\nSpaceship, spaceship \\nNo! You can\\'t. The skies are surrounded. That\\'s okay. I didn\\'t really wanna build... ...a spaceship anyway. That\\'s cool. Where can we go \\nwhere we can\\'t be found? \\nMaybe we could go underwater? \\nWhat if we went underwater? \\nGreat idea, babe! \\nThank you, Batman. \\nYour ideas are the best. \\nBut I just said that. \\n- We could build a submarine. \\n- A Bat-Submarine, patent pending. With rainbows! \\nAnd dream catchers, in case we take a nap. Like an underwater spaceship! \\nBut you can\\'t build all of them at once. Ready? Break. \\nOkay. \\nThese are the colors I need: \\nBlue razzleberry and sour apple! \\nIf anybody has black parts, \\nI need them, okay? \\nI only work in black. \\nAnd sometimes, very, very dark gray. - Use the yellow bricks! \\n- Hey, guys, can I help? \\nNo! It has to be this way! \\nNo, I need that! \\nWhere is he? \\nAnyone know what this is, \\nand do you need it? \\nI think we could use wings \\nand rocket boosters. \\nEw. Get your retro space stuff \\nout of my area. \\nYou guys, hey, just tell me exactly what to do. And how to do it. \\nEmmet, don\\'t worry about \\nwhat the others are doing. \\nYou must embrace \\nPage 33/60\\nwhat is special about you! \\nThere he is! \\nAll units, attack the sub! \\nEmmet, get in here! \\nStop him! Stop him! Don\\'t let him... ...get to the water! \\nDive, dive, dive! Everybody in! \\nWe\\'re going under! \\nOh, no. \\nMy home. \\nIt\\'s gone. \\nI feel something inside. \\nIt\\'s like the opposite of happiness. I must stay positive. \\nAh. Bubble gums. \\nButterflies. \\nCotton candy. \\nGosh, I\\'m so sorry, Unikitty. \\nDo you want to sit down \\nand talk about it? \\nWhat the heck is that? \\nIt\\'s a double-decker couch. \\nWhich seemed like a good idea \\nat the time... \\n...but I now realize it\\'s not super helpful. But, you know, it has cup holders. Seats flip up with coolers underneath. You are so disappointing \\non so many levels. \\n- Why are my pants cold and wet? \\n- Ew. \\nUh... \\nHull breach. \\nThe walls are crying! \\nWe\\'re coming apart at the seams! \\nThis is not how Batman dies. \\nEmmet! \\n- Hold on, hold on! \\n- Wyldstyle! \\nDeep breath! Deep breath, everybod...! Micro-managers, \\nwhat\\'s going on down there? \\nScanning submarine wreckage. \\nNo survivors detected. \\nPage 34/60\\nScuba cops, \\ndredge the entire ocean if you have to. We have got to find that Piece. \\nLet\\'s get these prisoners \\nback to Lord Business... \\n...and give him the good news. \\nThe Special is no more. \\nHello, everybody! \\nSuperman. Wonder Woman, \\nI had no idea you\\'d be here. \\nMr. Shaquille O\\'Neal. \\nGreetings, all! \\nWelcome to my Think Tank. \\nHelp us! \\nAll the MasterBuilders \\nyou\\'ve captured over the years... ...you\\'ve brought them here. \\nYou\\'re a very perceptive person, Superman. They come up with all the instructions for everything in the universe. \\nRobots! \\nNo! No! Grr! \\nCan\\'t get much worse than this. \\nUh, hello, neighbor. \\n- Oh, no. \\nIt\\'s Green Lantern. \\nOh, my gosh, we\\'re roommates! \\nHow crazy is that? \\nDoes anyone have some Kryptonite that they could give me? \\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. Where is The Special? The Special and the Piece of Resistance are at the bottom of the ocean. \\nWait, are you telling me \\nyou don\\'t have him? \\nSir, my scuba team is looking \\nfor his remains as we speak. \\nBad Cop, he could still be alive! The Piece could still be out there. The only remnant of The Special \\nwas a double-decker couch. \\nWait, hold on. \\nA double-decker couch? \\nYes, sir. \\nPage 35/60\\nReally? So it\\'s like a bunk-bed couch? Is that what it\\'s like? \\nThat\\'s weird. \\nIf you\\'re sitting in the top middle... ...how are you gonna get down \\nwithout climbing over someone? \\nIf you\\'re sitting on the bottom \\nand you\\'re watching TV... \\n...are you gonna have to watch \\nthrough a bunch of dangling legs? \\nWho\\'s gonna want to sit on the bottom? It is literally... \\n...the most useless idea \\nI have ever heard. \\n- Well, we\\'re still alive. \\n- Yeah! \\nHeh. The double-decker couch. \\nIt wasn\\'t totally pointless after all. It\\'s the one thing that stayed together. I always believed in you, Emmet. \\nI don\\'t mean to spoil the party, \\nbut does anyone else notice... \\n...we\\'re stuck in the middle \\nof the ocean on this couch? \\nI mean, it\\'s not like a big gigantic ship... ...is gonna come out of nowhere \\nand save us... \\nMy gosh! \\nAvast, mateys! \\nMetal Beard, I thought you said \\nwe were a lost cause! \\nYe are! \\nDid ye not hear me whole story... \\n...circumscribing the folly \\nof this whole enterprise? \\nWell, it\\'s kind of hard not to hear when you\\'re yelling everything. \\nSo why did you come back? \\nThis be-doubled land couch. \\nI watched Lord Business\\' forces \\ncompletely overlook it. \\nWhich means we need more ideas like it! Oh, thank you. \\nIdeas so dumb and bad... \\nPage 36/60\\n...that no one would ever think they could possibly be useful. \\nOh. Thank you. \\nSo, Special, what do we do? \\nUh... \\nWell... \\n...what\\'s the last thing Lord Business expects MasterBuilders will do? Build a spaceship? \\nKill a chicken? \\nMarry a marshmallow. \\nWhy, this: \\nHow you gonna keep \\'em down on the farm? No! It\\'s follow the instructions. - Don\\'t like that. \\n- Sounds weird. \\nNow, listen. Wait, listen. \\nGuys, you\\'re all so talented \\nand imaginative. \\nBut you can\\'t work together as a team. I\\'m just a construction worker. But when I had a plan and we were all working together... \\n...I mean, we could build a skyscraper. Now, you\\'re MasterBuilders. \\nJust imagine what could happen \\nif you did that. \\nYou could save the universe. \\nWell said, Emmet. Well said. \\nReally? \\nShe be a fine speech there, laddie. Okay. \\nSomebody get me some markers... ...some construction paper... \\n...and some glitter glue! \\nI call this: \\n\"Emmet\\'s plan to get \\ninside the Tower... \\n...put the Piece of Resistance \\non the Kragle... \\n...and save the world. \" \\nI\\'ve built a hundred just like them Page 37/60\\nback in the city. \\nIf we can just get in, I know where the air ducts and wiring are located. I can get us anywhere. \\nHow will we get inside? \\nIn a spaceship. \\n- Spaceship! Ha, ha! \\n- Great idea. A Bat-Spaceship. \\nNo, they\\'re expecting us to show up... ...in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship. \\nOne of those sounds awesome to me. My idea is to build a spaceship... ...that\\'s exactly like all the other Octan delivery spaceships. \\nSo not the special spaceship that \\nI\\'m building for all of you right now? Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time. \\nOoh, you\\'re really letting the oxygen out of my tank here. \\nYeah, but according \\nto your precious instructions... \\n...this ship needs a hyperdrive. \\nWe don\\'t have that part. \\nMaybe we could find one! \\nWhat do you think, a spaceship \\nis just gonna appear out of the blue? Are you kidding me? \\nThe same thing! \\n- Chewie! \\n- Mm! \\nWe\\'re supposed to be halfway \\nto Naboo for a sweet party! \\nThis hyperdrive keeps malfunctioning... ...taking us to loser systems like this. Captain Solo, we must go. \\nYou know how perturbed I get \\nif we are not punctual. \\nThe Droid\\'s right. Let\\'s roll. \\nNow hold on, Han. \\nThis might be the right galaxy after all. Because I see a heavenly body. \\nOoh, whoa, I have a boyfriend. \\nAnd it is super serious. Right, babe? Page 38/60\\n- Of course it\\'s serious. \\n- Yeah! \\n- Got room forjust one dude? \\n- Whoa! Babe! \\nIf he\\'s a cool dude like you. \\nYou\\'re trying to bail on us! \\nI\\'m not trying to bail! \\nYou asked them if you could go \\nwith them on their party ship! \\nThat thing is filled with bon vivants. You speak French now? \\nBabe, look, if this relationship \\nis ever gonna work between us... \\n...I need to feel free to party... ...with a bunch of strangers \\nwhenever I feel like it. \\nWhat? \\nBabe! \\nI will text you. \\nWhere\\'d you get that \\nsweet space cape, brother? \\nIt\\'s party time! \\nBabe? \\nWyldstyle, you\\'re such an amazing person. And, you know, \\nif Batman can\\'t see that, then he\\'s just... Well, he\\'s just as blind as a guy... ...whose eyes stopped working. \\nAnd I\\'m gonna tell you something: Batman is the worst person I\\'ve ever met. - Need a hyperdrive? \\n- No way. \\n- Babe! \\n- I knew it! I knew that. \\nYou really had me there! \\nThose guys were so lame. \\nAll they did was play space checkers. Plus, it turns out the hairy one\\'s a dude. And the metal one too. All dudes. But won\\'t they notice \\ntheir hyperdrive is missing? \\nCome on, Chewie, hit the hyperdrive. Nah, they\\'ll be fine. \\nPage 39/60\\nStep one: \\nAll right, we need a red four-piece unit over at the... \\nUnikitty... \\n...you\\'re supposed to follow \\nthe instructions, remember? \\nSorry. \\nUgh, this gives me the jeebies. \\nWhat do I even...? I can\\'t...! \\nNice! \\nStep two: \\nWe pilot the ship to the service entrance... ...so we can get past the dangerous... ...but also kind of cool... \\n...laser gate. \\nSpace ID. \\nI have a drive-on. \\nWho are you here to see? \\nI\\'m here to see Your Butt. \\nIs that last name \"Butt,\" \\nfirst name \"Your,\" or is it...? \\nOh, my gosh! \\nPow. Wham. Ka-zap. \\nFirst try! \\nStep three: \\nWe break into Lord Business\\' office... ...and we\\'ll plunder his collection of relics for disguises. \\nStep four: \\nBenny and Metal Beard... \\n...will sneak their way \\ninto the master control room. \\nMotion sensors triggered in Sector 12. 10-4. \\nUh-oh. \\n- Are you thinking what I\\'m thinking? - Oh! \\nDo it. \\nMetal Beard, that was awesome! \\nFirst law of the sea... \\n...never place your rear end \\nPage 40/60\\non a pirate\\'s face. \\nOnce inside, \\nthey\\'ll use their technical know-how... ...to disable the Kragle shield. \\nI am the computer. \\nCool! Talking computer. \\nPlease disable the shield systems. Of course. \\nThere are no movies \\nin your area with that title. \\nStep fve: \\nVitruvius will provide lookout \\nand make sure we\\'re not being followed. Okay. \\nStep six: \\nBatman and Unikitty go into the boardroom... ...to make one last change \\nto Lord Business\\'plan. \\nI move that we freeze the universe. Can I get a second on that? \\nI second. \\nBruce Wayne, CEO of Wayne Enterprises. Bruce Wayne? Uh, who\\'s that? \\nSounds like a cool guy. \\nWe\\'d like to invest in your company. Your weapon to control \\nthe universe sounds super sweet... ...I must say. \\n- It is, indeed, super sweet. \\nCool. What kind of sound system \\ndoes it have? \\nUh, sound system? \\nWell, I mean, we have an iPod Shuffle. Wait a second. \\nYou\\'re telling me you have \\na machine to control the universe... ...and you can\\'t listen to tunes \\nin surround sound? \\nEmbarrassing. \\nWell, I mean... \\n...we need to get that done. \\nI want eight-foot speakers. \\nPage 41/60\\nGreat call. \\nYeah, I want speakers that you can hug with your arms and your legs... \\n...and just feel the beat. \\nListen up! We need new instructions for a speaker system for the TAKOS. We\\'ll never help. \\nWhatever you say, boss. \\nThen once the instructions are printed... ...Wyldstyle and I \\nwill enter the Kragle room... \\n...place the thing on the other thing... ...and save the universe. \\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, I didn\\'t draw that. Is that me exploding? \\nUh, I didn\\'t mention that earlier? When you reunite the Piece \\nwith the Kragle, it might explode? No! But it might not, right? \\nSure, sure, sure. Let\\'s go with that. Attention, everybody! \\nIncoming speaker delivery! \\nOw! \\nWho are you two? \\nWe are transfers from downstairs. - What? \\n- Excuse me? \\nYour robot voice \\nsounds an awful lot like a human voice. Give me a break. \\nI\\'ve never been a robot before. \\nWhat do you mean? \\nYou have always been a robot! \\nNo, no, no, do not listen to her. What are your robot serial numbers? Everything is awesome \\nNo way. This is my jam. \\nThis is also my jam. \\nEverything is awesome \\nEverything is cool \\nWhen you\\'re part of a team \\n- Needs great harmonies. \\n- I don\\'t want to sing the song. I\\'m not... Everything is awesome \\nPage 42/60\\nEverything is cool \\nWhen you\\'re part of a team \\nEverything is awesome \\nWhen we\\'re living our dream \\nQuick, let\\'s go. \\nEverything is awesome \\nHmm, I thought you didn\\'t like that song. I don\\'t. \\nMm-hm. \\nI know you put on this tough act... ...but I don\\'t think you\\'re as mean as you\\'re trying to seem. \\nI\\'m not mean. What are you talking about? I\\'m just saying, you were all, \\n\"He\\'s not The Special, Vitruvius. \\nHe can\\'t possibly be The Special. \\nThis guy? Are you kidding me?\" \\nAnyways, I don\\'t think that\\'s you. \\nThe real you, anyway. \\nLook, Emmet. \\nI wanted it to be me, okay? \\nI wanted to be The Special. \\nAnd I know that sounds super mature. It\\'s just... \\n...ever since I heard the prophecy, I wanted to be the One. \\nI was right there in that construction site... ...right on top of it, and then... \\n...it turned out to be you. \\nThat night in the city, \\nwhen you thought I was The Special... ...and you said I was talented \\nand important... \\n...that was the first time anyone \\nhad ever really told me that. \\nAnd it made me \\nwanna do everything I could... \\n...to be the guy you were talking about. Lucy. \\nWhat? \\nThat was my real name. \\nYou asked earlier, and it\\'s... \\n...Lucy. \\nI really like that name. \\nPage 43/60\\nHey. \\n- What are you two losers talking about? - Huh? What? Oh, nothing. \\nThought I\\'d help you guys. \\nLeft the weird cat thing to stall. Business, business, business. Numbers. - Is this working? \\nYes. \\nYay! \\nThere\\'s Bad Cop. \\nOh, Danny boy, the pipes... \\nOkay. Wait for my signal. \\nGood luck, Emmet. \\nLucy. \\nI guess this might be goodbye. \\nI don\\'t like goodbyes. \\nLet\\'s just call this: \\n\"See you later, alligator. \" \\n\"See you later, alligator\"? \\nAfter a while, crocodile. \\nWho\\'s Lucy? \\nBatman, when we get inside this room... ...there are gonna be \\naudio sensors everywhere. \\nWe have to be really, really quiet. Don\\'t worry, Dad, I read your dumb instructions. Stop yelling at me. Benny, what\\'s our status with the shield? Oh, yeah, no, it\\'s going great. \\nIt\\'s just going great, \\nif somebody would listen to me! \\nDownloading latest episode \\nofWhere Are My Pants? \\nWhere are you \\ngetting \"pants\" from? You know what I want! The pipes are calling... \\nBad Cop. \\nHi, this is Lord Business\\'assistant. He would like you to come \\nto his office immediately. \\nCopy that. \\n- Thanks. \\n- You are welcome, sir. \\nHey, who is that? \\nPage 44/60\\nThat\\'s the signal... \\n...but the shield is still up. \\nWe\\'ll wing it. \\nThat\\'s a bat pun. \\nShh. Benny... \\n...disable the shield. \\nDisable the shield. \\nNow. \\nDisable the shield. \\n- Searching for Albanian restaurants. - What? \\nNo! I never once said anything...! I don\\'t understand what you mean. Disable the shield! \\nBenny, what\\'s going on? \\nDisable the shield! Come on! \\nYou are undermining me! \\nWhich phrase \\nwould you like me to underline? Disable the shield! \\nLet me try. \\nBe ye disabling of yon shield. Disabling shield. \\nWhat? \\nOkay, in three... \\n...two... \\n...one. \\nLet\\'s do this. \\nLucy! \\nLucy! \\nNo! \\nOh, man. \\nOh, no. \\nUh-oh. \\nSneaking around the corner... \\n- Unh! \\n- Vitruvius. \\nI see you\\'ve accidentally \\nwandered into my Think Tank. \\nAnd by the way, \\nI found a few of your friends. - By which I mean all of them! - Sorry! \\nAcceptable work, Bad Cop. \\nPage 45/60\\nThank you, sir. \\nRobots, destroy this old man at once. Did you just call me \"old\"? \\nYeah. So what? \\nWell, Junebug, I really prefer the word... ...\"experienced\"! \\nAha. \\nYou see, Emmet? \\nA corrupted spirit is no match \\nfor the purity of imagina... \\n- Ha-ha-ha! \\nVitruvius! \\nNo! \\nVitruvius. \\nMy sweet Emmet. Come closer. \\nYou must know something \\nabout the prophecy. \\nI know, I\\'m doing my best... \\n...but I don\\'t... \\nThe prophecy... \\nI made it up. \\nWhat? \\nI made it up. It\\'s not true. \\nBut that means I\\'m just... \\nI\\'m not The Special? \\nYou must listen. \\nWhat I\\'m about to tell you... \\n...will change the course of history. No. \\nNo. \\nHey. \\nNot so special anymore, huh? \\nWell, guess what. \\nNo one ever told me I was special. I never got a trophy just for showing up! I\\'m not some special little snowflake... ...no. \\nBut as unspecial as I am... \\n...you are a thousand-billion times... ...more unspecial than me. \\nRobots, bring me the Sword of Exact Zero. Yes, Lord Business. \\nIt must be weird. \\nOne minute, you\\'re the most \\nPage 46/60\\nspecial person in the universe. \\nAnd the next minute, you\\'re nobody. \\nOh, I have a nice spot \\nfor this in my relic room. \\nUh-oh! My mistake! \\nThere it goes! \\nNo! \\nBye-bye forever! \\nWell, I guess \\nthere\\'s only one thing left to do! \\nRelease the Kragle! \\n- Computer! \\n- Yes, sir. \\nSet the electric shocker to 100 Mississippi. No problem. \\n- Then terminate everyone. \\n- Already on it. \\nEmmet, that should give you enough time... ...to witness the first location to be Kragled. - Your hometown. \\n- No! \\nBad Cop, unfortunately, \\nI\\'m gonna have to leave you here to die. What? Sir. \\nIt\\'s not personal. \\nIt\\'s just business. \\nLord Business. \\nCiao. \\nBeginning zapping termination... \\n...in 99 Mississippi... \\n...98 Mississippi... \\n...97 Mississippi... \\n...and so on. \\nAttention, everyone. \\nThis is President Business. \\nHello. \\n- Hi, welcome to Taco Tuesday! \\n- Whoa. \\nDon\\'t worry about this big black... \\n...monolith thing that\\'s blocking out the sun. What you need to worry about... \\n...is this question that I\\'m about to ask you: Who wants a taco? \\nYeah! I know! \\nPage 47/60\\nTacos, tacos! We\\'re going crazy! Yeah. All right, everyone. \\nAct normal. \\nPerfect. \\nNow, everybody say \"Freeze!\" \\nSo I guess running around \\nand screaming is normal. \\nMicro-managers, \\ncommence micro-management. \\nCommencing micro-management. \\nWhat\\'s going on? I can\\'t move! \\nPlease, please! Won\\'t somebody help us? Emmet, you\\'ll think of something, right? Like you always do. \\nDidn\\'t you hear him? \\nThe prophecy\\'s made-up. \\nI\\'m not The Special. \\nAnd to think for a moment \\nI thought I might be. \\nEmmet. \\n- Who said that? \\nI did. \\nI am Ghost Vitruvius. \\nWoo! \\nEmmet, you didn\\'t let me finish earlier. Because I died. \\nThe reason I made up the prophecy... ...was because I knew that \\nwhoever found the Piece... \\n...could become The Special. \\nBecause the only thing \\nanyone needs to be special... \\n...is to believe that you can be. I know that sounds like a cat poster, but it\\'s true. \\nLook at what you did \\nwhen you believed you were special. You just need to believe it some more. But how can I just decide \\nto believe that I\\'m special... \\n...when I\\'m not? \\nBecause the world depends on it. Woo! \\nZapping termination in 35 Mississippi...

What are you...? \\nNow it\\'s your turn to be the hero. 13 Mississippi... \\n- No! \\n...12 Mississippi... \\nSee you later, alligator. \\nDon\\'t! \\nNo, Emmet! \\n- Aah! \\n7 Mississippi... \\n...6 Mississippi... \\n...5 Mississippi... \\n...4 Mississippi... \\n...3 Mississippi... \\n...2 Mississippi... \\n...1 Mississippi... \\n...0 Missi... Error. \\nTermination failure. \\nEmmet! \\nNo. \\nHe... He saved us. \\nWell, what do we do now? \\nThere\\'s gotta be a bright side... ...here somewhere. \\nDoes anyone have any ideas? \\nPage 49/60\\nEmmet had ideas. \\nArr, if only there were more people in the world like he. \\nMaybe there are. \\nMeet me downstairs in 10 seconds. \\nHoney, where are my... \\n...pant...? \\n- Hi! \\nHey, guess what. \\nFound your pants.

Hey, everybody. \\nYou don\\'t know me, \\nbut I\\'m on TV, so you can trust me. I know things seem kind of bad right now. But there is a way out of this. \\nThis is Emmet. \\nAnd he was just like all of you. \\nA face in the crowd... \\n...following the same instructions as you. He was so good at ftting in, \\nno one ever saw him. \\nAnd I owe you an apology... \\n...because I used to look down \\non people like that. \\n\"I used to think they were followers... ...with no ideas or vision. \" \\nBecause it turns out Emmet had great ideas. And even though they seemed weird... ...and kind of pointless... \\n...they actually came closer... \\n...than anyone else to saving the universe. And now we have to fnish what he started... ...by making whatever weird thing \\npops into our heads. \\nAll of you have the ability \\ninside of you to be a groundbreaker. And I mean literally! \\nBreak the ground! \\nPeel up the pieces... \\n...tear apart your walls! \\nBuild things only you could build. Page 50/60\\nDefend yourselves. \\nWe need to fght back \\nagainst President Business\\'... \\n...plans to freeze us! \\nToday will not be known as Taco Tuesday. It will be known as Freedom Friday! But still on a Tuesday! \\nEnd of the line. \\nBad Cop? \\nI hope there\\'s still a Good Cop in me somewhere. \\nI\\'ll hold these guys off. \\nYou go stop them. Yay! \\nGreat idea, but how will we get there? T- minus one. \\nTen, nine, eight... \\n...seven, six... \\n- I could, uh... \\n...fve, four... \\n- I could build a... \\n...three, two, one. \\nI could build a spaceship! \\nYou\\'re not gonna say no? \\nBuild away, whatever your name is. - Whoa! Yay! \\n- Ha-ha-ha! \\nOkay. Spaceship! Spaceship! \\nSpaceship! \\nSpaceship! \\nSpaceship! \\nSpaceship! \\nSpaceship! \\nSpaceship! \\nSpaceship! \\nAll units, attack that spaceship. Spaceship! \\nWhere\\'d he go? \\nSpaceship! \\nWyldstyle, look... \\n...it\\'s the citizens! \\nTallyho! \\nYee-haw! \\nAnd don\\'t forget us MasterBuilders. What is going on? \\nPage 51/60\\nYou stop... \\n...building that stuff! \\nJust stop it! \\nGreatjob! \\nThis might actually work. \\n\\'Twas your speech \\nwhich roused this hearty crew. If only Emmet were here to see this. He\\'d say something adorable like... Am I just gonna keep... \\n...falling... \\n...forever? \\nIs this another vision? \\nWhere am I? \\nIs that the Office Tower? \\nBricksburg! \\nWhat was that? \\nNo, no, no. \\nNo! \\nSpaceship, spaceship, spaceship! - Pew! \\nWhat in the world is that? \\nIt\\'s adorable. \\nUh-oh. \\nNo. No. Whoa, no, no, no. \\nHey, don\\'t eat me. Don\\'t eat me. Do not eat me. Please. \\nHi, Emmet. \\nUh... \\nHi? \\nIs this The Man...? \\nThe Man Upstairs? \\nWhat happened? \\nNo, no, no, this is a disaster. Why...? Why...? What? What? \\nWhat? \\nWhy is the dragon on top \\nof the luxury condo development? But I was just playing... \\nI know it\\'s hard to understand... ...but this is Dad\\'s stuff, okay? All of this that you see before you... ...is all your father\\'s. \\nAnd everything is thought-out very... Page 52/60\\nWhat did you do down here? \\nDid you take the top off of the tower? It was an accident. \\nYou accidentally... \\n...expertly... \\n...carefully took the entire top off of that tower? \\nYes. \\nYou know the rules. This isn\\'t a toy. - Um, well, it kind of is. \\n- No. \\nActually, it\\'s a highly sophisticated interlocking brick system. \\n- But we bought it at the toy store. - We did. \\nBut the way I\\'m using it \\nmakes it an adult thing. \\nThe box for this one said ages 8 to 14. That\\'s a suggestion. \\nThey have to put that on there. You can\\'t expect me to be able to resist playing with all this. You have your stuff over near \\nthe Christmas decorations. \\nAll those bricks, \\nyou can build anything you want. Finn, we\\'re gonna play a little game. It\\'s called: \\n\"Let\\'s Put Everything Back \\nthe Way You Found It. \" \\nBut, Dad, you don\\'t understand. So I can make things \\nthe way they\\'re supposed to be. Permanently. \\nMore Kragles? \\nThis rebellion ends right now. Commencing... \\n...micro-management. \\nOh, no. No! \\nHa, ha! Fire in the hole! \\nWait, what\\'s happening? \\nNo, wait! No, we\\'re going down! Mayday! \\nNo! \\nPage 53/60\\nMeow. Meow. \\nHold on, Jeff. We\\'re coming for you! No! \\nStop! \\nOh, no! \\nArr, there be too many Micro-managers! What am I holding here? \\n- It\\'s a battleship. \\n- No, it\\'s a hodgepodge. That\\'s what it is. What\\'s Batman doing on it? \\nWhat is this, a robot pirate? \\nDang it. \\nStop! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop! You got glue all over \\nthat construction worker. \\nHere. Give that to me. \\nStop it! Stop it! Stop it! \\nAll of those are my friends! No, stop it! Ye were a hearty crew. But it be... It be over. \\nNo! \\nThe Piece of Resistance! \\nI can still save them! \\nLet\\'s get this gunk \\noff this construction worker. \\nHe\\'s notjust a construction worker, Dad. He\\'s the hero. \\nNope, he\\'s not. \\nHe is a ordinary, regular... \\n...generic construction worker... ...and I need to put him back \\nwhere he belongs. \\nNow, where is my X-Acto knife? \\nI gotta get the Piece of Resistance. If I could get the attention \\nof the smaller creature... \\nI gotta move. \\nWhere is that? \\nMove! \\nAll right. \\nMove! \\nNow, I didn\\'t move... \\nOw. \\nUh, Dad? \\nPage 54/60\\n- Yeah. \\nI think I saw the X-Acto over there near Middle Zealand. \\nOh, great. Thank you. \\nWelcome. \\nIt\\'s up to you now, Emmet. \\nBelieve. \\nI know that sounds like a cat poster... ...but it\\'s true. \\nWhoa! \\nSorry, street. \\nHo-ho! \\nI can see everything. \\nHa, ha! \\nWhat the heck is this? \\nI am a MasterBuilder. \\nRelease every Micro-manager we have! Let\\'s get him, fellas! \\nHey, everyone! \\n- Emmet! \\n- Emmet! Yay! \\nLucy, I\\'m going inside that thing. You\\'ve got it, Emmet. \\nTake that! Ha, ha! \\nGood night! Come here! \\nWe\\'ll help you out, kid. \\nHere\\'s how we do it pirate-style! Yes! Emmet! That\\'s it! \\nTake him down, boys! \\nEmmet! \\nStay positive. \\nThey\\'re tearing me apart! \\nStay positive. \\nCome on! \\nOh, forget it! \\nYou all need to be more friendly! Emmet, go! \\nGo! Now\\'s your... \\n...chance! \\nShe\\'s right! \\n- You can do it, me laddie! \\nGo on, kid. Get in there! \\nSir, we got an intrud...! \\nLord Business. \\nPage 55/60\\nBack from the dead, Brickowski? \\nWell, you\\'re too late! \\nSkeletrons, get him! \\nArgh! I can\\'t move! \\nYou see, your friends... \\n...oh, they\\'re fnished! \\nMy world is almost fnished. \\nThe last thing I need to do is finish... ...you. \\n- No, stop! Please! \\nIf you do one more thing, \\nI\\'m gonna unleash my secret weapon. Your secret weapon? \\nYes, it\\'s called: \\nThe Power of The Special. \\nThat sounds dumb. \\nAll right, here it comes. \\nMy secret weapon... \\n...is this. \\nWhat is that? Is it super small? \\nI don\\'t see anything. \\nIt\\'s my hand. I want you to take it. You want me to take your hand off? \\nNo, I want you to join me. \\nLook at all of these things that people built. You might see a mess... \\nExactly. And a bunch \\nof weird, dorky stuff... \\n...that ruined my perfectly good stuff! Okay. What I see... \\n...are people inspired by each other... ...and by you. \\nPeople taking what you made... \\n...and making something new out of it. Finn, did you make all of this? \\nThe people are trying to stop \\nPresident Business... \\n...from using the Kragle. \\nWhat\\'s the Kragle? \\nUm, it\\'s in there. \\nIn here? \\nSo President Business is the bad guy? Lf... \\nIf the construction guy... \\nPage 56/60\\n...said something \\nto President Business... \\n...what would he say? \\nYou... \\n...don\\'t have to be... \\n...the bad guy. \\nYou... \\n...are the most talented... \\n...most interesting... \\n...and most extraordinary person in the universe. \\nAnd you are capable of amazing things... ...because you are The Special. \\nAnd so am I. \\nAnd so is everyone. \\nThe prophecy is made-up... \\n...but it\\'s also true. \\nIt\\'s about all of us. \\nRight now, it\\'s about you. \\nAnd you... \\n...still... \\n...can change everything. \\nOh, we got a hugger. \\nBe careful. \\nI have been told it might explode. Phew. \\nEmmet, thank you. \\nAnd I just want you to know, \\nfrom the bottom of my heart... \\n...from this moment forward... \\n...I solemnly promise that I will never... Emmet! \\nHey, everyone! Is everyone okay? Where\\'s Lucy? \\nEmmet! \\nLucy! \\nWe did it. \\nOh. Uh, Emmet, wait. \\nBatman, there\\'s something \\nI need to say to you. \\nNo. Wyldstyle... \\nI mean... \\n...Lucy. \\nHe\\'s the hero you deserve. \\nPage 57/60\\nUh... \\n- Thanks, Batman. \\nI liked Emmet before it was cool. Whoops, I have the antidote for the Kragle. How did that happen? \\nYay! \\n- De-Kragler. \\nWatch this. \\n- Yay! \\n- Oh, Mommy, Daddy. \\nYou\\'re okay! \\n- Oh, son! \\n- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. \\nWe\\'re okay, son. Ha, ha. \\nGuys, time to come up for dinner. It\\'s Taco Tuesday, your favorite. - Okay, honey. We\\'ll be up in a sec. - Yeah, we\\'ll be up in a sec! \\n- I gotta tell you something. \\nWhat? \\nNow that I\\'m letting you \\ncome down here and play... \\n...guess who else gets to \\ncome down here and play? \\n- Who? \\n- Your sister. \\nWhat? \\nWell, things sure have a way \\nof working out smoothly. \\nAm I right, guys? \\nWhat? \\nWe\\'re from the Planet Duplon. \\nWe are here to destroy you. \\nOh, man. \\nYes, this is real music. \\nDark, brooding... \\n...important... \\n...groundbreaking. \\nCheck out the lyrics. \\nDarkness \\nNo parents \\nContinued darkness \\nMore darkness.

God, I still can\\'t get that song out of my head. \\nIt\\'s truly amazing how many LEGO fans there are around the world... \\n...who love to create short films using LEGO bricks. \\nThe filmmakers of The LEGO Movie, Chris and Phil... \\n...thought it would be fun to challenge the ReBrick community... \\nThat\\'s LEGO\\'s official \\nsocial media platform. \\n- To come up with an original brick film between 15 and 30 seconds... \\n...with the winning entry being featured during The LEGO Movie. How cool is that? Look at all these things that people built. Just to make it a bit more challenging, entries had to incorporate the theme... ...of a LEGO mini figure changing up their environment to fight off a bad guy. Well, the ReBrick community went to work and created some really fun... \\n...and really incredible mini movies entirely made out of LEGO bricks. We\\'re giving you the opportunity \\nto see some of the top entries... ...along with the winning submissions. So be ready to be blown away \\nPage 59/60\\nby LEGO awesomeness. \\nRoll it. \\nAwesome. \\nPage 60/60\\n\\n\\n\\nScripts.com \\nTransformers: Age of Extinction \\nBy Ehren Kruger \\nPage 1/70\\nShit. \\nDarcy, you really shouldn\\'t have come.

Over 1,300 dead. \\nMuch of the city has been destroyed. Homeland Security is urging everyone to report suspicious alien activity. A swift act of Congress \\nput an end to all joint operations between the military and the Autobots, ending the alliance. \\nAs this committee knows, \\nthe Invasion of Chicago \\nwas a defining day \\nfor our nation five years ago. \\nThe day millions of people realized that never again can we allow aliens to fight our battles for us. \\nA handful of Autobots \\nwere given sanctuary \\nafter joint-combat operations \\nwere abolished. \\nFewer than a dozen Decepticons \\nare still on the run \\nthanks to our CIA unit, \\n\"Cemetery Wind.\" \\nHurry, let\\'s get it \\nto my house, guys. \\nAs for the alien technology, \\nour objective remains \\nto keep it in American control. Page 4/70\\nHi. My name is Timothy. \\nThis is my crew. \\nWe found this alien ball turret in Chicago. \\nWe just found it in the rubble \\nand it\\'s all working... \\nWord has it Japan, India, \\nthe Israelis may have gotten their hands on a couple of ships. \\nApparently the Russians \\nare starting a bidding war. \\nWe\\'re taking $5,000 for it. \\nIt\\'s got 36 guns, alien shit. \\nA new era has begun. \\nAnd the age of the Transformers is over. Hey. \\nHey, I\\'ve been waiting for you. You\\'re looking hot today! \\nYeah? \\nHow about you take your shirt off? You want me to take my shirt off right now? \\nWhat would your dad think of that? - What the hell? \\n- Hey, where you going? \\nI cannot believe him. \\nI cannot believe this. \\nWhat the hell? \\nAll the way! \\nA truck? \\nDad, please tell me \\nyou didn\\'t spend our money on this. No, don\\'t worry, he didn\\'t. \\nHe spent my money. \\nA hundred and fifty bucks of it. As an advance \\non your regular paycheck. \\n- What regular paycheck? \\n- Which you will get back. \\n- When? \\n- Never. We\\'re broke. \\nI knew it. \\nSweetheart, could you please not drive a wedge \\nPage 5/70\\nbetween employer and employee. \\nHold on. I thought we were partners. Look, I came up short, okay? \\nI had to buy her a prom dress. \\nYou want me to deny her a prom dress? You might as well. \\nYou denied her a prom date. \\nNo, I offered to take her and chaperone. Nobody wants to go to the dance \\nwith their dad. It\\'s weird. \\nIt\\'s not the issue. \\nWell, maybe it should be. \\nHey, could you guys \\njust get off my case? \\nYou know what the engine \\non this runs for? \\nI can break it down and strip it for parts. And sweetheart, your shorts \\nare shrinking by the second, okay? Cold water, air dry, please. \\nI think she looks hot. \\nWhat did you say? \\nLike a hot teenager. \\nIt\\'s the \"teenager\" thing \\nthat makes it better. Thank you. \\nIt didn\\'t sound like what it meant. That goes by the circuit boards. \\nPut the Zeiss lenses over there. \\nDad, please. You can\\'t keep \\nspending money on junk \\njust so you can turn it \\ninto different junk. \\nWe do not use the \"J\" word in here. That is a Super Simplex \\ntheater projector. It\\'s very rare. What about the SmilePilot? \\nOr the Exer-Mower that I invented? Simply ahead of their time. \\nYeah, like the alleged Guard-Dawg. You\\'re gonna get him upset. \\nHey, Cade! Cade! \\nThis thing still work? \\n- No! \\n- Yes. \\nPage 6/70\\nYes, and still groundbreaking. Go back there and lay on the recliner and just wait for a cold one. \\nDude, stop breaking stuff. \\nFinal notice, late notice, past due. Come on, come on. \\nBring Daddy the alcohol. Come on. I mean, what is all this crap \\npeople send you? \\nThat\\'s a Discman \\nand that\\'s an 8-track tape. \\n- Music. \\n- Never heard of it. \\nLook, I fix that, \\nit\\'s 100 bucks. I fix that, it\\'s $250. If I would have been able to fix that before you broke it even more, it would have been 20 bucks. \\nThis stuff is what\\'s \\ngonna put you through college, as long as you land \\none of those scholarships. \\nWhat\\'s the estimated time of arrival, usually? Average? \\nWait. So it just brings \\nthe beer near you? \\nThat\\'s the trick? \\n- It\\'s got a couple kinks, man. - Yeah. \\nDad, you think maybe some things should never be invented? \\nNo, I don\\'t. That\\'s backwards thinking. This is a temple of technology. You guys are standing in a holy place. What do you think? \\nWhy don\\'t you look at all of this? This could be yours. \\nWhat about this land? \\nPurple People Eater\\'s back \\nand she looks hungry. \\nIsn\\'t this incredible? \\n- I knew you would like it. \\n- Hey, you! \\nHey. \\nPage 7/70\\nI own this house! It\\'s not for sale! Six months late on payments, \\nMr. Yeager. \\nAnd I see you stealing power \\nat the pole. \\nHey, that\\'s not your concern. \\n- Sir, do you wanna see the property? - Sure. \\nI\\'d be more than happy \\nto give you a tour. \\nI\\'ll show you three other buyers I got buried out back, \\nthen I\\'ll crack your head open \\nlike an egg! \\n- Whoa! Whoa! \\n- Stay back! He\\'s crazy. \\nI told you don\\'t come back here \\nanymore. \\nI will have my brother come back and beat your ass! \\n- Don\\'t you start with me. \\n- Why don\\'t you do it yourself? \\nAnd I\\'ll bring the police \\nwhen I come, too! \\n- My brother ain\\'t no joke! \\n- Who, Jerry? \\nYou bring his big ass up here, \\nhe\\'s gonna be huffing and puffing before he can squeeze out of that car! You back out on my grass, \\nyou\\'re gonna be in big trouble! \\nYou tell Jerry to come see me. \\nI\\'ll give him some pecan pie. \\nHey! \\nShe smashed through the fence? \\nCade, relax. \\nYou\\'re going to have an aortic infarction. What is that? \\nI think it\\'s a brain heart attack. Yeah, I\\'ve had one already. \\nSo we\\'re stealing power now? \\nNo, we\\'re borrowing it \\nfrom the neighbors. \\nGreat. That\\'s awesome. \\nPage 8/70\\nOnce I graduate and I\\'m gone, \\nwho\\'s gonna take care of you? \\nYou take care of me? \\nWho taught you how to solder a circuit? Or write a program? \\nOr French braid your hair? \\nOr throw a spiral? Me. That\\'s what I do. Who taught you how to cook \\nwithout ketchup, \\nor balance your checkbook? \\nWho always has to be the grownup around here? \\nAll right, you got a point, okay? But that means we\\'re a great team. And I know it\\'s been sucky \\naround here lately. \\nBut we\\'re gonna be fine, sweetie. You just gotta keep believing, okay? I mean, that\\'s what great inventors do. I promise you, one day, \\nI\\'m gonna build something that matters. I believe you, Dad. \\nYou know, your mom \\nwould be very proud of you. \\nIt\\'s going to be okay. \\nSpread out! Push right! \\nRoll, roll, roll, roll. \\nGive me two. Give me two. \\nTake the beach, nice and easy. \\nAll right, hold what you got. \\nRelease the mini-drones. \\nVipers. \\nEagle in sight.

Please! \\nHold your fire. \\nHold! Hold fire! \\nCan you not see? I\\'ve been injured. Box him in. Box him in. \\nMedical Officer Ratchet! I\\'m a friend! I\\'m an Autobot! \\nThen why are you running? \\nOptimus sent this distress message. Calling all Autobots. \\nWe are under targeted attack. \\nCease all contact with humans. We\\'re all hiding. \\nAll Autobots are being hunted. We\\'re all in danger. \\nI lost a sister in Chicago. \\nYou\\'ll get no sympathy from me. What\\'s wrong with you humans? \\nNo! Please. \\nCheck fire, check fire! \\nHe\\'s mine now. \\nLockdown. \\nAutobots, Decepticons. \\nLike little children, always fighting. Making a mess out of the universe. Then I\\'ve got to clean it up. \\nThere is one way you survive. \\nTell me where he\\'s hiding. \\nWhere is Optimus Prime? \\nNever. \\nNever is here. \\nPage 10/70\\nI must say, it is remarkable, \\nreally astounding, \\nthe success that the CIA has had since you have taken \\noperational control, \\nand so the President \\nhas asked me to ask you \\nto ask him, \\nto invite you both \\nover to the White House \\njust to powwow, \\nwhere we get maybe \\nsome more specifics about how \\nexactly you\\'re hunting \\nthe enemy Decepticons left. \\nI\\'ve had my desk for two years. \\nMr. Attinger has been here for 25. He runs the projects \\nwhere I don\\'t ask for specifics. That\\'s why they\\'re called Black Ops. And why we all sleep better at night. Check. That is great. So, um... \\nAny dirt on that? \\nHow, that\\'s going? \\nOutstanding. \\nGreat. Great. \\nI was hoping to hear that. \\nThe President will be pleased. \\n\\'Cause, I\\'ll tell you right now, I\\'ve only been Chief of Staff since Monday, um, but I do know that \\nthe alien war stuff, these are... These are the only fun meetings. Look, I\\'m not here \\nto entertain the President, \\nbut you may tell him \\nthat the war will be over. \\nSoon. \\n\"...be over...\" In case he asks, I just like to have an exact quote. \"War will be over soon.\" \\nThat is great. Such good news. \\nAnd, um, the President would, \\nI know, just love... \\nPage 11/70\\nReally, really love to press the flesh... Not flesh, obviously, \\nbut just maybe get a shot with, um... Is it Lord Prime? Sir Prime? \\nWe could bop on Air Force One. \\nIt\\'d be just a quick bop, \\nthen we just bop in and bop back. I wouldn\\'t get his hopes up \\non that one. \\nOkay. \\nHe\\'s called Optimus Prime. \\nAlien combatant. Here illegally. But aren\\'t they our friends? Why? Because our world \\nwill never truly be safe \\ntill all of them are gone. \\nWell, I would hope we could do \\na much more ceremonial farewell. Especially since our military \\nhas worked so closely with them. - Until you. \\n- It\\'s not their planet. \\nNever was. \\nTime we take it back. \\nAll right, come on. Come on. \\nYes. Yes. \\nYes. \\nThere you go. \\nNo, hold it. \\nStop shaking! Why are you shaking? You have the job! \\nYou forgot to eat dinner! \\nYou see why I worry? \\nLook, sorry, sweetie, I... \\nI almost got it working right. \\nSo, listen, I\\'m done with homework and set with finals, \\nso I was just gonna take a little drive with some friends \\nif that was okay with you. \\nNo boys, I know. Graduate first. Exactly. \\nYou do know \\nno one else has this rule, right? Page 12/70\\nRule? Don\\'t make it sound harsh, okay. It\\'s wisdom. \\nI don\\'t think we need to be \\ndriving around in the middle of the night. It\\'s already like quarter to eight. It\\'s almost dark. \\nSpud, will you stop it? \\nYou know where I was \\nfor my graduation? \\nYes. With me, the mistake. \\nThe surprise, Tess. \\nAnd the best thing that ever happened. Do we look unhappy? \\nNo. It\\'s the greatest day of my life. I made your mother a promise \\nbefore she passed. \\nOur baby\\'s gonna be at her graduation. That\\'s it. \\nHigh school boys know nothing. \\nIt\\'s only later they turn into men. So if you were older and wiser, \\nI wouldn\\'t exist. \\nThat\\'s not what I meant. \\nYou know, this is \\na non-dating household, okay? \\nYou don\\'t date, I don\\'t date. That\\'s it. Well, maybe you should. \\nTessa, wait. \\nTessa? \\nLook. \\nI know I\\'ve been on you, okay? \\nBut I have to be. \\nTwelve to seventeen \\nis the official teenage danger window. It\\'s my job to get you through it. So you can be pissed off all you want. And, yes, you can take a ride \\nwith your friends. \\nOkay. \\nDon\\'t work all night. \\nAnd eat. \\nBest thing that ever happened, Emily. She\\'s the best thing that ever happened. You\\'d be proud. \\nPage 13/70\\nNo. \\nUnbelievable. \\nUnbelievable. God! \\nSomething in here needs to \\nmake this family some money. \\nCome on, you old wreck. \\nJudgment Day. \\nWhere is he? \\nI don\\'t know. \\nIntruder alert! Intruder alert! Asshole. \\nI am dialing 911. \\nTess, I\\'m basically your uncle. Su casa es mi casa. \\nAnd we\\'re going to lose the casa. Dad! \\nComing! \\nAre you working with lasers? \\nIf so, I\\'m not coming in. \\nYou guys have never seen \\na truck like this before. \\nGet in here. Lock that door. \\nIt doesn\\'t have a lock. \\nLook! Look at the hole in the radiator. Look at the size of it. \\nSomething blew a hole in it! \\nYeah, so? \\nIt\\'s not normal steel. \\nThe shrapnel in the engine, \\nit ripped all the connections apart. And watch. \\nAnd this took some Cade genius. You are gonna love this. \\nWhen I hook this back \\nto a working battery... \\nCalling all... \\nCalling all Autobots. \\nYeah. \\nI don\\'t think it\\'s a truck at all. I think we just found a Transformer. Tran... \\n- Evacuate! \\n- Wait! Guys! \\nDad, are you out of your mind? Page 14/70\\nYou need to get that thing out of here. You don\\'t have to worry. I\\'ve been in there working all night. I\\'m fine. You know what? \\nThat\\'s not a truck, okay? You\\'re right. It\\'s an alien killing machine. - Dude. It\\'s DOA. \\n- Jesus. \\nIt\\'s been recalled, totaled, done. So, listen, \\nthere\\'s a number that you call. You\\'re supposed to call the government. It\\'s the American thing to do. - Here we go. \\n- You\\'re supposed to call, \\nand if it ends up being alien, then you win $25,000. \\nYou don\\'t win money. \\nAnd if you can capture it live... Like tag it like a wild wildebeest, then you get $100,000. \\n- Dad, we\\'re making the call. \\n- I heard that. \\nI\\'ve seen the commercial. They don\\'t say that. That\\'s not a guarantee. You think Greg would lie to me? Look, if that\\'s a Transformer there from the Battle of Chicago, \\nI need to know how it works. \\nI\\'m an inventor. \\nThis could be a game changer for me! If I can apply that technology to my inventions, \\nwe\\'d never have to \\nworry about money again. \\nI\\'ve heard that before. \\nTwenty-five grand! \\nIt pays for my college. \\nIt pays for the house. \\nBesides, you used my money \\nto buy the truck, right? \\nSo technically, that\\'s my truck. Don\\'t you think? \\nYou also signed a contract \\nPage 15/70\\nregarding all research lab I.P. Research lab? It\\'s a barn, dude. You signed it and now you\\'re competing. Any idea of yours is mine. \\nAny thought you have, I own it, so basically, I own you. \\nI don\\'t think you can own someone. That was, like, a while ago, \\neven in Texas. \\nAll right. Bring the torch over and help me with the pulley arm. I think the shrapnel \\ntook out its power core. \\nAnd, Tessa, you see this? \\nWould an alien killing machine let me do that? \\nLook, I\\'ll make the call. \\nWe\\'ll get the money. \\nJust first let me see if I\\'m right. You want to hide in the house? Go ahead. \\nOkay. \\nLet\\'s go. Pulley arm. \\nI can\\'t believe him! \\nWhat is that? Looks like a missile. It is! Whoa! \\nDad! \\nThere\\'s a missile in the family room! Holy... \\nI\\'ll kill you! \\nNo! No! \\nDad, there\\'s a missile in... \\nI\\'ll kill you! Stay back! \\n- No. Don\\'t shoot. Don\\'t shoot! - Call 911! Run! \\n- Lucas! \\n- Stop! \\nLucas? Don\\'t move, just calm down. Easy, human. \\nStay there. He\\'s not going to hurt us. Weapons systems damaged. \\nA missile hit your engine. \\nAnd we took it out of you. \\nYou\\'re hurt really bad. \\nPage 16/70\\nI\\'m just trying to help you. \\nYou\\'re in my home now. \\nI\\'m an engineer. \\nMy name is Cade Yeager. \\nCade, I am in your debt. \\nMy name is Optimus Prime. \\nMy Autobots. \\nThey\\'re in danger. \\nI need to go. I need to go now. How far you think you\\'re gonna get? Tessa, come here. He needs our help. What happened to you? \\nAn ambush. A trap. Set by humans. I escaped and took this form. \\nBut you\\'re on our side. \\nWhy would humans hurt you? \\nThey were not alone. \\n- My Autobots can repair me. \\n- Yeah. \\nIf you can reach \\'em. \\nWhat about me? \\nI warn you, Mr. Attinger of Earth, an alliance is a contract, and contracts, like humans, \\nexpire. \\nOn this planet, we have a saying. \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\" I also have a saying. \\n\"I don\\'t care.\" \\nSo what happened in Mexico City? I thought you had him. \\nThree direct hits. A mortal wound. Then your men allowed him to escape. You promised me human intelligence. Or is there such a thing? \\nYou know, you\\'ve still never told me. Why do you want him? \\nWho are you working for? \\nEvery galaxy I\\'ve traveled, \\nall you species are the same. \\nYou all think \\nyou\\'re the center of the universe. You have no idea. \\nGo to the hardware store \\nPage 17/70\\nand you get the list. \\nThe whole list. \\nWhat, you\\'re going to try and fix him? He\\'s not a model train set, Cade. No, that\\'s right. He\\'s important. Yeah, but important to who? \\nYou can\\'t keep an alien \\nlocked up in your barn. \\nWhat are you gonna do, play with him? - Will you calm down? \\n- I\\'m trying to, \\nbut I just got hit in the head with a ten-foot cannon! \\nIf he eats you, I get the GTO. Not a word to anybody. \\nDo you hear me? \\nNot a single word. \\nNobody. \\nI think we have a lock \\non a high-value target. \\nSpecial Operations group is ready. What do you got? \\nSir, Special Ops just got a call from Paris, Texas. \\nHard match on the truck \\nseen leaving Mexico City. \\nSon of a bitch. Let\\'s go get him. Took a hell of a hit, you know. The missile just missed \\nyour power source. \\nWe call it a Spark. \\nIt contains our life force \\nand our memories. \\nYeah, we call it a soul. \\nScramble Cemetery Wind. \\nThank you for your efforts, \\nladies and gentlemen. \\nThis room is going dark. \\nThe exit is on your left. \\n- I\\'ll take it from here. \\n- Okay, let\\'s go. \\nI\\'m with Cemetery Wind. \\nWe\\'re on the move. \\nRepeat, on the move. \\nPage 18/70\\nCade. \\nWhy are you willing to help me? I guess maybe because you trust me to. I\\'m back! \\nTook you long enough! \\nMy head hurts. I had to go to the doctor. I got a welt on my head \\nthat makes me look \\nlike a fricking Star Trek character. Whatever. \\nLook! Look! \\nWe\\'re on property. \\nViper 15 overhead. Angels 1. \\nDad! \\nMr. Yeager, my name\\'s James Savoy. I\\'m a federal agent. \\nMy men and I are trying to track down an abandoned truck. \\nIt\\'s a nice spread you got here. Too bad she\\'s for sale. \\nWell, thanks. She\\'s not. \\nThat the truck you mean? \\nAfraid not. \\nYou know, Mr. Yeager, \\nwe received a call from someone concerned about this truck. \\nNo. \\nThat wasn\\'t you? \\nOnly thing I\\'m concerned about \\nis you being on my property \\nwithout permission. \\nYou know, we got a rule about people messing with people from Texas. And I don\\'t know what truck \\nyou\\'re talking about. \\nThe kind that cost American lives. Search the property! \\nWhat do you mean, \\n\"Search the property\"? \\nYou don\\'t have a warrant. \\nMy face is my warrant. \\nWait. But if you guys do find a truck, we get a reward, right? \\nViper 15 holding, point alpha. \\nPage 19/70\\nCharlie team, hold tight. \\nLock it down. \\n- Open, open, open. \\n- Short wall. Short wall. \\nFive in. Five in. \\nIntruder alert! \\nBack away from the premises. \\n- What the hell is that? \\n- Just some dumb inventor. \\nClear. \\nClear. \\nClear right. \\nClear. \\n360. 720. Heads on a swivel. \\nLet\\'s go. There\\'s nothing here. There\\'s no signs. We got nothing. Sir, we have a live armed missile in the trash. \\nLive? I carried that to the trash! You told me that was a dud, dude. I could be dead. Right? \\nLook. \\nOkay, yes, I found a truck, all right. I towed it back for the parts. \\nI left it here last night. \\nThis morning, it\\'s gone. \\nWhen? Where? I don\\'t know. \\nI swear to God. \\nThat\\'s as much as I know about him. \"Him.\" \\nHe said, \"Him.\" \\nHe knows who the son of a bitch is. - Mr. Yeager. \\n- What? \\nExcuse me. \\nYou just said, \"Him.\" \\n- Take them down. \\n- What? \\nLet me go! \\nThey don\\'t know about the truck! I know! Just let her go. \\nWhat kind of a man \\nbetrays his flesh-and-blood \\nbrethren for alien metal? \\nPage 20/70\\n- Get this guy out of my sight. - Get off! \\nLet her go! \\nThey don\\'t know about the truck. All right! Load up! Search the perimeter! Lucas, you called, didn\\'t you? \\nNo! \\nI don\\'t know any of these scary guys. God! You\\'re manhandling a woman! I\\'ll kick your ass! \\nLet her go! \\n- Daddy! Let me go! \\n- You\\'re not going anywhere. \\n- Daddy! \"\" \\nNo! You\\'re not taking me anywhere! I\\'m an American! \\n- Easy, sweetheart. \\n- Okay, okay, okay. \\nAll right. Okay. All right. I was wrong. Savoy. Use the girl. \\nMy God! \\nNow, you got ten seconds. \\nWhere\\'s the truck? \\n- You\\'re gonna shoot my little girl? - If I have to. \\nPlease don\\'t shoot me! Please! \\nLook, I don\\'t know. I told you \\neverything that I know! He\\'s gone. He left. \\nHe was in the barn, I swear to God! - Just let her go!- \\nPlease, please. \\nHe was in there! Let her go! \\nSeven seconds. \\nI\\'m telling you the truth! \\nHe was in there! \\nDad! \\nTell him to get away \\nfrom my little girl now! \\nDad! \\nYou touch her and I\\'ll kill you! You got two seconds. \\nI need the truth. \\n- Please. \\nPage 21/70\\n- Shoot her. \\nHere I am! \\nGet down! \\nCade! \\nThey\\'re going to kill you! Get out of here! Push right! Headed to the house! \\nCome on. Hurry up! Get in the car! - Let\\'s go! \\n- Daddy, get in the car! \\nPerimeter, Optimus moving your way! What\\'s happening, baby? \\nWho are they? \\nIt\\'s the truck. They want the truck! \"Who are they\"? Who are you, \\nand who are you calling \"baby\"? \\nI know you heard me. \\n- I\\'m her boyfriend! \\n- He\\'s my boyfriend! \\nWhat? You\\'re not her boyfriend! \\nHis name\\'s Shane and he drives, Dad. What kind of cars are those? \\nThey\\'re so scary! \\nThere\\'s another one \\ncoming up the back! \\nYou gotta try to lose them \\nin the cornfield! \\nHe\\'s coming up behind us! Go! \\nViper 15, \\nrunning on fumes. RTB. \\nThey\\'ve got us cornered! \\nWatch out, \\nwatch out, watch out! \\nMr. Yeager, this is not \\nhow I wanted us to meet, okay? \\nI\\'m Shane, and I\\'m a completely... And I am not talking to you! \\nDrive the car! \\nWatch out! Watch out! \\nThrow \\'em some warning shots! \\nMan, I don\\'t know how \\nI\\'m driving this good. \\nIt\\'s like, today \\nI\\'ve gone to a whole other level. Road, focus! Stop talking! \\nPage 22/70\\nShane, look out! \\nThis may be primarily my fault, okay. They said \\nthey were gonna bring a check! \\nI didn\\'t know they were gonna send a death squad! \\nHang on! \\nHey, we got ourselves a winner! Don\\'s got it over here. \\nLook out! \\nWe lost them! \\nGood job, stranger from the cornfields! The scary cars are back. \\nLose them at the factory, Shane! I thought you knew \\nhow to drive this thing! Go! \\nI don\\'t think we\\'re gonna get that money. Doesn\\'t seem like it. \\nCade! \\nTake \\'em upstairs! \\nWe\\'re losing them on the fifth floor. - Do that thing, Shane! \\n- You know it. \\nWhat do you mean? What thing? \\nWhat we\\'re about to do \\nis gonna be kind of scary. \\nTake out your guns and shoot them! They\\'re shooting at us! \\n- Tessa, grab my stick! Grab my stick! - What? \\nShe\\'s got \\nthe best hands in the business. Ready, Tess? Pull! \\n- No! No! No! \\n- No f-ing way! \\nYeah! \\nYeah! \\nTessa, you are so grounded! \\nShit! The rim\\'s cracked. \\nOptimus. Come on, move! Move! \\nMy foot\\'s stuck! Wait, Cade! \\n- Lucas! \\n- Wait! Wait! \\nLucas! Lucas, above you! \\nPage 23/70\\nRun! \\nCome on, get in, let\\'s go! \\nI\\'ll bet you wish \\nyou could see my face right now. Lucas, we just left him? \\nHe\\'s gone. \\nMy deepest sympathies \\nfor the loss of your friend. \\nStay here till I\\'m sure \\nwe weren\\'t followed. \\nWe are all targets now. \\nSo we\\'re hiding out now? \\nThat\\'s the plan? \\nWe\\'re taking orders from a truck? Well, you got a better idea? \\nHey, move away from her, kid. Don\\'t... Keep your hands off her. All right? No. You got your ass kicked \\nby a garage inventor from Texas. That goes on your resume. \\nYeah, it goes on all of yours, too! Do I look like I\\'m in the mood \\nfor any of your shit today? \\nWashington thinks \\nwe were chasing a Decepticon target, but our story falls apart \\nif we don\\'t find this Yeager family first. Yeah, well, what if he goes \\nto the cops or the FBI? \\nThey know to hand him over. \\nHis world as he knows it is gone. Well, bright side, you guys met. Where is he from? \\nI told you, he\\'s a driver from Texas. Texas? \\nWhere, Dublin, Texas? \\nShamrock, Texas? \\nSo why does he sound \\nlike a leprechaun? \\nYou\\'d get your ass kicked in Ireland for saying that. \\nWell, we\\'re not in Ireland, \\nLucky Charms. We\\'re in Texas. \\nAnd so he drives? \\nPage 24/70\\nWhat do you mean, he drives? \\nLike, for a living? \\nYeah. At least he makes a living. Thank you. \\nLook, I race rally cars. \\nOne driver. \\nOne navigator. Her. \\nBy the way, I\\'m totally legit. \\nI just got picked up by Red Bull. And just so you know, \\nmy life savings \\nwas in that car back there. \\n- This is not happening. \\n- It definitely is. \\nHow old are you? \\nTwenty. \\nShe\\'s a 17-year-old girl. \\nSo we can work this two ways. \\nOne, I punch you right in the mouth and you call the police on me. \\nDad. Or two, \\nI just call the cops on you \\nbecause this is illegal. She\\'s a minor. We\\'re protected by \\nthe Romeo and Juliet laws. \\nWe dated for a little while. \\nI was a sophomore, \\nand he was a senior. It\\'s fine. \\nNo, it\\'s not fine. \\nWe\\'ve got a preexisting \\njuvenile foundational relationship. - Statute 22.011. \\n- What? \\nTexas statute? \\n- That a real law? \\n- Yep. \\nRomeo and Juliet? \\n- You know how those two ended up? - In love. \\nDead. Do your parents know about this? Is your dad okay with you \\ndating a 17-year-old girl? \\nHe took off when I was five, \\nbut if I ever bump into him, I\\'ll ask him. Page 25/70\\nYou know, Tessa, \\n- I trusted you. \\n- To what? \\nNever have fun, take a risk, \\nbe a normal teenager, like you? I am your father, okay? \\nAnd I have been busting my ass to take care of you. \\nIs that what you were doing \\nwhen you brought home the truck? All you had to do was report it, and now Lucas is dead. \\nAnd my life is over. Thank you. You\\'ve taken real good care of me. Please don\\'t shoot me! \\nPlease! Dad! \\nThey were willing to kill her. Then they still are. \\nSomebody somewhere gave \\nthat order. \\nI\\'m going to find some fingerprints. Please! \\nNo! \\nI\\'m an Autobot! I\\'m an Autobot! Grab whatever you think \\nwe can use for supplies. \\nClothes, anything. \\nAnd take that computer. \\nLet\\'s go. \\nThis is not easy. \\nYou know, \\nyou don\\'t suck at everything, Dad. What the... \\nI knew it. \\nYou told me he was no one. \\nWell, \\nthis \"no one\" has our tech. \\n\"OPTIMUS ON RADIO\". \\nCalling all Autobots. \\nCalling all Autobots. \\n- Whoa! My God! \\n- My God! \\nThat was insane! \\nIt was awesome, \\nPage 26/70\\nbut it was insane, right? \\nYeah! Hell, yeah! \\nHe\\'s back! He\\'s alive! \\nOptimus is here! \\nAt last. There is hope after all. Yeah. \\nMr. Leader of the Free Galaxy is back. I knew you\\'d make it. I never doubted. We got your warning. \\nWe\\'ve been waiting. \\nHell, yeah. Boom time. \\nWe got the gang back together. \\nHumans have asked us \\nto play by their rules. \\nWell, the rules have just changed. Human beings, \\nbunch of backstabbin\\' weasels. \\nHound, find your inner compass. Loyalty is but a flower \\nin the winds of fear and temptation. What the hell are you saying? \\n- It\\'s a haiku. \\n- Cut the crap, \\nbefore I drop a grenade \\ndown your throat. \\nTry it, you\\'ll be dead. \\nPlease pull it. Please do it. \\nYou know what, \\nit\\'ll save us so much time. \\nWell, raise your hand \\nif you\\'re thoroughly disenchanted with our little pleasant Earth vacation. So, who\\'s the stowaways? \\nWhoa, hey, what\\'s with the gun? Stop. Hound, both of you. \\nThey\\'ve risked their lives for mine. We owe them. \\nSo, there\\'s been no sign of any others? - Nada. \\n- We are all that\\'s left. \\nThey\\'re picking us off, \\none by one. \\nWe\\'re the pathetic, dirty foursome. And you make five. \\nPage 27/70\\nSo that\\'s our best-case scenario? Autobot witness protection? \\nHey, Speed Racer, \\nyou\\'re welcome to leave anytime. Well, for the record, Superdad, I\\'m not hiding with you. \\nI\\'m hiding outwith that big guy. Sensei, with your fate unknown, Bumblebee has held command, \\ndespite his complete \\nand total lack of anything \\nresembling warrior discipline. He\\'s like a child. \\nThis child is about to kick your ass. He brings us shame. \\nCage fight. \\nSmartass. \\nWhat\\'s the matter with them? \\nAm I the lone sage who sees through this puppy-dog eyes act? \\nIt\\'s beneath you. \\nYes, I\\'ve been waiting \\nfor them all to dispatch each other, so I could take charge \\nwith no trouble at all. \\nJust me reporting to me. \\nWell, it sure looks like \\nyou\\'ve been missed. \\nAutobots, Lockdown is hunting us and humans are helping. \\nWe need to know why. \\nWell, listen, I don\\'t know why, but I have an idea about who. \\nThis drone I stole recorded footage of an Autobot raid. \\nIt\\'s in pieces, \\nbut watch what happens here. \\nThat\\'s Leadfoot. \\nThey rip him apart. \\nSavages. \\nAnd later, this truck \\ncomes to haul him off. \\nKSI. Kinetic Solutions. \\nDefense, aerospace, \\nPage 28/70\\ngovernment contracts. \\nThey designed this drone. \\nSo these government guys \\njust hunt you down, \\nand then pass you off to this KSI? The company is headquartered \\nin Chicago. \\nThat could be where they were taken. No way to get inside without a battle. Well, what if you had \\nsome human help? \\n- What, are you two partners now? - Sweetie, we\\'re targets now, too. We need to know why \\nor we\\'ll never get our lives back. Autobots, \\nI have sworn to never kill humans. Big mistake. \\nBut when I find out who\\'s behind this, he\\'s going to die. \\nHooah! \\nThere\\'s a full-on \\nmanhunt out for us, \\nso we have some new rules. \\nAnyone who has got a badge \\nis not our friend. \\nWe\\'re gonna divide and conquer. You two in charge of stealing food and the essentials. And nothing else. Chicago KSI headquarters \\nis like a fortress. \\nI\\'m gonna find a way \\ninto their top-secret military wing. Find something to blackmail \\nthis company and the government. We\\'re gonna get our freedom back. Good morning, Mr. Joyce. \\nWhat was that sound? \\nThat\\'s \"the\" sound. \\nThat you asked for. \\nNo, I asked for boundless. \\nTranscendent. \\nWhen you walk through a door \\nin this building, \\nPage 29/70\\nit should sound like \\nyou\\'ve stepped into the future. Present. \\nSay it. \\nFuture. \\nThe past is history. The present is past. \"JOSHUA ON PA\". The future is now. Why can\\'t I get in touch with you? Don\\'t you realize \\nwhat the Arctic find means? \\nYou know that story \\nwe were all told as children \\nabout a giant asteroid \\nthat struck the Earth \\nmillions of years ago \\nand wiped out the dinosaurs? \\n- Vaguely. \\n- We were wrong. \\nThis metal caused the great extinction. How and why, I can\\'t yet say. \\nBut carbon dating puts it \\nat 65 million years B.C. \\nThis ore you\\'ve got us digging for is a lot more dangerous than you think. And my people... \\nDarcy, I think that you\\'ve been out in the field for far too long. Why don\\'t we discuss dinosaurs \\nover dinner? \\n- Ribs? \\n- Not a chance. \\nYou have no idea \\nwhat\\'s been happening here. \\nWe\\'re about to make the quantum leap. A rare-earth metal. \\nMolecularly unstable. \\nIndustrial uses, none. \\nAnd then the aliens came. \\nAnd we made the connection. \\nIt\\'s what they\\'re made of. \\nIt\\'s the Holy Grail. \\n\"Transformium.\" \\nThat\\'s what we\\'re calling it. \\nFocus-grouped. Catchy. \\nPage 30/70\\n- Trademarked. \\n- Yeah. \\nThis is the greatest advance \\nin modern physics \\nsince the splitting of the atom. It\\'s programmable matter. \\nAnd now, we\\'ve mapped its genome. - I. \\n- Now you\\'ve mapped its genome. And now we can begin to give it instructions. \\nThis is extremely good. \\nWatch this. \\nWe can change anything into anything. Sensual, almost. Don\\'t you think? Do you like music? \\nThe Pill. \\nPerhaps something a little more violent? My God. You\\'ve done it. \\nIn aerospace, the military... \\nWe will own the entire robotics industry. All exploration. \\nThe oceans. Space. Everything. \\nWembley. What is this? \\nThe jellyfish commercial \\nthat you wanted. \\nYou said they were erotic yet deadly, like women. \\nI never said that. \\n- Yes, you did. \\n- No, I didn\\'t. \\nI definitely heard you say it \\n\\'cause you were talking \\nabout your ex-girlfriend, \\nwho was sexy, but a bitch. \\nPlease don\\'t eat on the tour. \\nIs that her? \\nHey, I found a whole bunch \\nof boxes of clothes. \\nSo, sweetie, you can get some \\nlong pants, nice, loose-fitting ones, and lose the short shorts, okay? What\\'d you guys get? \\nIt\\'s protein. \\nPage 31/70\\nLook, I said the essentials, okay? It wasn\\'t easy. We almost got caught. You stole mouthwash? \\nI like to be fresh \\nwhen I\\'m making out with your daughter. That\\'s funny. \\nYeah, that\\'s not happening ever. Ever? \\nThis is our military prototype, Galvatron. I don\\'t understand it. \\nThis is the fifth iteration. \\nWhy does he keep turning out like this? It\\'s just some bugs in the final render. I modeled Galvatron \\nafter Optimus Prime. \\nWhy does he keep looking \\nlike Megatron? \\nRendering sequence \\nis almost finished. Stand by. \\nSimple coding. \\nAlgorithms! \\nMath! \\nWhy can\\'t we make \\nwhat we want to make, \\nthe way we want to make it? \\nWhy? \\nAnd does that look \\nlike a consumer-friendly face to you? And what about that \\nbig hole in the chest? \\nI think it\\'s bad-ass. I like it. - Love it \\nWell, I hate it. \\nHere he is. \\nThat bald-headed Doc Frankenstein. Ma\\'am, this is not legal. \\nThis is illegal experimentation. Aliens would never do this to people! Eat you, kill you, maybe, but that\\'s it. This ain\\'t right! \\nNobody puts baby in a box! \\nThis is worse than waterboarding! This little gentleman \\nhas been translating for us \\nPage 32/70\\nall the information \\nthat comes from these two heads. Their history, their science, everything. - Is that Megatron? \\n- Precisely. \\nWhere did you get all this? \\nSpecial government contract. \\nNow we know everything \\nabout Transformers. \\nAnd now at long last \\nwe can build them ourselves. \\nAnd we can build them better. \\nYeah, that\\'s good, Bee. That\\'ll get us in. A couple times a day, \\nthese guys are moving \\nin vehicle shipments into KSI \\nfor something called \"scanning.\" Major security all over. \\nSo our best shot at getting in \\nis a back classified research entrance. I\\'m gonna drive in with Bee \\ntomorrow morning. \\nExcuse me. \\nThere\\'s no smooching \\nin front of me, okay? \\nYou\\'re so square. \\nWho even says \"smooching\"? \\nI tell you, no respect. \\nIt\\'s just impossible sometimes. \\nYeah. I went through that \\nwith Bumblebee. \\nCalm down. Calm down. \\nYou know, at a time like this, \\nthe idea is to keep cool, not look cool, so why don\\'t you lose the glasses? About a month ago, \\nmiddle of the night, \\nI thought I heard noises in my house. Was that you? \\nWhat? Come on. No way. \\nDon\\'t lie to me, kid. \\nYou see that guy with the gun out there? There\\'s so many guys with guns. \\nLet\\'s get out of the car and tell him Page 33/70\\nwe\\'re about to break in \\nand it\\'s your idea, \\n\\'cause I don\\'t care. \\nI\\'m old, I\\'ve already lived long enough. You have a really bad habit \\nof having these conversations \\nat the wrong time, man. \\nYou want to come clean \\nor you want me to make a mess? \\nSir, can I talk to you \\nfor a second, please? \\nIt was me, it was me, \\nit was me, it was me. \\nI\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. \\nTaking it in for scanning? \\nAll right. You\\'re good to go. \\nI\\'m literally gonna kill you. \\nScanning in bay three. \\nWe took old, alien technology \\nand made it better in every way. Introducing Stinger. \\nKSI. We make the world. \\nThat is a bad-ass robot. \\nHe kind of looks like you, Bee. \\nHere is the past. And now the future. They\\'re trying to build \\ntheir own versions. \\nWell, at least they\\'re picking cooler cars than this. \\nYou talk to me like that? \\nBee, stop! \\nYou see what happens \\nfrom being a wiseass? \\nNow get out of here. \\nStinger, inspired by Bumblebee, \\nbut better in every way. \\nSon of a... \\nNo, no! You gotta calm down. \\n- He\\'s crazy! \\n- Stop! \\nBumblebee! Bee, stop going psycho! OUR FACTORY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH TRANSFORMIUM FOR PRODUCTION... \\nBECAUSE YOU DON\\'T KEEP \\nPage 34/70\\nYOUR PROMISE TO SUPPLY IT. \\nMy delicate flower, I can\\'t \\nunderstand you when you\\'re angry. Actually, I don\\'t really understand you at all. \\nOur entire factory \\nis up and running... \\nExcuse me one second. Hey! \\nHey, you two! Grease monkeys. \\nWhat the hell is going on here? What\\'s with this vintage crap? We\\'re not scanning collector car junk. What do you think it is \\nthat we make here? \\nWe make poetry. We\\'re poets. \\nAll right? You work for me, \\nyou get one mistake. One. Understood? - It won\\'t happen again. \\n- It certainly won\\'t. \\nSo let\\'s get this pathetic thing out of here. \\nAnd you, too. \\nSo sorry. So sorry. \\nLet\\'s move on. \\nWatch him. \\nI\\'m going to see what I can find. Quietly get out of here. \\nI swear. I swear. \\nI can\\'t bear it when you\\'re angry. You know how it upsets me. \\nBee, you gotta calm down right now. I\\'m perfectly calm, dude. \\nYou gotta breathe, \\nor just do whatever it is that you do. I\\'m calm. I\\'m calm. \\nI\\'m not even touching it. \\nOkay, I\\'m barely touching it. \\nI\\'m barely touching it. \\nMy God. \\nTurn back into a car right now! Get out of my face, all right? Our design team \\nstarted with the Bumblebee. \\nBut really, \\nPage 35/70\\nthis alien\\'s design was decrepit and, let\\'s face it, antique. \\nWhat the... \\n- Don\\'t take it personally, Bee. - Kind of old and ratty. \\nYou mean ugly. \\n- Hell, no! \\n- No! No! \\nYou think you\\'re better than me! Yee-hah! \\nWhat did you touch? \\nI told you, homeboy \\nCan\\'t touch this \\nMy office in 15 minutes. \\nThis is \\ndissection room seven. \\nGalvatron, \\nrender postmortem number 12. \\nContinued head disfigurement \\nat event number 32. \\nSo what about the deal? Is it done? Did you get the Seed? \\nWe get it \\nwhen the bounty hunter gets Prime. Meanwhile, \\nthere has been a complication. \\nA what? \\nNo, no. \\nAt KSI, we don\\'t use words like that. A civilian harboring the Autobots has hacked into one of your mini-drones. Meaning, they may know \\nof your involvement. \\nWhat? \\nThat was a little bit intense. \\nI need more Transformium, and \\nI need it now, to build more prototypes. You tell your alien bounty hunter that I have staked my company \\non this deal. \\nAnd I have merely staked my life. Hey, you came to me on this, \\nremember? \\nYou retire from the CIA, \\nPage 36/70\\nyou get a seven-figure piece \\nof my company, and you and I \\nrevolutionize national defense together. But, Attinger, buddy, for both our sakes, you need to deliver \\nthe Seed. \\nI\\'m in. Can you see my camera? \\nThey\\'re melting Ratchet. \\nThey slaughtered Ratchet! \\nI\\'m gonna tear them apart! \\nMetal. \\nJust metal. \\nThat\\'s what I always thought of them. Well, they\\'re not. \\nThey\\'re living things, \\nwith souls like ours. \\nOnce, I spoke to one. \\nAnd you\\'re working with Transformium? Yeah, that\\'s what I do. I am. \\nI\\'m out there digging for it. \\nThere\\'s just not much left to find. So that\\'s how badly \\nyou boys need more? \\nReduced to melting \\nevil old Decepticons down. \\nNo. That\\'s an Autobot there. \\nThe ones who fought for us. \\n- I\\'ve got this taken care of from here. - Right. \\nSame badge code scanned \\nat two separate gates. \\nI\\'m having the classified area \\nlocked down now. \\nCheck that guy. \\nHey! \\nStop right there! \\nStop! \\nFreeze! \\nUp against the wall. \\nAll right. \\nCorporate espionage. \\nThat\\'s a very serious crime, Mr. Yeager. Wow. \\nLook, I want a lawyer. \\nPage 37/70\\nThe Justice Department. \\nSomebody I can trust. \\nI\\'m just trying to protect my family, okay? \\nNot from your company, \\nfrom the government. \\nMr. Yeager, \\nwho do you think I work for? \\nYou\\'re trying to protect your family, that\\'s admirable. \\nI\\'m trying to defend the nation from alien war. \\nWe\\'ve had a taste \\nof what that looks like, \\nand we are not gonna tolerate another. Now... \\nThere is a version of this conversation where you get to go back to your barn, your daughter \\ngets to graduate with honors, \\nand life as you know it will go on. You have no idea \\nwhat you\\'re involved with here. Really? \\nWhat\\'s the other version \\nof this conversation? \\nThe one when you send in \\nthe hired help to murder my little girl? Or you gonna man up \\nand do it yourself? \\nWhat\\'s your preference? \\nI\\'m going to ask you this once. Where is Optimus Prime? \\nCome on. \\nLet\\'s get out of here. \\nWe\\'re moving. Basement. \\nThey\\'re here. \\nGet out! All of you! \\nScience fair\\'s over, meatbags! \\n- Destroy the lab! \\n- Move, move, move, move! \\nLook out! Look out! \\nDestroy it all! \\n- Danger! Security breach! \\nPage 38/70\\n- Danger... \\nGuys! It\\'s me! \\nBreak me out of this Frankenstein box! Hey! \\nHey! \\nHey! \\nStop! \\nThat\\'s company property! \\nThey\\'re not your property! \\nThey were my friends. \\nYou ain\\'t talking so much now! \\nYou got Hound in front of you? \\nGo ahead. \\nShow us your true colors, \\nonce and for all. \\nJust give me the word, I\\'ll splatter him. Why don\\'t you tell Itchy Fingers here that this is all the spoils of war. Dead metal. \\nInnovation. What we do here is science. Because if we don\\'t do it, \\nsomebody else will. \\nBecause you cannot stop technology! We\\'re not your technology! \\nLet me vaporize his ass. \\nI broke the code. \\nI own your whole genome. \\nThe world will know \\nwhat you\\'re doing here. \\nThe world? The world will approve. We can make you now. \\nDon\\'t you get it? \\nWe don\\'t need you anymore. \\nThat was cruel. \\nAutobots, \\nwe\\'re done. \\nWe\\'re done? \\nWe\\'re not gonna kick a little bit of ass? I\\'ve been itching \\nto kill something lately. \\nThis is our chance. \\nWe have to stop him. \\nYou have to stop him. \\nIt\\'s never been tested in the field. Page 39/70\\nLabs, military bases, \\nbut not on civilian streets. \\nDown there \\na Defense Department contract \\nwas just attacked in a terrorist attack. This is now a CIA military op. \\nYou\\'re indemnified. Respond! \\nLet\\'s go. \\nKSI Chicago, closest live sat, patch it in. Been an unprovoked Autobot attack. Bring up Galvatron. \\nTransforming Galvatron. \\nGalvatron coming online. \\nBring up Stinger. \\nStinger coming online. \\nLet\\'s show these alien terrorists what an upgrade looks like. \\nGalvatron and Stinger are moving \\nto intercept targets. \\nReapers. \\nFive targets in the open. Good picture. Two miles to intercept. \\n200 meters. \\nEngage-. \\nTransform. \\nWhoa. \\nWe are programming this, right? \\nYes. Mostly. \\nSystems seem to have malfunctioned. Targeting five bogeys. \\nEngaging rockets. \\nMissiles away. \\nGotta haul ass, Bee! Come on! \\nStinger is in pursuit. \\nMisfire, misfire! Misfire, misfire! System failure. \\nGalvatron just fired four rockets. Whoa! They\\'re shooting at us! \\n- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! \\n- Watch out! What are you doing? \\nArgh! \\nWhat was that? \\nWe need a full medical team now. \\nPossible civilian casualties. \\nPage 40/70\\nI mean, you got a lot of people in the crossfire here. I don\\'t like... You\\'re making history here. \\nFor your country, for the world. Human freedom is at stake. \\nInnocent people die all the time. Come on, Optimus! \\nTessa! \\nMake him fight. Don\\'t let him go down. Make him fight! \\nCome on, come on. \\nCome on, come on. \\nTessa! \\nTessa! \\nTessa, run to the field! \\nYou have no soul! \\nThat is why I have no fear! \\nYou die! \\nHelp me! \\nWhat is that? \\nThat\\'s my asset. Pull Galvatron back. Do it. \\nI got to go get her. \\nTessa! \\nDon\\'t go out there! He\\'ll kill you! - She needs my help! \\n- She\\'s hidden! \\nOptimus! Optimus, get up, get up! I can\\'t. Get out of here. \\nI feel sorry for you, Prime. \\nYour allegiance to these humans. The trouble with loyalty to a cause is that the cause will always betray you. Who sent you here? \\nWhere do you think you came from? You think you were born? \\nNo. You were built. \\nAnd your creators want you back. We all work for someone. \\nNo, no. \\nNo. \\nIt\\'s got her! \\n- She\\'s in the car! \\n- Tessa! \\nPage 41/70\\n- No! \\n- Tessa! \\nDad! \\nTessa, get out! \\nGet out! \\nTessa! \\nGet out! Tessa! \\nDad, help me! \\n- Tessa! \\n- Help me, help me! Dad! Dad! \\nDad! \\n- Dad! \\n- Tessa! Break the glass! \\n- Break the glass to get out! \\n- I\\'m trying! \\n- Tessa, I can\\'t hold on! \\n- Dad! \\nTessa! \\n- Help me! \\n- Just break it! Break the glass! Tess... \\nCade, warn the Autobots! \\nDad, help me! Don\\'t leave me! \\nNo! \\nTake that human to the trash. \\nMr. Secretary. \\nMy team is on the way. \\nThis is a CIA operation. \\nThis is my asset. \\nTell the military to stand down. Hang on, I have the White House. Agent, hello! \\nMy goodness. \\nBoy, is it a flurry of excitement over here at the White House. \\nEverybody is super, super mad. At me. So, I went over my notes \\nfrom our last meeting, \\nand I\\'m not sure \\nwhen you said anything about \\na \"giant alien warship \\nover Michigan Avenue.\" \\nTell the President this is not an attack. Remember this ship, Prime? \\nPage 42/70\\nBuilt for all you Knights, \\nyou great crusaders, \\nto explore the universe. \\nWell, I commandeered it. \\nIt\\'s my personal prison now. \\nOptimus? \\nWelcome back \\nto the Knights\\' Temenos, Prime. \\nYou have disgraced it. \\nJoin your fellow rebels, fugitive scum. It\\'s for the rarest of specimens. The worst of the worst. \\nIt\\'s taken centuries, \\nbut I\\'ve collected all the Knights but you. The creators want to sweep \\ntheir chessboard clean. \\nI\\'m slave to no one. \\nAll this species mixing with species. It upsets the cosmic balance. \\nThe creators, they don\\'t like it. They built you to do what you were told. Why hasn\\'t it taken off yet? \\nCome on, Bee, it\\'s descending. \\nYou got to get on it! \\nSavoy, mission accomplished. \\nLockdown has Prime. \\nThe deal\\'s going down now. \\nPicking up the Seed at the recon point. Nest, Talon. \\nL.Z. appears clear. \\nMuch as I\\'ve enjoyed the hunt, \\nI won\\'t miss your wretched planet. Our deal is done. \\nOne Prime for one Seed. \\nHandle it with care. \\nI trust your species is ready. \\nDon\\'t worry about our species. \\nFarewell, Earth. \\nCome on, come on! \\nBee, come on! \\nIt\\'s a bad idea. \\nBut I\\'m all about bad ideas. \\nLet\\'s go! \\nWell, let\\'s rock. \\nPage 43/70\\nThis is crazy. \\nLook, you wanna cut and run, \\nyou better do it now. \\nI\\'m gonna die trying. \\nHey, I\\'m not here to help you \\nget your daughter. \\nYou\\'re here to help me get my girlfriend. Engage dark-matter drives. Full power. We\\'re behind enemy lines now. \\nLockdown\\'s ship has booby traps. \\nEyes open. \\nBeware of his bone grinders, \\nbrain blinders, flesh peelers, \\nchromosomal inverters, \\ncatatonic sludge, black hole trapdoors, and, of course, radiation. \\nWe must be quick. \\nWe have the element of surprise. \\nLet\\'s try to use violence as a last resort. Get it! \\nI kill you! Kill you! \\nI hate those things. \\n- That\\'s freaky. \\n- He\\'s not alive anymore. \\nWell, we looked. \\nThey\\'re not here. Let\\'s go. \\nWhat? Hey, I\\'m not going \\nanywhere without Tessa. \\nI\\'m unclear. What\\'s in it for me? What\\'s in it for you? \\nEasy. Let\\'s use words. \\nWhat\\'s in it for you is I don\\'t kill you. We\\'re getting the boss back. \\nAnd the girl. Copy? \\nOkay, okay. \\nVery persuasive. Textbook machismo. Well, then. \\nWe\\'ll need to sabotage something. Better hurry. Because dark-matter drives are preparing to take off. - Wonderful. \\n- I give us 10 minutes. \\nIs that what that sound is? \\nThe engines filling up? \\nPage 44/70\\nAre you telling me \\nthat thing\\'s gonna be... \\nThis is gonna be flying out of here in 10 minutes? \\nTen minutes? \\nCould be nine. Worst case, seven. - Humans, search the cell blocks. - We\\'re wasting time, let\\'s go. - We\\'ll find the center core. \\n- Let\\'s move. \\nWe\\'re gonna stop this nightmare ship. We\\'re never gonna find her \\nin this huge ship. \\nLike a needle in a haystack. \\nTessa! \\nGreat. Great. \\nThat was smooth. \\nNo, that was really smooth, \\nletting everybody know we\\'re here. Now they\\'re gonna be looking for us. Better hurry, Crosshairs, \\nbefore we go into space! \\nHere\\'s the little jujube right here. Hello, Mama. \\nWho fired the anchors? \\nWho\\'s on my ship? \\nWe have a loose prisoner. \\nHurry up. We got like six minutes. We\\'ll find her. \\nHold up. \\nBack up. \\nCome on, these things \\nare gonna find us. Hurry, hide. Whoa! \\nWeapons! \\nCome here. Help me. Hurry, hurry. Help me up. \\nThere are some weird sounds out there. - What is that? \\n- I don\\'t know. \\nYou ready? \\nRun. \\nAll right, we\\'re not going down without a fight. \\nPage 45/70\\nThey turn that corner, \\nand we\\'re gonna take them. \\nYou ready \\nor you gonna bitch out on me? \\nNo, I got your back. \\n- Are you ready? \\n- Absolutely. \\nDon\\'t bitch out on me. \\nAre you ready? \\nYeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. \\nWhoa, okay! I surrender! \\nI surrender! I surrender! \\nI\\'m so sorry! I\\'m so, so, so sorry! What\\'d you do? How\\'d you do that? I have no idea! \\nYou no-good, chickenshit little rat! Look at that. You see that? \\nWhoa! \\nYou stay here, Lucky Charms! \\nMan. I am so gonna patent this shit. Ew! \\nTess! \\nDad! Help me! \\nHey! \\n- Tess? \\n- Tess! \\nCome on, move, move! \\nTessa! \\nShane, I love you! I love you! You saved me! You saved me! \\nI know. I know. \\nThank you. Thank you so much. \\n- Thank you. You saved me. \\n- Yeah, he saved you. Yeah. \\nYeah. \\nI think you and Mr. \"I Surrender\" have a lot to catch up about, sweetie. He saved me, too. \\nYou should have seen him in there. I mean, our hero. Let\\'s go. Now. - Eyes open. \\n- I almost got it. \\nBig boy coming through! \\nMove, move, move. \\nPage 46/70\\nWhoa! \\nThis has got to be \\nthe Supermax. Watch the corners. There\\'s a lot of cages. \\nYeah. \\nCreepy critters in here. \\nI don\\'t want to know \\nwhat\\'s in the big cage. \\n- What\\'s this? \\n- Hound, don\\'t do it. \\nAw, you don\\'t look \\nvery dangerous in there. \\nThat\\'s festering ugliness. \\nI\\'m hit! I\\'m down! It\\'s melting! It burns! \\nI think it\\'s acid! \\nNuts. It\\'s just shizzle. \\nI hope that\\'s not contagious. \\nI got to hurt you now. \\nYou\\'re just too disturbing to live. Take that, bitch! \\nYou\\'re dead. \\n- Hound! \\n- He\\'s alive! \\nHold on, boss, we\\'re coming! \\n- Optimus, sound off! \\n- In here, quick! \\nHang on, we\\'re coming for you! \\nThe arms of this Knight Ship detach! We can break free! It\\'s a separate ship! Hurry! \\nWhere\\'s the cockpit? Right or left? - Right! \\n- I\\'m on it, boss. \\nHurry. We have no time. \\nSensei. \\nLet\\'s rock! I always wanted \\nto fly one of these things. \\nI\\'m there, boss! \\nHey, Yeager Technologies, \\nyou gonna invent us \\na way out of this one? \\nWhoa. My God. \\nI am not doing this. \\nPage 47/70\\n- I am not doing that. \\n- Yes, we are. \\nNo, it\\'s good. It\\'s stable. Come on. No way. \\nSweetie, you know why I\\'m here? I\\'m here to protect you. \\nYou\\'ve done great at that. \\nI want you to trust me right now. We\\'re getting down. Let\\'s go. \\nDon\\'t look down, okay? Step. \\nSee, it\\'s easy. Come on. \\nCareful, these cables \\nare starting to get thinner here! - Step. Step. There. \\n- My God! \\nSee, don\\'t look down! \\nAll right? Don\\'t look down. \\nWe\\'re gonna be at the building in no time! \\nYou okay, Tess? \\nKeep stepping. \\nMy God! \\nMy God, Dad! \\nAll right, sweetie. \\nYou need to keep moving here, okay? - Come on! \\n- I can\\'t. \\nI\\'m freaking out. \\nYou need to move now! \\nI\\'m not moving! \\nI\\'m going back to the ship! \\nShit! \\nYou can\\'t go back to the ship, honey! Watch me! \\nYou are not 18 years old yet \\nand you\\'re gonna do what I say! Now let\\'s go! \\nWe need to go this way, okay. \\nNot that way. \\nTalk to her, Romeo! Now! \\nCome on, for God\\'s sake. \\nDo not start with me. \\nMy God, what is that? \\nAll right, Tessa. \\nPage 48/70\\nDon\\'t look back. \\nWell, don\\'t say that to me. \\nNow I want to turn around. \\nIt\\'s nothing major, sweetie. \\nWell, that means it\\'s totally major! I\\'m gonna have to point this gun in your direction. \\nIt\\'s gonna feel like it\\'s in \\nyour direction, but I\\'m not. \\n- You better hurry. \\n- Are you trying to kill me? \\nI had to bust my ass \\nto get up here on this spaceship! - Shoot it! \\n- Get down now! \\nTessa, wait! \\nI\\'m coming for you! Tessa! \\n- My God! \\n- I\\'m coming! \\nHold on! \\nYou\\'re the best, Bee! You are the best. You damn right! And don\\'t ever forget it. You see that? Look at me! \\nWe\\'re off the ship, right? \\nBumblebee! \\nBumblebee! Friendly! \\nEnemy ships are coming in hot. \\nGet on! Get on! \\nHold your knickers, I\\'m punching it! They got three ships on them! \\nI\\'m giving it the juice! \\nCome on, Bee, take them out! \\nGood move, Bee! \\nThis one\\'s for you, A-holes! \\nIf you\\'re gonna do something, \\nyou better do it! \\nCome on! \\nI\\'m sick of this crap. You fly. I shoot. Hey, you better let me fire \\nthis big-ass gun \\n- and make this ship go faster! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! \\nListen up! Crash course. Tracer guns. Punch forward to fire, \\nPage 49/70\\nslide back to reload. \\nWhat? \\nPunch, hold, slide, repeat. \\nPunch, hold, slide, repeat. \\nWait. What\\'re you talking about? - I don\\'t know what he means. \\n- Good luck. \\nWhere are you going? \\nTo lay some hate. \\n- Say it! \\n- Okay. \\nPunch, hold, slide, repeat. \\nPunch, hold, slide, repeat. \\n- 60! \\nYeah, I got one! Whoo! \\nThese alien guns kick ass! \\nCome on, he\\'s on us! \\nBee, you gotta move! Duck! \\nBee, fire the gun! \\nBUMBLEBEE\\'. ! \\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! \\nWhoa, whoa, whoa! \\nThat was insane! \\nTess, you okay? \\nOkay. Sir? \\nYou better have insurance! \\nInsurance? \\nIt\\'s a freaking spaceship. \\nYou go get insurance \\non a freaking spaceship. \\nGood luck with that, buddy. \\nIs this your car? \\nSweetie, hand me my alien gun. Here you go. \\nCome here. \\n- Trust your dad. \\n- Okay. \\nPrepare for interstellar launch. We\\'re almost ready to separate. We\\'re almost there. \\n- Hurry, he\\'s launching! \\n- All over it, chief. \\nLockdown will be in deep space before he realizes I\\'m gone. \\nPage 50/70\\nI\\'m a sucky pilot, but \\nlet\\'s give it a whirl. \\nHell, yeah! \\nYou CIA guys are really subtle. What a deft hand. \\nI\\'m sure nobody noticed all that. Look. In a few minutes, there are gonna be feds all over this place, and I don\\'t want them \\nfinding our Holy Grail. \\nSo we\\'re gonna take all our R&D, we\\'re moving it to our China facility. Yeah. \\nI want you to bring me the Seed, but I want you to bring it to me there. Mr. Joshua, I would not describe your product testing as perfected. We have plenty of time \\nfor improvements in China. \\nSir, Galvatron. He was... \\nA fiasco. \\nA farrago. An embarrassment. \\nAnd he spoke. How did that happen? Do you know what a flaw is, Wembley? A flaw? \\nA flaw is a total failure. \\nI did not have control over my prototype, and I want to know why! \\nLet\\'s give Bumblebee the good news. We got a ship now. We\\'re leaving. You humans. After all we have done. You don\\'t know \\nwhat you\\'ve wrought upon yourselves. What? What is it now? \\nWhat are you talking about? \\nI mean, I\\'m doing stuff \\nout of my league here! \\nYou don\\'t see who\\'s controlling who. Within that manmade prototype I fought, I sensed the presence \\nof Megatron. \\nWhat, the Decepticon that \\nstarted the Chicago war? \\nHow do you think KSI \\nPage 51/70\\nbuilt those bots in the first place? They had a whole mess of \\ndead Decepticon heads \\nand they were downloading their minds! And I was in charge of autopsy duty. No union, no benefits, no nothing. They hooked me up to Megatron, and that mind \\nwasn\\'t as dead as they thought. He fed them the science and specs! All so they could build him \\na brand-new body. \\nThen he infected it \\nwith his evil, nasty chromosomes. They had red, beady eyes. \\nThey got all in my lovely locks. I can smell it right now. \\nTotal inside custom job! \\nKSI might have named the body \\nthe snappy name of Galvatron, \\nbut that\\'s just Megatron reincarnated! You knew this \\nand you didn\\'t warn them? \\nLittle girl, you can go to a pretty dark place when you on death row. He\\'s been playing KSI all this time, all so that he could manipulate them into going after the Seed. \\nWait. The Seed? \\nThose nasty soldiers \\nthat were chasing us. \\nI saw them board the ship, \\nand they took something \\nthat they called the Seed. \\nListen. Sixty million years ago, give or take an eon... \\nThousands of planets \\nwere cyber-formed with Seeds. \\nThey turned your organic life \\ninto our elemental metals. \\nOur creators destroyed your world to make us. \\nAnd that\\'s what Galvatron \\nwants to happen again. \\nPage 52/70\\nHe wants to detonate that Seed in the biggest city and kill millions! He\\'s gonna show the world, \\n\"Baby, I\\'m back.\" \\nThe blast wave will incinerate that city into molten metal. \\nHe\\'ll have enough \\nto build a massive army \\nand annihilate your species forever. You dumb, greedy bastards \\njust brought extinction to yourself. Not my problem, though. \\nI\\'m free at last. \\nWhole thing worked out good for me. I\\'m walking. \\nWe got to get the Seed \\nbefore Galvatron does. \\n\"JOSHUA\". The Seed is going to be the salvation of our company. \\nWe take delivery tonight. \\nAnd next month, we detonate safely in the Mongolian desert. \\nAnd we\\'ll create enough Transformium for a hundred years. \\nDad, I\\'m tired of running and stealing. Well, a place to sleep. \\nYeah. Just another break-in. \\nYou know, when I was your age, I liked to get a little wild. \\nI liked cars, girls. \\nBut then there was Tessa. \\nAnd when she was born, \\nall I ever wanted out of life \\nwas for her to be happy \\nand healthy and safe. \\nSomehow I thought I\\'d always \\nbe enough to protect her. \\nBut I won\\'t be. \\nI\\'ll never be. \\nSo somebody better be. \\nThanks for being here today, \\nLucky Charms. \\nWell, thanks for not shooting me when you had the chance. \\nPage 53/70\\nI\\'ll have more. \\nYeah, I can see that. \\nWe\\'ve intercepted \\nthe encrypted communications. \\nJoshua Joyce is headed to his factory in Guangzhou, China. \\nHey, big shot. \\nYour company\\'s in serious trouble. You better have a damn good lawyer. Really? \\nWell, you better have a great one \\'cause you\\'re about to be responsible \\nfor the annihilation of a city. Now, you listen to me. \\nYour tech has been hacked. \\nYour prototypes are infected. \\nAnd now Galvatron is after that Seed. Look. I know you have a conscience because you\\'re an inventor, like me. Do not let Galvatron \\nanywhere near that Seed. \\nI control Galvatron. I created him. Deep down, I know you know. \\nYour prototype\\'s been controlling you. How fast can that thing get us \\nhalfway around the world? \\nVery. It\\'s a spaceship. \\nIf we\\'re traveling, now\\'s the time. All I want is to have our life back. It\\'s your call. Whatever you want. Are we safer on our own, \\nor are we safer with them? \\nShe\\'s a keeper. \\nMust take after her mom. \\nI can\\'t argue with that, kid. \\nMove! We\\'re retrieving the Seed, but then we\\'re done \\ndefending the humans. \\nWhat, done? \\nWhat do you mean, you\\'re done? \\nMeans \"finished,\" \\n\"see ya,\" \"good-bye.\" \\nHijacked part of my ship? \\nHow did you let this happen? \\nPage 54/70\\nShut down dark-matter drive, \\nreverse course at light speed, \\nand get us back! \\nPrime\\'s taken my trophy case. \\nAnd he will feel my wrath! \\nWelcome to China. \\nPut Galvatron in containment. \\nTell the techs do not activate him. Absolutely, sir. \\nI WANT SECURITY ON HIGH ALERT. \\nJoyce. \\nI cannot tell you \\nhow enthused I am to deliver this. Top of your alien wish list. \\nIt\\'s yours. Or rather ours. \\nI will need to see my advance. \\nFive million shares \\nof the company. \\nTogether, \\nwe\\'re gonna end human warfare. \\nWe\\'re about to build \\na fully automated U.S. Army. \\nJust think of all the American lives we\\'re gonna save. \\nALL OF THESE CARS ARE KSI\\'S \\nNEWEST CMLIAN PROTOTYPE ROBOTS. So how soon until \\nwe can start continuous production? You know, why don\\'t we take \\na beat on this for a minute? \\nI have some new data \\nthat I discovered and... \\nYou\\'re not backing out on me here? No, I\\'m not backing out. I just... I want the Seed. \\nI\\'m not saying I don\\'t want the Seed. I\\'m just saying I don\\'t know if I... If I want the Seed right now. \\nGood men have died \\ntrying to get that thing for us. For you. \\nI know what you did to get that thing. A lot of illegal, icky shit. \\nI can take you down, too, Mr. Black Ops. Page 55/70\\nDon\\'t you threaten me. \\nI started this company when I was a boy, with a dream \\nof making the world a better place. Funny. I had the same dream. \\nSomewhere along the way, \\nyou made billions of dollars. \\nSo why don\\'t you tell me \\nwhat\\'s missing from my dream? \\nWhy don\\'t you tell me what\\'s missing from my boyhood dream? \\nI have served my country for decades of unparalleled prosperity \\nand you are my golden parachute. So you are damn well \\njumping out of the plane with me! I am Galvatron! \\n- What\\'s going on? \\n- Your Galvatron has gone active. What haven\\'t you been telling me? Find Darcy, and bring a car around downstairs. Quietly. \\nWe got a factory emergency. \\nI have to get you out of here. \\n- What the hell\\'s going on? \\n- Take them outside. \\nWe had a deal. \\nYou got what you wanted. \\nI got what \"it\" wanted. \\nMy brothers, \\ntoday I grant you your freedom. And from now on, \\nyou are commanded by me. \\nRise up! \\nGo find my Seed! \\nDetonate the Seed in the largest city. Listen, princess. \\nI don\\'t wanna hear, \"I told you so,\" but this is much more dangerous than I think. \\nGet in. \\nGalvatron\\'s hacked into the others. - What? \\n- Joshua. \\nPage 56/70\\n- You have to contain this! \\n- Drive, drive! \\nSon of a... \\nCome on. \\nLet\\'s move, let\\'s move, let\\'s move! I know how to lose them in Hong Kong. I know a military garrison there that will help us. \\nThreatening a professional CIA killer. Possibly not my finest hour. \\nI\\'d like to have that one back. Killer? I thought they were your friends! No. Not friends. Business. \\nThey gave me this bomb. \\nBomb? \\nIs there a bomb in the bag? \\nYes, there\\'s a bomb in the bag. Shit. \\nWhen you said you were done \\nfighting for humans, \\nyou didn\\'t mean that, did you? \\nHow many more of my kind \\nmust be sacrificed \\nto atone for your mistakes? \\nWell, what do you think \\nbeing human means? \\nThat\\'s what we do. \\nWe make mistakes. \\nAnd sometimes out of those mistakes come the most amazing things. \\nWhen I fixed you, it was for a reward. That was it. That was why. For money. And it was me making a mistake. Without it, you wouldn\\'t be here. So even if you got no faith in us, I\\'m asking you to do what I do. I\\'m asking you to look at all the junk and see the treasure. \\nYou gotta have faith, Prime, \\nin who we can be. \\nI\\'m seriously pissed \\nwe\\'re not getting paid for this. Well, at least we get to kill him. They\\'re not getting away if \\nPage 57/70\\nI still got him on satellite. \\nSome genius. \\nThinks he can outrun the CIA. \\nJoshua? Yes? \\nHow lethal is that bomb? \\nI don\\'t know. Let me check. \\nI love this! This is so good. \\nHang on. \\nI\\'m getting a text from \\nll Duce in Hong Kong. \\n\"Need to know \\nthe Seed\\'s estimated blast range.\" Duh. \\nI\\'ll do the diversion! \\nGet that thing somewhere safe! \\nKillers are coming! Guys, we gotta go! GUYS, guys... \\n- Shut up! Shut up! \\n- All right! I\\'m sorry! \\nAll right, go ahead, go ahead! \\nOkay, good? No, don\\'t go! Wait! \\nOkay, he\\'s in. Okay, okay, okay. \\nI need a raise! I want a raise. \\nAll right, yes! \\nI\\'m sure whatever you want! \\nGo, go, go! \\nNo! \\nDeath is on our tail! Death is on our tail! Get out of the way, all of you! \\nGet out of the way! \\nI don\\'t want to die like this. \\nBox them in. \\nHurry, hurry! Come, come. \\nOkay, yes. I\\'ll follow you anywhere. You\\'re amazing! \\nWe\\'re going to get you to the roof. Good, good. \\nGo! \\nLOL. That\\'s funny. \\nI can\\'t... This is really happening. A man, me, who is worth \\nover 20 billion dollars is now \\nbeing chased by CIA assassins. \\nThat\\'s the truth. \\nPage 58/70\\nAnd in the middle \\nof a robot uprising. \\nAnd I\\'m carrying what is, \\nin essence, a tactical nuke. \\nAnd the great thing is I... \\nThe great thing is that I\\'m... I\\'m barely feeling any jetlag. - Just stop it! \\n- What? \\nYou need to hide on the roof \\nof this building. \\nI\\'ll get you a helicopter extraction. Okay. \\nI like her. \\nI find her very attractive. \\nHe\\'s definitely around here. \\nCome on, come on. \\nI got a bike! \\nCheck in there! \\nThese are the CIA assassins \\nI told you about. \\nWhoa! \\n- Guys. \\n- Let\\'s go. \\nHello. \\nHey! Okay. \\n- Pick it up. \\n- All right. I\\'m gonna. \\nWow. \\nWow. Wow, thank you. \\nWow! How did you... \\nPolice training, prior to my MBA. I love you. \\nGet to the roof. \\nAll right, okay. \\nFind my Seed. It\\'s here! \\nThose prototypes are after that bomb. No! \\nNo, no, no, no! \\nWho the hell\\'s aboard that? \\nImpossible. \\nBrothers, it\\'s the Autobots! \\nShoot them down! \\nJoshua! \\nPage 59/70\\nHey, Baldy! \\nHey, it\\'s me! Hey! \\nBring it over now! Let\\'s go. \\nHurry up, run! \\n- Hurry! Come on! \\n- Let\\'s go! Move it! \\nGuys! Come on. Give it to me now! Looks like \\nwe might have company. \\nWe\\'re hit! We\\'re hit! \\nThey live, they talk, we\\'re dead. - Kill them all. \\n- Pleasure. \\nI count ten below! \\nI thought you said \\nyou had one prototype get infected. Now he\\'s got operational control of my other 50. \\nCome on. \\nClimb, climb! \\nSurround them. \\nI may have started the apocalypse, but you brought your family. \\nAnd that\\'s, you know, terrible parenting. I\\'m about one second away \\nfrom knocking you out, \\ntaking the bomb, \\nand just leaving you here. \\nPlease, do me a favor. \\nOptimus, Autobots, you alive? \\n- Come on, bitch! \\n- Come on! \\nEvac! Evac! \\nWe\\'re getting flanked! \\nWe got company below! \\nMy fat ass is stuck! \\nBee, take the shot! \\n- Into the elevator! Get in. \\n- Okay. \\nCome on. \\nGet down, get down! \\nClose the door! Close the door! Won\\'t go! It\\'s not closing! \\nThere\\'s too much weight. \\nPage 60/70\\n- Get back down to Bumblebee! \\n- Dad, no! \\nHey! You want me! \\nCenter elevator. \\nCenter elevator. \\nHe\\'s gonna be okay. \\nAlien bomb! Alien bomb, \\ncoming through! \\nClear the way! Clear the... Hi, kids. Coming through, ladies! \\nExcuse me! \\nExcuse me, ladies! Excuse me! \\nMy God! \\nHow do you say, \"Get the fuck \\nout of the way\" in Chinese? \\nThat\\'s a long way down. \\nYou\\'ve got to be kidding me. \\nNo! \\nCome on. \\nWhoa! \\nI\\'m coming for you! \\nNever should have hidden that truck. You should have never \\ncame after my family. \\nTough luck, Yeager. We all have family. Yeah, but I\\'m gonna live to see mine. Where is my escaped bounty? \\nAutobots at this location. \\nPrime is close. \\nDo whatever you have to do. \\nI intend to. \\n- Darcy! \\n- Joshua! \\nWe got three more \\ncoming in from that way! \\nBee, where\\'s Tessa? \\nDad! \\nWe got a real dilemma here. Okay? I created incredible robots. \\nIt\\'s all designed \\nto kick that fat Transformer\\'s ass. So, really, this is a no-win situation. It\\'s over. \\nThat was mean. \\nPage 61/70\\nHey! I\\'m sorry if you can\\'t handle the cold-hearted truth! \\nOptimus, what are my orders \\nwith these humans? \\nCan I squish the bald guy? \\nThey\\'re in trouble. \\nNah! This isn\\'t our fight! \\nI\\'m done being an underdog. \\nUnderdogs suck! \\nI say they get what they deserve. What\\'s the play, Prime? \\nIt\\'s time for reinforcements. \\nRecognize one of your Knights. \\nTHE LEGEND EXISTS. \\nCome on. \\nAll right, come on! Come on, let\\'s go! Bee, go! \\nCome on, we got to move! \\nLet\\'s go, move! \\nWhere\\'s Tessa? \\nTessa, get over here! Come on. \\nGet over here! \\nStay behind me! \\nI\\'m covering you! \\nIf I stop covering you, it means I\\'m dead. But that ain\\'t gonna happen. \\nTake that! \\nI\\'m a wicked warrior robot! \\nGoddamn! \\nCome on! We gotta move now! \\nGo, go! \\nWe got hostiles coming down the street! Go! \\nBee! Twelve o\\'clock! Cover fire! We\\'re surrounded! \\nHustle, hustle, hustle! \\nRocket! \\nGo, go, go! \\nGet down! \\nThis is the perfect place to hide. A big glass box! Nobody will ever find us here! That\\'s... \\nYou\\'ve got to be kidding me. \\nLegendary warriors, \\nPage 62/70\\nthe powers that created us \\nnow want us all extinguished. \\nWe must join forces, \\nor else forever be their slaves. So today you stand with us... \\nor you stand against me. \\nWe\\'ll let Prime figure this one out. Very wise. \\nThere\\'s no friggin\\' way \\nI\\'m staying down here with them. No way. No way. \\nOnly together can we survive! \\nLet me lead you! \\nNo. \\nI was expecting a giant car. \\nCome here! \\nWe\\'re giving you freedom. \\nYou defend my family, \\nor die. \\nAutobots, \\nwe\\'re going to prove who we are and why we\\'re here! \\nYou just want to die for the guy. That\\'s leadership. \\nOr brainwashing, or something. No. That\\'s Optimus Prime. \\nAutobots, we charge together! \\nNow, roll out! \\nWe\\'re getting boxed in! \\nWe\\'re getting flanked everywhere! Help me out here! \\nKill anything that moves! \\nCome on, Cade, shoot! \\nCome and get some, you little bitch! Incoming! \\nI can\\'t believe \\nI\\'m putting my life in your hands. Here. Be my guest. Take the gun. - Go ahead, take it. \\n- No, I don\\'t want the gun. \\n- Come on, you can lead. \\n- No, I don\\'t want the gun. \\nThen stay under there and shut up! All right. You\\'re good with the gun. \\nPage 63/70\\nSo you keep it. \\nRunning out of guns and ammo. \\nCome and get some! \\nYou\\'re all gonna die! \\nWay to go, baby! \\nGood shooting, Cade! \\nI\\'m like a fat ballerina \\nwho takes scalps and slits throats! Got your fortune cookie! \\nCome here, you little punk. \\nPull the pin! I\\'m dying out here! Here! Take it. Take it! \\nLittle help! Little help! \\nIt\\'s live! It\\'s live, it\\'s live. Take it! What do you want me to do with it? - Just throw it! \\n- Give, give, give! \\nGot some bad news, Cade. \\nI\\'m out of ammo and out of ideas. Faster! Go! \\nI\\'ll kill you! \\nCharge! \\nNo, impossible! \\nThey\\'re ruining everything! \\nTake that! \\nGet off me. \\n- Get up, Hound! \\n- I can\\'t go on. \\nBut you gotta keep fighting! \\nTank\\'s empty, bro. \\nThere\\'s more of \\'em coming. \\nIf you don\\'t get up \\nand fight, we\\'re going to die. Let\\'s go! Attack! \\nOptimus is here! \\nBee, jump! \\nI hate cheap knockoffs. \\nAwesome job! \\n- You. \\n- Who? \\n- You. \\n- Step forward. \\nWait. Why? \\nYour science will be responsible Page 64/70\\nfor humanity\\'s extinction. \\nAll right. I know that you\\'re sensitive to this whole bioethical dilemma. Maybe all he wants to hear you say is that some things \\nshould never be invented. \\nOkay. \\nWe\\'ll lead you out of the city. Get that Seed safely to the hills. Use this car. \\nHe almost ate me! \\nAll right, we\\'re good! \\nAll right, let\\'s go! \\nGet out of that seat. \\nAnd you\\'re one lucky dad to have me. Okay, Lucky Charms. You got that. You drive. Let\\'s go. \\nWhat did you do? \\nI don\\'t know. \\nI don\\'t know, but it\\'s an issue. - Did you press a button? \\n- Is it gonna blow up? \\nI don\\'t know. \\nYour thing is beeping now, \\nso you must have hit something. - Is it gonna blow up? \\n- I don\\'t know! \\nA bomb starts beeping, \\nthat might signal a problem, you think? I\\'m just saying \\nthat it\\'s a steady blinking light, which could be a timer of some kind. Unless it\\'s signaling location. To who? \\nWe\\'ve got to call the central government for help! \\nOptimus Prime. \\nCome to me. \\nDEFENSE MINISTER... \\nTHERE\\'S A CRISIS IN HONG KONG! \\nTHE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WILL \\nPROTECT HONG KONG AT ALL COSTS. WE HAVE FIGHTER JETS ON THE WAY. There\\'s the bridge. \\nPage 65/70\\nBack it up! Back it up! \\nGo, go, go, go! \\nBack up! Go back! Go back! \\nMove! \\nGet out of the way. I can\\'t see! - Shane, drive faster! \\n- Okay, just calm down. \\n- Shane, watch out! \\n- Whoa, whoa, whoa! \\n- Get cover! \\n- Back up! Back! Back up! \\nAutobots, fall back! \\n- Come on, move! Out of my way! - Get out of the way! \\n- Look out! \\n- Just hit them! Just hit them! It\\'s a big magnet! \\nIt\\'s sucking up metal and dropping it! - Go faster! Go faster! \\n- Move! \\n- Get out of the way! \\n- It\\'s coming! It\\'s coming! \\nIt\\'s coming closer! \\nGo faster, Shane! \\nWatch out, watch out! \\n- Watch out! \\n- Look out! \\nWhoa! \\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! \\nNo, now it\\'s circling back towards us! Hard right! Take a hard right! Move it! Get out of the way! \\nMy God! \\nNo. No, the magnet. Get out, get out! Come on! Come here! Get out! \\nNo, no, no! \\nNo, we\\'re going up. Grab the bomb! Help me grab the bomb! \\nI can\\'t get the seat belt off! Pull me down! Catch me! \\nI\\'m going up! I\\'m going up! \\nGet me! Grab me! \\nPull me down! Pull me! \\nI can\\'t get the seat belt off! Page 66/70\\nI can\\'t get the belt off! \\nI\\'m stuck! I\\'m stuck! \\nHold the bomb! I can\\'t hold on! \\nPull! \\nGuys, it\\'s crushing me! \\nCar! \\nMove! \\nShane! \\n- Shane! \\n- I\\'m good! I\\'m good. \\nI\\'m good. \\nBumblebee! \\nHey, you guys! \\nYee-hah! \\nCome on. \\nGo find someplace safe. \\nI\\'m proud of you. \\nGet cover! \\nCade! \\nAutobots, get this bomb over the bridge and out of the city! \\nDad! \\nWhat? Come on. \\nI got it! \\nI\\'m getting this bomb out of here! Give me the gun. \\nIt\\'s you and me now! \\nLook, Optimus is out there all alone. What? You can\\'t help him. \\nI have to, Tess. He came back for us. Dad, don\\'t leave, please. \\nLook, I\\'ll find you, I\\'ll get there, okay? Dad, no, you\\'ll die! \\nYou gotta stay with Shane. \\nYou\\'re gonna be okay. \\nYou promise me \\nyou\\'re gonna keep her safe, \\nrest of her life, until the end of time! Promise me! \\nI promise you. \\nYou\\'re the best thing I ever made, Tess. All right, don\\'t ever forget it, it was always you. \\n- I love you. \\nPage 67/70\\n- Please. \\nGet in the car, now. \\nDad! \\nPrime! \\nStop the car! \\n- You better listen. \\n- No, you listen. \\nI\\'m not leaving my dad. \\nAll right, we\\'re gonna \\nhold the line, then block the bridge! You see, it takes patience \\nto make a man. \\nThe patience to watch and wait, to protect all of us, quietly, \\nfor God and country, \\nwithout any recognition at all! Cade! \\nThere are no good aliens! \\nOr bad aliens, Yeager. \\nIt\\'s just us and them. \\nAnd you chose them. \\nAnytime. \\nYou saved the human \\ninstead of saving yourself? \\nYou bring shame upon us all. \\nShe never listens. Never. \\nI gave you an order! \\nGet out of here, now! \\nGet in. Get in. \\nHey, you! Hey! \\nCade, get out of here! This is my fight! It\\'s my fight, and you\\'re all gonna die! Go! Go! \\nCome on! Come on! \\nYeah! Killer robot, my ass! \\nWhoo! \\nCome on. \\nGet away, all of you! \\nCome on, Tess. \\nCome on, Tess. Come on, Tess. \\nDrive! \\nYou see my face, your life is done! Come on, come on, come on! \\nYeah! \\nPage 68/70\\nHonor to the end. \\nYou still happy we met? \\nAlways. \\nHurry! \\nQuickly! I\\'m setting off \\nLockdown\\'s grenade! \\nHold tight! \\nWe shall meet again, Prime, \\nfor I am reborn. \\nKind of nice being your hero \\nfor a change. \\nYou always were. All my life. \\nI love you. \\nI love you, too. \\nLet\\'s go home to graduation? \\nYeah. \\nYou\\'re okay, kid. \\nCome here, you\\'re all right. \\nYou\\'re all right. \\nWe don\\'t have a home, Dad. \\nIt blew up. \\nI might be able to help you with that. Brave warriors... \\nyou are free! \\nI\\'ll ride \\nwith you anytime, Spike! \\nDid you miss me? \\nNo. \\nThis Seed belongs to our creators, whoever they are. \\nThere remains a price on my head. I endanger you all if I stay. \\nI shall take it \\nwhere it can never be found. \\nWill we ever see you again? \\nCade Yeager, \\nI do not know. \\nBut whenever you look to the stars, think of one of them \\nas my soul. \\nDefend this family, Autobots, \\nas they have you. \\nDefend \\nall they can be. \\nPage 69/70\\nThere are \\nmysteries to the universe \\nwe were never meant to solve. \\nBut who we are and why we are here are not among them. \\nThose answers we carry inside.

No! \\nToo late, assholes. \\nDon\\'t move, \\nyou mutant scum! \\nNo! \\nFlat on the ground, \\nhands behind your head! \\nSo few of us left. \\nProfessor? \\nI\\'ve found them. \\nProfessor! \\nBobby. \\nHey, Storm. \\nHey, kid. \\nProfessor, \\nyou made it. \\nWhenever the Sentinels attack, Warpath spots them... \\nthen I send Bishop \\nPage 2/56\\nback to warn us \\nof the attack \\nbefore it happens. \\nBlink scouts the next site... \\nand then we leave before \\nthey ever know we were there. \\nBecause... \\nwe never were. \\nWhat do you mean \\nyou were never there? \\nShe projects Bishop back in time a few days to \\nwarn the others... \\nof the coming attack. \\nSo she sends \\nBishop back in time? \\nNo, just his consciousness, \\ninto his younger self. \\nHis younger body. \\nWow. \\nThis might just work, \\nCharles. \\nWhat might work? \\nThe Sentinel program was originally conceived by Doctor Bolivar Trask. In the early \\'70s, \\nhe was one of the world\\'s \\nleading weapons designers. \\nBut, covertly, he had begun \\nexperimenting on mutants... \\nusing their gifts \\nto fuel his own research. \\nThis is extraordinary. \\nThere was one mutant who had \\ndiscovered what he was doing. \\nA mutant with the ability to \\ntransform herself into anyone. Mystique. \\nI knew her as Raven. \\nWe met when \\nwe were children, \\ngrew up together. \\nShe was like a sister to me. \\nI tried to help her... \\nPage 3/56\\nbut only succeeded \\nin driving her away. \\nShe hunted Trask \\nacross the world. \\nAnd at the Paris \\nPeace Accords in 1973, \\nafter the Vietnam War... \\nshe found Trask... \\nand killed him. \\nIt was the first \\ntime she killed. \\nIt wasn\\'t her last. \\nBut killing Trask did not have the outcome she expected. \\nIt only persuaded \\nthe government \\nof the need \\nfor his program. \\nThey captured her that day... \\ntortured her, \\nexperimented on her. \\nIn her DNA, they discovered the secrets to her powers of transformation. It gave them the key \\nthey needed... \\nto create weapons that could \\nadapt to any mutant power. \\nAnd in less than 50 years... \\nthe machines \\nthat have destroyed... \\nso many of our kind \\nwere created. \\nBut it all started \\nthat day in 1973... \\nthe day she first killed. \\nThe day she truly became... \\nMystique. \\nYou want to go back there. \\nIf I can get to her, \\nstop the assassination... \\nkeep her out of \\ntheir hands... \\nthen we can stop the Sentinels from ever being born. \\nPage 4/56\\nAnd end this war \\nbefore it ever begins. \\nUh, I can send someone back \\na couple weeks. \\nMaybe a month. \\nBut you\\'re talking about \\ngoing back decades. \\nYou have the most \\npowerful brain in the world, \\nProfessor... \\nbut the mind can only stretch \\nso far before it snaps. \\nIt would rip you apart. \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nNo one could \\nsurvive that trip. \\nWhat if someone\\'s mind \\nhas a way of snapping back? \\nWhat if someone can heal as fast as they\\'re ripped apart? \\nIt\\'s a risk. \\nYeah, I\\'m getting that. \\nNot just for you. \\nYou do this, \\nyou change history. \\nWell, that\\'s kind of \\nthe point. \\nSome of us could be killed. \\nSome of us may \\nnever be born. \\nWe have no idea \\nhow things may change. \\nWe could keep going. \\nKeep fighting. \\nUntil what? \\nYou\\'ve got a \\ndecision to make. \\nYou can keep sending \\nBishop back in time \\nover and over again \\nto warn you, \\nuntil one day, \\nhe doesn\\'t make it, \\nand you all die. \\nPage 5/56\\nOr you can \\ngive up this life. \\nSo that they and everyone \\nelse who died in this war \\ncan actually have a future. \\nYou\\'re asking us \\nto sacrifice our lives \\nfor a future we might not \\neven be a part of. \\nYes. \\nA second chance. \\nA better chance \\nfor everyone. \\nMy people need to vote. \\nThey just did. \\nThey\\'re in. \\nOkay, spread out. \\nTake your positions. \\nSo I wake up \\nin my younger body, \\nGod knows where. \\nThen what? \\nYou\\'ll need to go to \\nmy house and find me. \\nConvince me of all of this. \\nWon\\'t you be able to \\njust read my mind? \\nI didn\\'t have my \\npowers in 1973. \\nLogan, you\\'re going to have to do for me what I once did for you. Lead me, guide me. \\nI was a very \\ndifferent man then. \\nYou\\'ll have to be \\npatient with me. \\nPatience is my strongest suit. You\\'ll need me as well. \\nWhat? \\nAfter Mystique left Charles, \\nshe came with me... \\nand I set her on \\na dangerous path. \\nA darker path. \\nPage 6/56\\nIt\\'s going to take the two of us, side by side... \\nat a time when we couldn\\'t \\nbe further apart. \\nGreat. \\nSo where do I find you? \\nWell, it\\'s complicated. \\nAre you sure about this? \\nIt\\'s not just his power \\nthat\\'ll be tested. \\nI\\'ve seen what this \\ncan do to you. \\nI can handle this. \\nTrust me. \\nI guess I\\'ll see you \\nin the next life. \\nBasically, your \\nbody will go to sleep \\nwhile your mind travels \\nback in time. \\nAs long as you\\'re back there, \\npast and present will continue to coexist. But once you wake up... \\nwhatever you\\'ve done will take hold and become history. \\nAnd for the rest of us, \\nit will be the only history \\nthat we know. \\nIt will be like the last \\n50 years never happened. \\nAnd this world, \\nand this war... \\nthe only person who will \\nremember it is you. \\nAll right, Logan... \\nI need you to \\nclear your head \\nand to stay \\nas calm as possible. \\nWhat? What do you mean? \\nIf your mind gets rocky, \\nit will be harder for me to hold you... and you could start to slip \\nbetween past and future. \\nPage 7/56\\nWhat if I need to get \\na little rocky? \\nThink peaceful thoughts? \\nPeaceful thoughts... \\nDo you have any good news? \\nWell, you don\\'t really age, \\nso you\\'ll pretty much look the same. You won\\'t have \\nmuch time in the past. \\nThe Sentinels will find us. \\nThey always do. \\nAnd this time, \\nwe won\\'t be able to run. \\nWe\\'ll have no escape. \\nThis is our last chance. \\nYou really think this will work? I have faith in him. \\nIt\\'s not him I\\'m \\nworried about, it\\'s us. \\nWe were young... \\nwe didn\\'t know any better. \\nWe will now. \\nSee you all soon. \\nThis might sting a little. \\nThe first time \\nEver I saw your face \\nWhoa. \\nI thought the sun \\nRose in your eyes \\nAnd the moon and the stars \\nWere the gifts you gave \\nHoly shit. \\nIt worked. \\nHey, what\\'s going on? \\nGwen, get dressed. \\nWho the hell are you? \\nHey, I don\\'t know \\nwhat\\'s going on. \\nYou\\'re supposed to be \\nguarding the boss\\'s daughter, \\nnot screwing her. \\nWell, I didn\\'t \\nsleep with her. \\nNo? \\nPage 8/56\\nNo. \\nI mean, yes, I slept \\nwith her many times. \\nJimmy! \\nThat wasn\\'t me. \\nThat was the old me. \\nI just got here \\n20 seconds ago. \\nReally? \\nThen what happened \\nto your clothes? \\nMy... Oh. \\nWould you believe \\nme if I told you \\nI was sent here \\nfrom the future? \\nHuh? \\nGet out of here, \\nsweetheart. \\nYeah. \\nWe\\'re gonna take care of this comedian. No, you\\'re not. \\nYou\\'re gonna give me the keys to your car and some money for gas... or you\\'re gonna wake \\nup in the hospital. \\nTrust me, \\nI know how these things play out. Oh. Because you\\'re \\nfrom the future? \\nNo. \\nBecause of these. \\nWhat the hell? \\nGod damn it! \\nPeaceful thoughts. \\nJimmy! What happened \\nto Ramon? \\nAnd why are you \\ntalking crazy talk? \\nLook, uh... \\nGwen. \\nGwen, you\\'re gonna wanna \\nlay low for a few days, \\nall right? \\nPage 9/56\\nStarting now. \\nCome on, out. \\nGo. \\nHmm. \\nToday, the 18th MP Brigade \\nis departing from Saigon, \\nmarking the last American \\ntroops to leave Vietnam. \\nAnd effectively ending the war. We are reviewing all of our \\ndefense expenditures... \\nand all the black books \\nare being opened. \\nWe can\\'t support a weapon \\nthat targets our own citizens. If these mutants, \\nas you describe... \\nare already living among us... then they are living \\nhere peacefully. \\nWe haven\\'t had an incident \\nin over 10 years. \\nAfter what happened in Cuba? \\nThat was never confirmed. \\nWe have very real \\nenemies out there... \\nthe Russians, the Chinese. \\nWe are talking about \\na tenth of a tenth... \\nof a tenth \\nof our population. \\nAllow me to read \\nsomething to you. \\nPlease. \\nThis was acquired by \\nour friends at the CIA. \\nIt\\'s a dissertation... \\nwritten by a mutant \\nat Oxford University. \\nAnd I quote... \\n\"To Homo Neanderthalensis... \\n\"his mutant cousin, \\nHomo Sapiens...\" \\nwhich is us... \\nPage 10/56\\n\"was an aberration. \\n\"The arrival of the mutated \\nhuman species, Homo Sapiens... \\n\"was followed by the immediate \\nextinction of their less evolved kin.\" Well... \\nNow, we are \\nthe Neanderthal. \\nSpeak for yourself, \\nDr. Trask. \\nYou know, \\nwhen you sent our soldiers to Vietnam... without the weapons they \\nneeded to win the war... \\nyou underestimated \\nyour enemy. \\nYou do that \\nwith this enemy... \\nMmm... \\nand it won\\'t be some border \\nskirmish halfway around the world. This time, the war will \\nbe for our streets... \\nour cities, our homes... \\nand by the time you see the \\nneed for my program... \\nit will be too late... \\nand you will have lost \\ntwo wars in one lifetime. \\nWe are sorry, \\nDr. Trask... \\nbut your Sentinel Program... \\nit ain\\'t gonna fly. \\nCan I help you, Colonel? \\nJust here to give our \\nboys a proper send-off. \\nI\\'m sorry, sir, \\nbut we have orders. \\nThis is a quarantined area. \\nStand aside, soldier. \\nThat\\'s an order. \\nAtten-hut! \\nAt ease. \\nWhat is all this? \\nPage 11/56\\nLab reports, \\nblood tests. \\nIt\\'s all getting packed up \\nand shipped back. \\nWhere is it going? \\nSame place they are. \\nTrask Industries. \\nLet\\'s go, gentlemen. \\nI\\'m taking you out \\nof this shit show. \\nShipping home? \\nNot just yet. \\nWhat are you doing \\nwith those? \\nSomething to make the ride \\na little smoother. \\nI\\'m transferring you \\nto a private facility... \\nwhere we can run \\na few more tests. \\nYour men are not military. \\nPrivate outfit. \\nWe\\'re authorized \\nto remand these men. \\nHmm. \\nThese troops are going home. \\nWell, Colonel, \\nI don\\'t believe you have \\njurisdiction in this matter. \\nI\\'m afraid I do, son. \\nI\\'m sorry, who are you? \\nThe question is, \\nMajor... \\n...who are you? \\nRaven! \\nThat\\'s not my name. \\nI had that. \\nI know. \\nLet\\'s move out. \\nCome on, let\\'s go. \\nWhere\\'s Erik? \\nI\\'m on my own now. \\nLet\\'s go! Move it! \\nHold that plane! \\nPage 12/56\\nWouldn\\'t wanna leave these \\nboys in this godforsaken country. Yes, sir. \\nYou\\'re not coming \\nwith us, are you? \\nMy war\\'s not over. \\nThe enemy is \\nstill out there. \\nThe four privates, \\nwhere did they go? \\nThey were headed \\ntowards the tarmac. \\nCan I help you? \\nUh... Yeah, \\nwhat happened to the school? \\nThe school\\'s been shut for years. Are you a parent? \\nI sure as hell \\nhope not. Who are you? \\nI\\'m Hank. Hank McCoy. \\nI look after the house now. \\nYou\\'re Beast? \\nLook at you. I guess \\nyou\\'re a late bloomer. \\nI don\\'t know what \\nyou\\'re talking about, \\nbut I\\'m gonna have \\nto ask you to leave. \\nSo where\\'s the Professor? \\nThere\\'s no professor here. \\nYou\\'re pretty strong \\nfor a scrawny kid. \\nYou sure there\\'s not \\na little Beast in there? \\nNo, he\\'s not here. \\nCome on, Beast. \\nCome on, Beastie. \\nNo. \\nHey! \\nI said the school\\'s closed. \\nYou need to leave. \\nNot until I see the Professor. There\\'s no professor here, \\nI told you that. \\nPage 13/56\\nLook, kid. \\nYou and I are gonna be good friends. You just don\\'t know it yet. \\nProfessor! \\nProfessor! \\nHank? \\nWhat\\'s going on here? \\nProfessor? \\nPlease don\\'t call me that. \\nWhy? \\nYou know this guy? \\nYeah, he looks \\nslightly familiar. \\nGet off the bloody \\nchandelier, Hank. \\nYou can walk. \\nYou\\'re a perceptive one. \\nI thought Erik... \\nWhich makes it \\nslightly perplexing that \\nyou missed our \\nsign on the way in. \\nThis is private property, \\nmy friend. \\nI\\'m gonna have to ask him \\nto ask you to leave. \\nWell. \\nI\\'m afraid \\nI can\\'t do that... \\nbecause, uh, \\nI was sent here for you. \\nTell whoever it was \\nthat sent you that I\\'m busy. \\nThat\\'s gonna be \\na little tricky... \\nbecause the person \\nwho sent me was you. \\nWhat? \\nAbout 50 years from now. \\nI know. Stay with me. \\nLike in the future, \\n50 years from now? \\nYeah. \\nI sent you from the future? \\nPage 14/56\\nYeah. \\nPiss off. \\nIf you had your powers, \\nyou\\'d know I was telling the truth. How do you know \\nI don\\'t have my p... \\nWho are you? \\nI told you. \\nAre you CIA? \\nNo. \\nYou\\'ve been watching me? \\nI know you, Charles. \\nWe\\'ve been friends for years. \\nI know your powers \\ncame when you were 9. \\nI know you thought you were \\ngoing crazy when it started... all the voices in your head. \\nAnd it wasn\\'t \\nuntil you were 12... \\nthat you realized all the voices were in everyone else\\'s head. \\nDo you want me to go on? \\nI never told anyone that. \\nNot yet, no, \\nbut, you will. \\nAll right, \\nyou\\'ve piqued my interest. \\nWhat do you want? \\nWe have to stop Raven. \\nI need your help. \\nWe need your help. \\nI think I\\'d like \\nto wake up now. \\nWhat does she \\nhave to do with this? \\nSo you\\'re saying... \\nthey took Raven\\'s \\npower, and what? \\nThey weaponized it? \\nYep. \\nShe is unique. \\nYeah, she is, Hank. \\nIn the beginning, \\nPage 15/56\\nthe Sentinels were just targeting mutants. Then they began to identify \\nthe genetics in non-mutants... \\nwho would eventually have mutant children and grandchildren. \\nMany of the humans tried to help us, but it was a slaughter. \\nLeaving only the worst \\nof humanity in charge. \\nI\\'ve been in a lot of wars. \\nI\\'d never seen \\nanything like this. \\nAnd it all starts with her. \\nLet\\'s just say \\nfor the sake of... \\nthe sake, that I \\nchoose to believe you... \\nthat I choose to help you. \\nRaven won\\'t listen to me. \\nHer heart and soul \\nbelong to someone else now. \\nI know. \\nThat\\'s why we\\'re \\ngonna need Magneto, too. \\nErik? \\nYou do know where he is? \\nYeah. \\nCould you give me that \\none more time, please? \\nYou heard me. \\nHe\\'s where he belongs. \\nYou\\'re just gonna walk out? \\nOoh, top marks. \\nLike I said, you are perceptive. The Professor I know \\nwould never turn his back... \\non someone who\\'d \\nlost their path. \\nEspecially someone he loved. \\nYou know... \\nI think I do \\nremember you now. \\nYeah. Tall, angry fellow \\nwith the contentious hair. \\nPage 16/56\\nWe came to you a long time ago... seeking your help. \\nAnd I\\'m gonna say to you \\nwhat you said to us then. \\nFuck off. \\nListen to me, \\nyou little shit. \\nI\\'ve come a long way, \\nand I\\'ve watched a lot of people die. Good people. Friends. \\nIf you\\'re gonna \\nwallow in self-pity... \\nand do nothing, then you\\'re \\ngonna watch the same thing... \\nyou understand? \\nWe all have to \\ndie sometime. \\nTold you there was \\nno professor here. \\nWhat the hell happened to him? He lost everything. \\nErik, Raven... \\nhis legs. \\nWe built the school, \\nthe labs, this whole place... \\nthen, just after \\nthe first semester... \\nthe war in Vietnam got worse. \\nMany of the teachers... \\nand older students \\nwere drafted. \\nIt broke him. \\nHe retreated into himself. \\nI wanted to help, \\ndo something... \\nso I designed a serum \\nto treat his spine... \\nderived from the same formula that helps me control my mutation. \\nI take just enough \\nto keep myself balanced... \\nbut he takes too much. \\nI tried easing him back... \\nbut he just couldn\\'t bear \\nPage 17/56\\nthe pain, the voices. \\nThe treatment \\ngives him his legs... \\nbut it\\'s not enough. \\nHe\\'s... \\nHe\\'s just lost too much. \\nYou\\'re not scared of me? \\nI always believed I couldn\\'t be the only one in the world. \\nCharles Xavier. \\nRaven. \\nYou\\'re hungry and alone. \\nTake whatever you want. \\nWe\\'ve got lots of food. \\nYou don\\'t have to steal. \\nIn fact... \\nyou never have to \\nsteal again. \\nAnd that\\'s a promise. \\nI\\'ll help you get her. \\nNot for any of your future shite, but for her. \\nFair enough. \\nBut I\\'ll tell you this. \\nYou don\\'t know Erik. \\nThat man is a monster. \\nA murderer. \\nYou think you can \\nconvince Raven to change? \\nTo come home? \\nThat\\'s splendid. \\nBut what makes you think \\nyou can change him? \\nBecause you and Erik sent \\nme back here together. \\nThe room \\nthey\\'re holding him in \\nwas built during \\nthe Second World War... \\nwhen there was \\na shortage of steel. \\nSo the foundation is pure \\nconcrete and sand. No metal. \\nHe\\'s being held... \\nPage 18/56\\na hundred floors \\nbeneath the most \\nheavily guarded \\nbuilding on the planet. \\nWhy is he in there? \\nWhat, he forgot \\nto mention? \\nUh, JFK. \\nHe killed... \\nWhat else explains a bullet \\nmiraculously curving through the air? Erik\\'s always had \\na way with guns. \\nAre you sure you want \\nto carry on with this? \\nThis is your plan, \\nnot mine. \\nWe don\\'t have any \\nresources to get us in. \\nOr out. \\nIt\\'s just me and Hank. \\nI knew a guy. \\nYeah, he\\'d be \\na young man now. \\nGrew up outside of D.C. \\nHe could get into anywhere. \\nI just don\\'t know how the hell we\\'re gonna find him. \\nIs Cerebro \\nout of the question? \\nIf only you guys \\nhad Internet. \\nWhat\\'s \"Internet?\" \\nWe have a phonebook. \\nI thought you\\'d be getting \\nready for your trip, sir. \\nI just came to \\ngrab a couple files. \\nIs that a new scarf? \\nIt\\'s nice. \\nThank you. \\nDr. Trask? \\nOne second. \\nOh. \\nPage 19/56\\nWe added some names \\nto the Paris meeting. \\nThank you. \\nIs something wrong, sir? \\nNo. It\\'s nothing. \\nWould you mind \\ntyping up my itinerary? \\nI don\\'t wanna miss anything. \\n- Here, here, here. \\n- Where? \\nJust stop here. \\nAll right, all right. \\nNext time I\\'m driving. \\nDon\\'t get used to it. \\nWhat\\'s he done now? \\nI will just write you a check for whatever he took. \\nWe just need to talk to him. \\nPeter! The cops \\nare here. Again. \\nI\\'m a princess. \\nWhat are you? \\nI\\'m the Wolverine. \\nWhere\\'s your brother? \\nGo upstairs \\nand bug your sister. \\nBut she bugs me! \\nWhat do you guys want? \\nI didn\\'t do anything. \\nI\\'ve been here all day. \\nJust relax, Peter. \\nWe\\'re not cops. \\nOf course you\\'re not. \\nIf you were, \\nyou wouldn\\'t be \\ndriving a rental car. \\nHow did you know \\nwe\\'ve got a rental car? \\nI checked your registration when you were walking to the door. \\nI also had \\nsome time to kill \\nso I went through \\nyour rental agreement. \\nPage 20/56\\nSaw you were from out of town. \\nAre you FBI? \\nNo, you\\'re not cops. \\nHey, what\\'s with this gifted youngsters place? That\\'s an old card. \\nHe\\'s fascinating. \\nHe\\'s a pain in the arse. \\nWhat, a teleporter? \\nNo, he\\'s just fast. \\nAnd when I knew him \\nhe wasn\\'t so... young. \\nYoung? \\nYou\\'re just old. \\nSo you\\'re not afraid \\nto show your powers? \\nWhat powers? What \\nare you talking about? \\nDo you see \\nsomething strange here? \\nNothing anybody would \\nbelieve if you told them. \\nSo, who are you? \\nWhat do you want? \\nWe need your help, Peter. \\nFor what? \\nTo break into a highly \\nsecured facility... \\nand to get someone out. \\nPrison break? \\nThat\\'s illegal, you know. \\nUm... \\nWell, only if \\nyou get caught. \\nSo, what\\'s in it for me? \\nYou, you kleptomaniac, \\nget to break into the Pentagon. \\nHow do I know \\nI can trust you? \\nBecause we\\'re \\njust like you. \\nShow him. \\nThat\\'s cool, \\nbut it\\'s disgusting. \\nBuilt in 1943, the Pentagon is the \\nPage 21/56\\nworld\\'s largest office building... housing more than \\n25,000 military employees... \\nstretched over six \\nmillion square feet. \\nWhere\\'s the bathroom? \\nHe always needs to pee! \\nYeah, we\\'re getting \\nbroadcast signal down here. \\nWhat\\'s going on? \\nDamn it, call Maintenance, \\nget them down here. \\n...fought for and captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Empire. Now, this month-long battle... included some of \\nthe fiercest fighting \\nduring World War \\nII in the Pacific... \\nIn three seconds, \\nthose doors are going to open... and 20 guards will \\nbe here to shoot us. \\nI know. That\\'s what \\nI\\'m waiting for. \\nWhat are you doing? \\nI\\'m holding your neck so \\nyou don\\'t get whiplash. \\nWhat? \\nWhiplash. \\nDon\\'t move! \\nYou\\'re \\ngood, it\\'ll pass. \\nIt happens with everyone. \\nYou must have done \\nsomething pretty serious. \\nWhat did you do, man? \\nWhat did you do? \\nWhat did you do? \\nWhy\\'d they have you in there? \\nFor killing the President. \\nAh. Wow. \\nShit. \\nThe only thing \\nPage 22/56\\nI\\'m guilty of \\nis fighting for \\npeople like us. \\nYou take karate? \\nYou know karate, man? \\nI don\\'t know karate. \\nBut I know crazy. \\nLadies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this is a Code Red situation. \\nWe are evacuating \\nthe entire floor... \\nso that my associate and I... \\ncan, uh, secure the prison. \\nWho are you? \\nWe\\'re special operations, \\nCB... \\nFB-CID. \\nPerhaps you didn\\'t hear me \\nwhen first I spoke... \\nbut it is imperative \\nthat you understand... \\nwe\\'re in a complete \\nlockdown situation. \\nWe have to get you \\nto the third floor... \\nOh, I\\'m sorry. \\nWere you finished? \\nThey told me \\nyou control metal. \\n\"They\"? \\nYou know, my mom once knew \\na guy who could do that. \\nI\\'m sorry, I\\'m just not \\nvery good with violence. \\nCharles? \\nGood to see you too, \\nold friend. \\nAnd walking. \\nNo thanks to you. \\nYou\\'re the last person in \\nthe world I expected to see today. Believe me... \\nI wouldn\\'t be here \\nif I didn\\'t have to. \\nPage 23/56\\nIf we get you out of here, \\nwe do it my way. \\nNo killing. \\nNo helmet. \\nI couldn\\'t disobey \\nyou even if I wanted. \\nI\\'m never getting \\ninside of that head again. \\nI need your word, Erik. \\nNobody move! \\nHold it right there! \\nCharles. \\nDon\\'t move. \\nHands up, \\nor we will shoot! \\nFreeze them, Charles. \\nI can\\'t. \\nHands up! \\nNo! \\nIf I could save time \\nin a bottle \\nThe first thing \\nthat I\\'d like to do \\nIs to save every day \\nTill eternity passes away \\nJust to spend them with you \\nIf I could make days \\nlast forever \\nIf words could make \\nwishes come true \\nI\\'d save every day \\nLike a treasure and then \\nAgain, \\nI would spend them with you \\nBut there never seems \\nto be enough time \\nTo do the things \\nyou want to do \\nOnce you find them \\nI\\'ve looked around \\nenough to know \\nThat you\\'re the one I want \\nto go through time with \\nThanks, kid. \\nPage 24/56\\nPeter, \\nthank you very, very much. \\nYou take care. \\nHey, I saw your \\nflight plan in the cockpit. \\nWhy are you going to Paris? \\nImagine if they were metal. \\nDo me a favor and return it for me. Okay. \\nAnd, Peter? \\nTake it slow. \\nWhere did they \\ndig you up? \\nYou\\'re gonna find \\nthis hard to believe... \\nbut, uh, you sent me. \\nYou and Charles. \\nFrom the future. \\nHow did you lose them? \\nThe treatment for my \\nspine affects my DNA. \\nYou sacrificed your powers \\nso you could walk? \\nI sacrificed my powers \\nso that I could sleep. \\nWhat do you know about it? \\nI\\'ve lost my fair share. \\nHa. \\nDry your eyes, Erik. \\nIt doesn\\'t justify \\nwhat you\\'ve done. \\nYou have no idea \\nwhat I\\'ve done. \\nI know that you took the things that mean the most to me. \\nWell, maybe you should have \\nfought harder for them. \\nIf you want a fight, \\nErik... \\n- Sit down. \\n...I will give you a fight! \\nLet him come. \\nYou abandoned me! \\nYou took her away... \\nPage 25/56\\nand you abandoned me! \\nAngel. \\nAzazel. \\nEmma. \\nBanshee. \\nMutant brothers and sisters... \\nall dead! \\nCountless others... \\nexperimented on. \\nButchered! \\nErik! \\nWhere were you, Charles? \\nWe were supposed \\nto protect them! \\nWhere were you when your \\nown people needed you? \\nHiding! You and Hank! \\nPretending to be \\nsomething you\\'re not! \\nErik! \\nYou abandoned us all. \\nSo, you were \\nalways an asshole. \\nI take it we\\'re best \\nbuddies in the future. \\nI spent a lot of years \\ntrying to bring \\nyou down, bub. \\nHow does that \\nwork out for you? \\nYou\\'re like me. \\nYou\\'re a survivor. \\nDo you wanna pick \\nall that shit up? \\nGeneral, maybe you should slow down, \\nwe have a big day tomorrow. \\nWe\\'re celebrating, captain. It\\'s not every day you win a war, let alone against the American devils. I\\'m getting another bottle. \\nExcuse me. \\nI\\'m pretty sure it was my fault. \\nYou speak Vietnamese. \\nI\\'m an interpreter. \\nI speak many tongues. \\nPage 26/56\\nLet me buy you another drink... unless you\\'re here with someone. I\\'m alone. \\nA bottle of Johnnie Walker please. You\\'re going to the Summit tomorrow? A pretty girl interested in politics... Looks can be deceiving. \\nLady. \\nShow me more, baby? \\nClothes off? \\nWhat\\'s the matter, baby? \\nYou don\\'t think I \\nlook pretty like this? \\nFancy a game? \\nIt\\'s been a while. \\nI\\'m not in the mood \\nfor games, thank you. \\nI haven\\'t had \\na real sip in ten years. \\nI didn\\'t kill the President. \\nThe bullet curved, Erik. \\nBecause I was \\ntrying to save him. \\nThey took me out \\nbefore I could. \\nWhy would you \\ntry and save him? \\nBecause he was one of us. \\nYou must think me \\nso foolish. \\nWe\\'ve always said they \\nwould come after us. \\nI never imagined they\\'d \\nuse Raven\\'s DNA to do it. \\nWhen did you last see her? \\nThe day I left for Dallas. \\nAnd how was she? \\nStrong. \\nDriven. \\nLoyal. \\nHow... How was she? \\nShe was... \\nWe were... \\nI could see why she \\nPage 27/56\\nmeant so much to you. \\nYou should be proud \\nof her, Charles. \\nShe\\'s out there \\nfighting for our cause. \\nYour cause. \\nThe girl I raised was \\nnot capable of killing. \\nYou didn\\'t raise her, \\nyou grew up with her. \\nShe couldn\\'t stay a little girl forever, that\\'s why she left. \\nShe left because you \\ngot inside her head. \\nThat\\'s not my power. \\nShe made a choice. \\nBut now we know where \\nthat choice leads, don\\'t we? \\nShe\\'s going to murder Trask, \\nthey\\'re going \\nto capture her... \\nand then they\\'re \\ngoing to wipe us out. \\nNot if we get \\nto her first. \\nNot if we change \\nhistory tomorrow. \\nI\\'m sorry, Charles... \\nfor what happened. \\nI truly am. \\nIt\\'s been a while \\nsince I\\'ve played. \\nI\\'ll go easy on you. \\nMight finally \\nbe a fair fight. \\nYou have the first move. \\nThe diplomats from \\nall around the world \\nare arriving here \\ntoday at the Hotel Royal. \\nIt\\'s an historic day. \\nIt\\'s the, uh, \\nofficial ending \\nof the United States\\' military \\nPage 28/56\\ninvolvement in Vietnam. \\nThere we have the South Vietnamese Foreign Minister... \\nwith other South \\nVietnamese dignitaries. \\nThe Summit doesn\\'t begin \\nfor another hour. \\nThe hotel has arranged \\na private room \\nupstairs for \\nyour special guests. \\nThat will be plenty of time. \\nGood afternoon, everyone. \\nHello, thank you for coming. \\nCongratulations on \\nwinning this war. \\nNow, I know you all \\nhave hands to shake \\nand photos to take downstairs... so I will get \\nright to the point. \\nThere is a new \\nenemy out there. \\nAn enemy that will render \\nyour arsenals useless... \\nyour armies powerless... \\nand your nations defenseless. \\nYou will need a new weapon for this war. I call them Sentinels. \\nNamed after \\nthe ancient guardians \\nthat stood at \\nthe gates of the citadel. \\nThey have the aeronautic capabilities of a Harrier jet. \\nArmed with guns \\nthat can fire off... \\nmore than 2,000 rounds per minute of thermoceramic ammunition. \\nBut size, power, \\nspeed... \\nYou could find that \\nat Lockheed or Boeing. \\nNo, what makes the \\nPage 29/56\\nSentinels so special... \\nis the ability to target \\nthe mutant X-gene. \\nA genetic guidance system \\nthat can lock onto a mark \\na half a mile away. \\nIt won\\'t trigger unless it has identified the target. \\nWith this weapon, \\nthere will be \\nno human collateral damage. \\nIf I turn it on, \\nthe system couldn\\'t \\neven activate in here. \\nUnless there\\'s a mutant. \\nThere has to be \\nsome kind of mistake. \\nMy machines don\\'t make mistakes. What are you? \\nI assure you... \\nNo, don\\'t shoot it. \\nI assure you, \\nI don\\'t know what \\nyou\\'re talking about. \\nRaven! \\nRaven? Raven! \\nRaven? \\nCharles? \\nWe\\'ve come for you, \\nErik and I. \\nTogether. \\nI never thought \\nI\\'d see you again. \\nI made you \\na promise a long time ago \\nthat I would protect you. \\nWolverine! \\nI\\'m going \\nto keep you safe. \\nI\\'m going to keep you \\nout of their hands. \\nErik? \\nErik? \\nWhat are you doing? \\nPage 30/56\\nSecuring our future. \\nForgive me, \\nMystique. \\nAs long as you\\'re out there, \\nwe\\'ll never be safe. \\nErik... \\nUse your power, \\nCharles. Stop him. \\nHe can\\'t. \\nHe\\'s slipping back. \\nI\\'m losing him. \\nStryker! \\nSomeone will finish \\nwhat we\\'ve started, Wolverine! One day! \\nRestrain him. \\nErik! \\nWhere am I? \\nHuh? \\nHow the hell \\ndid I get here? \\nWhat? You came to us. \\nWho are you? \\nCharles. \\nCharles Xavier! \\nI don\\'t know you. \\nHuh? \\nWhat the hell is that? \\nWhoa. Whoa. \\nLook, I can deal with this. Just go. Stop Erik! \\nErik, please... \\nI\\'m sorry. \\nErik... \\nYou\\'re Logan, \\nthat\\'s Hank McCoy, \\nI\\'m Charles Xavier. \\nYou spent the last \\ncouple of days with us. \\nYou\\'re on acid. \\nSomebody gave you \\nreally bad acid, yeah? \\nJust hold on tight, \\nwe\\'ll get through \\nPage 31/56\\nthis together. \\nOh, my God, Kitty. \\nShe\\'s wounded pretty bad. \\nI got him. \\nProfessor? \\nWhat happened to you? \\nI just saw someone \\nwho\\'s gonna \\nbring me a lot \\nof pain someday. \\nWhere\\'s Raven? \\nGone. \\nWhat? \\nWe have to get \\nout of here. \\nWe want to know if there\\'s \\nany sort of connection with... Yesterday, \\nthe Paris Peace Summit... \\nwas rocked by the appearance \\nof unidentified assailants... \\nthe likes of which \\nthe world has never seen. \\nMass hysteria has gripped \\nthe nation as people ask... \\n\"Where did they come from? \\nWill they be back?\" \\nAnd most importantly, \\n\"Are they friend or foe?\" \\nThat was London correspondent \\nToby Elliot... \\nreporting from the \\nParis Peace Summit yesterday. \\nFuck me. \\nWhat the hell are we dealing with here? Off the record. \\nTwo days ago, this man, \\nErik Lehnsherr... \\nescaped from a maximum security prison inside the Pentagon. \\nWe believe that this woman \\nis a former associate \\nof Lehnsherr\\'s. \\nThey were together in Cuba, \\nPage 32/56\\nthe day of \\nthe crisis in \\'62. \\nHe was also implicated \\nin Kennedy\\'s assassination. \\nWhat about that thing? \\nWe don\\'t know what \\nthat thing is, sir. \\nActually, we really don\\'t know what any of them are. \\nYes. Yes, we do. \\nThey\\'re mutants. \\nHe has the power \\nto control metal. \\nLast I checked, \\nthat\\'s what \\nmost of your weapons \\nwere made of. \\nAnd she can transform \\ninto anyone. \\nA general, \\na secret serviceman. \\nEven you, \\nMr. President. \\nShe could walk \\ninto this office... \\nand order a nuclear strike \\nif she was in the mood. \\nAnd that\\'s only \\ntwo of them. \\nDo we have any countermeasures? Any defense? \\nI was waiting for you \\nto ask me that question. \\nThat\\'s an experimental program, sir. Strictly off the books. \\nYou\\'re telling me these mutants are out in the world... \\nand our best defense \\nare these giant metal robots? \\nMany of the mutants \\nlook like us. \\nMy Sentinels can \\ntell the difference. \\nI have eight prototypes \\nPage 33/56\\nready to go. \\nThey\\'re built out of \\na space-age polymer, \\nnot an ounce \\nof metal on them. \\nI want to make \\na demonstration. \\nI want the world to know \\nthat we can protect them. \\nWhat do you need to get \\nthese things operational? \\nI already gave that \\nnumber to Congress. \\nUnfortunately, \\nthey elected to shut me down. \\nIt\\'s going to cost a bit \\nmore to turn them on. \\n- Whatever you need. \\n- Oh, and one more thing. \\nIf we do manage to capture them, I would like her. \\nFor research purposes, \\nof course. \\nI don\\'t care who you screw, \\nas long as it\\'s not me. \\nTerrible thing. \\nWhat is? \\nBeing born like that. \\nIs it? \\nCan you imagine... \\nLooking in the mirror and seeing that staring back at you? \\nYes, I can. \\nWhere do you think she comes from? You think she has a family? \\nYes. \\nShe does. \\nIf I see so much \\nas a screw move, \\nI will jam this \\ninto your throat. \\nHow did you find me? \\nYou taught me well. \\nIt\\'s been a long time \\nPage 34/56\\nsince we were this close. \\nI missed you. \\nYou tried to kill me. \\nSo the rest of us \\ncould live. \\nWhat do you mean? \\nWe received a message \\nfrom the future. \\nDon\\'t lie to me. \\nI never have, \\nand I never will. \\nHumans use your blood, \\nyour genes, \\nto create a weapon \\nthat wipes us all out. \\nI was only doing \\nwhat I thought \\nnecessary to secure \\nour future. \\nSo what\\'s to stop me \\nfrom killing you \\nright now and \\nsecuring my future? \\nNothing. \\nIt doesn\\'t matter anymore. \\nThey have your DNA. \\nYour blood was on the street. \\nWhose fault was that? \\nMine. \\nI\\'ve seen their plans. \\nThey\\'re creating a weapon. \\nAnd now they have what they need to take it further. \\nWe have to strike now, \\nwhile we still hold the upper hand. I\\'ve seen too many \\nfriends die, Erik. \\nI don\\'t want a war. \\nI only want the man \\nwho murdered them. \\nThis is war. \\nWhat happened to you? \\nDid you lose your way \\nwhile I was gone? \\nPage 35/56\\nAre you still Charles\\' Raven? \\nOr are you Mystique? \\nTrask is the enemy. \\nKilling one man isn\\'t enough. \\nIt never was for you. \\nGoodbye, Erik. \\nWhat happened? \\nCome on. \\nCan he walk? \\nHe needs his treatment. \\nHank, I can hear them. \\nI know. It\\'s okay. \\nCan you make it stop? \\nI\\'ll get them. \\nHey, hey. \\nPull yourself together. \\nIt\\'s not over yet. \\nYou don\\'t believe that. \\nHow do you know? \\nAs these go... \\nthis comes back. \\nThey all come back. \\nLook. \\nI\\'m still here... \\nand she\\'s still out there. \\nWe need your help, Charles. \\nNot like this. \\nI need you. \\nWe can\\'t find Raven. \\nNot without your powers. \\nI added a little extra \\nbecause you missed a dose. \\nCharles. \\nHank, do me a favor. \\nWould you help me \\nto my study, please? \\nCome on, I got you. \\nAre you sure about this? \\nAbsolutely not. \\nThis creature is extraordinary. Her genes could hold the key \\nto mutation itself. \\nI need more. \\nThat\\'s all they were able to \\nPage 36/56\\nscrape off the pavement in Paris. More than blood. \\nI need brain tissue... \\nspinal fluid, bone marrow. \\nImagine... \\nSentinels that could transform, adapt to any target. \\nIf I could just get \\nmy hands on her. \\nThis girl could leap \\nthe program forward years... \\ndecades into the future. \\nHow old is your \\nson now, Major? \\nJason? \\nHe\\'s coming up on ten now, \\nif you can believe it. \\nEight years from fighting age. And how many of \\nour sons and brothers \\ndid we just ship \\nhome in body bags? \\nMaybe fifty, \\nfifty-five thousand? \\nAnd how many more \\non the other side? \\nNever before... \\nin all of human history... \\nhas there been a cause which \\ncould unite us as a species. \\nUntil now. \\nYou really hate, \\nmutants, don\\'t you? \\nOn the contrary, \\nI rather admire them. \\nThe things they can do. \\nI see mutants \\nas our salvation. \\nA common enemy. \\nA common struggle \\nagainst the ultimate enemy. \\nExtinction. \\nI believe our new friends... \\nare going to help us \\nPage 37/56\\nusher in a new era, Bill. \\nA new era of genuine... \\nand long-lasting peace. \\nAttention, attention. \\nTransport departure \\nin two hours. \\nRepeat. Transport \\ndeparture in two hours. \\nWhen was the last time \\nyou were down here? \\nThe last time we went \\nlooking for students. \\nA lifetime ago. \\nWelcome, Professor. \\nRaven\\'s wounded. \\nShe won\\'t be moving fast. \\nThese are muscles \\nI haven\\'t stretched in a long time. Charles! \\nCharles! \\nCharles? It\\'s all right. \\nI\\'ll go check the generator. \\nIt\\'s not the \\nmachinery, is it? \\nI can\\'t do this. \\nMy mind... \\nYes, you can. \\nIt won\\'t take it. \\nYou\\'re just a little rusty. \\nYou don\\'t understand. \\nIt\\'s not a question of being rusty. I can flip the switches. \\nI can turn the knobs. \\nBut my power comes from here. \\nIt comes from... \\nAnd it\\'s broken. \\nI feel like one \\nof my students. \\nHelpless. \\nIt was a mistake \\ncoming down here. \\nIt was a mistake freeing Erik. This whole thing has been \\none bloody mistake. \\nPage 38/56\\nI\\'m sorry, Logan, \\nbut they sent back the wrong man. You\\'re right. \\nI am. \\nActually, it was \\nsupposed to be you. \\nBut I was the only one who could physically make the trip. \\nAnd, uh... \\nAnd I don\\'t know \\nhow long I\\'ve got here. \\nBut I do know that \\na long time ago... \\nactually, a long \\ntime from now... \\nI was your most \\nhelpless student. \\nAnd you unlocked my mind. \\nYou showed me \\nwhat I was. \\nYou showed me \\nwhat I could be. \\nI don\\'t know how \\nto do that for you. \\nYou\\'re right. \\nI don\\'t. \\nBut I know \\nsomeone who might. \\nHmm. \\nLook into my mind. \\nYou saw what \\nI did to Cerebro. \\nYou don\\'t want me \\ninside your head. \\nThere\\'s no damage \\nyou can do... \\nthat hasn\\'t already \\nbeen done. Trust me. \\nCome on. \\nHey. \\nHey, Logan. \\nHi, Jean. \\nKill me. \\nI love you. \\nPage 39/56\\nYou poor, poor man. \\nLook past me. \\nNo, I don\\'t want \\nyour suffering. \\nI don\\'t want your future! \\nLook past my future. \\nLook for your future. \\nThat\\'s it. \\nThat\\'s it. \\nThat\\'s it. \\nCharles. \\nCharles. \\nSo this is what \\nbecomes of us. \\nErik was right. \\nHumanity does this to us. \\nNot if we show \\nthem a better path. \\nYou still believe? \\nJust because someone \\nstumbles, loses their way... \\nit doesn\\'t mean \\nthey\\'re lost forever. \\nSometimes we all need \\na little help. \\nOh, I\\'m not \\nthe man I was. \\nI open my mind... \\nand it almost \\noverwhelms me. \\nYou\\'re afraid, \\nand Cerebro knows it. \\nAll those voices... \\nso much pain. \\nIt\\'s not their pain \\nyou\\'re afraid of. \\nIt\\'s yours, Charles. \\nAnd as frightening \\nas it may be... \\nthat pain will \\nmake you stronger. \\nIf you allow \\nyourself to feel it... \\nembrace it... \\nPage 40/56\\nit will make you more powerful than you ever imagined. \\nIt\\'s the greatest \\ngift we have... \\nto bear their pain \\nwithout breaking. \\nAnd it\\'s born... \\nfrom the most human power. \\nHope. \\nPlease, Charles... \\nwe need you to hope again. \\nFind what you were looking for? The power\\'s back on. \\nYes. \\nYes, it is. \\nShe\\'s lost too much blood. \\nShe can\\'t keep \\ngoing like this. \\nWe have no \\nchoice, Bobby. \\nWe can wake him up. \\nNo! \\nThey need more time. \\nI had... \\na glimpse into the past. \\nIf we wake Logan now... \\nwe may set our fate \\non an even darker course. \\nThey need more time. \\nThere is someone else. \\nNo, no one \\nhas Kitty\\'s power. \\nSomeone that could \\ntake her power, \\ntake her place. \\nShe took yours once. \\nRogue. \\nI\\'m sorry, Bobby, \\nshe must be dead. \\nI haven\\'t been able to make \\na connection \\nwith her for years. \\nThat\\'s because \\nthey\\'re keeping her \\nPage 41/56\\nin the one place \\nyour mind can\\'t reach \\nfrom the outside. \\nShe\\'s in Cerebro. \\nShe\\'s in your house, \\nProfessor. \\nThey\\'re experimenting on her. \\nTrying to tap into her power, \\nso they can take ours. \\nTake all of ours. \\nIf you knew this, \\nwhy didn\\'t you go after her? \\nWe tried. \\nIt\\'s too heavily guarded. \\nI may know a few things \\nabout that house they don\\'t. \\nKitty, I\\'m \\ngoing to get help. \\nI\\'m gonna bring back \\nsomebody to help you. \\nPlease, just bring \\nyourself back. \\nRaven, stop. \\nStop running. \\nCharles? \\nWhere are you? \\nBack at the house... \\nwhere you should be. \\nI need you to come home. \\nI know what \\nI need to do. \\nIf you kill Trask... \\nyou will be creating countless more just like him. \\nThen I\\'ll kill them, too. \\nThose are Erik\\'s words, \\nnot yours. \\nOh! \\nThe girl I grew up with \\nwasn\\'t capable of killing. \\nShe was good... \\nfair, full of compassion. \\nI have compassion. \\nJust not for Trask. \\nPage 42/56\\nHe\\'s murdered \\ntoo many of us. \\nShut her down, Charles. \\nGet in her head. \\nShe\\'s not letting me in. \\nI\\'m barely holding on. \\nI\\'m not strong enough yet. \\nI know what \\nTrask has done... \\nbut killing him \\nwill not bring them back. \\nIt will set you \\non a path... \\nfrom which \\nthere is no return. \\nAn endless cycle of killing. \\nUs and them, \\nuntil there is nothing left. \\nBut we can stop it, \\nright now, you and I. \\nYou just have \\nto come home. \\nI have to? \\nYou haven\\'t changed \\nat all, Charles. \\nLike I said... \\nI know exactly \\nwhat I have to do. \\nYou do? \\nThen, wherever you go, \\nI will find you. \\nAnd, Raven, if you make me, \\nI will stop you. \\nGood luck, Charles. \\nWhere is she? \\nShe\\'s in an airport, \\nboarding a plane. \\nShe could be \\ngoing anywhere. \\nGet some \\nrest, Charles. \\nWe\\'ll track her in the \\nmorning and find out \\nexactly where \\nPage 43/56\\nshe\\'s going. \\n...rockets did land \\noutside the base, \\nkilling five civilians \\nand wounding 12 others. \\nYeah? \\nYou know that those things \\ncan give you cancer? \\nI\\'ve done some toxicology \\ntests in the lab, and... \\nYou want something? \\nYeah, I\\'m... \\nI know it\\'s complicated, \\nand there\\'s probably \\nall kinds of rules \\nand reasons for what \\nyou can and can\\'t say, \\nbut I was wondering \\nif you could tell me \\nin the future, \\ndo I make it? \\nNo. \\nOh. \\nOkay. \\nIt\\'s okay. Thanks. \\nHey, kid? \\nIt\\'s just the world \\nI came from. \\nWe\\'re going \\nbackwards in time. \\nTomorrow, in front \\nof the White House, \\nthe President will \\nmake his announcement. \\nHe will be joined by \\nSecretary of Defense Laird... \\nand has even \\nsought the help \\nof renowned scientist \\nBolivar Trask... \\nhis special advisor to \\ncombat this mutant issue. \\nThe White House has \\nasked all three networks \\nPage 44/56\\nto air the event live, \\nas it is a \\nmatter of importance \\nnot only to the \\nUnited States, \\nbut to every citizen \\nfrom around the globe. \\nThere are no other details \\nabout the event... \\nRaven... \\nMy God. \\nI don\\'t understand. \\nWhat are you doing here? \\nI, uh... \\nI guess, \\nI just realized \\nI have nowhere else to go. \\nI\\'ve gotta wake Charles... \\nNo, don\\'t. \\nJust wait. \\nYou really shouldn\\'t \\nwalk on this. \\nI\\'ve had worse. \\nSo, you\\'ve been living \\nhere all these years? \\nSomeone had to \\ntake care of Charles. \\nYou know, \\nhe\\'s missed you. \\nHe misses who I was. \\nI\\'m not who he wants \\nme to be anymore. \\nI\\'ve missed you. \\nSo, you\\'re like this \\nall the time now. \\nLike what? \\nThis. \\nNo, not \\nall the time. \\nI take a shot \\nin the morning, \\nand I need another \\nif I get worked up. \\nWorked up? \\nPage 45/56\\nYeah, yeah, \\nwhen I\\'m... \\n...emotional \\nor excited. \\nAny animal urges. \\nHmm. \\nUsually, I can \\nfight them off. \\nWell, maybe, \\nwe shouldn\\'t have to fight off the things that \\ncome naturally to us. \\nDo you remember one of \\nthe last things you said to me? That I would never be deemed beautiful, looking like this? \\nDo you still think that? \\nMaybe. You saw \\nwhat happened in Paris. \\nYou know what \\nthey think of us. \\nWhat do you think? \\nI think you\\'re beautiful. \\nWhat about yourself? \\nYou should get some rest. \\nI\\'m glad you\\'re home. \\nHank? \\nDo you remember the last \\nthing I said to you? \\nIt was, \"Mutant and proud.\" \\nThe old gas and water pipes \\nlead straight to the house. \\nThe walls are made \\nof reinforced steel. \\nIn other words, a door. \\nYou\\'re walking \\ndirectly over the hall now. \\nI\\'ve been on that slab. \\nLet me show you \\nhow it feels. \\nRogue, Rogue, \\ncome on. Wake up. \\nRogue. \\nCome on, Rogue, wake up. \\nPage 46/56\\nWake up, it\\'s me. \\nNo. \\nRogue, Rogue, Rogue, \\nit\\'s okay. He\\'s with me. \\nWe\\'re gonna \\nget you out of here. \\nErik, Bobby. \\nGet out of there! Now! \\nTake her! \\nBobby! No! \\nBobby! \\nBobby! \\nProfessor! \\nGet us out of here. \\nBobby. \\nI know. \\nI\\'m sorry, Charles. \\nWhere\\'s Bobby? \\nI\\'m sorry, Kitty. \\nHello, Logan. \\nRogue. \\nRaven was here. \\nI screwed up. \\nShit. \\nWe can\\'t track her now. \\nShe\\'s cut her ties. \\nHey, I saw in the \\nnews last night \\nthere\\'s going to be an announcement in Washington this afternoon \\nabout a new \\nprotocol for mutants. \\nI set the system \\nI designed... \\nto record any news about \\nParis over all three networks... and PBS. \\nAll three? Wow. \\nYeah, and PBS. \\nLook what I found. \\nTomorrow, in front \\nof the White House, \\nthe President will \\nmake his announcement. \\nPage 47/56\\nHe will be joined by Secretary of Defense Laird... \\nand has even sought the help \\nof renowned scientist \\nBolivar Trask... \\nhis special advisor \\nto combat this mutant issue. \\nThe White House has asked... \\nRaven doesn\\'t realize... \\nthat if she kills Trask \\nat an event like that... \\nwith the whole world watching... Then I came a \\nlong way for nothing. \\nAnd there\\'s more bad news. \\nI saw in a report... \\nthey found traces \\nof her blood in Paris. \\nFor all we know, \\nthey already have her DNA... \\nwhich is all they\\'d need. \\nTo create the \\nSentinels of the future. \\nThere\\'s a theory \\nin quantum physics... \\nthat time is immutable. \\nIt\\'s like a river. \\nYou can throw a pebble into it... and create a ripple, \\nbut the current always corrects itself. No matter what you do, the river just keeps flowing in the same direction. What are you trying to say? \\nWhat I\\'m saying is... \\nwhat if the war \\nis inevitable? \\nWhat if she\\'s \\nmeant to kill Trask? \\nWhat if this is just \\nsimply who she is? \\nJust because someone stumbles, loses their way... \\ndoesn\\'t mean \\nthey\\'re lost forever. \\nPage 48/56\\nNo, I don\\'t believe \\nthat theory, Hank. \\nAnd I cannot believe \\nthat is who she is. \\nReady the plane. \\nWe\\'re going to Washington. \\nYou all right? \\nGetting there. \\nWhatever happens today, \\nI need you to promise me something. You\\'ve looked into my mind \\nand seen a lot of bad... \\nbut you\\'ve seen \\nthe good, too. \\nThe X-Men. \\nPromise me you\\'ll find us. \\nUse your power, \\nbring us together. \\nGuide us. Lead us. \\nStorm. Scott. \\nJean. \\nRemember those names. \\nThere are so many of us. \\nWe will need you, \\nProfessor. \\nI\\'ll do my best. \\nYour best is enough. \\nTrust me. \\nThere\\'s 12 carriers \\ninbound, 10 miles! \\nThey\\'ve found us. \\nThousands of people \\nwill be gathered here today. \\nThey\\'ve come from \\nall over the world... \\nto witness history, \\nalong with news crews... \\nfrom at least \\n50 different countries. \\nThank you. \\nCan I see your \\ninvitations, please? \\nYes, you may. \\nThese two \\nPage 49/56\\nare with me. \\nGo ahead. \\nThank you. \\nLogan! \\nPlease, this way, sir. \\nFourth infantry... \\nTook a Bouncing Betty. \\nWhat happened to you? \\nFriendly fire. \\nThe worst kind. \\nYeah. \\nI haven\\'t found her yet, \\nbut she has to be here. \\nThe President \\nof the United States. \\nMy fellow Americans... \\ntoday we face the gravest \\nthreat in our history... \\nmutants. \\nWe have prepared \\nfor this threat. \\nIn the immortal words \\nof Robert Oppenheimer... \\n\"Behold. \\n\"The world will never be \\nthe same again.\" \\nCan I help you? \\nNo, you can\\'t. \\nHere they come. \\nThis is for you, \\nbrothers and sisters. \\nRaven? \\nI have her. \\nLet me go, Charles. \\nThere. You see? \\nSecret Serviceman. \\nLeft of the stage. \\nGot him. \\nGo. \\nWhat the hell \\nare you doing? \\nI didn\\'t tell you \\nto activate them. \\nI didn\\'t. \\nPage 50/56\\nRaven, please, \\nlisten to me. \\nWe\\'ve been given a second \\nchance to define who we are. \\nDon\\'t do this. \\nGentlemen, you cannot \\npass this point. \\nWe can\\'t stop that many. \\nNo, but we can \\nslow them down. \\nErik! \\nAh! \\nStorm! \\nGo, go, go! \\nWatch your head! \\nGo, go, go! \\nTake us to DEFCON 3. \\nMr. President, \\nwe are Code Red. \\nWhat\\'s our air \\ndefense readiness? \\nAll our air \\ndefenses are ready one. \\nWhat the hell \\nhappened out there? \\nI will fix it. \\nYou said that before. \\nI wanted to make a statement. \\nNow the whole goddamn world \\nknows we can\\'t protect them. \\nI will fix it. \\nYou damn well better. \\nCharles! \\nNo, no, no... \\nIs everybody okay? \\nNo! \\nBehind you. \\nAh! \\nNow! \\nDo what you \\nwere made for. \\nWhere are you? \\nAh! \\nI got this! Go! \\nPage 51/56\\nOh, dear God, no. \\nSo much for \\nbeing a survivor. \\nOne of them is in here. \\nNo, no, no! \\nDon\\'t kill it! \\nI need it alive. \\nWhat the hell has happened? \\nYou built these \\nweapons to destroy us. \\nWhy? \\nBecause you are \\nafraid of our gifts. \\nBecause we are different. \\nHumanity has always feared \\nthat which is different. \\nWell, I am here \\nto tell you... \\nto tell the world... \\nyou are right to fear us. \\nWe are the future. \\nWe are the ones \\nwho will inherit this earth. \\nAnd anyone who \\nstands in our way... \\nwill suffer the same fate \\nas these men... \\nyou see before you. \\nToday was meant to be \\na display of your power. \\nInstead I give you a glimpse... of the devastation my race \\ncan unleash upon yours. \\nLet this be a warning \\nto the world. \\nAnd to my mutant \\nbrothers and sisters out there... I say this. \\nNo more hiding. \\nNo more suffering. \\nYou have lived \\nin the shadows... \\nin shame and fear for too long. Come out. \\nPage 52/56\\nJoin me. \\nFight together in \\na brotherhood of our kind. \\nA new tomorrow... \\nthat starts today. \\nAll those years wasted... \\nfighting each other, \\nCharles. \\nTo have a precious \\nfew of them back... \\nMr. President, sir. \\nStand down. \\nI said, stand down! \\nYou want to make a statement? \\nKill me. Fine. \\nBut spare everyone else. \\nVery heroic, \\nMr. President... \\nbut you had no intention... \\nof sparing any of us. \\nThe future of our \\nspecies begins now. \\nYou used to be \\na better shot. \\nTrust me, \\nI still am. \\nGet out of my head, \\nCharles! \\nRaven. \\nPlease, do not make us \\nthe enemy today. \\nLook around you. \\nWe already are. \\nNot all of us. \\nAll you\\'ve done so far... \\nis save the lives \\nof these men. \\nYou can show them \\na better path. \\nShut her down, Charles. \\nI\\'ve been trying to control \\nyou ever since the day we met... and look where \\nthat\\'s got us. \\nPage 53/56\\nEverything that happens now... is in your hands. \\nI have faith \\nin you, Raven. \\nHe\\'s all \\nyours, Charles. \\nIf you let them have me, \\nI\\'m as good as dead. \\nYou know that. \\nI know. \\nGoodbye, old friend. \\nGoodbye, Erik. \\nAre you sure you \\nshould let them go? \\nYes. \\nI have hope for them. \\nThere\\'s going to be a time, Hank, when we are all together. \\nWhat about Logan? \\nThe first time \\nEver I saw your face \\nI thought the sun... \\nBuckminster Fuller is a great \\nexample of an architect... \\nwhose ideas were very similar \\nto those of a utopian future. \\nGood morning, Logan. \\nLate start. \\nHave a good lunch. \\nGood job. \\nThank you. \\nVery good job. \\nStorm. \\nJean. \\nHey, Logan. \\nJean. \\nAre you okay? \\nYou\\'re here. \\nWhere else would I be? \\nWhoa. \\nEasy, pal. \\nWell, some things \\nnever change. \\nIt\\'s good to \\nPage 54/56\\nsee you, Scott. \\nUh-huh. \\nSee you \\nlater, Jean. \\nProfessor. \\nLogan, is everything \\nall right? \\nYeah. \\nYeah, I think it is. \\nYou did it. \\nDid what? \\nLogan, don\\'t you have \\na class to teach? \\nA class to teach? \\nHistory. \\nHistory? \\nActually, I could use \\nsome help with that. \\nHelp with what? \\nPretty much \\neverything after 1973. \\nI think the history \\nI know is a little different. \\nWelcome back. \\nIt\\'s good to \\nsee you, Charles. \\nIt\\'s good to see everyone. \\nWell... \\nI had a promise to keep. \\nYou and I have a lot of \\ncatching up to do. \\nYeah. \\nWhat\\'s the last thing \\nyou remember? \\nDrowning. \\nThe past. \\nA new... \\nand uncertain world. \\nA world of \\nendless possibilities. \\nAnd infinite outcomes. \\nYou kidding me? \\nOh, he\\'s alive! \\nCountless \\nPage 55/56\\nchoices define our fate. \\nEach choice, each moment... \\na ripple in the river of time. What do you want us to do with him, Major Stryker? \\nEnough ripples... \\nand you change the tide. \\nI\\'ll take him from here. \\nFor the future \\nis never truly set. \\nPage 56/56'"
