Razor wire. A formidable hellhole.  SUPER: BURREL PRISON - ALBANIA \\nA KAWASAKI NINJA 300 FLIES UP to the prison gates.  \\nTWO GUARDS watch as a silky figure climbs off the bike and  removes her helmet to reveal a gorgeous head of red hair.  \\nDialogue in ITALICS is in ALBANIAN with ENGLISH SUBTITLES: \\nGATE GUARD \\nYou lose your way?  \\nGIRL \\nNo, I’m right where I need to be.  \\nShe unzips her jacket. Is she gonna flash them? But then she  pulls out two ENVELOPES.  \\nConfused, the guards open them up. They’re filled with  AMERICAN DOLLARS. \\nGIRL (CONT’D) \\nAleksander Luga. Inmate 2-1-9-5. I  \\nwant him free.  \\nThe guards trade looks. Go to hand the money back. \\nGATE GUARD \\nGet the fuck out of here. \\nGIRL \\nJust know... We gave you the easy  \\nway out. \\nTwin precision shots rip through the guards foreheads. IN A  FLASH: AN EXTRACTION TEAM emerges from the treeline.  \\nThe girl pulls control keys from a guard’s pocket. Steps into  a security shack. Disarms security and opens a side gate. \\nWearing night vision goggles and carrying Geind SMS-65  submachine guns, the gunmen enter the prison with military precision, THE ENTIRE CHARGE SEEN IN NIGHT VISION GREEN. \\nINT. BURREL PRISON - ISOLATION WING - CELL - SAME \\nAn inmate is doing push-ups. With one arm. In a handstand.  His body is lean. Covered in tats. One for each kill. His  head is shaved. He is as dangerous as they come.  \\nHe is ALEKSANDER LUGA.\\n2.\\nINT. BURREL PRISON - VARIOUS - SAME \\nThe extraction team makes their way through the prison. A  gunman attaches an explosive to a lock. BLOWS FREE the door. \\nINT. BURREL PRISON - UTILITY ROOM - SAME \\nA gunman cuts wires to the electrical grid. \\nINT. BURREL PRISON - CELL BLOCK - SAME \\nThe lights SHUT OFF -- leaving guards vulnerable to the  extraction team, wearing night vision. They CUT THEM DOWN.  \\nINT. BURREL PRISON - ISOLATION WING - MOMENTS LATER \\nThe hallway door EXPLODES. TEAM LEADER crosses up to Luga’s  cell. Attaches another charge to the door. It blows open.  Luga steps out. Instantly demands:  \\nLUGA \\nGive me a gun. \\nThe gunman hands him a Glock 30. Luga sees two guards rushing  up and FIRES -- killing them both. \\nEXT. BURREL PRISON - SAME \\nA MERLIN HELICOPTER shoots towards the prison.  INT. BURREL PRISON - VARIOUS - SAME \\nThe extraction team commences exfil. \\nEXT. BURREL PRISON - SAME \\nThe helicopter touches down inside the walls. Luga and the  extraction team hop inside. It flies off. \\nEXT. PLG SHIPPING COMPANY - MAGIC (SIX HOURS BEHIND) A large building on the Indian River in Florida.  SUPER: MIAMI - FLORIDA \\nINT. PLG SHIPPING COMPANY - OFFICE - SAME \\nBARDHA, a tough Albanian, hands a cheap phone to his boss,  ALBERT HESS, 50’s, serious and intelligent. Into the phone: \\nHESS \\nPut him on.  \\nINT. MERLIN HELICOPTER - INTERCUTTING \\nLuga takes the phone from the Lead Team Member. \\n3.\\nHESS \\nYou know who this is? \\nLUGA \\nI got your message. \\nHESS \\nGood -- then you know I only got  \\nyou out for one reason. This is not \\na personal job. It’s business.  \\nYou’re to do what I hired you to do  \\nand nothing more. Tell me you  \\nunderstand that. \\nLUGA \\n...I understand. \\nLuga hangs up. Stares ahead. Cold eyes. Hard. END INTERCUT.  \\nHESS \\n(to Bardha) \\nI need to keep this dog on a short  \\nleash. Make sure he’s brought to me  \\nthe second he gets off the boat.  \\nHess sends the phone down a chute -- into an incinerator. RESUME HELICOPTER:  \\nflying off -- as RAP MUSIC BLASTS.  \\nEXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT \\nSHOOTING over neon-lit water, we pan up to frame the MIAMI  SKYLINE, the sonic WHOOSH of a 6262cc V12 engine as we GO TO: \\nA GUN-GRAY FERRARI 599 \\nTHUNDERING past Miami hot-spots. Behind the wheel, dressed  like a GQ cover model: MIKE LOWERY. A Lamborghini Huracan  pulls up beside him at a red light, two IMG MODELS inside.  \\nIMG MODEL #1 \\nSweet ride. \\nShe REVS the engine. \\nMIKE \\nYou two aren’t silly enough to want  \\nto race me. \\n...Maybe. \\nIMG MODEL #1 IMG MODEL #2 \\n...Depends how big your engine is.  \\n4.\\nMIKE \\nBig enough for two. What do you  \\nhave under the hood?  \\nIMG MODEL #1 \\nCatch us and you’ll find out.  \\nMIKE \\nWould if I could, but I got work.  \\nI’ll have to find you ladies later. \\nIMG MODEL #1 \\nAnd how do you plan to do that? \\nMike flashes his BADGE. Girls smile. The light turns green.  They ZOOM AHEAD. Mike mouths “damn” and ROARS forward. \\nEXT. AVENTURA MALL - PARKING LOT - LATER \\nA luxury shopping center. Mike’s Ferrari pulls up and parks.  INT. FERRARI - SAME \\nMike checks his Hublot King Power Black Mamba watch.  \\nMIKE \\nAlright, it’s almost game time.  \\nDaltrey, Sanchez, you two set?  \\nThis to a HIDDEN MICROPHONE in the lining of the car ceiling.  INT. CADILLAC ESCALADE - SAME \\nParked a few cars away from Mike. Sitting inside are two next generation cops with MIAMI-DADE PD’S TACTICAL NARCOTICS TEAM:  SCOTT DALTREY (Louisiana-transplant; ex-Marine; Duck Dynasty- beard; the guy you want backing you in a firefight) and MARIA  SANCHEZ (Latina; sexy; teflon-tough).  \\nBoth cops are wired with MICS near their throats so they can  talk without holding up a radio. \\nDALTREY \\nReady to rumble, hoss. \\nRESUME MIKE: \\nMIKE \\nTheroux, where are you at? \\nCAM (V.O.) \\nRight behind you partner. \\nWait, partner? What happened to Marcus Burnett?  \\nMike looks in the rear-view at the sweet-looking Dodge  Challenger SRT8 behind him. The driver gives a wave.  \\n5.\\nINT. DODGE CHALLENGER - SAME \\nMeet Mike’s new partner: CAM THEROUX, young and cocky.  INTERCUT ALL THREE CARS: \\nCAM \\nNice of your connection to pick  \\nthis place to meet. I say after we  \\nbust the bad guys, we do a little  \\nshopping, a candle from Wicks N  \\nSticks, maybe grab some Cinnabon.  \\nDaltrey, some new bandanas? \\nMIKE \\nHey, you wanna do your job or you  \\nwanna fuck around? \\nCam gets quiet quick. \\nMIKE (CONT’D) \\nNow let’s go over it again: as soon  \\nas I agree to the buy, I give the  \\ncall to Theroux to show up with the  \\ngreen. Once we got the glass in  \\nhand: Daltrey, Sanchez, you two  \\ncome in hard and fast, back us up.  \\nNo call, you’re all statues unless  \\nI give the trouble signal. Any  \\nquestions? \\nSANCHEZ \\nYeah. What’s the trouble signal? \\nMIKE \\n“Oh shit, I’m in trouble.” Now  \\nlet’s get sharp. It’s prove  \\nyourself time.  \\nCam resents Mike’s condescending attitude. Under his breath: \\nCAM \\nProve yourself, my ass. \\nEXT. AVENTURA MALL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER Stores are closing. Mike and the TNT cops are still waiting. RESUME DALTREY AND SANCHEZ: \\nDALTREY \\nC’mon, top 3 country songs. Go. \\nSANCHEZ \\nThey’re all the same. If it\\'s not  \\nabout cheating, it\\'s about  \\ndrinking. Or screwing. \\n6.\\nDALTREY \\nAnd that’s different from what you  \\nlisten to? It’s all about Kush,  \\nbitches and doe.  \\nSanchez sits up. Spots a mousey WHITE GUY heading toward  Mike’s car. Into her mic:  \\nSANCHEZ \\nLowery, heads-up. \\nMike sees the white guy approaching. His connection. \\nMIKE \\nThat’s him. Get ready. \\nCam zips open a gym bag on the passenger seat. A Strayer  \\nVoight Infinity TIKI handgun rests atop wrapped stacks of  bills. He discretely pulls out the gun.  \\nMike gets ready to step out of his Ferrari but the connection  doesn’t slow down. Just keeps walking up to Mike’s car -- \\n-- and drops a PRE-PAID CELL onto Mike’s lap. \\nCam, Daltrey and Sanchez are all thrown. Mike was supposed to  meet him in the open. \\nMike sees the connection vanish into the shadows of the  parking lot, then picks up the phone.  \\nVOICE ON PHONE \\nWe need to change locations. \\nMIKE \\nWhat are you talkin’ about? This is  \\nwhere we agreed to meet. \\nVOICE ON PHONE \\nNot anymore. You want what we’re  \\nselling, you come to us. Club \\nApagón. Be there in twenty minutes.  \\nBring the cash to the VIP section.  \\nCome alone. \\nCLICK. The call ends. Back into his mic: \\nMIKE \\nAlright, change of plan. We’re  \\ngoin’ clubbing. Meet’s at a place  \\ncalled Apagón. \\nSanchez instantly gets on her phone and runs a search.  \\nSANCHEZ \\nAfter hours joint in Little Havana. \\n7.\\nDALTREY \\nGoddamn set-up. \\nCAM \\nC’mon Mike, you’re not serious.  \\nThat’s an invitation to a hit. \\nYou gotta call this off. \\nMIKE \\nNot callin’ anything off. \\n(urgent) \\nSanchez, Daltrey: beat us to the  \\nclub. Make sure you got eyes and  \\nears in place when the deal goes  \\ndown. \\nDaltrey and Sanchez immediately drive away in the Escalade. \\nMIKE (CONT’D) \\nTheroux, you hold back out front  \\nwith the money and don’t release it  \\nuntil you get the call from me. You  \\ngot it? \\nCam’s not happy -- but Mike’s the senior officer here. \\nCAM \\nYeah, I got it. \\nMike drives off. Cam shakes his head. \\nCAM (CONT’D) \\nGoddammit Lowery. \\nAnd starts up his ride. LATIN TECHNO BLASTS as we GO TO:  INT. CLUB APAGÓN - LATER \\nAn EXPLOSION OF SOUND AND LASER LIGHT. Lots of skin. Miami’s  YOUNGEST AND HOTTEST dance around acrobatic salsa performers  and bikini-clad conga dancers. \\nEXT. CLUB APAGÓN - SAME \\nUnder the I-95 overpass in Little Havana. The Escalade parks.  INT. CADILLAC ESCALADE - SAME \\nDaltrey turns to see Sanchez STRIPPING in the passenger seat. \\nDALTREY \\nWhat are you doing?  \\nSANCHEZ \\nSame thing you should be. This is a  \\nclub, not a Waffle House. \\n8.\\nSanchez removes her jacket and shirt to reveal a lacy  \\ncamisole. Daltrey takes off an outer-shirt, throws off his  bandanna and messes up his hair. \\nINT. CLUB APAGÓN - MOMENTS LATER \\nLooking club-hot, Sanchez and Daltrey step inside. Play the  role of boyfriend and girlfriend. Hands all over each other. \\nThe two cops take up position so they have line of sight into  the GLASS ENCASED VIP AREA. \\nDALTREY \\n(into a hidden mic) \\nAll ready Mike, you’re good to go. \\nEXT. CLUB APAGÓN - SAME \\nMike arrives, followed by Cam, who watches Mike enter the  club, still thinking he’s nuts to do so. \\nINT. CLUB APAGÓN - MOMENTS LATER \\nMike crosses underneath LATIN DANCERS GYRATING in CAGES to  the VIP SECTION. \\nFIVE MEN await him, standing. A beefy SECURITY OFFICER runs a  wand over Mike. He’s clean.  \\nDaltrey and Sanchez watch as Mike steps inside the VIP area.  But as soon as the glass door closes behind him -- \\n-- the glass turns FROSTED. Sanchez and Daltrey can’t see in. \\nShit.  \\nSANCHEZ \\nINT. DODGE CHALLENGER - SAME \\nWhat? \\nCAM \\nDALTREY \\nWe can’t see inside.  \\nCam shifts, uneasy.  \\nINT. CLUB APAGÓN - VIP AREA - SAME \\nSUDDENLY -- GUNS APPEAR, AIMED AT MIKE.  \\nThe five men are members of a cruel and merciless HOME  INVASION CREW that specializes in ripping off drug buyers. \\nLEAD GUNMAN \\nPut your fucking hands up mother fucker! \\n9.\\nMIKE \\nWhoa, let’s dial this shit down.  \\nThe LEAD GUNMAN steps forward, threatening: \\nLEAD GUNMAN \\nWhere’s the fucking money!?! \\nMIKE \\nThere is no fucking money. \\nLEAD GUNMAN \\nCall your boy and get us our money  \\nor we kill your ass!  \\nA GUNMAN presses a Glock into his temple. \\nINT. DODGE CHALLENGER - SAME \\nHearing this, Cam grabs the gym bag off the passenger seat,  throws open his door and crosses the parking lot to the club. \\nINT. CLUB APAGÓN - VIP SECTION - SAME \\nDespite the guns aimed at him, Mike keeps cool. \\nMIKE  \\nHow about you all go fuck  \\nyourselves instead?  \\nLEAD GUNMAN \\nWhat the fuck did you say to me,  \\nasshole? \\nMIKE \\nThe money is what’s keeping me  \\nalive. You get that, then what? No.  \\nWe do this, we do it my way.  \\nEXT. CLUB APAGÓN - SAME \\nCam gets intercepted by the bouncer -- his gun bulge visible. \\nBOUNCER \\nClub’s full, homie.  \\nCam drops the bag, grabs the bouncer’s hand and elbow,  presses them together, KICKS out his knee and SLAMS his head  against the wall. The bouncer’s out-cold. He pulls out the  bouncer’s radio headset and pockets his cell phone and gun.  Then picks back up the gym bag and moves into the club. \\nRESUME MIKE: \\nMIKE \\nNow put your guns down, show me the  \\nglass and we can make this happen.  \\n10.\\nINT. CLUB APAGÓN - SAME \\nSanchez and Daltrey see Cam go to the VIP area. \\nSANCHEZ \\nWhere the fuck’s he going? Lowery  \\nhasn’t given the signal yet. \\nRESUME MIKE: \\nMIKE \\nIf not, just shoot me now cause  \\nyou’re not gonna see dime one of  \\nthat fucking money. \\nCam SLAMS his hand on the door outside. \\nCAM (O.S.) \\nHey, open up, I got your money! \\nMike rolls his eyes. Asshole. No choice -- \\nMike KNOCKS away the gun that’s pressed to his temple while  quick-drawing a SECOND GLOCK out of the gunman’s pants. \\nHe aims it at the leader as another CREW MEMBER FIRES. Mike  uses his gunman as a HUMAN SHIELD, trading bullets. The glass  wall SHATTERS! \\nINSTANT PANDEMONIUM! EVERYONE IN THE CLUB GOES RUNNING! \\nCam draws the bouncer’s gun and starts laying down cover  fire. Mike escapes the VIP section. \\nTWO MORE GANG MEMBERS run from the main area of the club. But  before they can shoot at Mike and Cam -- BANG! BANG! BANG! Daltrey and Sanchez take them out.  \\nIt’s an ALL OUT GUN BATTLE -- bullets shooting electrical  equipment -- CAUSING SPARKS and FIRE. WATER GUSHES out of the  sprinklers. Everyone gets DRENCHED.  \\nThe Lead Gunman goes for an exit. Mike CHARGES after him.  Another SHOOTER takes aim, but before he can fire -- his head  EXPLODES.  \\nREVEAL: CAM -- having just taken the kill shot. \\nMike gets closer to the Lead Gunman -- who whips around,  FIRING at Mike, who then SLIDES across the wet floor, legs  STRIKING the Lead Gunman, who drops onto his back. \\nMike swings the gun right into his face. \\nMIKE \\nLike I said: my way. \\n11.\\nEXT. CLUB APAGÓN - LATER \\nAftermath. Fire trucks. Cruisers. A Crown Victoria pulls up.  CAPTAIN LEO HOWARD steps out. Surveys the chaos and zeroes in  on the man responsible: Mike, currently fighting with Cam. \\nYou disobeyed a direct order!CAM \\nMIKE \\nThey were gonna kill you! \\nMIKE \\nWhat you did was put the whole crew  \\nat risk!  \\nAs tensions reach a fever pitch, Howard comes walking up. \\nCAPTAIN HOWARD \\nYeah, yeah, this looks about right  \\nfor one of your Thursdays. Wait,  \\ncan that be? Oh my God yes, the  \\nbuilding’s still standing. You must  \\nbe losing your touch, Mike. \\nMIKE \\nCaptain, before you start in -- \\nOver here. \\nCAPTAIN HOWARD \\nMike follows Howard away from Cam and the others. \\nMIKE \\nLook it’s not my fault that things  \\ngot out of hand this time. \\nCAPTAIN HOWARD \\nOf course not. It was “ABM’s”  \\nfault. Anyone But Mike’s. You said  \\nthis was gonna be a routine buy.  \\nMIKE \\nWhich it would have been if Theroux  \\nlistened -- \\nCAPTAIN HOWARD \\nWait, someone didn’t listen to you?  \\nI’m sorry ‘CAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA  \\nWHAT THAT’S LIKE! You know, ever  \\nsince the “Bad Boys” broke up,  \\nyou’re like my nephew without  \\nRitalin. You weren’t a one man army  \\ndoing everything the way you want.  \\nSo I’m telling you now: you better  \\nlearn how to be part of a fucking  \\nteam again. \\nHoward walks away. OFF MIKE -- fuck that, MUSIC and GO TO: \\n12.\\nEXT. MIAMI - MORNING \\nSun breaks, casting morning rays over the city. INT. BURNETT HOUSE - MORNING \\nThe front door flies open, letting in a walking rack of DRY CLEANING. A dog rushes in and undercuts the mess, tripping  the person in the center: MARCUS BURNETT. \\nOh shit! \\nMARCUS \\nTHERESA (O.S.) \\nBaby, that you? \\nHe falls, and the dog tramples the clothes. \\nTHERESA (CONT’D) \\nDid you remember the dry-cleaning? \\nUh-huh!  \\nMARCUS \\n(to the dog) \\nGo, scoot, away. \\nPast the open rumpus room door, a phone is ringing. INT. BURNETT HOUSE - “RUMPUS ROOM” - MOMENTS LATER \\nWhich has been converted into a combination gym/home office.  On the treadmill, JAMES BURNETT, 16, has just answered the  phone. QUINCY, 15, reads a men’s fitness magazine.  \\nJAMES \\nHello, B.S. Unlimited! \\nMARCUS \\n(entering) \\nJames! No, no, man. How many times  \\ndo I have to tell you: it’s not  \\nB.S. unlimited. It’s “Burnett  \\nServices Unlimited. Private  \\nInvestigator.” \\nJAMES \\nI think B.S. makes more sense.  \\nMarcus snatches the phone. Clears his throat. \\nMARCUS \\nGood morning. Burnett Services  \\nUnlimited. \\nHe scrambles for something to write on. Quincy hands him a  torn-out page from his magazine. It’s an ad for MALE BOTOX.  \\n13.\\n“Because you’ve only got one face. BRO-TOX.” The tight face  of a middle-aged man peers back. Marcus leers at Quincy. \\nMARCUS (CONT’D) \\nYou’re adopted. \\n(into the phone) \\nYes, ma’am, I got thirty years of  \\ninvestigative experience.  \\nNarcotics, Murder One, kidnapping,  \\nhuman trafficking. Seen it all.  \\n(crestfallen) \\nOh, your husband came home late? \\nHe begins writing notes onto the BRO-TOX AD. \\nMARCUS (CONT’D) \\nNo ma’am, there is no sin too big  \\nor too small for Marcus Burnett. \\nINT. BURNETT HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \\nMarcus walks in on wife THERESA hugging their 22 year-old  daughter, MEGAN. \\nTHERESA \\n...just make sure you break it to  \\ndad gently. \\nMARCUS \\nBreak what to dad gently? \\nMegan turns to Marcus. Smiles. \\nOh shit. \\nMARCUS (CONT’D) \\nMarcus!MEGAN \\nTHERESA \\nDad! \\nMARCUS \\nI’m sorry, baby. That was just a  reflex. I’m here now... What were  you gonna say? \\nI’m -- \\nOh shit! Marcus! \\nMEGAN \\nMARCUS THERESA MARCUS \\nTheresa, what do you want from me?  Our little girl wants to go off and  marry that idiot, Clark. \\n14.\\nMEGAN \\nDad, I’m not marrying Clark. \\nMARCUS \\nDamn right you’re not.  \\nMEGAN \\nI’m having his baby. \\nMARCUS \\nOh hell no. \\nMarcus -- \\nTHERESA MARCUS \\nTheresa, excuse me, but no way.  First off, Clark’s unemployed -- \\nMEGAN \\nHe’s not unemployed. He works at  home. He does freelance. \\nMARCUS \\nYou know who also does freelance at  home? Hookers. And I wouldn’t want  them to be my baby’s baby daddy  either. \\nMEGAN \\n(storming past him) \\nYou’re unbelievable. \\nMegan! \\nMARCUS THERESA \\nGood one, baby. Real slick.  \\nTheresa follows her now-crying daughter. Marcus looks down.  He still has the BRO-TOX AD in his hand. \\nMARCUS \\nWhat are you looking at? \\nA beat as the picture catches his gaze again. Lingers there.  He doesn’t break. Wait, is Marcus considering “Bro-Tox?” \\nEXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY \\nA cargo ship trudges over choppy waters, spewing smoke.  INT. CARGO SHIP - HOLD - SAME \\nShip see-sawing, Luga shaves his beard -- dry. Looks in a  small mirror at his new face, still menacing.  \\n15.\\nINT. MIKE’S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - MORNING \\nPanning across the ultimate bachelor pad, we pick up pieces  of clothes. Shoes. Pants. Then a skirt. A bra.  \\nWe hear a shower running as we land on Mike, asleep in bed.  The phone RINGS, waking him. He picks it up, answering: \\nMIKE \\nLowery... Yeah, alright. I’ll be  \\nthere in twenty. \\nAn arm drapes over him. Belongs to IMG MODEL #1 from the  opening, a pair of HANDCUFFS dangling from her wrist. \\nIMG MODEL #1 \\nDon’t tell me you’re leaving me  \\nagain. \\nMIKE \\nSorry, baby. Duty calls.  \\nIMG MODEL #2 (O.S.) \\nBut we haven’t posted bail yet. \\nMike looks to the BATHROOM where IMG MODEL #2 has just  emerged from the shower, naked and wet.  \\nBut whereas before, Mike would mouth “damn”, now he  looks...bored. Has the bachelor life become too routine? \\nEXT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - DAY \\nMike’s Ferrari roars up. Parks. \\nINT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - ELEVATOR - DAY Mike crosses the lobby to the elevator. As the doors shut -- \\nVOICE  \\nHold the elevator. \\nMike stops the doors from closing to reveal LT. ELLIE  GARRISON, strong-willed and beautiful. Even her conservative  business suit can’t diminish the luster she gives off.  \\nELLIE \\n(stepping inside) \\nSergeant. \\nMIKE \\nLieutenant. \\nEllie hits the button for 6. Mike has already pressed 8.  Ellie is the only woman in Miami who won’t succumb to Mike’s  charm -- but that hasn’t stopped him from trying. \\n16.\\nMIKE (CONT’D) \\nHear the brass wants you to head up  \\nVice. Congratulations. \\nELLIE \\nThank you.  \\nMIKE \\nSure Howard’s gonna miss having you  \\nas his #2. If you want I could help  \\nyou celebrate. \\nELLIE \\nI don’t think so. \\nMIKE \\nYou know one of these days you’re  \\ngonna surprise me and say yes. \\nELLIE \\nAnd one of these days you’re gonna  \\nsurprise me and say nothing. \\nThe elevator stops at Ellie’s floor and she gets out. Mike  smiles. Likes her. She’s a challenge. The doors close and -- \\nINT. TNT DIVISION - MOMENTS LATER \\n-- re-open on the 8th floor. Mike crosses the busy bullpen to  Howard’s closed office. \\nINT. TNT DIVISION - HOWARD’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \\nMIKE \\n(knocking as he enters) \\nHey Captain, they said you wanted  \\nto see me.  \\nCAPTAIN HOWARD \\nClose the door. \\nMike sees Howard isn’t alone. There’s someone else with him:  FBI SPECIAL AGENT DAN KESSLER, 50’s. Mike closes the door. \\nCAPTAIN HOWARD (CONT’D) \\nMike, this is Agent Dan Kessler  \\nwith the FBI Miami field office. \\nMIKE \\n(sitting down) \\nSo is this a good meeting or a bad  \\nmeeting? \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nAleksander Luga escaped from Burrel \\nPrison in Albania. \\n17.\\nMike reacts. He knows the name well. \\nAGENT KESSLER (CONT’D) \\nNeedless to say, his capture has  \\nbecome top priority for both the  \\nbureau and Interpol. \\nMIKE \\nI’m sure not everyone is being told  \\nin person. \\nCAPTAIN HOWARD \\nMike, the FBI has reason to believe  \\nLuga’s on his way to Miami right  \\nnow.  \\nMIKE \\nTo do what? \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nTo kill you. \\nFor a second that hangs there -- but Mike is hardly rattled. \\nMIKE \\nThat it? Bad guys try to kill me  \\nevery day.  \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nI wouldn’t be here if I didn’t  \\nthink I was saving your life. We’ve  \\ngot intel that his people back in  \\nAlbania have been running searches  \\non you. They have your social  \\nsecurity number, your home  \\naddress... \\nMIKE \\nLuga’s not a fool. He’s not gonna  \\ncome all this way, risk all the  \\nheat, just to kill me.  \\nAGENT KESSLER \\n(deadly serious) \\nThat’s exactly what he’ll do. You  \\nand Marcus Burnett killed his  \\nbrother. The Albanians call it  \\n“Krvna Osveta”. Means he’s made a  \\nblood oath to get revenge against  \\nyou both. His people have been  \\ndoing this for centuries. Luga’s on  \\na vendetta and he doesn\\'t give a  \\nshit if Miami PD, FBI, Interpol,  \\nthe Goddamn Marines, are after him.  \\nNow for your own safety, you need  \\nto be put into protective custody  \\nimmediately —- \\n(insulted) My safety? \\nMIKE \\n18.\\nAGENT KESSLER (CONT\\'D) \\n-- while the FBI tracks down  \\nand apprehends Luga.  \\nMIKE \\nIf anyone is gonna apprehend him -- \\nAGENT KESSLER \\n(cutting him off;  \\ncondescending as hell) \\nIt’s gonna be the FBI. We know all  \\nabout how you operate, Lowery.  \\nShoot first, can’t ask a question  \\n‘cause the suspect’s now dead. Now  \\nyou’re to stand down like a good  \\nboy -- \\nInsulted by “boy”, Mike stands up -- towering over Kessler.  \\nMIKE \\nBoy, who you calling boy? \\nCAPTAIN HOWARD \\n(rising; before things get  \\nout of hand) \\nThank you, Agent Kessler. I  \\nappreciate you bringing this to our  \\nattention.  \\nA beat, then Kessler, staring back at Mike, turns to Howard,  then leaves. The second the door closes behind him: \\nMIKE \\nCan you believe that shit, Captain? \\nCAPTAIN HOWARD \\nI absolutely do... That’s why  \\nyou’re going into protective  \\ncustody immediately. \\nMIKE \\nWhat? You gotta be kidding -- \\nCAPTAIN HOWARD \\nThis guy broke out of a maximum  \\nsecurity prison. I’m not taking any  \\nchances.  \\nMIKE \\nThere’s no way I’m sitting on my  \\nass alone in some Motel 6 while  \\nthere’s a target on my back. \\nCAPTAIN HOWARD \\nFirst of all... it’s a Red Roof Inn  \\nand secondly, yes you are.

MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \\nA fire red CAMARO Z28 is parked across from a small house. INT. CAMARO - SAME \\nMarcus surveils the house of a client, MRS. WALLACE. Through  NIGHT-VISION BINOCULARS, Marcus glimpses TOM WALLACE in the  kitchen, washing the dishes.  \\nMarcus readies a PARABOLIC MIC, unfolding a satellite dish.  He slips in the earpiece to hear: \\nMRS. WALLACE (O.S.) \\nOh, and can you remind me we need  \\nto get the dog’s dewclaw trimmed?  \\nHe turns down the volume. \\n20.\\nMRS. WALLACE (CONT’D) \\nJesus, Tom. Why are you putting  \\nthose pans in the dishwasher? Are  \\nyou trying to strip the Teflon? \\nMarcus grimaces, muttering to himself. \\nMARCUS \\nDon’t let her punk you like that! \\nHe sees the Wallaces arguing. Marcus just stares ahead, a  faraway look in his eyes. Suddenly -- THREE BLACK SUBURBANS  WITH TINTED WINDOWS ROAR UP TO THE CAMARO. CAGE HIM IN.  \\nMarcus sits up. Who are these guys? Off which: \\nEXT. RED ROOF INN - MAGIC \\nOutside Miami, beside a highway, across from an empty field.  Sun setting, Cam’s Challenger drives up. \\nINT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \\nWalking up with Cam, Mike wraps up a call on his cell. \\nMIKE \\nCrawford. Lowery. Hit me back as  \\nsoon as you get this. \\nCAM \\nThought Howard said no calls. \\nMIKE \\nI’m not gonna sit on my hands. I  \\ngotta find this guy before he finds  \\nme. \\nCAM \\nSo this Luga...you and Burnett  \\nkilled his brother? \\n(Mike nods) \\nAnd now he wants to kill you.  \\n(Mike says nothing) \\nHappens a lot with you, doesn’t it? \\nThey round a corner. Cam leads Mike to his room, explaining: \\nCAM (CONT’D) \\nAlright, you’re in room 124.  \\nDaltrey and Sanchez have set up a  \\nsurveillance room across the hall.  \\nCaptain’s orders: you are not to  \\nleave the room under any  \\ncircumstances. You need something:  \\nfood, toothbrush, Q-tip, dial 125.  \\nOtherwise, try to relax. \\n21.\\nOn “relax”, Cam unlocks room 124 and the door opens into: INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 124 - CONTINUOUS \\nWhere Mike is met by MARCUS -- sitting on the edge of the  bed, flipping through channels in a pair of SKINNY JEANS. \\nMIKE \\nWhat’s he doing here? \\nMARCUS \\nWhat am I doin’ here? No one said  \\nanythin’ about you bein’ here.  \\nCAM \\nCaptain’s orders -- \\nMIKE \\nWell, he can un-order it. \\nCAM \\nLuga wants to kill the both of you. \\nMARCUS \\nWhich is why I need to get as far  \\naway from this man as possible! \\nMIKE \\nYou need to be away from me? \\nMARCUS \\nYou’re like a magnet for all things  \\nlife-threatening.  \\nMIKE \\nHere we go. \\n(to Cam) \\nCall down to the desk and get me  \\nanother room. \\nCAM \\nCan’t do it.  \\nMIKE \\nThis is not gonna work. \\nCAM \\nThis is the only secure room in the  \\nhotel. We got it wired for sound  \\nand video. We don’t have enough men  \\nto watch and protect two rooms, so \\nwhat can I tell ya? You’re  \\nroommates. \\nCam steps out. Mike and Marcus lock eyes. Silence. \\n22.\\nINT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 125 (TNT ROOM) - SECONDS LATER Across the hall. Daltrey and Sanchez watch the Mike and  \\nMarcus reunion on a closed circuit feed. Daltrey packs a can  of dip -- SNAP, SNAP, SNAP. \\nCam enters. Joins them at the monitor. \\nSANCHEZ \\nFive bucks says Lowery swings  \\nfirst. \\nRESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:  \\nMike notices the mess Marcus has already made in the tiny  room: fast food wrappers on the floor; used napkins on the  desk; clothes everywhere.  \\nMIKE \\nNice to see you’ve learned how to  \\nclean up after yourself. \\nMARCUS \\nDon’t start up with me. This is a  \\nbad situation for both of us.  \\nMIKE \\nSo why don’t you -- \\nMike pauses, fully registering Marcus in his skin-tight  skinny jeans for the first time. \\nMIKE (CONT’D) \\nWhat the hell are you wearing? \\nMARCUS \\nWhat? These are my threads. \\nMIKE \\nLook at you. You can barely move. \\nMARCUS \\nThey fit just fine.  \\nMIKE \\nThey’re painted on! \\nMARCUS \\nYou’re just jealous cause you’re  \\nnot the coolest looking -- \\nMIKE \\nHow the hell am I supposed to take  \\nyou seriously in those? \\n23.\\nMARCUS \\nWhat do I care if you take me  \\nseriously or not. That’s the beauty  \\nof not having to work with you  \\nanymore. \\nMIKE \\nSo why don’t you just walk out? Not  \\nlike you haven’t done that before. \\nMARCUS \\nOh so that’s how it’s gonna be,  \\nhuh? \\nMIKE \\nWasn’t my call, remember?  \\nMARCUS \\nYeah, and I know how much that  \\nbothers you. \\nMIKE \\nWhat’s that supposed to mean? \\nMARCUS \\nIt’s the Mike Lowery Show and we’re  \\nall just guest stars.  \\nMIKE \\nIs it possible for you to not talk  \\nout of your ass?  \\nRESUME CAM, DALTREY AND SANCHEZ:  \\nDALTREY \\nMy folks used to fight the exact  \\nsame way. \\nRESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:  \\ngetting loud and tense. \\nMARCUS \\nI warned you not to screw around  \\nwith these Albanians!

That’s supposed to  \\nmean something.  \\nMARCUS \\nI was a cop.

We’re to take -- \\nLUGA \\nGive me your phone. \\nViktor’s caught off guard by the request. Luga just stares  him down, eyes clarifying “give me your fucking phone.”  \\nViktor doesn’t know what to do, but he knows better than to  piss someone like Luga off. Wisely hands it over. \\nLuga steps away. Pulls a paper with a number on it. Dials.  \\nBut we stay with Viktor and his men, watching Luga. They  trade looks. What the hell is going on? A beat later, Luga  returns. Now wants something else. \\nLUGA (CONT’D) \\nGive me a gun. \\nViktor trades confused glances with his men. \\nVIKTOR \\nMr. Luga...? \\n28.\\nLUGA \\nI said give me a gun now. \\nLuga locks his eyes into Viktor again. No, he’s not fucking  around. Viktor is stuck.  \\nHe hands Luga a Glock. But it’s not enough. \\nLUGA (CONT’D) \\nYou have more? \\n(half-nod from Viktor) \\nGet in the car. \\nLuga moves past them, to the Ford Flex. Viktor turns back to  his men, who shrug.

Just lets Hess bluster. \\nHESS (CONT’D) \\nEvery law enforcement agent in  \\nFlorida is looking for you now. \\nLUGA \\nYou think I care about your police?  \\nBack home, they’re the criminals. \\nHESS \\nYou’re not home. We have a way of  \\ndoing things here. And I’m not  \\ngonna let you further jeopardize  \\neverything I’ve worked toward -- \\nLUGA \\nYou hide. You fear the police when  \\nthey should fear you.  \\nHESS \\n(not backing down) \\nForager’s here in two days. You’re  \\nnot leaving until then. \\nLuga sees he’s surrounded by Hess’s GUNMEN. Trapped. \\nHe then turns back to Hess. Says nothing. Just smiles. It’s  unnerving as hell. A chill runs down Hess’s spine but he  doesn’t let his anxiety show.  \\nMoments later, a metal door SLIDES OPEN. Luga steps inside,  disappearing down into the basement.  \\nAlbanians SEAL the door behind him, locking Luga inside.  \\nBARDHA \\nAre you sure about him? \\nHESS \\nI’m sure he’s essential. I’m sure  \\nif he wasn’t the only one who could  \\ndo what needed to be done, I’d  \\ndrown him in the river myself.  \\n(turning to Bardha) \\nThe three you sent to bring him  \\nhere..?  \\nBARDHA \\nThey didn’t show. Luga came alone.  \\nViktor and them are probably  \\nrunning. Scared for their lives. \\n40.\\nHESS \\nThey should be. Find them -- and  \\nkill them. \\nBardha nods. Turns and leaves.  \\nAGENT KESSLER (V.O.) \\nWhat part of what I’m telling you  \\nare you not clear about,  \\nlieutenant? \\nINT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - SITUATION ROOM - MORNING \\nEllie squares off against Kessler, passionate and intense.  Also on hand: MIAMI-DADE P.D. BRASS, including INSPECTOR  ROBERT LUTTRELL of Internal Affairs. 40’s. Tough, but fair.  \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nYou and your officers are to stand  \\ndown from this investigation  \\nimmediately. \\nELLIE \\nAnd what part of “I don’t give a  \\nshit” are you not clear about,  \\nAgent Kessler? That’s one of our  \\nown fighting for his life in a  \\nhospital bed right now. No way FBI  \\nkeeps us out of this! \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nDo you even know who you’re dealing  \\nwith? Before he was an enforcer  \\nwith the Albanian mafia, Aleksander  \\nLuga was in the Special Operations  \\nBattalion. One of the best trained  \\nunits in Europe and part of the  \\nelite Commando Regiment. He’s also  \\nan experienced pilot, highly  \\nskilled in hand-to-hand combat,  \\nknife training and light and heavy  \\nartillery readiness. Responsible  \\nfor at least 26 confirmed  \\nassassinations, so even if we  \\nallowed Miami PD to go after him,  \\nyou’re not equipped to do so. \\nELLIE \\n(not backing down) \\nThat is total bullshit! \\nINT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - SAME \\nMike moves with purpose up the corridor. He’s still in last  night’s blood-stained clothes. \\nRESUME SITUATION ROOM: \\n41.\\nAGENT KESSLER \\n(softening) \\nLook, Lieutenant, I’m sorry about  \\nCaptain Howard... I am. But this is  \\nbigger than you know.  \\nLUTTRELL \\nWhy? What are you talking about? \\nKessler pauses. Doesn’t want to give up any details, but his  silence betrays him. \\nELLIE \\nLuga didn’t just come here to kill  \\nLowery and Burnett, did he? \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nI can’t tell you that. Not until we  \\ncan be sure there are no more  \\nleaks.  \\nLeaks?  \\nLUTTRELL \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nLuga found out where you were  \\nkeeping Lowery and Burnett. That  \\ndidn’t come from us. What you  \\nshould be focusing on now is  \\nfinding another safe place for them  to wait this out. \\nELLIE \\nBecause that worked so well the  \\nfirst time? Or is it cause you  \\nthink setting up one of ours as  \\nbait is a good way to flush out  \\nyour fugitive? \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nConspiracy theories aside, Luga is  \\nan FBI matter -- which means Miami  \\nPD will stand down. All evidence  \\nrelating to last night is under our  jurisdiction.  \\nLUTTRELL \\nAgent Kessler, with all due  \\nrespect, the shooting at the Red  \\nRoof Inn involved our officers, not  yours. Miami PD Internal Affairs  \\nhas a responsibility to investigate  and every right to look at any  \\nevidence you have. \\nKessler pauses. He’s right. Can’t shut him out. \\n42.\\nAGENT KESSLER \\nAlright... I’ll allow access only  \\nto Internal Affairs, but our  \\ncooperation ends there, you  \\nunderstand?  \\nLuttrell nods. Fine. \\nINT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER \\nMike reaches the situation room just as the door opens and  Kessler moves out past him. Ellie sees Mike and walks up.  \\nMIKE \\nLet me guess: stand down and shut  \\nup? \\nELLIE \\nI know how you feel, Mike. No one  \\nwants to get this asshole more than  \\nme, but we have to let the Feds \\ntake the lead.  \\nBut Mike doesn’t buy that, cutting past her, leaving. \\nMike! \\nELLIE (CONT’D) \\nINT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \\nMike moves with purpose. Down the hall from him is Cam with  the TNT team. He sees Mike coming. Offers condolences. \\nCAM \\nMike, about Captain Howard, I just  \\nwanted to say -- \\nBut he never gets it out, Mike blowing by him. Shut out, Cam  watches his partner disappear around a corner as we GO TO: \\nEXT. BURNETT HOUSE - DAY \\nFive Miami-Dade PD cars are parked in front, keeping watch. INT. BURNETT HOUSE - SAME \\nPolice looking on: Burnetts dump bags and suitcases, packing  for an extended trip. Marcus coordinates from a balcony. \\nMARCUS \\nAlright Burnetts, you’re just here  \\nto take what you need and get out.  \\nYou’re leavin’ in ten minutes.  \\nJesus, Megan, how many suitcases  \\nyou plan on bringin’? You’re just  \\ngoin’ on a trip, you’re not movin’ \\nout. \\n43.\\nMEGAN \\nHow do I know that? No one’s  \\ntelling me where we’re going or for  \\nhow long. \\nMARCUS \\nThat’s ‘cause you don’t need to  \\nknow. It’s not safe. I’m tryin’ to  \\nprotect you.  \\nMEGAN \\nThen let me bring all my clothes  \\nwith me! \\nEXT. BURNETT HOUSE - SAME \\nMike’s Ferrari rolls up. He regards the house. Been a while  since he’s been here.  \\nA beat and he walks to the door. Gives a nod to the uniform  cops manning the house. \\nINT. BURNETT HOUSE - SAME \\nResponding to Mike’s knock, Theresa opens the door.  \\nTHERESA \\n(surprised) \\nMike. \\nMIKE \\nHey, Theresa, great to see you. \\nThey hug. Unlike her husband, Theresa missed seeing him. \\nTHERESA \\nGreat to see you. Even under the  \\ncircumstances... How’s Captain  \\nHoward? \\nMIKE \\nHard to say. Touch and go. \\nTHERESA \\nWe’re praying for him. \\nMarcus’s kids see Mike. Head over. Thrilled. \\nJAMES/QUINCY \\nHey, Uncle Mike!/Yo, Uncle Mike,  \\nwhat’s up? \\nSeeing them, Mike lights up. He missed them. They slap hands. \\nMIKE \\nOh my God, you boys got HUGE!  \\nMegan, damn, you’re a beauty.  \\n44.\\nMARCUS (O.S.) \\nWhat are you doin’ here, Mike?  \\nMike looks up to see Marcus, on the balcony above. \\nTHERESA \\n(behave) \\nMarcus. \\nMEGAN \\nUncle Mike, has my dad told you the  \\ngood news? \\nWhat news?MARCUS \\nMIKE \\nMegan, zip it! \\nMEGAN \\n(as Marcus protests:) \\nI’m pregnant! \\nMike’s jaw drops.  \\nMIKE \\nWOW!(to Marcus) \\nHEY! (to Megan) \\nYES!(they hug) \\nCONGRATS! \\nThank you! \\nMEGAN MARCUS \\nMike. Downstairs. Now. \\nINT. BURNETT HOUSE - “RUMPUS ROOM” - MOMENTS LATER Marcus leads Mike downstairs. Mike looks around the “office.” \\nMIKE \\nWow. The nerve center. \\nMARCUS \\nWhat are you doin’ here, Mike? I  \\nthought you wanted nothin’ to do  \\nwith me. \\nMIKE \\nYou still tight with Coleman at the  \\nFBI Miami office? \\nMARCUS \\n...He owes me a few favors. Why? \\n45.\\nMIKE \\nFeds are shutting Miami PD out of  \\nthe Luga investigation. I need  \\naccess to the Feds’ evidence file  \\non the shooting last night. \\nMARCUS \\nSo you came here to use me. \\nMIKE \\nRegardless of what’s going on with  \\nyou and me, I owe it to Howard to  \\ngo after Luga. Not to mention that  \\nas long as he’s out there, neither  \\none of us is safe. No matter how  \\nfar you send your family away.  \\nMarcus considers him, then: \\nMARCUS \\nYou don’t have to convince me. I  \\nwanna find him just as badly as you  \\ndo. \\nINT. BURNETT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \\nMike waits for Marcus to say his goodbyes. \\nMARCUS \\nAlright, y’all say goodbye. Daddy’s  \\ngotta go to work. \\nThe Burnetts flock in -- but quickly bypass their dad and go  directly to Mike, hugging him with love.  \\nJAMES/QUINCY/MEGAN \\nBye, Uncle Mike!/We love  \\nyou!/Please see us again! \\nMike beams, hugging them back -- while Marcus steams. \\nMARCUS \\nYeah, keep on showin’ him the love.  \\nIt’s not like Uncle Mike’s the  \\nreason you-all goin’ into hidin’. \\nMarcus sees Theresa, coming down the hall. He crosses up to  her. They hug. A private husband and wife moment.  \\nTHERESA \\nI’m scared, Marcus. \\nMARCUS \\nDon’t be, baby. These cops are  \\ngonna make sure nothing happens to  \\nyou or the kids. Everything’s gonna  \\nbe alright. I swear.  \\n46.\\nMike watches the couple, close. We catch a flicker of regret  on his face -- then Marcus walks out with him. \\nEXT. BURNETT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \\nMIKE \\nMy car’s over here. \\nMARCUS \\nOh no, no, this ain’t like old  \\ntimes. I’m not riding shotgun in  \\nBruce Wayne’s car. We doin’ this,  \\nwe’re taking my ride this time. \\nMarcus leads Mike over to his red-hot Camaro.  \\nWhoa... \\nMIKE \\n(reading the license  \\nplate) \\nStraight Pimpin’. Huh. They  \\ncouldn’t fit mid-life crisis on  \\nthere?  \\nMarcus digs into the pocket of his skinny jeans. \\nMIKE (CONT’D) \\nSure you can even get the keys out? \\nMARCUS \\nI can get the keys out! \\nMarcus struggles. Clearly he can’t.  \\nMike can’t help but smile as Marcus, with some difficulty,  finally gets his hand out of his pocket, pulling out his keys  -- along with his wallet and phone -- which go FLYING.  \\nMARCUS (CONT’D) \\nNot a word. \\nMIKE \\nNo problem, grandpa. \\nMarcus pauses, steaming -- then picks up his stuff and gets  in the car without another word to Mike. The two drive off. \\nEXT. MIAMI HOMESTEAD SPEEDWAY - DAY \\nA BLUR of stock cars ZIP around a race track. Marcus sits  with COLEMAN, an old friend and seasoned FBI agent. \\nCOLEMAN \\nThe office already got an e-mail  \\nabout this, warning everyone not to  \\ncooperate with Miami PD. \\n47.\\nMARCUS \\nGood thing I’m not Miami PD \\nanymore. \\nCOLEMAN \\nYeah, but your crazy-ass partner  \\nstill is. \\nMARCUS \\nLowery ain’t my partner no more.  \\nThis is for me and Captain Howard. \\nColeman debates, then: \\nCOLEMAN \\nAlright...but this stays between  \\nus. We ID’d one of the shooters  \\nwith Luga from the hotel  \\nsurveillance footage. His name’s  \\nViktor Gojahki. He’s tied into the  \\nAlbanian mob, but he’s pissing in  \\nthe wind. No one knows where he is.  \\nAnd if we can’t find him, good  \\nluck.  \\nEXT. MIAMI HOMESTEAD SPEEDWAY - PARKING LOT - SAME \\nMike stands in front of the Camaro. A group of hot-looking  SPEEDWAY GIRLS walk past. Give Mike the eye.  \\nMIKE \\nYup, I can make any car look good. \\nMarcus crosses up.  \\nMARCUS \\nI got a name. \\nMarcus gets in the car as Mike’s phone buzzes. \\nLowery. \\nMIKE \\nELLIE (V.O.) \\nJust wanted to make sure I made  \\nmyself clear earlier. \\nMIKE \\nWhat, about not wanting to date me?  Yeah, but I didn’t really take that  too seriously. \\nINTERCUT: \\n48.\\nINT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - ELLIE’S OFFICE - SAME \\nELLIE \\nAbout Luga. You’re not going after  \\nhim, correct? \\nMIKE \\nAbsolutely not.  \\nELLIE \\n‘Cause you need to stay away from  \\nthis case. Cam’s with you, right? \\nMIKE \\nOf course. We’re attached at the  \\nhip. I love that kid. \\nELLIE \\nGood. I want someone watching your  \\nback. After last night, you need to  \\nlow. I’ll check in with you guys  \\nlater. \\nMIKE \\nAlways love you checking me out,  \\nLt. \\nEllie hangs up. Mike knows he has no choice but to call Cam. \\nShit. \\nMIKE (CONT’D) \\nINT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - GYMNASIUM - DAY Cam POUNDS a punching bag, then answers his ringing phone.  \\nCAM \\nWhat’s up, Mike? \\nINT. CAMARO - LATER \\nMike and Marcus ride in front, Cam sits in the back. \\nCAM \\n(after a beat of silence) \\nSo, Mike... you gonna tell me where  \\nwe’re going or what? \\nMIKE \\nI’ll tell you when we get there. \\nCAM \\nI know you don’t think so, but I  \\ncan probably contribute to whatever  \\nit is you’re not supposed to be  \\ndoing. (MORE) \\n49.\\nCAM (CONT\\'D) \\n(off Mike’s silence, Cam  \\nleans forward) \\nCome on, I saw your eyes at HQ and  \\nafter your couples therapy session  \\nat the inn, there’s only one reason  \\nyou’d be sharing a car with  \\nBurnett. You’re going after Luga  \\nand you’re worried if Ellie sees me  \\nwithout my partner, she’ll stop  \\nyou. \\nMike won’t admit he’s right. Marcus is impressed. \\nMARCUS \\nGotta say, Mike, your boy’s quick. \\nMIKE \\nHe’s not my boy. He’s a pain in the  \\nass. \\nCAM \\nHey Mike, just because I don’t do  \\nthings exactly the way you do -- \\nMIKE \\nYou don’t know how to do things,  \\nthat’s the problem.  \\nMARCUS \\nYou know, I don’t know what it is,  \\nbut there’s something very familiar  \\nabout this conversation. \\nMIKE \\nDon’t start in, Marcus. \\nMARCUS \\nCam, let me ask you something: has  \\nMike ever canceled SWAT on you  \\nright before you’re about to go in  \\non a bust?  \\nCAM \\nShit, yeah. He did it twice in the  \\nsame month.  \\nMARCUS \\nAlright, what you gotta do next  \\ntime is call ahead and let them  \\nknow -- \\nMIKE \\nWhat are you, his mentor now? \\nMARCUS \\nThat’s right. Professor Marcus X. \\n50.\\nCAM \\nLet me ask you something, Marcus. \\nMARCUS \\nShoot, my brother. \\nCAM \\nWhen you guys were on a stakeout  \\nand you had to have something to  \\neat -- \\nMARCUS \\n(knows exactly where this  \\nis going) \\nAnd he won’t let you have food in  \\nhis car. Man, bullshit to that! \\nCam and Marcus laugh. Mike doesn’t. \\nCAM \\nMan, you’re alright, Marcus.  \\nMARCUS \\nThanks, Cam. I think you’re cool  \\ntoo. \\nMIKE \\nThat definitely means a lot from a  \\ngrown ass man in skinny jeans. \\nBefore Marcus can strike back: \\nCAM \\nYeah, I was gonna ask, what is up  \\nwith those pants anyway? They help  \\nwith posture or...? \\nMARCUS \\nWhat the fuck, you’re starting in  \\non me, too!?! \\nCAM \\nI’m sorry, but Mike does have a  \\npoint. \\nMARCUS \\nI don’t believe this shit. \\nMIKE \\nYeah, it’s tough when you think  \\nsomeone’s got your back and then  \\nthey don’t.  \\nCAM \\nMike, come on, that isn’t fair -- \\n51.\\nMIKE \\nShut up, Cam. \\nMARCUS \\nYeah, shut up, Cam. \\nCam sits back, giving up. \\nCAM \\nMan, you guys deserve each other. \\nEXT. LIBERTY CITY - DAY \\nA violent Miami neighborhood. The Camaro drives through. INT. CAMARO - DAY \\nMIKE \\nOkay. According to Payton in gang  \\nintel, Gojahki’s mother lives  \\nthere. #11.  \\nEXT. LIBERTY CITY STREET - SECONDS LATER \\nThe Camaro stops across the street from the #11 house.  INT. CAMARO - SAME \\nPeering out the window at Viktor’s mom’s house: \\nCAM \\nYou sure this is gonna work? \\nMIKE \\nThese Albanians are nothing if not  \\ntight with their families. Marcus,  \\nyou got any surveillance equipment? \\nMARCUS \\nI’m a PI, Mike. What do you think? \\nEXT. LIBERTY CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER \\nThe trunk pops open. Inside: various audio and visual  surveillance equipment -- along with personal defense  weapons, including a TASER GUN.  \\nMarcus grabs a phone hacking device called a GYPSY WIRE while  Cam picks up a camcorder. Presses play. His jaw drops when --  \\nA VERY SHAKY SEX TAPE \\nbetween Marcus and Theresa plays. \\nTHERESA (ON THE TAPE) \\nCome on, Marcus, forget the camera. \\n52.\\nMARCUS (ON THE TAPE) \\nTrust me baby, we’re gonna love  \\nhaving this when we’re older. \\nHusband and wife go at it as Marcus’s eyes light up. Mike  looks over the screen.  \\nMIKE \\nDude, two words “tri-pod” \\nMARCUS \\nGive it back! \\nCAM \\nI think I see the tri-pod. \\nRed, Marcus grabs the camera from Cam. Shuts it off. \\nMIKE \\nJust say the word and I can give  \\nyou a few pointers. \\nMarcus tosses the camera back into the trunk. Replaces it  with a pair of SPIKED CLIMBING SHOES.  \\nMIKE (CONT’D) \\nWho are you, Paul Bunyon? \\nMARCUS \\nHow else do you think I’m gettin’ \\nup on that pole?  \\nMarcus slips on the shoes: \\nCAM \\nSo you call up the mom, tell her  \\nthat her son’s been shot. She tries  \\ncalling Viktor, but Marcus cuts the  \\nline before the call is placed. \\nMARCUS \\nMom has no choice but to see if  \\nhe’s alive for herself. She gets in  \\nher car -- \\nMIKE \\nAnd takes us right to him.  \\nMarcus rises. Grabs the gypsy wire. Puts his “game face” on. \\nMARCUS \\nOkay. Let’s do this. \\nMarcus shuts the trunk and walks off toward the TELEPHONE  POLE, spikes digging into the pavement with each step.  \\n53.\\nINT. VIKTOR’S MOM’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \\nAn Albanian soap plays on a TV with rabbit ears.  \\nMRS. GOJAHKI adjusts her recliner. She’s old and mean as  fuck. In the window behind her, we can just make out -- \\nEXT. LIBERTY CITY STREET - SAME \\n-- Marcus struggling to climb the telephone pole. INT. CAMARO - SAME \\nSame seats as before: Mike, up front. Cam in the back.  \\nCAM \\nYou really hate having a partner  \\ndon’t you, Mike? \\nMike says nothing. \\nCAM (CONT’D) \\nMarcus, me. If it was up to you,  \\nyou’d just do everything yourself. \\nMIKE \\nOccasionally I need someone to get  \\nme coffee. \\nCAM \\nYou read my jacket before we were  \\npartnered up. You know what I can  \\ndo. What I bring to the game. \\nMIKE \\nYeah. Headache. Problem with you is  \\nyou have no idea what it takes to  \\nbe a real cop. You got no field  \\nexperience. \\nCAM \\nI think the only reason you give me  \\nno respect is because I remind you  \\nof you -- only you’re a step slower  \\nand I’m the up and comer. \\nMIKE \\nPlease, if you reminded me of me,  \\nI’d kick my own ass. Now shut up.  \\nYou may learn something. \\nEXT. LIBERTY CITY STREET - SAME \\nSweat POURING, Marcus reaches the phone box. He pops it open  and connects the gypsy wire, tapping into the mom’s line. \\n54.\\nINT. CAMARO - SAME \\nMIKE \\n... cool. And you’re sure she just  \\nhas the land line, right? No cell  \\nphone.(beat) \\nThanks, Lisa. I owe you one. \\nHe hangs up. Dials a new number. \\nINT. VIKTOR’S MOM’S HOUSE - INTERCUTTING \\nAn old-school ROTARY PHONE rings. Viktor’s mom grimaces and  answers the call. With a THICK EUROPEAN ACCENT: \\nYes. \\nMRS. GOJAHKI MIKE \\nThis is Viktor Gojahki’s mom? \\nWho this? \\nMRS. GOJAHKI MIKE \\nI’m the guy who just shot your son!  \\nHe’s dead. \\nMike hangs up. Cam looks at him, shameful. \\nCAM \\nThis is just mean, man. \\nMIKE \\nMean, but it works. \\nMrs. Gojahki hangs up, concerned. Is it true? She immediately  picks back up the phone. Dials a new number. \\nRESUME MARCUS:  \\nhearing her dial a new number, but before she can get  connected to anyone, he cuts the call.  \\nRESUME MRS GOJAHKI: \\nMRS. GOJAHKI \\n(hearing nothing on the  \\nother end) \\nHello?... Hello? \\nNothing. She hangs up. Thinks. Then steps out of frame. RESUME MARCUS:  \\nclimbing down the wooden pole. Gets a splinter along the way. \\nAhh fuck! \\nMARCUS \\n55.\\n(then another) \\nShit.(and a third for good  \\nmeasure) \\nMother-fucka! \\nHe jumps the last few feet and hits the ground, swallowing a  yell. Then steels himself and gets back in the Camaro. \\nViktor’s mom exits her house, gets into her own car and  drives down off. Marcus follows in pursuit. The plan worked. \\nEXT. MIAMI STREET - MAGIC \\nSun setting, Viktor’s mom’s car passes, followed by Marcus.  EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - VIRGINIA KEY - MAGIC \\nBuilt in 1963, the concrete amphitheatre overlooking a man made basin and the Miami skyline was condemned in 1992. It  stands now, completely painted over in graffiti.  \\nViktor’s mom pulls up to the street to the stadium. RESUME CAMARO: \\nMIKE \\nAlright, she’s slowing down. Viktor \\nmust be hiding out in the stadium.  \\nGet in front of her. We’ll cut her  \\noff. Marcus, get to her door. \\nMarcus hits the gas. Cuts in front of the mom’s car. She  stops short. Mike, Marcus and Cam explode out of the Camaro.  Marcus is the first to reach the mom -- going up to her door. \\nMARCUS \\nMa’am, I need you step -- \\nBut that’s all he gets out. Viktor’s mom puts a STUN GUN to  his hand. Shocks him with 50,000 volts. \\nMarcus CONVULSES. CRASHES. Mike and Cam rush over. Viktor’s  mom BOMBS out of the car, SWINGING her purse in Mike’s face  over and over, kicking the crap out of him. \\nMIKE \\nDo something! \\nCAM \\nI have no field experience,  \\nremember.  \\nMike catches the purse. Engages in a TUG OF WAR with the mom. \\n56.\\nMIKE \\nJesus, she’s got a grip! \\nCam gets an idea. Rushes off. Viktor’s mom starts SPITTING  and CURSING at Mike. \\nVIKTOR’S MOM \\nI kill you! I kill you! \\nMarcus staggers to his feet. Grabs the mom from behind. Tries  to yank her back when --  \\n-- TWO PROBES ATTACHED TO TASER WIRES tag her in the chest.  \\nCam hits the trigger on Marcus’s TASER GUN. She gets SHOCKED  and FALLS BACKWARD onto Marcus -- the two HITTING THE GROUND,  Marcus breaking her fall.  \\nMike and Cam stand over the pair. Marcus winces. \\nMARCUS \\nNext time...you get the door. \\nCAM \\nWhat do we do with her now? \\nMIKE \\nCall in a uniform. Get him to take  \\nher back home. \\nOFF MARCUS -- the 75 year old mother SEIZING on top of him: EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - PARKING AREA - LATER \\nA few feet beside Viktor’s Ford Flex, Mike and Cam get guns.  Ready for war. Mike sees Marcus doing the same. \\nMIKE \\nWhoa, hold up, what are you doing? \\nMARCUS \\nWhat’s it look like? \\nMIKE \\nIt looks like you’re gearing up for  \\npolice business and in case you  \\nforgot, you’re not the police  \\nanymore. \\nMARCUS \\nI wasn’t the police either when my  \\nass was climbing that telephone  \\npoll. \\nMIKE \\nThat was different. \\nWhy? \\nMARCUS MIKE \\n57.\\nBecause I wasn’t gonna do that. \\nMARCUS \\nSo you were just using me. \\nMIKE \\nHey, you were the one who didn’t  \\nwant to be a cop, remember? So  \\nstand back, citizen. \\nCAM \\nHey, Mike, come on, three sets of  \\nguns are better than two. \\nMIKE \\nDepends who’s doing the shooting,  \\nand who asked you? \\nMARCUS \\nI told you: I’m here for Howard.  \\nNot for you. You’re not my boss, my  \\npartner or my friend anymore. I’m  \\ngoing in. \\nMarcus cocks his gun and heads off. Mike can’t help but  respect his loyalty to Howard. Back to Cam: \\nMIKE \\nAnd you: better follow my lead. \\nMike heads off after Marcus. Cam follows.  \\nINT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER \\nAbandoned for decades, the metal seats now come in two  colors: rust and graffiti. Mike, Marcus and Cam move quietly  inside. There’s no sign of Viktor. The stadium looks EMPTY.  But -- \\nNEW ANGLE: VIKTOR AND HIS TWO GUNMEN \\nhiding behind columns a few feet ahead, Glocks ready. When  Mike, Marcus and Cam approach -- they swing around, FIRING. \\nMike, Marcus and Cam take cover behind seats and concrete  pillars, SHOOTING BACK -- GUNFIRE DEAFENING. \\nEXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - PARKING AREA - SAME Two black Suburbans ROAR UP. Doors explode open.  BARDHA AND A TEAM OF SHOOTERS hop out. Rush the stadium. \\n58.\\nRESUME MIKE, MARCUS AND CAM:  \\nstill trading rounds with Viktor and his men when -- GUNSHOTS COME RAINING IN FROM BEHIND THEM!  \\nMike, Marcus and Cam whip around. See Bardha and his shooters  advancing, FIRING.  \\nThe trio return shots in both directions -- but they are OUT MANNED -- caught in a CROSSFIRE between Bardha and his team  and Viktor and his men. \\nMIKE \\nFuck, they’re flanking us! Move  \\nback! \\nMike, Marcus and Cam make a DASH up the aisle, making their  way up to an UPPER LEVEL to escape the gunfire, taking cover  behind a PLASTIC TARP hanging down from the roof. \\nBut the GUNFIRE CONTINUES.  \\nMike quickly re-loads his gun and throws the plastic aside to  see what’s going on below -- and he’s thrown! \\nBardha and his team aren’t pursuing them. They’re ADVANCING  on Viktor and his men. Mike seeing: \\nBardha and his men fire multiple rounds at Viktor and the two  gunman, riddling Gunman #1 -- then tagging Gunman #2. \\nMIKE (CONT’D) \\n(realizing) \\nThey’re not here for us. They’re  \\nhere for them! \\nViktor fires back at Bardha and his team -- then TAKES OFF,  RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE.  \\nMike gives chase -- following Bardha and his men, racing  after Viktor -- who reaches the end of an aisle and -- \\nJUMPS OVER the side of the stadium -- dropping several feet  to the pavement below.  \\nBardha and his team run up and FIRE DOWN on him, but Viktor ESCAPES, rushing UNDERNEATH the lowest level of the stadium. \\nMike comes up behind Bardha and his men. Fires. Hits one, but  he’s wearing KEVLAR.  \\nThe others return shots. Mike ducks down behind seats,  bullets PINGING metal. \\n59.\\nEXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - SECONDS LATER \\nViktor emerges from underneath the stadium and JUMPS into the  Ford Flex. SLAMS the door. He’s about to turn the key when -- \\nBardha and his team run up. Surround the car. Viktor goes to  duck down. Too late.  \\nThe SUV gets COMPLETELY DEMOLISHED WITH BULLETS that RIP  through the car and Viktor’s flesh, killing him.  \\nBardha then turns to the Camaro. Fires a shot into a tire. \\nMike gets outside as Bardha and his team ROAR OFF in their  Suburbans. He goes to run into the Camaro to pursue. Stops  short when he sees the flat front tire. Shit. \\nIN THE DISTANCE: police sirens WAIL and cruisers approach. INT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER \\nViktor’s men lie on the cement, dead. Marcus hovers over  their bodies, looking like he’s about to hurl.  \\nCAM \\nHey... you alright? \\nHolding back barf -- but trying to play it off: \\nMARCUS \\nYeah. You know. Just... acid  \\nreflux. \\nHe gags. Mike comes up. Immediately pats down one of the  bodies, pulling what he can from his pockets. \\nCAM \\nWhat are you doing? \\nMIKE \\nWhat you should be. Taking whatever  \\nevidence we can before the Feds do.  \\nThese guys were our best shot at  \\ngettin’ to Luga. Whatever they  \\ncould tell us, someone made sure we  \\ncouldn’t find out. We need to  \\nfigure out what.  \\nMarcus and Cam soon join in. Go through pockets. Jackets.  Marcus finds a phone, Cam a wallet.  \\nBut then -- Cam sees something else: a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER  sticking out of the sock of Gunman #2. \\nCam pulls it out and unfolds the paper. Written on it: THREE  SETS OF STRANGE SYMBOLS MIXED WITH CYRILLIC LETTERS AND  RANDOM NUMBERS. A COMPLEX CODE. \\n60.\\nRed and blue lights converge on the stadium and we GO TO: EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - NIGHT \\nMike, Marcus and Cam give statements to MIAMI PD. Agent  Kessler soon arrives, backed by THREE FBI AGENTS. \\nAGENT KESSLER \\n(livid) \\nI hate to repeat myself, Lowery.  \\nNow, this is the second time I’ve  \\nhad to warn you not to interfere  \\nwith this investigation. \\nMARCUS \\nSome investigation. We’re the ones  \\nwho found the hotel shooters.  \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nWhat are you doing here anyway?  \\nYou’re a Goddamn civilian. \\nMARCUS \\n(up in his face; pissed) \\n“I’m a Goddamn civilian? I’m a  \\nGoddman civilian.” \\n(beat; realizing; backing  \\noff) \\nYeah, that’s right, I’m a Goddamn \\ncivilian. \\nAGENT KESSLER \\n(to his agents) \\nI want them searched.  \\nMike, Marcus and Cam protest but the FBI agents with Kessler  don’t give a shit, patting them down, finding Marcus’s gun -- \\nMARCUS \\nI got a permit for that. \\n-- and a gunman’s phone in Mike’s pocket. Kessler grabs it. \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nYou got a permit for this? \\nAnother agent finds a wallet in Cam’s pocket. \\nCAM \\nHey, that’s mine. \\nThe agent shows the ID to Kessler.  \\nAGENT KESSLER \\n(reading the Albanian name  \\non the card) \\nEnver Biba? \\n61.\\nCAM \\nIt’s my porno name. I also go by  \\nHung Frankenstein. \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nDetain them. \\nThe Feds quickly slap on cuffs. \\nMIKE \\nWhat the fuck, Kessler!?! \\nMike, Marcus and Cam are pulled over to the FBI sedans. \\nLUTTRELL (O.S.) \\nAgent Kessler! \\nKessler turns. Sees Luttrell walking up.  \\nLUTTRELL (CONT’D) \\nWhat are you doing to my  \\ndetectives? \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nWhat the hell does it look like?  \\nLUTTRELL \\nA Federal agent detaining Miami PD.  \\nYou don’t want the headlines or the  \\nheadache. Trust me. \\nKessler pauses. He definitely doesn’t. \\nLUTTRELL (CONT’D) \\nPut them in my custody. Let  \\nInternal Affairs handle them. \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nLike you’ve handled them so far? \\nLUTTRELL \\nThey won’t be a problem anymore. \\nKessler considers Luttrell. A beat, then warns: \\nAGENT KESSLER \\nThey interfere again, I’m gonna  \\narrest them for willful impeding of  \\na Federal Investigation. That  \\nclear? \\nCrystal. \\nLUTTRELL \\nKessler orders his men to let Mike, Marcus and Cam free. As  soon as the Feds walk away: \\n62.\\nMARCUS \\nThanks, man. \\nLUTTRELL \\nPlease. I love standing up to those  \\nFederal pricks. Mike, I know how  \\nbad you want Luga. I do too. But  \\nyou’re bringing down too much heat. \\nMIKE \\nJust tell me what else Kessler  \\nknows about Luga. \\nLUTTRELL \\n(beat, then:) \\nWhat I’ve managed to piece together  \\nis: the FBI has intercepted a lot  \\nof chatter on Albanian organized e mail communications. References to  \\nsomething called “Forager.” And  \\naccording to their HUMINT sources,  \\nthey believe someone inside the  \\ncountry has brought Luga here as  \\ntalent to pull off some major drug  \\noperation. \\nMARCUS \\nWe gotta get this guy fast, Mike. \\nCAM \\nMaybe this will help. \\nCam reaches down and takes off a shoe.  \\nMARCUS \\nYour socks? \\nCam pulls the paper he took off the gunman out of his shoe.  \\nCAM \\nGot this off one of Viktor’s boys.  \\nStashed it in my shoe in case we  \\nhad to give the other evidence up. \\nMarcus is instantly impressed. Mike is too, but isn’t showing  it. Marcus picks up on this. \\nMARCUS \\nOkay, I’ll say it: “Fuck yeah.” \\nMike takes the paper. Doesn’t know what to make of it.  \\nLUTTRELL \\nMike, a word. \\nMike hands the paper back to Cam and walks off with Luttrell. \\n63.\\nLUTTRELL (CONT’D) \\nThere’s something else. Didn’t want  \\nto say in front of the others. \\nWhat’s up? \\nMIKE \\nLUTTRELL \\nI’ve been looking into who had  \\nknowledge that you guys were hiding  \\nout at the hotel. Only a handful of  \\npeople knew and all of them were  \\ncops. The leak definitely came from  \\ninside Miami PD, maybe even your  \\nunit. Somebody’s gone bad. I’m  \\ngonna find out who, but in the  \\nmeantime, don’t trust anyone.  \\nMike considers that, as we GO TO: \\nEXT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - AN HOUR LATER \\nELLIE (V.O.) \\nI asked you point blank if you were  \\ninvestigating Luga -- \\nINT. MIAMI-DADE P.D.

But  \\nyou should at least respect that I  \\nhave a job to do. \\nMIKE \\nAnd so do I. This asshole’s come  \\nhere to kill me and because of  \\nthat, Captain Howard’s fighting for  \\nhis life. You wanna talk respect?  \\n(MORE) \\n64.\\nMIKE (CONT\\'D) \\nHow ‘bout the respect you owe your  \\ncops instead of the Feds -- or the  \\nrespect I owe Howard to go after  \\nLuga and bring his ass down for  \\nwhat he did? \\n(rising from his seat) \\nAnd I’d do the same if it was you  \\nin the hospital right now instead  \\nof him. \\nEllie looks at Mike. He’s telling the truth but despite her  loyalty to Howard, she can’t let him off the hook. \\nELLIE \\nI would suspend you, but I don’t  \\nthink that would help. So you -- \\n(to Cam) \\n-- get your toothbrush, your  \\npajamas, whatever you need, cause  \\nfrom this moment on, you’re on Mike  \\nwatch. Every move he makes you’re  \\ngonna tell me about it. And if he  \\nscrews up, it’s on you too. \\n(back to Mike) \\nThis is not gonna end with you dead  \\nor in jail. This is for your own  \\ngood.

I wanna  \\nknow what those codes mean. I’m  \\nheadin’ over to Miami General.  \\nSanchez: how are your gang  \\nconnections? Any owe you favors?  \\nSANCHEZ \\nI got a guy who’s in ABK. Runs a  \\nbodega in Miami Gardens.  \\nMIKE \\nReach out to him. Have him slip it  \\nto two or three operators in the  \\nAlbanian community that one of the  \\nhotel shooters survived the hit  \\ntonight and is listed as a John Doe  \\nat the hospital. When word travels  \\nup the chain that one of their  \\ntargets is alive and talkin’ to the  \\ncops, the Albanians are gonna send  \\nsomeone to finish the job. I’ll  \\nhave a heart to heart with him and  \\nfind out where Luga’s hiding his  \\nass. Call me when y’all have  \\nsomething. \\nMike steps back out into the hallway. Cam hurries after him. INT.

I don’t know what he’s  \\ndoin’, but I know it’s not good. If  \\nI can’t find out on my own, you’re  \\ngonna have to get something off  \\nthat list.

MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - ROOM 726 - NIGHT \\nMarcus strips out of his clothes to change into an  unflattering hospital gown -- and he’s NOT happy. \\nMARCUS \\nThis is some next level  \\nembarrassment right here.  \\nMIKE \\nYou’re the one who said you wanted  \\nto be involved. \\nMARCUS \\nWell, thanks for tossin’ me a  \\nfuckin’ bone.

Gone. \\nMIKE \\nWould you just get in bed and quit  \\ncomplaining? \\nMARCUS \\nHey, as long as I’m the one whose  \\nass is literally exposed here, I’m  \\ngonna complain as much as I want.  \\nHe finally gets the gown on and hops into the bed. \\nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) \\nYou all good in here, Mike? \\nMike turns to the door to find an ATTRACTIVE NURSE. \\nMIKE \\nYeah, Dena.

HEADQUARTERS - TNT DIVISION - DAY \\nDaltrey runs the list of codes through a scanner. Pulls the  image up on a wall monitor.  \\nMONTAGE:  \\nOver the next SEVERAL HOURS, Cam tries to break down the code  with a pen, re-arranging letters, words and symbols onto a  piece of paper as: \\nDaltrey types an algorithm into a computer. Hits ENTER.  Immediately all the numbers, letters and symbols start to  move around and change order. Eventually --  \\nDaltrey’s algorithm cracks the first cipher.  \\nDALTREY \\nHoly shit, I got it. \\nCam snaps up, alert. \\nDALTREY (CONT’D) \\nThe code’s based off the Albanian  \\nalphabet. We just need to figure  \\nout which numbers correspond to  \\nwhich letters -- \\nCAM \\nAnd then add them to the letters  \\nthat already exist. \\nExactly. \\nDALTREY \\nDaltrey types more commands into the computer, cross referencing letters in the code with the Albanian alphabet.  \\nCAM \\nHold up. What about the symbols? \\nDALTREY \\nThe symbols are nothing. Garbage.  \\nNoise to keep us from seeing the  \\nreal code. \\n68.\\nCam jots down a few ALBANIAN WORDS as they appear. Then types  into another computer. Translates the Albanian words in the  first coded entry into English. Comes up with: \\nCAM \\nMorrow Airpark. \\nDaltrey does the same routine for the second code.  \\nDALTREY \\nNext code’s an address. 27309  \\nFleming Avenue. \\nDaltrey enters the address into his computer.  \\nDALTREY (CONT’D) \\nIt’s a gas depot.  \\nCAM \\nAnd the last code? \\nDaltrey tries to crack it using the same method as the other  two, but can’t. \\nDALTREY \\n...I don’t know. This cipher’s  \\ndifferent from the other two. It’s  \\nnot based on the same alphabet.  \\nGonna take some time to break. \\nCam checks his watch. Makes a call. \\nCAM \\nOkay.

He had four people\\nkilled alone last night.\\n\\n\\nIf Sionis is such a mastermind, how\\'d he\\nget fired from his own fucking company?\\n\\n\\nThe Janus Corporation\\nis his father\\'s company, thank you.\\n\\n\\nAnd by the way,\\nthey cut him off.\\n\\n\\nWhere does the DA\\'s office\\nstand on all this?\\n\\n\\nTo make matters worse, the assistant DA?\\nThat\\'s her ex.\\n\\n\\nThe evidence that Sionis is\\nlinked to these murders...\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s a shipment coming in.\\n\\n\\n- Drugs?\\n- A diamond.\\n\\n\\nWow, Montoya. Should we call\\nthe Feds for backup?\\n\\n\\nListen,\\nI had a source at the club.\\n\\n\\nHis driver. He said that Roman\\ncouldn\\'t stop talking about this thing.\\n\\n\\nAnd he said that he overheard\\nsomething about laser-encoding.\\n\\n\\nNow, I did some research.\\nI think it\\'s the Bertinelli diamond.\\n\\n\\nYou remember the Bertinelli\\nmassacre, right?\\n\\n\\nQuick history lesson. Fifteen years\\nago, one of the wealthiest\\n\\n\\nMafia families in Gotham\\nwas gunned down.\\n\\n\\nIt was a power grab,\\nbut the real target\\n\\n\\nwas the Bertinellis\\' super-secret\\noffshore bank accounts,\\n\\n\\nthe details of which were said\\nto be encoded in the atomic structure\\n\\n\\nof a 30-carat diamond.\\nThe rock was lost.\\n\\n\\nAnd with it, the only key\\nto the Bertinelli fortune.\\n\\n\\nWhich is exactly why Roman Sionis\\nis trying to get his hands on it.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s what makes him so dangerous.\\nHe\\'s already building an army.\\n\\n\\nIf he gets the diamond, he\\'ll\\nhave all the money and connections\\n\\n\\nto bribe every single judge and cop\\nhe needs to get a monopoly on the city.\\n\\n\\nYou said you had someone on the inside?\\n- Yes. He\\'s...\\n\\n\\n- He\\'s no longer there, but...\\n- So basically, you have nothing.\\n\\n\\nYou are trying to go after\\n\\n\\none of the most litigious and\\nwealthiest families in Gotham,\\n\\n\\nand all you\\'ve got is\\nrumors and a hunch?\\n\\n\\nWell, you know, the DA\\'s office\\nis building a case against him, too.\\n\\n\\n- Isn\\'t that right, Miss Yee?\\n- If the DA is willing to throw himself\\n\\n\\nout in front of this, it\\'s fine with me.\\n- Captain, no.\\n\\n\\nListen, Munroe, find me some tangible\\nconnection to Sionis, all right?\\n\\n\\n-Yes, sir.\\n-Wait, wait, wait. Captain.\\n\\n\\nThis is my case, okay? I\\'ve been\\nworking on this for six months.\\n\\n\\nWe need something that we\\ncan actually use, Detective.\\n\\n\\nAnd, Miss Montoya,\\nwe do have a dress code.\\n\\n\\nLook, I\\'m sorry about\\nthat, but I...\\n\\n\\nThat is my job you are fucking with.\\nWhat is wrong with you, Renee?\\n\\n\\n- Me? He gave my case away.\\n- Oh, poor Renee.\\n\\n\\nWhy don\\'t you pour yourself\\na drink? It\\'s almost noon.\\n\\n\\nWow.\\n\\n\\nJesus. Who the fuck is this?\\nWhat?\\n\\n\\nWhy the fuck haven\\'t you been picking\\nup your phone? We\\'ve got a situation.\\n\\n\\n- What... What situation?\\n- You didn\\'t hear this from me,\\n\\n\\nbut you gotta find her\\nbefore someone else does.\\n\\n\\nShe\\'s got the diamond, and\\ntrust me, Roman will kill her.\\n\\n\\n- My diamond? Who? Who\\'s got it?\\n- This kid.\\n\\n\\nShe\\'s a pickpocket.\\nHer name\\'s Cassandra Cain.\\n\\n\\nHoly fuck.\\n\\n\\n- Can I help you?\\n- Why, yes. Yes, you can.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m here to\\nreport a terrible crime.\\n\\n\\nAnd what terrible crime is that?\\n\\n\\nThis one.\\n\\n\\nHi, boys.\\n\\n\\nMeeting\\'s over.\\n\\n\\nRun, piggy, run.\\n\\n\\nWhere can I find\\nCassandra Cain?\\n\\n\\nHold up, hold up.

DAD WAS A \\nWIZARD! \\nWhat? \\nIAN \\nLAUREL \\nHold on, your Dad was an \\naccountant. I mean, he got \\ninterested in a lot of strange \\nthings when he got sick but-- \\nLaurel and Ian are confused. Ian looks back under the cloth and sees a rolled up piece of parchment. \\nIAN \\nThere’s a letter. \\n(reading) \\n“Dear Ian and Barley: Long ago, the \\nworld was full of wonder! It was \\nadventurous, exciting, and best of \\nall… there was magic. And that \\nmagic helped all in need. But it \\nwasn’t easy to master. And so the \\nworld found a simpler way to get \\nby. Over time, magic faded away, \\nbut I hope there’s a little magic \\nleft… in you. And so I wrote this \\nspell so I could see for myself, \\nwho my boys grew up to be.” \\nIan looks at the second page of the letter. \\nIAN \\nVisitation Spell? \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 26. \\nBarley takes the page from Ian and examines it. It reads VISITATION SPELL and has a diagram of a wizard staff with a beam of light shooting from it, forming a person. \\nBARLEY \\nI don\\'t believe this. \\n(excited) \\nThis spell brings him back. For one \\nwhole day, Dad will be back! \\nWhat? \\nLAUREL IAN \\nBack?! Like back to life? That’s \\nnot possible. \\nBARLEY \\n(holding up staff) \\nIt is with this. \\nIAN \\nI’m gonna meet Dad? \\nLaurel grabs the letter from the boys. She’s beside herself. \\nLAUREL \\nOh, Will, you wonderful nut, what \\nis this?! \\nBarley digs through the cloth. \\nBARLEY \\nNow, a spell this powerful needs an \\nassist element. For this to work \\nDad would’ve had to find a... \\n(finding gem) \\nPhoenix Gem! \\nBarley pulls out an orange gem and exams it. \\nBARLEY \\nWow. There’s only a few of these \\nleft. \\nLAUREL \\nHold on, is this dangerous? \\nBARLEY \\nWe’re about to find out. \\nBarley puts the gem in the staff, holds out the staff, and gets suddenly serious. Everyone waits in suspense. \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 27. \\nAh! \\nWhat?! \\nSplinter. \\nBARLEY LAUREL BARLEY \\nBarley grabs the staff, strikes a pose in the center of the room, and begins to read the spell. \\nBARLEY \\n\"Only once is all we get, grant me \\nthis rebirth. \\'Til tomorrow\\'s sun \\nhas set, one day to walk the \\nearth!” \\nBut nothing happens. \\nBARLEY \\nHold on, I was just gripping it \\nwrong. \\nBarley adjusts his hands. \\nBARLEY \\nOnly once is all we get, grant me \\nthis rebirth, ‘til tomorrow’s sun \\nhas set, one day to walk THE EARTH! \\nStill nothing. \\nIn quick cuts, Barley tries again and again, with no success. \\nBARLEY \\nOnly once is all we get, grant me \\nthis rebirth. \\nHe tries again. \\nBARLEY \\n‘Til tomorrow’s sun has set... \\nAnd again. \\nBARLEY \\n...one day to walk THE EARTH! \\nAnd again, exhausted. \\nBARLEY \\nOne day to walk the earth! \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 28. \\nLosing his patience. \\nBARLEY \\n‘Til tomorrow’s sun has set... \\nAgain, frustrated. \\nBARLEY \\nOne day to walk the earth! \\nWith everything he has left. \\nBARLEY \\n...One day... to walk... the earth! \\nOne more big attempt. \\nBARLEY \\n‘Til tomorrow’s sun has set... \\nLaurel and Ian have already given up. \\nBARLEY \\nOne day to walk the earth! \\nLAUREL \\n(gentle) \\nBarley. \\nHe looks back to her, then puts the staff down and sits on the bed. Laurel puts her hand on Barley’s shoulder. All three of them are heartbroken. \\nLAUREL \\nI\\'m sorry you guys don\\'t have your \\nDad here, but this shows just how \\nmuch he wanted to see you both. So \\nmuch that he’d try anything. That’s \\nstill a pretty special gift. \\nYeah. \\nBarley leaves. \\nIAN \\nLAUREL \\n(to Ian) \\nHey, want to come with me to pick \\nup your cake? \\nIAN \\nThat\\'s okay. Thanks, Mom. \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 29. \\nAs Laurel gets to the door, she looks back at Ian with a sad smile, then leaves. Ian sits on his bed, crestfallen. \\nINT. IAN’S BEDROOM - EVENING \\nIan at his desk, looking at all the pictures of Dad on his bulletin board. He examines Dad’s spell, reading it aloud. \\nIAN \\nOnly once is all we get, grant me \\nthis rebirth... \\nSuddenly, an orange light glows on Ian’s face. He turns to see the Phoenix Gem is glowing. He looks back at the spell. \\nIAN \\n\\'Til tomorrow’s sun has set... \\nThe gem glows brighter. Objects in the room raise from the ground. The staff shakes and starts to fall. \\nAs Ian catches it, the staff lights up. He tightens his grip and reads louder. \\nIAN \\nOne day to walk the earth! \\nA beam of light shoots from the staff. Ian holds on with all his might as objects in the room swirl around him. \\nBarley opens the door. \\nBARLEY \\nHey man, what are you doing in \\nhere?(startled) \\nHoly Tooth of Zadar! How did you--? \\nIAN \\nI don’t know, it just started! \\nBlazey pokes her head in the door but quickly runs away. \\nIan strains to hold the staff. The light from the staff conjures a pair of shoes. \\nBARLEY \\nWhoa, feet! \\nAbove the shoes, bright purple socks appear. Then pant cuffs, pant legs, a belt, a shirt, one button at a time... \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 30. \\nThe gem slowly lifts out of the staff and spins. An ominous red light swells from the gem, overpowering Ian. \\nDad’s body recedes to the waist. Ian braces with all he has. \\nBARLEY \\nHang on, I can help! \\nBarley reaches for the staff. Ian pulls away from Barley. \\nIAN \\nBARLEY, NO! \\nThe red swell explodes. The gem BURSTS into pieces. \\nEXT. LIGHTFOOT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \\nThe window of Ian’s room blasts out. \\nINT. LIGHTFOOT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \\nBarley helps Ian up. Ian looks around, desperate. There’s no sign of dad in the empty, disheveled room. \\nSuddenly there’s a rustling in the closet. The boys perk up. A pair of legs in khaki pants and dress shoes clumsily begin to kick their way out from behind the clothes. \\nDad? \\nIAN \\nThe legs stand to reveal... they have no torso. \\nAH! \\nIAN \\nBARLEY \\nAH! He’s just legs! \\nIan and Barley cautiously approach the living pants as Dad’s feet begin to feel their way around the space. \\nBARLEY \\nThere’s no top part. I definitely \\nremember Dad having a top part! \\nIAN \\nOh, what did I do? This is \\nhorrible! \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 31. \\nThe pants start to make their way toward Ian and Barley. Ian calms himself, then approaches Dad’s pants. He reaches out, waving his hand through Dad’s missing torso. \\nHello? \\nIAN \\nDad begins to feel around with his foot and walk blindly. \\nBARLEY \\nIt’s really him. \\n(beat) \\nDAD! You are in your house! \\nDad bumps into a dresser and falls. The boys race over to help him up. \\nIAN \\nWhoa, whoa! \\nOh boy! \\nBARLEY IAN \\nAh, he can’t hear us. \\nBarley thinks, then walks over and taps on Dad’s foot: Shave and a Haircut. \\nIAN \\nWhat are you doing? \\nDad’s legs suddenly leap back with emotion - as much emotion as legs can have. He stomps the final two beats of the song. \\nDad touches Barley’s feet with his foot, patting gently. \\nBARLEY \\nThat’s right Dad. It’s me, Barley. \\nDad feels around, finds Ian’s foot, and does the same. \\nBARLEY \\nYeah, that’s Ian. \\nHi... Dad. \\nIAN \\nThis lands on Ian, and he puts his hand delicately on Dad’s foot. It’s the closest they can get to a hug. \\nIAN \\nOh... I messed this whole thing up \\nand now he’s gonna be legs forever! \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 32. \\nBARLEY \\nWell, not... forever. The spell \\nonly lasts one day. At sunset \\ntomorrow, he’ll disappear and we’ll \\nnever be able to bring him back \\nagain. \\nBarley points to the spell, illustrations of the sun setting and the man vanishing. \\nIAN \\nOkay, okay, okay. Twenty-Four \\nhours...that doesn\\'t give us much \\ntime, but-- \\nIan looks at his phone, broken in the chaos. He chucks it on his bed and sets his watch. Twenty-four hours counting down. \\nIAN \\nWell, we’ll just have to do the \\nspell again. \\nBARLEY \\nYou mean you have to. \\n(beat) \\nA person can only do magic if they \\nhave the gift. And my little \\nbrother has the magic gift! \\nBarley pulls Ian into a playful headlock. Ian pushes away. \\nIAN \\nBut I couldn’t even finish the \\nspell. \\nBARLEY \\nWell, you\\'re gonna have plenty of \\ntime to practice. Because we have \\nto find another Phoenix Gem. \\nBarley gets an idea. He flips through his Quests of Yore cards then holds one up to Ian. It shows an old pub: THE MANTICORE’S TAVERN. \\nBARLEY \\nAh-ha! We’ll start at the place \\nwhere all quests begin. The \\nManticore’s Tavern! \\nThen another card: THE MANTICORE, a fearsome winged beast. ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 33. \\nBARLEY \\nIt’s run by a fearless adventurer. \\nShe knows where to find any kind of \\ngem, talisman, totem... \\nIAN \\nBarley, this is for a game. \\nBARLEY \\nBased on real life! \\nIAN \\nBut, how do we know this tavern is \\nstill there? \\nBARLEY \\nIt’s there. Look, my years of \\ntraining have prepared me for this \\nvery moment. And I’m telling you... \\nthis is the only way to find a \\nPhoenix Gem. \\nBarley holds up a card featuring THE PHOENIX GEM. \\nTrust me. \\nBARLEY \\nIan looks longingly at Dad. \\nIAN \\nWhatever it takes, I am gonna meet \\nmy dad. \\nBARLEY \\nYou hear that, Dad? We’re going on \\na quest! \\nEXT. BARLEY’S VAN - SUNSET \\nIan slams his door. Barley slams his door. \\nINT. BARLEY’S VAN - CONTINUOUS \\nSeatbelt on, keys in the ignition, the gears grind. \\nBARLEY \\n(straining) \\nCome on, Guinevere... \\nIAN \\nUh... Maybe we should just take the \\nbus. \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 34. \\nBARLEY \\nShe’s fine. \\nThe van starts. Barley grabs a cassette tape labeled “QUEST MIX” and pops it in the stereo. Sweeping fantasy music plays. \\nH’YAH! \\nBARLEY \\nThe van backfires and spits black smoke as it heads away from the cookie cutter suburban homes, toward the fantastical purple mountains in the distance. \\nEXT. SUBURBAN FANTASY TOWN - NIGHT - MONTAGE \\nThe van travels past a road sign: “Leaving New Mushroomton.” The van passes through a TROLL BOOTH. \\nINT. VAN - CONTINUOUS \\nIan sits in the back, talking to Dad’s legs, working on something we can’t quite see. \\nIAN \\nAnyway, it’s like this award for \\nmath, it’s no big deal. But I’ll \\nshow you when we get back home. \\nBarley looks in the rearview mirror. \\nBARLEY \\nHey, what are you two Chatty \\nCharlies up to back there? \\nIAN \\nYou know, I felt weird talking to \\nDad without a top half, so... \\nIan picks something up and puts it on Dad, he steps aside to reveal it’s a top half made out of stuffed clothes. \\n...Ta-da! \\nIAN \\nBARLEY \\nOh! That’s great! Dad, you look \\njust like I remember. \\nDad starts to wander toward the front seat. ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 35. \\nBARLEY \\nHey, don’t worry, we’ll have the \\nrest of you here before you know \\nit. And then, first thing I’m gonna \\ndo: introduce you to Guinevere. \\nRebuilt this old girl myself, from \\nthe lug nuts to the air \\nconditioning. \\nBarley flips on the air conditioning. It BLASTS like a leaf blower. Ian fights against the wind to turn it off. \\nIAN \\nShowing Dad your van? That’s your \\nwhole list? \\nWhat list? Oh... \\nBARLEY IAN \\nBARLEY \\nWhat’s that? \\nIAN \\n(a little embarrassed) \\nI’m just working on a list of \\nthings I wanted to do with Dad. You \\nknow, play catch, take a walk, \\ndriving lesson, share my whole life \\nstory with him. \\nBarley nods, appreciative. \\nBARLEY \\nThat’s cool. \\n(beat) \\nOh, but before you cast Dad’s spell \\nagain, you’re gonna have to \\npractice your magic. \\nBarley tosses Ian the Quests of Yore book. \\nIAN \\nThis book is for a game. \\nBARLEY \\nI told you, everything in Quests of \\nYore is historically accurate! Even \\nthe spells. So start practicing, \\nyoung sorcerer! \\nBarley hands Ian the staff. Ian opens the book. ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 36. \\nIAN \\nOkay, Dad. Let’s try some magic. \\nINT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT \\nLaurel sees a note taped to Ian’s door: “Back soon with MIND BLOWING surprise!” along with a crude drawing of Laurel with a mushroom cloud blowing from the top of her head. \\nShe opens the door. \\nINT. IAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT \\nLaurel GASPS. Ian’s bedroom looks like a bomb went off. \\nShe notices Ian’s broken phone on the bed. Then walks over to the Quests of Yore cards Barley laid out earlier: The Phoenix Gem and the Manticore’s Tavern. \\nINT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT \\nLaurel grabs her car keys off of the hook. \\nEXT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - NIGHT \\nShe pulls out of the garage in her car. \\nINT. LIGHTFOOT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \\nHeadlights shine on a pewter figurine on Barley’s game board: part lion, part bat, part scorpion: THE MANTICORE. \\nEXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT \\nBarley’s van drives through a muddy back road. \\nINT. VAN - NIGHT \\nIan points the staff at an empty soda can. \\nIAN \\nAloft Elevar. \\nNothing happens. \\nIAN \\nAloft Elevar. \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 37. \\nStill nothing. Ian turns to Barley, picks up the Quests of Yore book gestures to a levitation spell in it. \\nIAN \\nI can’t get this levitation spell \\nto work. Maybe I should try \\nsomething else, like... \\n(flipping pages) \\nArcane Lightning? \\nBARLEY \\nPfft, yeah, like a level one mage \\ncould bust out the hardest spell in \\nthe Enchanter’s Guide Book. \\n(nerdy laugh) \\nMaybe we’ll stick with the easy \\nones. \\nIAN \\nYeah, well, it’s not working. Am I \\nsaying it wrong? \\nBARLEY \\nYou said it right, it’s just for \\nany spell to work you have to speak \\nfrom your heart’s fire. \\nMy what? \\nIAN \\nBARLEY \\nYour heart\\'s fire, you must speak \\nwith passion, don’t hold back. \\nIan seems doubtful about this advice. \\nIAN \\n(trying harder) \\nAloft Elevar! \\nNothing. \\nBARLEY \\nNo, like - Aloft Elevar! \\nIAN \\n(angry, louder) \\nAloft Elevar! \\nBARLEY \\nNo, from your heart\\'s fire! \\nIAN \\nALOFT ELEVAR! \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 38. \\nBARLEY \\nDON’T HOLD BACK! \\nIAN \\nALOFT ELEVAR! \\nBARLEY \\nHEART\\'S FIRE! \\nIan tosses the staff in frustration. \\nIAN \\nSTOP SAYING HEARTS FIRE! This just \\nclearly isn’t working! \\nIan sits defeated next to Dad. \\nBARLEY \\nHey, it was a good start. \\nIan stares at the Visitation spell, then looks to Dad, disappointed in himself. \\nBARLEY \\nOh! Gather your courage, we’ve \\narrived. The Manticore’s Tavern. \\nIan looks out the window to see an old tavern, just like the one on the Quests of Yore card. \\nIAN \\nWow, it is still here. \\nBARLEY \\nYeah! I told you. \\nEXT. TAVERN - NIGHT \\nIan and Barley approach the tavern. Ian has to tug on Dad\\'s leash to keep him moving in the right direction. \\nIAN \\nCome on, Dad! That’s good. \\nThey approach the ominous entrance, with a carving of the Manticore’s fearsome face above the door. \\nBARLEY \\nAlright, listen, first: let me do \\nthe talking.(MORE) \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 39. \\nBARLEY (CONT\\'D) \\nSecondly, it’s crucial we show the \\nfearless Manticore the respect she \\ndeserves or she will thirdly, not \\ngive us a map to a Phoenix Gem. \\nIAN \\nWhoa, whoa, wait, the map?! I \\nthought she had a Phoenix Gem? \\nBARLEY \\n(nerd laugh) \\nYou\\'re so cute. \\n(to Dad) \\nHear that, Dad? He’s a smart kid, \\nhe just doesn’t know how quests \\nwork. \\nIAN \\nWell, is there anything else you\\'re \\nforgetting to tell me? \\nNope. \\nBARLEY \\nBarley pushes open the door. \\nINT. MANTICORE’S TAVERN - NIGHT \\nThe place is a ridiculous family restaurant, just full frontal Fuddruckers. A large table of revelers sing along with the waitstaff, around a birthday cake. \\nWAITERS \\n(singing) \\nHappy happy birthday, \\nCome join us on our quest, \\nTo make your birthday party, \\nThe very, very best! HEY! \\nIan looks at Barley, losing faith in his brother. \\nBARLEY \\nOkay, okay, so the tavern changed a \\nlittle over the years, but the \\nManticore is still the real deal. \\nIan and Barley walk through the restaurant, taking it all in. A TAVERN WAITRESS takes an order at a nearby table. \\nTAVERN PATRON \\nI’ll have the soup of the day. \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 40. \\nTAVERN WAITRESS \\nWould m’lord like a Cup or \\nCauldron? \\nAn elf kid plays a claw drop game with a gauntlet hand picking up treasure.

Adorable and silly, it lets out a CHUCKLE and hugs Ian. Barley pushes the Costumed Manticore away from Ian, irritated. \\nBARLEY \\nNo, no, no, no no! The real \\nManticore! The fearless adventurer! \\nThe costumed Manticore rubs its eyes like it’s crying. \\nHOSTESS \\nOh, you mean Corey? She’s over \\nthere. \\nThe hostess gestures toward the kitchen. \\nINT. MANTICORE’S TAVERN - NIGHT \\nThe kitchen doors burst open as a frantic Manticore struggles to balance plates. No longer a fearless adventurer, she wears a restaurant uniform, glasses, and a wrist brace. \\nMANTICORE \\nQUICK, SOMEBODY HELP ME! These \\ngriffin nuggets were supposed to go \\nout minutes ago! \\nWaiters rushes in and she scrambles to offload the plates. \\nIAN \\nThat\\'s the Manticore? \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 41. \\nBarley leaps forward and takes a knee. \\nBARLEY \\nOh, great and powerful Manticore! \\nMANTICORE \\nWhoah, sir!

They’re all based \\non my old maps. \\n(quick, formal) \\nOh, uh, “The great Manticore sends \\nyou on your adventure with a hero’s \\nblessing.” And here’s some crayons. \\nShe hurries off, but Barley follows reverently. \\nBARLEY \\nThat’s very amusing your dominance, \\nbut might you have the real map? \\nThe Manticore points to a wall of swords, shields, scrolls. \\nMANTICORE \\nUh... yeah, it\\'s over there. \\nIan points to a map on the wall with the title: PHOENIX GEM. \\nThat\\'s it! \\nIAN \\nBARLEY \\nThis is perfect! \\nBarley reaches for the scroll, but the Manticore grabs it. \\nMANTICORE \\nWhoa, whoa, whoa! What are you \\ndoing? You can’t take this. \\nBARLEY \\nWe have to. \\nBarley removes Dad’s torso to reveal he’s just legs. The Manticore looks aghast, unsure what she’s seeing. \\nMANTICORE \\nWhat is that? \\nThe Manticore Mascot walks past and sees the legs.

My days of sending people on \\ndangerous quests are over. \\nWhat? Why? \\nBARLEY \\nMANTICORE \\nUh, cause they’re dangerous! \\nThe HOSTESS pops around the corner. \\nHOSTESS \\nCorey, the karaoke machine is \\nbroken again. \\nThe Manticore sees a group of female fantasy creatures in matching shirts surrounding a cyclops in a veil. \\nMANTICORE \\n(to the boys) \\nI’m sorry, but you are not getting \\nthis map. \\nINT.

The engine whines, but nothing happens. \\nIAN \\nCome on, why won’t it start?! \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 70. \\nBARLEY \\nThere’s a sweet spot... not in the \\nmiddle, but not quite at the end! \\nIan wiggles the ignition, leaning into it. \\nIAN \\nComeoncomeoncomeoncomeon! Come. On. \\nGuinevere! \\nThe van sputters to life. \\nBARLEY \\nPut it in “O” for “onward!” \\nIan pulls the screwdriver gear shift down to the handwritten letter “O”. The van lurches forward just as a sprite SMASHES out Ian’s window with a flail. \\nAHH! \\nDRIVE!!! \\nIAN \\nBARLEY \\nIan’s unintentionally cuts off the sprites. Their bikes get tangled up as the van speeds away. \\nEXT. EXPRESSWAY/INT. VAN - NIGHT \\nThe van races up the on-ramp onto the expressway. \\nBARLEY \\nOkay, you’re gonna have to merge! \\nCars ROAR past the van as Ian cautiously picks up speed. A huge truck barrels up beside him. Ian tentatively steers the van closer to the freeway. The truck lays on its horn. \\nSpeed up! \\nBARLEY IAN \\nI can’t do this! \\nBARLEY \\nYes you can! \\nIAN \\nI’m not ready! \\nBARLEY \\nYou’ll never be ready!

Nice job! \\nIn the rearview mirror, Ian sees the motorcycles gaining on them. They pull up on both sides of the van, surrounding him. \\nA biker pulls out a flail and hits the van. Barley leaps up to the window, yelling out at the sprites. \\nBARLEY \\nHey, don’t hit Gwinny! \\nBarley! \\nIAN \\nIan quickly comes up behind a slow moving car. \\nOh, no! \\nIAN \\nBARLEY \\nGet around ’em! \\nIAN \\nThey\\'re not letting me in! \\nSIGNAL! \\nBARLEY IAN \\nYou don’t have a signal-er! \\nBARLEY \\nStick your arm straight out the \\nwindow to signal left! \\nIan holds his arm straight out the window. A sprite immediately wraps a chain around it. \\nAH!! \\nIAN \\nIan turns the wheel one-handed and merges into the next lane. Barley climbs out on Ian’s arm to untangle the chain. \\nIAN \\nGet back here! \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 72. \\nBARLEY \\nJust keep driving! \\nThe sprites cheer as they gain on the van. \\nBarley! \\nIAN \\nBarley successfully untangles the chain. It recoils and almost knocks a number of sprites off their motorcycle. \\nIan looks ahead and sees the freeway splitting EAST and NORTH. Barley crawls back onto Ian’s shoulder. \\nBARLEY \\nThe mountains are north. You need \\nto get all the way over! \\nDad stumbles to the front of the car and face plants into the steering wheel, blaring Guinevere’s horn. \\nEXT.

A group of sprites LEAP from their bike and into the van, attacking Ian. \\nINT. VAN - CONTINUOUS \\nA sprite tackles Barley. Barley pulls the sword from the hand of a nearby bobblehead warrior and brandishes it at the sprite. Ian, covered in sprites, causes the van to swerve. \\nBarley and his sprite are thrown onto the passenger seat. The sprite pins Barley down with the seatbelt buckle. \\nBARLEY \\nIan! Stay focused! \\nI can’t! \\nIAN \\nBARLEY \\nYou HAVE to focus or we\\'re all \\ndead! \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 73. \\nIan sees the NORTH sign out the window rapidly approaching. \\nBARLEY \\nJust stay cool! \\nIan gets an idea. \\nHe frantically reaches and turns on the AC. Strong air blasts from the vents, blowing the sprites out the windows. \\nThe sprite that was fighting Barley is blown into the windshield of the car behind Guinevere. \\nBarley clings to the seatbelt, flapping in the wind. \\nBARLEY \\nWay to go, Guinevere! \\nHe loses his grip and is suddenly blown out the window. But Ian manages to grab him at the last minute. \\nThe sprites rev their bike for another attack. \\nHit it! \\nDEWDROP \\nIan sees his exit ahead, across several lanes. \\nBARLEY \\nWe’re not gonna make it! \\nWith determination, Ian crosses several lanes of traffic, just barely making it onto the NORTH fork of the freeway. \\nThe sprites don’t have time to correct their course. They crash their bike and hurtle toward the ground. But their wings flap until suddenly... they’re flying. \\nHuh. \\nINT. VAN - NIGHT \\nDEWDROP \\nTiny Barley perches on Ian’s shoulder, celebrating their success. Ian pants heavily, still riding the adrenaline. \\nIAN \\nDad, are you okay?! \\nBARLEY \\nHe’s fine, thanks to the skillful \\ndriving of Sir Ian Lightfoot! High \\nFive! \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 74. \\nBarley raises his hand to high five, but it bulges to full size and smacks Ian in the face. \\nIAN \\nOw! What is happening? \\nBARLEY \\nI think the spell is wearing off. \\nBarley’s torso expands to full size on Ian’s shoulder. Ian can’t even see out the window to know where he’s going. \\nIAN \\nGet off my face! \\nBarley’s right leg grows, slamming onto the gas pedal. \\nEXT. ROADWAY - NIGHT \\nThe van lunges forward, swerving past a hidden police car. Its lights come on and it gives chase. \\nINT.

I got it! The disguise spell! \\nYou can disguise yourself to be \\nanyone you want. \\nBarley draws the spell in the dirt. \\nIAN \\nWhat if I mess up again? \\nBARLEY \\nAccording to the spell, “Disguising \\nyourself is a lie, so you must tell \\nthe truth to get by.” As long as \\nyou don’t tell a lie, the spell \\nwill be fine. \\n©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL\\nOnward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 76. \\nIAN \\nOkay... who are we gonna be? \\nThe cops watch a wandering, meandering Dad. \\nOFFICER GORE \\nOkay, we’re taking you down to the \\nstation. \\nThere’s a flash followed by the sound of hooves. The cops turn to see Officer Colt Bronco walk out from behind the van. \\nCOLT \\n(nervous/uncertain) \\nWhat seems to be the problem here \\nfellow... police folk? \\nColt’s back legs walk out of sync, nervous and awkward. \\nOFFICER GORE \\nOfficer Bronco? \\nOFFICER SPECTER \\nWere you in that van? \\nTo the side of Colt we see a new point of view: The boys are masked by a ghost-like shell of Colt, Ian in the front, Barley in the back.

PLAZA, DOWNTOWN KIEV – CONTINUOUS \\nThe van PULLS UP – rear door open – they JUMP INSIDE – \\nINT. VAN – MOMENTS LATER \\nThe Protagonist pulls off his mask. BREATHING. The Passenger  turns – grabs the ‘Target’s face, SOMETHING WRONG... the  Protagonist turns to the Driver – WHO HAS A GUN POINTED AT  HIM ... \\nBLACK SCREEN: \\nSCREAMING. The Protagonist’s screaming. Close on his eyes –  FLICKERING, SWEATING, PLEADING, DEFIANT... and we are – \\n7.\\nEXT. RAIL YARDS – DAY \\nThe Protagonist, tied to a chair, in a windswept rail yard.  In front of him, the ‘Target’, also tied to a chair, back to  us. The Driver steps back, SWEATING. BLOODY PLIERS in hand. \\nDRIVER \\n(breathless) \\nA man can be trained to hold out  \\nfor about eighteen hours. \\nThe Driver gestures at a CLOCK on a table – \\nDRIVER (CONT\\'D) \\nSo your colleagues will clear by 7. \\nThe Driver PUSHES the ‘Target’s chair over. The ‘Target’  lands hard on his side on the gravel. Groaning. \\nDRIVER (CONT\\'D) \\nHe didn’t last eighteen minutes. \\nThe Driver pulls out a KNIFE. Leans in to the Protagonist – \\nDRIVER (CONT\\'D) \\nBut he didn’t have anything to  \\nhide. You were smuggling a nobody. \\nThe knife moves towards the Protagonist’s throat... \\nRisky. \\nDRIVER (CONT\\'D) \\n...then to his collar – which he CUTS – \\nDRIVER (CONT\\'D) \\nOr were you counting on this? \\n...pulling out a SILVER CAPSULE. The Protagonist stares. \\nDRIVER (CONT\\'D) \\nDeath, CIA issue. \\nThe Driver TOSSES the pill, WAVES the pliers at the clock – \\nDRIVER (CONT\\'D) \\nSpare yourself once they’re clear. \\nThe Protagonist looks at the clock – ‘5:38’. A FREIGHT TRAIN  RUMBLES PAST, CLOSE... As we close in on the clock, THE  PROTAGONIST’S SCREAMS ARE DROWNED OUT BY THE FREIGHT TRAIN... \\nThe Driver steps back. The Protagonist breathes heavy, blood  dribbling... the Driver follows his gaze to the clock –  ‘6:53’ – then checks his watch. Frowns theatrically, picks up  the clock, SHAKES it – \\n8.\\nDRIVER (CONT\\'D) \\nRunning fast... \\nThe Driver SETS THE HANDS BACK ONE HOUR. The Protagonist  \\nwatches, DESPAIRING... as the Driver puts the clock back on  the table, the Protagonist notices the ‘Target’s FINGERS  WIGGLING... in them is a SILVER PILL... \\nFreight trains rumble past in opposite directions, sound  BUILDING... The Driver approaches, bloody pliers in hand – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWe were alone. \\nDRIVER \\nI didn’t ask. Which means we’re  \\nfinally getting somewhere. \\nThe Protagonist HURLS himself onto the ‘Target’s hands – face  SMASHING – gets the PILL into his mouth – BITES DOWN –  DEAFENING TRAIN NOISE... \\nArms GRAB at him – HANDS PRY his jaw as he SEIZES, MOUTH  FOAMING... the Protagonist’s EYES GLAZE and we – \\nCUT TO: \\nBlack screen. \\nSupertitle: \\nTENET \\nFADE IN: \\nThe Protagonist opens his eyes. A man stands beside his bed.  SWAYING gently. This is FAY. \\nFAY \\nWelcome to the afterlife. \\nThe Protagonist lifts his head and we are – \\nINT. BOAT AT SEA – DAY \\nThe Protagonist sees the STEELY OCEAN SWELL... \\nFAY \\nYou’ve been in a medically induced  \\ncoma while we got you out of  \\nUkraine and rebuilt your mouth. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThe pills are fake? \\nFAY \\nWe swapped yours for a sedative. \\nWhy? \\nA test. \\nPROTAGONIST FAY \\n9.\\nThe Protagonist runs a finger around his mouth. REALIZING. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nTest? They pulled my teeth out. \\nFay lets that dissipate. The Protagonist closes his eyes. \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) \\nDid the team get clear? \\nFAY \\nNo. Private Russians, we think. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nSomebody talked. \\nFAY \\nNot you. You chose to die instead  \\nof giving up your colleagues. \\nEXT. DECK OF THE BOAT – LATER \\nThe Protagonist stands in the wind, contemplating the  horizon. \\nFAY (O.S.) \\nWe all believe we’d run into the  \\nburning building, but until we feel  \\nthat heat... we can never know. You  \\ndo. \\nI resign. \\nPROTAGONIST FAY \\nYou don’t work for us – you’re  \\ndead. \\nThe Protagonist turns to Fay, confused. \\nFAY (CONT\\'D) \\nYour duty transcends national  \\ninterests. This is about survival. \\nWhose? \\nPROTAGONIST FAY \\nEveryone’s. There’s a cold war.  Cold as ice. To even know its true  nature is to lose.  \\n(MORE) \\n10.\\nFAY (CONT\\'D) \\nThis is knowledge divided – all I  \\nhave for you is a gesture – \\n(interlaces his fingers) \\n– in combination with a word –  \\n‘tenet’. Use it carefully, it’ll  \\nopen the right doors, but some of  \\nthe wrong ones, too. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThat’s all they’ve told you? \\nFAY \\nThe test you passed? \\n(beat) \\nNot everybody does. \\nFay breaks eye contact with the Protagonist. The boat  continues to nose into the swell. \\nEXT. LAUNCH, WIND FARM AT SEA – DUSK \\nThe Protagonist is driven away from the boat on a launch,  towards the GIANT WHITE TURBINES of the ocean wind farm. \\nThe launch SLIPS amongst them, seeking the ladder of a  particular one... \\nThe Protagonist climbs the ladder to a door. He tries it –  it’s open. He turns to see the launch move off into the  gathering dark. The Protagonist ENTERS the wind turbine. \\nINT. WIND TURBINE – CONTINUOUS \\nIn the bare space, the Protagonist finds a SPORTS BAG, a COT,  a pallet of WATER and PROTEIN BARS. He opens the sports bag  to find passports, cash, credit cards and a HI-VIZ VEST. \\nUnder the vest is a small black cylinder. He unscrews the top  to find three SILVER SUICIDE PILLS. The Protagonist shakes  his head as he tosses them back into the bag. \\nINT. WIND TURBINE – LATER \\nThe Protagonist EATS, DRINKS and EXERCISES by CLIMBING the  endless interior ladder of the turbine. The stash of food and  water SHRINKS... \\nThe Protagonist does PULL-UPS at the very top of the ladder,  FEET DANGLING over the VERTIGINOUS DROP... \\nINT. WIND TURBINE – MORNING \\nThe Protagonist is woken by a repeated AIR HORN. He pulls  himself off the cot, opens the door to find – \\n11.\\nEXT. WIND TURBINE – CONTINUOUS \\nA large CATAMARAN nosed up to the windmill, ladder in place,  MAINTENANCE CREW in HI-VIZ VESTS moving on and off the  turbine. Other boats service other turbines. The Protagonist  pulls on his VEST and CLIMBS down onto the catamaran. \\nEXT. EUROPEAN PORT – DAY \\nThe Protagonist disembarks with the rest of the wind-farm  crew. As they file past a car the driver, also in hi-viz,  steps out into line, leaving the door open, engine running.  The Protagonist gets in. The GPS is already set... \\nEXT. OFFICE COMPLEX – LATER \\nA bland suburban office park. The Protagonist gets out of the  car, wearing his hi-viz and carrying a clipboard. Heads  inside, passing numerous STAFF coming out... \\nINT. LOBBY, OFFICE COMPLEX – CONTINUOUS \\nThe Protagonist moves through the lobby unimpeded. Checking  the tenant listings he sees – ‘WINDFARM TRANSITIONS – B-2’. \\nINT. CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS \\nThe Protagonist walks up to B-2. \\nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) \\nWith a hi-viz vest and a clipboard,  \\nyou can get almost anywhere.  \\nAlmost. \\nThe Protagonist turns to find a brusque young woman. This is  BARBARA. He joins his hands, interlacing the fingers... \\nPROTAGONIST \\nA pretty obscure tenet. \\nUsing a key card, she ushers him through a door into – \\nINT. OFFICE, LABORATORY – CONTINUOUS \\nBarbara hands the Protagonist a cup of tea. \\nBARBARA \\nNo small talk, nothing that might  \\nreveal who we are, or what we do. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI thought I was here to find out  \\nwhat we do. \\n12.\\nBARBARA \\nYou’re not here for ‘what’, you’re  \\nhere for ‘how’. ‘What’ is your  \\ndepartment. And not my business. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWell, to do what I do, I need some  \\nidea of the threat we face. \\nBarbara considers the Protagonist. Sips her tea. \\nBARBARA \\nAs I understand it, we’re trying to  \\nprevent World War Three. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nNuclear holocaust? \\nBARBARA \\nNo. Something worse. \\nINT. SHOOTING RANGE – MOMENTS LATER \\nBarbara hands the Protagonist a semi-automatic. He  reflexively checks the chamber and magazine – EMPTY. \\nBARBARA \\nAim it and pull the trigger. \\nThe Protagonist SHRUGS, lifts the empty pistol, sights a  target 25m away with several holes in it... \\nHe squeezes the trigger – BAM! – a shot. He is CONFUSED... \\nBARBARA (CONT\\'D) \\nCheck the magazine. \\nThe Protagonist checks the clip – THERE IS A ROUND IN IT. \\nHow? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nBarbara pulls on PROTECTIVE GLOVES and removes the round from  the clip, placing it next to an identical one on a table. \\nBARBARA \\nOne of these bullets is, like us,  \\ntravelling forwards through time.  \\nThe other one’s going backwards.  \\nCan you tell which is which? \\nThe Protagonist shakes his head. Barbara reaches forward – \\nBARBARA (CONT\\'D) \\nHow about now? – \\n13.\\nOne of the rounds FLIES UP INTO HER HAND, FALLING IN REVERSE.  The Protagonist is taken aback. Barbara holds the round  towards him so he can inspect it – \\nBARBARA (CONT\\'D) \\nIt’s inverted – its entropy runs  \\nbackwards. So, to our eyes, its  \\nmovement is reversed. We think it’s  \\na type of inverse radiation,  \\ntriggered by nuclear fission. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou didn’t make it? \\nBARBARA \\nWe don’t know how. Yet. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nSo where’d it come from? \\nBARBARA \\nSomeone’s manufacturing them in the  \\nfuture. They’re streaming back at \\nus. \\nBarbara places the round on the table, in front of a CAMERA. \\nTry it. \\nBARBARA (CONT\\'D) \\nHe puts on a glove – moves his hand over it, nothing. \\nBARBARA (CONT\\'D) \\nYou have to have dropped it. \\nThe Protagonist reaches out again – it LEAPS UP INTO HIS  HAND. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nHow can it move before I touch it? \\nShe cues up the recording of what he just did – \\nBARBARA \\nFrom your point of view you caught  \\nit, but from the bullet’s point of \\nview... \\nShe plays it BACKWARDS – \\nBARBARA (CONT\\'D) \\n...you dropped it. \\nON THE SCREEN: the round FALLS from his hand. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nBut cause has to come before  \\neffect. \\n14.\\nBARBARA \\nNo. That’s just how we see time. \\nShe PULLS the round towards herself using one finger – the  round follows her finger as if MAGNETIZED... \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhat about free will? \\nBARBARA \\nThat bullet wouldn’t have moved if  \\nyou hadn’t put your hand there. \\nEither way we run the tape, you  \\nmade it happen. \\nShe LAUNCHES it up into her other hand – \\nBARBARA (CONT\\'D) \\nDon’t try to understand it. Feel  \\nit. \\nBarbara PLAYS with the round in increasingly IMPROBABLE,  BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENTS... The round SHOOTS AWAY FROM HER – the  Protagonist CATCHES IT... \\nPROTAGONIST \\nInstinct. Got it. \\nBarbara smiles, swaps him the round for the pistol. She then  places a TRAY COVERED IN SHELL CASINGS beside him.  \\nThe Protagonist aims at the target – a shell casing LEAPS  into the gun – he FIRES, and a bullet hole near the bullseye VANISHES – \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) \\nWhy does it feel so strange? \\nBARBARA \\nYou’re not shooting the bullet,  \\nyou’re catching it. \\nWhoa. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThe Protagonist examines the target – no bullet holes. \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) \\nI’ve seen this type of ammunition  \\nbefore. \\nBARBARA \\nIn the field? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI was almost hit. \\n15.\\nBARBARA \\nThen you are exceedingly lucky... \\nThe Protagonist turns to her... \\nBARBARA (CONT\\'D) \\nAn inverted bullet passing through  \\nyour body would be devastating. The \\ninverse radiation would spread  \\nthrough your body. Like polonium \\npoisoning. Not pretty. \\nThe Protagonist examines the rounds... \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThese look like today’s. \\nBARBARA \\nThey may have been made today, then  \\ninverted years from now. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhere did you get them? \\nBARBARA \\nThey came with the wall. I was  \\nassigned it, like all the material  \\nI’m studying here. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nDo you have an analysis of the  \\nmetals? \\nSure. Why? \\nBARBARA \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThe mixture of alloys can tell me  \\nwhere they might have been made. \\nLook, I know you said that ‘what’  \\nis my business – \\nBARBARA \\nLet’s not go off-topic. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’m not seeing Armageddon here. \\nBarbara takes the round from him, and beckons him to follow – \\nINT. ARCHIVE – CONTINUOUS \\nBetween tall sets of DRAWERS... \\n16.\\nBARBARA \\nA bullet may not seem like much,  \\nbut it’s a simple machine – lead  \\nbullet, brass casing, gunpowder. If  \\nthey can invert this – I see no  \\nreason they couldn’t invert pretty  \\nmuch anything. Even a nuclear  \\nweapon can only affect our future.  \\nAn inverted weapon might be able to  \\naffect our past as well. \\nBarbara stops at a drawer. Gestures around herself – \\nBARBARA (CONT\\'D) \\nNow that we know what to look for,  \\nwe’re finding more and more  \\ninverted material... \\nShe opens a drawer, revealing a VARIETY OF RUSTED BITS AND  PIECES – SCREWS, CRACKED LENSES, METAL RODS, BUTTONS... \\nBARBARA (CONT\\'D) \\n...remnants of complex objects. \\nThe Protagonist reaches out and lets a RUSTED BUCKLE leap  into his hand. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nSo what do you think we’re seeing? \\nBARBARA \\nThe detritus of a coming war. \\nThe Protagonist looks around at the MULTITUDE of DRAWERS. \\nEXT. CROWDED STREET, MUMBAI – DAY \\nThe Protagonist walks out of an electronics store, opening a  new phone, and slips into the throng. He dials – \\nMALE VOICE \\nYup? \\n(over phone) \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWe live in a twilight world. \\nMALE VOICE \\n(over phone) \\nNo friends at dusk. I was told  you’d left the building. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nEven the dead need allies. \\n17.\\nMALE VOICE \\n(over phone) \\nSpecifically? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAn assist in Mumbai. To get to  \\nSanjay Singh. \\nMALE VOICE \\n(over phone) \\nSingh? He never leaves his house,  \\nand his house... well, it’s – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nYes, it is – I’m looking right at  \\nit. \\nAbove the bustling street, a HIGH-RISE HOUSE, at least twenty  storeys tall, with two large balconies, towers over... \\nMALE VOICE \\n(over phone) \\nI’ll see who’s on deck. Bombay  \\nYacht Club, two hours. \\nAs the Protagonist hangs up, he spots a figure, on the top  balcony. A WOMAN IN A SARI, standing high above the city. \\nINT. BOMBAY YACHT CLUB – EVENING \\nThe Protagonist enters the quiet ex-colonial establishment.  Takes a seat. A BUSINESSMAN sits down next to him. \\nBUSINESSMAN \\nIt seems you need an introduction  \\nto a prominent Mumbai local on  \\nshort notice. I’m Neil. \\nNeil offers his hand. The Protagonist takes it – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI need an audience with Sanjay  \\nSingh. \\nNEIL \\nNot possible. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nTen minutes, tops. \\nNEIL \\nTime isn’t the problem. Getting out  \\nalive’s the problem. \\n(thinks) \\nWould you take a child hostage? \\nThe Protagonist shakes his head. \\nA woman? \\nNEIL (CONT\\'D) PROTAGONIST \\n18.\\nIf I had to. I’m not looking to  \\nmake much noise here. \\nNeil keeps thinking. Signals a waiter – \\nNEIL \\nVodka tonic. \\n(gestures at the  \\nProtagonist) \\nDiet Coke. \\nThe Protagonist stares at Neil. Neil looks up, confused. \\nNEIL (CONT\\'D) \\nWhat? You never drink on the job. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou’re well informed. \\nNEIL \\nIt pays to be in our profession. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWell, I prefer club soda. \\nNEIL \\n(grins) \\nNo, you don’t. \\nNeil raps his knuckles on the table, thinking. \\nNEIL (CONT\\'D) \\nHow’s your parachuting? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nBroke an ankle in basic training.  \\nSingh’s house isn’t tall enough to \\nparachute off of. \\nNEIL \\n(thinks) \\nBut it’s bungee-jumpable. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI don’t think ‘bungee-jumpable’ is  \\na word. \\nNEIL \\nIt may not be a word, but it may be  \\nyour only way out of that place. \\n(a thought occurs) \\nOr into it, for that matter. \\n19.\\nEXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – EVENING \\nARMED GUARDS patrol the balconies. \\nINT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS \\nInside one of the magnificent rooms, a middle-aged Indian man  mixes drinks. This is SANJAY SINGH. \\nEXT. LOW ROOFTOP NEXT DOOR TO HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS \\nNeil and the Protagonist race across the roof carrying a  sports bag. Neil pulls out a WINCH, the Protagonist pulls out  a large CATAPULT, loops it around two pipes, glancing down  into the WALLED YARD at the foot of the high-rise house.  \\nNeil BOLTS the winch to the roof, the Protagonist sights the  upper balcony of the high-rise house, FIRES a ball with a  line up and over the balcony railing... \\nEXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS \\nThe Protagonist and Neil lie next to each other as the WINCH  RUNS, TENSIONING THEIR ELASTIC LINES... they LAUNCH  themselves, FLYING UP to land against the side of the  building –  \\nThey RUN SILENTLY UP THE BUILDING, onto the UPPER TERRACES,  SHOOTING TWO GUARDS with silenced pistols... \\nINT./EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS \\nSanjay Singh hands a drink to the Woman in the sari. They  move out onto the balcony – \\nEXT. BALCONY – CONTINUOUS \\nThe Protagonist surprises Sanjay, holds him at gunpoint – \\nPROTAGONIST \\n(to the Woman) \\nStay back. \\n(to Sanjay) \\nI was almost taken out by a very  \\nunusual type of ammunition in  \\nUkraine. I want to know who  \\nsupplied it. \\nSANJAY \\nMy name’s Sanjay. And you are? \\n(silence) \\nNo chit-chat? \\n20.\\nThe Woman pushes a RED BUTTON on the wall – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThere’s no one at the other end. No  \\none who’s going to help you,  \\nanyway. \\nINT. SECURITY STATION, HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS \\nAn alarm buzzes, the Security Guards are frozen, Neil has a  gun on them, a finger to his lips... \\nEXT. BALCONY, HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS \\nSanjay tries to turn to see the Protagonist – \\nSANJAY \\nWhy would I know who supplied it? \\nThe Protagonist pushes his head back around with the gun – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThe combination of metals is unique  \\nto India. If it’s from India, it’s  \\nfrom you. \\nSANJAY \\nA fair assumption – \\nDeduction. \\nPROTAGONIST SANJAY \\nDeduction, then. Look, my friend,  \\nguns are never conducive to a  \\nproductive negotiation. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’m not the man they send to  \\nnegotiate... \\nHe COCKS his weapon – puts the gun to Sanjay’s head – \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) \\nBut I am the man people talk to. \\nSANJAY \\n(charm curdles) \\nI can’t. I can’t tell you. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou’re an arms dealer, friend –  \\nthis may be the easiest trigger  \\nI’ve ever had to pull. \\n21.\\nWOMAN (O.S.) \\nTo say anything about a client  \\nwould violate the tenets he lives  \\nby... \\nThe Protagonist GLANCES at the Woman... whose fingers are  casually INTERTWINED. The Protagonist brings his free hand up  to hold the gun in both hands, fingers INTERLACED... \\nPROTAGONIST \\nIf tenets are important to you,  \\nthen you can tell me. Everything. \\nWOMAN \\nNot while you have a gun to my  \\nhusband’s head. \\nThe Protagonist releases him. \\nWOMAN (CONT\\'D) \\nSanjay, make us a drink. \\nINT. TERRACE OVERLOOKING MUMBAI, SANJAY’S HOUSE – LATER \\nOverlooking the extraordinary bustle of the city. Sanjay has  left. His wife hands the Protagonist his drink – \\nPRIYA \\nI’m Priya Singh. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThis is your operation? \\nPRIYA \\nA masculine front in a man’s world  \\nhas its uses. The dealer you’re \\nlooking for is Andrei Sator. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThe Russian oligarch? \\nPRIYA \\nYou know him? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nNot personally. Made his billions  \\nin gas, moved to London and married \\nan English girl. Said to be on the  \\nouts with Moscow. \\nPRIYA \\nVery good. Except the ‘gas’ he made  \\nhis billions from was actually \\nplutonium, and he’s said to be on  \\nthe outs so he can feed British  \\nIntelligence whatever the Russians  \\nwant them to think they know. \\n22.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nNone of which explains how or why  \\nyou sold him inverted munitions. \\nPRIYA \\nWhen I sold him the rounds, they  \\nwere perfectly ordinary. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nSo how did he get them inverted? \\nPRIYA \\nWe believe he’s functioning as some  \\nkind of broker between our time and  \\nthe future. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nHe can communicate with the future? \\nPRIYA \\nWe all do. Credit cards, email,  \\ntext – anything that goes into the  \\nrecord speaks directly to the  \\nfuture. The question is – can the  \\nfuture speak back? And, if so, what  \\nare they saying? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAnd I’m supposed to find out? \\nPRIYA \\nTo get anywhere near Sator would  \\ntake a fresh-faced protagonist... \\nShe reaches up to touch his cheek. \\nPRIYA (CONT\\'D) \\nFresh as a daisy. Get close, find  \\nout what he’s receiving and how. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nIs it safe to involve British  \\nIntelligence? \\nPRIYA \\nI have a contact who’s out of  \\nSator’s reach. \\nOne of us? \\nPROTAGONIST PRIYA \\nNo, he thinks we’re chasing  \\nplutonium. \\nSIRENS. BANGS! Priya looks over to see POLICE CARS arriving  far below, in the WALLED YARD at the foot of her house... \\n23.\\nPRIYA (CONT\\'D) \\nYou’d better get out of here. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nCan’t you explain things? \\nPRIYA \\nYou have to start looking at the  \\nworld in a new way – this conflict  \\nruns backwards and forwards  \\nsimultaneously. Your name on a  \\npolice report reveals your identity  \\nto the future – they pass it back  \\nto Sator – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nMy cover’s blown before I get near  \\nhim. \\nPRIYA \\nYou got in – you must’ve had a plan  \\nfor getting out.  \\nThe Protagonist pulls a CLIP and cord from his harness – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nNot one I loved. \\nPriya watches him clip onto the balcony rail. Neil FLIES  PAST, dropping from the balcony above.  \\nThe Protagonist JUMPS, SLOWING as he DROPS BEHIND THE WALL,  OUT OF REACH OF THE POLICE, into a MARKET STREET and RELEASES  his harness – disappearing into the crowd... \\nEXT. MEMBER’S CLUB, LONDON – DAY \\nThe Protagonist walks down the busy Mall, and up the steps... \\nINT. MEMBER’S CLUB, LONDON – DAY \\nThe Protagonist enters, is approached by a STEWARD. \\nSTEWARD \\nCan I help you, sir? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’m Mr Crosby’s lunch. \\nSTEWARD \\nI presume you mean Sir Michael  \\nCrosby’s lunch? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nPresume away. \\n24.\\nSTEWARD \\nIf you’ll follow me. \\nINT. LOUNGE, MEMBER’S CLUB – CONTINUOUS \\nThe Protagonist is shown to a table where a distinguished  middle-aged man is already eating. CROSBY. \\nCROSBY \\nStarted without you, hope you don’t  \\nmind. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’ll catch up. \\n(to the Steward) \\nSame for me. \\nSTEWARD \\nI’ll send the waiter. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nNo, just pass on the order. \\nCrosby smiles at the Protagonist’s handling of the Steward. \\nCROSBY \\nI gather you’ve an interest in a  \\ncertain Russian national. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAnglo-Russian. So I’ll have to  \\nwatch my step. \\nCROSBY \\nIndeed. He’s tapped into the  \\nintelligence services – I’ve warned  \\nthem he’s feeding them rubbish, but  \\nthey don’t seem to care. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nTell me about him. \\nCROSBY \\nI assume you’re familiar with the  \\nSoviet-era secret cities? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nClosed cities, not shown on maps,  \\nbuilt up around sensitive  \\nindustries. Most of them have been  \\nopened up and renamed as regular  \\ntowns. \\nCROSBY \\nNot the one Sator grew up in.  \\nStalsk-12. (MORE) \\n25.\\nCROSBY (CONT\\'D) \\nIn the seventies our people  \\nestimated its population at almost  \\n200,000. Unacknowledged to this  \\nday. Thought to be abandoned. \\nAbandoned? \\nPROTAGONIST CROSBY \\nSome kind of accident. After which  we think it became a site for underground tests. Just two weeks  ago, same day as the Kiev Opera  siege, our satellites detected a  detonation in north-west Siberia,  about where we think Stalsk-12 was. \\nNuclear? \\nPROTAGONIST CROSBY \\nBig enough to be noticed. Sator  emerged from this blank spot on the  map with an ambition that  \\neventually led him here, to buy his  way into the British establishment. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThrough his wife? \\nCROSBY \\nKatherine Barton, eldest niece of  Sir Frederick Barton. She works at Shipley’s, met Sator at an auction. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nHe’s into art? \\nCROSBY \\nLike a lot of wealthy criminals, he  thinks if he covers his walls with tasteful, expensive things it’ll  distract from the bloodshed.  Judging by the lovely girl he  married, there might be something  in it. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nHappy marriage? \\nCROSBY \\nNo. Practically estranged. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nHow do I get to Sator? \\nCROSBY \\nThrough her, of course. \\n26.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou may have an inflated idea of my  \\npowers of seduction. \\nCROSBY \\nHardly. We have an ace in the  \\nhole... \\nCrosby slides a SHOPPING BAG over to the Protagonist’s feet.  The Protagonist looks inside: a small FRAMED DRAWING. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou’re carrying a Goya in a Harrods \\nbag? \\nCROSBY \\nIt’s a fake, by a Spaniard named  \\nArepo. One of two we confiscated  \\nfrom an embezzler in Bern. We hung  \\non to this one for a rainy day – I  \\nfelt the first drops when India  \\ncalled. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhat happened to the other one? \\nCROSBY \\nA Rubens. It turned up at  \\nShipley’s, where it was  \\nauthenticated by Katherine Barton  \\nbefore going under the hammer. And  \\nwho do you suppose bought it? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nHer husband? Does she know it’s a  \\nforgery? \\nCROSBY \\nHard to say. Rumour had it that she  \\nand Arepo were close. \\nCrosby looks the Protagonist over – \\nCROSBY (CONT\\'D) \\nLook, no offence, but this is a  \\nworld where someone claiming to be  \\na billionaire gets asked if they’re  \\njust a dollar billionaire. \\nAnd? \\nPROTAGONIST CROSBY \\nBrooks Brothers won’t cut it. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’m assuming I have a budget. \\n27.\\nCROSBY \\n(tosses him a credit  \\ncard) \\nSave the world, then we’ll balance  \\nthe books. Can I recommend a  \\ntailor? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’ll manage. You British don’t have  \\na monopoly on snobbery, you know. \\nCROSBY \\nNot a monopoly. More of a  \\ncontrolling interest. \\nThe Protagonist rises, taking the credit card and the bag. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThanks for this. By the way, is she  \\na Kate or a Kathy? \\nCROSBY \\nA Kat, I believe. \\nThe waiter arrives, bearing food, supervised by the Steward. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nCould you box that for me? \\nSTEWARD \\nCertainly not. \\nThe Protagonist smiles at Crosby, who nods goodbye. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nGoodbye, Sir Michael. \\nEXT.

SCHOOLKIDS pile out of the school... \\nINT./EXT. CAR – CONTINUOUS \\nThe Protagonist watches from across the road as the Young  Woman SPOTS her son. She offers him her hand, but he reaches  up to take his NANNY’S. She moves her hand to pick something  off his jumper before he is put into the back of a BLACK  RANGE ROVER with tinted windows.  \\nThe Protagonist watches the Young Woman wave at the departing  car carrying her child. Utterly alone. \\n28.\\nEXT. SHIPLEY’S, LONDON – DAY \\nA BENTLEY pulls up – a DOORMAN opens the rear door, the  Protagonist emerges, IMMACULATELY TAILORED, holding a  beautiful leather briefcase. \\nINT. SHIPLEY’S – CONTINUOUS \\nThe Protagonist is approached by a REPRESENTATIVE – \\nREPRESENTATIVE \\nHow can I help, sir? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI have an appraisal with Ms Barton. \\nREPRESENTATIVE \\n(to receptionist) \\nTell Kat her client is in the  \\nFallow Room. \\nINT. APPRAISAL ROOM – MOMENTS LATER \\nThe Protagonist admires the paintings on the walls. The door  opens and the Young Woman from the school gates comes in,  dressed for business. This is KAT BARTON. She looks bemused,  but gives him a genuine and friendly smile – \\nKAT \\nI’m sorry, I wasn’t notified of any  \\nappointments, Mr... \\nGoya? \\nMr Goya? \\nPROTAGONIST KAT \\nThe Protagonist opens his briefcase... \\nPROTAGONIST \\nNo, I’m told you’re the person to  see about... \\nOffers the drawing to her... \\n...Goya. \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) \\nShe takes it, suddenly interested... \\nKAT \\nWow. It’s extraordinary. \\nShe lays the drawing on the table and grabs a loupe – \\n29.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhat’s it worth? \\nKAT \\nLet’s not get ahead of ourselves.  \\nThere’s a lot of work before any  \\nkind of valuation – provenance,  \\nmicroscopic examination, X-rays... \\nShe is bent over the table, peering through the loupe.  The Protagonist studies her reaction as he – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nBut what does your heart tell you? \\nShe steps back. Something about the drawing BOTHERS her... \\nKAT \\nI’m sorry, where did you say you  \\nacquired this drawing? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nTomas Arepo. \\nKat rises and turns to face the Protagonist. Cold. \\nKAT \\nWhat do you want? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhat I want is complicated. \\nKAT \\nDo you work for my husband? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’ve never met your husband. That’s  \\nthe reason I’m here. Is there  \\nsomewhere we can talk? \\nKAT \\nIn London? Not really. \\nINT. RESTAURANT – NIGHT \\nThe Protagonist and Kat sit at a corner table. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI bought my Goya for cents on the  \\ndollar from an irate Swiss banker. \\nTraced it to Arepo, and realized  \\nI’d scored a bargain when he told  \\nme who’d paid top dollar for  \\nanother one of his pictures. Your  \\nhusband. \\n30.\\nKAT \\nWhere’s the bargain? Your drawing’s  \\nan obvious fake. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nMy drawing’s a very good fake – you  \\nknow that better than anyone. The  \\ninformation’s the bargain. \\nKAT \\nThe information that I helped  \\ndefraud my own husband? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nHe and I are in related businesses,  \\nbut he’s a hard man to meet. If you \\nand I were to make an arrangement – \\nKAT \\nArrangement? You mean blackmail.  \\nDon’t be afraid of the word – my  \\nhusband isn’t. And I’m sorry to  \\ntell you he got there first. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nHe knows? And he’s never done  \\nanything about it? \\nKAT \\nWhy would he? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nHe paid nine million dollars – \\nKAT \\nWhich would barely cover the  \\nholiday he just forced us on. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhere’d you go – Mars? \\nKAT \\nViet Nam. On our yacht. His yacht. \\nKat looks the Protagonist up and down... \\nKAT (CONT\\'D) \\nYou’ve got the suit. The shoes, the  \\nwatch. But I think you’re a little  \\nout of your depth. \\nPROTAGONIST \\n(sharp) \\nPeople who’ve amassed fortunes like  \\nyour husband’s aren’t generally \\nokay with being cheated out of any  \\nof it. \\n31.\\nKat sips her wine. Wanting to talk. Knowing she shouldn’t. \\nKAT \\nThe drawing is his hold over me. He  \\nthreatened me with the police,  \\nprison, the works. He controls me,  \\nmy contact with my son, everything.  \\nLeaving him would never have been  \\neasy, now it’s impossible. My life,  \\nnow... You can’t fight. Just beg.  \\nOr worse. In Viet Nam I tried to  \\nlove him again. If there were still  \\nlove, he might give me my son. We  \\nsat on that bloody boat and watched  \\nthe sunsets, imitating an earlier  \\ntime. He seemed happy, so I asked.  \\nAnd he made me an offer. To let me  \\ngo if I agreed to never see my son  \\nagain. I expressed myself – \\nINSERT CUT: a CRYSTAL BOWL of RASPBERRIES SMASHES onto the  polished wood of a yacht’s deck – \\nKAT (CONT\\'D) \\nThen took Max ashore. He called us,  \\ncontrite. But when we came back... \\nINSERT CUT: Kat and Max on a launch – Kat follows Max’s gaze  to see a FEMALE FIGURE SLIDE into the water... \\nKAT (CONT\\'D) \\nI glimpsed some other woman diving  \\noff the boat. And he’d vanished. \\nI’ve never felt such envy. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou don’t seem the jealous type. \\nKAT \\nOf her. You know how I dream of  \\njust diving off that boat? Of  \\nfreedom? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nBut you share a son. \\nKAT \\nAnd that’s my life. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nDid you know the drawing was a  \\nfake? \\nKAT \\nThe authentication took months –  \\nArepo and I became close, maybe too \\nclose. Maybe my judgement was  \\nclouded. I failed.  \\n(MORE) \\n32.\\nKAT (CONT\\'D) \\nBut Andrei can’t conceive of  \\nfailure, only betrayal. I didn’t  \\nbetray my husband. In retrospect,  \\nmaybe I missed my chance. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAnd he let Arepo walk free? \\nKAT \\nIf you’d actually met Arepo, as you  \\nclaimed, you’d understand that he  \\nno longer walks anywhere. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWe spoke on the phone – \\nKAT \\nHe can’t do that, either. \\nThe Protagonist considers this. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhere’s the drawing? \\nWhy? \\nKAT \\nPROTAGONIST \\nGet me the introduction, I’ll take  \\nthe drawing out of the equation. No  \\npicture, no prosecution. No hold  \\nover you. \\nKat looks at the Protagonist. Not daring to hope. \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) \\nI might just be your second chance  \\n– \\nKAT \\n(snaps) \\nI don’t need redemption. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAt betrayal. \\nA LARGE, WELL-DRESSED THUG sits down at the table. He takes a  green bean from the Protagonist’s plate and chews it  vacantly. This is VOLKOV. The Protagonist looks at Kat – \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) \\nFriend of your husband? \\n(she nods) \\nYou knew this would happen? \\n33.\\nKAT \\nThey won’t kill you. Andrei \\ndislikes tangling with local law  \\nenforcement on that level. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou must really not have liked the  \\nlook of me. \\nKAT \\n(rising) \\nThe look of you is fine. It’s  \\nbetter to get to the nasty part  \\nbefore I care one way or the other. \\nHe takes her hand, pulls her forward to kiss her cheek. \\nPROTAGONIST \\n(whispers) \\nThere’s a number in your left coat  \\npocket. Don’t call from home. \\nA Thug puts a MEATY HAND on the Protagonist’s shoulder. \\nKAT \\nYou won’t be taking my call. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI might surprise you. \\nShe leaves, BREEZING out through the kitchen... at Volkov’s  nod, two Thugs escort the Protagonist from his chair, heading  towards the kitchen – a WAITER moves to object – Volkov,  eating the Protagonist’s leftovers, pulls the Waiter up  short, shaking his head. \\nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – MOMENTS LATER \\nKat exits the restaurant, DISTRAUGHT, walking past a waiting  THUG, then sliding into the back seat of a MERCEDES. \\nINT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS \\nThe driver is a GAUNT RUSSIAN. \\nKAT \\nPlease, let’s go. \\nThe Gaunt Russian does not react, but watches through the  rear-view mirror as a THUG enters the kitchen – \\nKAT (CONT\\'D) \\nCan we get going? \\n34.\\nINT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS \\nThe Protagonist enters the kitchen, followed by the two  thugs. CHEFS and BUSBOYS retreat as the other thug  approaches... \\nINT./EXT.

ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS \\nThe Protagonist brushes himself clean, SPOTS the Mercedes,  starts moving towards it – \\n35.\\nINT./EXT.

I’ll be there,  \\ntoo. \\nMax looks up at the Nanny. Kat hugs him, tight. The Nanny  TAPS Kat on the shoulder. Kat smiles at her son, tears in her  eyes, as the car pulls away. She pulls out her phone,  dials... hears a RINGTONE behind her –  \\nThe Protagonist is there. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI said I’d surprise you. He’s a  \\ncute kid. \\nKAT \\nMax. He’s everything. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhere’s the drawing? \\nKAT \\nOslo. At the airport. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThe airport? \\nINSERT CUT: a Rotas car drives across an airport apron, and  down a ramp... \\nKAT \\nDo you know what a freeport is? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nA storage facility for art that’s  \\nbeen acquired – \\n...into a SLEEK facility – the OSLO FREEPORT – as a STAFF  MEMBER stands ready to greet a new CLIENT... \\n36.\\nKAT (V.O.) \\nBut not yet taxed. We started a  \\nnetwork – Rotas, his construction  \\ncompany, built them, I brought in  \\nclients. The facilities are tax  \\nhavens... \\nThe client is NEIL... he takes in the security  arrangements... \\nPROTAGONIST (V.O.) \\nThe clients can view their  \\ninvestments – \\nEXT. OSLO OPERA HOUSE – DAY \\nThe Protagonist is standing on the roof of the Oslo Opera  House, briefing Neil... \\nPROTAGONIST (V.O.) \\n– without importing them, so they  \\navoid paying tax. \\nNEIL \\nSort of a transit lounge for art? \\nWe go back to Kat, on the street, briefing the Protagonist... \\nKAT \\nArt, antiques, anything of value,  \\nreally. \\nAnything? \\nPROTAGONIST KAT \\nAnything legal... \\nThen back to the Protagonist briefing Neil... \\nPROTAGONIST \\nBut it’s not unlike the Swiss  \\nbanking system. Opaque. \\nBack to Kat – \\nKAT \\nRotas has assets in the Oslo  \\nFreeport. I’m guessing it’s there. \\nGuessing? \\nBack to Oslo – \\nGuessing? \\nPROTAGONIST NEIL \\n37.\\nBack to Kat – \\nKAT \\nWe make trips there four or five  \\ntimes a year. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nTo view art? \\nKAT \\nAnd whatever he does – it turns out  \\nart is of no importance to Andrei. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nBut the freeports are. \\nKat nods. \\nINT. FREEPORT – DAY \\nA STAFF MEMBER brings Neil into a LUXURIOUS GALLERY – \\nSTAFF MEMBER \\nSome freeports are just warehouses  \\n– here, you can actually enjoy your \\npossessions... \\nThen through doors into an ANGLED INNER CORRIDOR... \\nSTAFF MEMBER (CONT\\'D) \\nThe structure of the vaults is  \\nbased on The Pentagon – each vault  \\na separate structure within the  \\nothers. Damage to one structure  \\nwon’t compromise the others. \\nThey arrive at a door in the corridor. The Staff Member uses  his thumb to unlock a door – \\nSTAFF MEMBER (CONT\\'D) \\nClients have biometric access  \\nstraight in off the tarmac. \\nNEIL \\nFrom the terminal? \\nSTAFF MEMBER \\n(confused) \\nFrom their private planes. \\nOf course. \\nNEIL \\nNeil checks the locks as the Staff Member opens the door into  – \\n38.\\nINT.

Absolutely – \\nNEIL \\nI was going to say, water damage  \\nfrom sprinkler systems. \\nSTAFF MEMBER \\nWe don’t use sprinklers. \\n(points to vents) \\nThe facility is flooded with halide  \\ngas, displacing all the air within  \\nseconds. \\n39.\\nNEIL \\nCan you show me? \\nSTAFF MEMBER \\nIf I did, we’d suffocate. \\nNEIL \\nWhat about the staff in here? \\nSTAFF MEMBER \\nHalide only fills the vaults – they  \\njust have to get into the corridor. \\nThere’s a ten-second warning. \\nNEIL \\nYou only give them ten seconds? \\nSTAFF MEMBER \\nOur clients use us because we have  \\nno priorities above their property. \\nBlimey. \\nNEIL \\nSTAFF MEMBER \\nWell, sir, you asked. \\nINT. OSLO AIRPORT – DAY \\nThe Protagonist and Neil walk through the terminal. \\nNEIL \\nVault doors are fireproof,  \\nhydraulic closers, simple key and  \\nelectronic triggers. Surprisingly  \\neasy, once there’s a lockdown. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhy a lockdown? \\nNEIL \\nPower switches to fail-safe,  \\nsealing outer doors, but inner  \\ndoors revert to factory settings  \\nand pickable locks. Child’s play,  \\nreally. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nChild’s play? They’re inside  \\nairport security. They have to  \\nworry about climate control, not  \\narmed raids. \\nNEIL \\nSo how do we get fire power through  \\nthe perimeter to trigger a \\nlockdown? \\n40.\\nEXT.

OSLO STREET – DAY \\nThe Protagonist looks at Neil in disbelief. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou want to crash a plane? \\nNEIL \\nNot from the air, don’t be so  \\ndramatic. I want to run a jet off  \\nthe taxiway, breach the rear wall,  \\nstart a fire. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nHow big a plane? \\nNEIL \\nWell, that part is a little  \\ndramatic. \\nThey approach a MAN sitting on a harbour-front bench. \\nNEIL (CONT\\'D) \\nThis is Mahir. His team will work  \\nthe plane. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThere can’t be passengers – \\nMAHIR \\nNorskfreight.

What about the crew? \\nMAHIR \\nWe’ll pop the slides, chuck ’em off  \\n– \\n41.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nOn the move? \\nMAHIR \\nWhat’s the problem? They’ll be  \\nfine. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nIt seems... bold. \\nMAHIR \\n(smiles) \\n‘Bold’ I’m fine with – I thought  \\nyou were going to say nuts. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAnd if you get caught? \\nWe won’t. If you do? \\nMAHIR \\nPROTAGONIST MAHIR \\nEveryone assumes terrorism, but no  one’s died. Swift extradition, then lost in the system. It’ll barely  make the news. \\nNEIL \\nThat may depend on the size of your  explosion. \\nMAHIR \\nActually, the gold bars might get  some play. \\nGold bars? \\nPROTAGONIST NEIL \\nNorskfreight ships treasury gold  \\nonce a month. \\nMAHIR \\nWe blow the back, drop the gold out  \\non the runway. \\nNEIL \\nNo one’s going to be looking at  \\nyour building, I guarantee you. \\nINT.

Which means you’ve decided  \\nto trust me. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nOr I’ve lost my edge. \\nNEIL \\nOh, your edge is intact. \\nThe Protagonist looks at Neil. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThere’s a cold war. \\nNuclear? Temporal. \\nNEIL \\nPROTAGONIST NEIL \\n(skeptical) \\nTime travel? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nNo. Technology that can invert an  object’s entropy. \\nNEIL \\nYou mean reverse chronology. Like  Feynman and Wheeler’s notion that a positron is an electron moving  backwards in time. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nSure, that’s exactly what I meant. \\nNEIL \\nI’ve a master’s in physics. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWell, try to keep up. \\nNEIL \\nThe implications of this are – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nBeyond secret. \\nNEIL \\nThen why’d you take me in? \\n50.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nI thought we’d find the drawing and  \\na couple boxes of bullets. \\nNEIL \\nYou were as surprised as I was. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’m going back to Mumbai for  \\nanswers. I’ll set you up as go between. But remember – to you, all  \\nthis is about plutonium. Or when  \\nwe’re done, they’ll kill you. \\nNEIL \\nWon’t you have to anyway? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’d rather it was my decision. \\nNEIL \\nSo would I. I think. \\nINT./EXT. FERRY BOAT, MUMBAI – DAY \\nThe Protagonist boards, approaching Priya at the rail. \\nPRIYA \\nI don’t like to leave my house. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAnd I don’t like bungee jumping.  \\nBut we need to talk. \\nPRIYA \\nWhat about? \\nInversion. \\nPROTAGONIST PRIYA \\nWe spoke about it – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI don’t remember anything about  people being inverted – \\nPRIYA \\nWe’re trying to do with inversion  what we couldn’t do with the atomic  bomb – uninvent it. Divide and  contain the knowledge. Ignorance is  our ammunition – the more any one  of us knows, the greater the risk  that we’re actually making the  situation worse. \\nRisk more. \\nPROTAGONIST \\n51.\\nPriya gestures at the paper. A headline: ‘OSLO GOLD FREIGHT  CRASH – TERRORISM? ROBBERY? BOTH?’ \\nYour work? \\nPRIYA \\nThe Protagonist nods. \\nPRIYA (CONT\\'D) \\nWhat did you find in the vaults? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nTwo antagonists, one inverted. We  took out the regular one, the  \\ninverted one got away. \\nPRIYA \\nBoth emerged at the same moment? \\nYeah. \\nPROTAGONIST PRIYA \\nThey were the same person. You saw  someone re-inverting. Sator’s built a turnstile in that vault. \\nTurnstile? \\nPROTAGONIST PRIYA \\nA machine for inverting. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou told me the technology hasn’t  been invented, yet. \\nPRIYA \\nIt hasn’t. He’s been given it by  the future. \\nFor what? \\nPROTAGONIST PRIYA \\nYou’ve the best chance of finding  out. \\nEXT. MUMBAI STREET – MOMENTS LATER They walk, BODYGUARDS at a discreet distance. \\nPRIYA \\nHave you met him? \\n52.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nI was close. \\nPRIYA \\nGet closer. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’ve been compromised. Unless that  \\nantagonist was a coincidence. \\nPRIYA \\nThe wife set you up? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nMaybe. There’s a good chance I get  \\nkilled as soon as I go back in. \\nPRIYA \\nThis was always a suicide mission –  \\nthat’s why they recruited a corpse. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWho did? Who are we working for? \\nPRIYA \\nEveryone. Survival. You need more,  \\nconsider yourself working for me. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWell, Boss, I need a way to  \\nsucceed. \\nPriya thinks. Looks at the Protagonist. Deciding. \\nPRIYA \\nWhat if you have something he  \\nneeds? \\nSuch as? \\nPROTAGONIST PRIYA \\nPlutonium 241. Sator tried to lift  the only loose 241 from under a CIA  team at the opera siege in Kiev. He  got the team, but not the 241. \\nWho did? \\nPROTAGONIST PRIYA \\nUkrainian security services. It’s  moving through Tallinn in a week. \\n53.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nHelping an arms dealer steal  \\nweapons-grade plutonium is  \\nunacceptable. I’m just gonna take  \\nhim out. \\nPRIYA \\nNo. Sator has to stay alive until  \\nwe know his part in things.  \\nLeverage the situation without  \\nlosing control of the 241. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nIt’s too dangerous. \\nPRIYA \\nA terrorist bomb, even one that  \\nkills millions, is nothing compared  \\nwith what happens if we don’t stop  \\nSator. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nFrom. Doing. What? \\nPriya looks up the road at the cars STREAMING past... \\nPRIYA \\nWe’re being attacked. Not by  \\nterrorists or rogue states... \\nWho, then? \\nPROTAGONIST PRIYA \\nWe’re being attacked by the future.  And we’re fighting over time. \\nTime? \\nPROTAGONIST PRIYA \\nTheirs is running out, so they’re  \\ncoming for ours. And Sator is  \\nhelping. You have to find out how. \\nEXT. TERRACE, AMALFI COAST – DAY \\nThe Protagonist leaves the tourists behind, heading down a  leafy path to emerge at a terrace overlooking the sea. Kat  stands there, alone. The Protagonist falls in beside her. \\nKAT \\nI saw the news from Oslo. Do you  \\nhave the drawing? \\n54.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou don’t have to worry about it  \\nany more. \\nKAT \\nYou destroyed it? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI didn’t think you’d want it back. \\nKAT \\nDoes he know? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nNot yet, so sit tight. \\nKAT \\nSit tight? Why? Every day my son  \\nspends with that monster, he thinks  \\na little less of me. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nIt won’t be long. In the meantime,  \\nintroduce me. \\nAs what? \\nKAT \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’m a former First Secretary from  the American Embassy in Riyadh, we met at a party last June – \\nKAT \\nWe were at a party in Riyadh, but I  don’t think it was June – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nJune 29th. 7 for 7:30, salmon on  the printed menu swapped for sea  bass on the night. Sator left  early, that’s when we met. Don’t  offer any of this, it’s there if he  asks. I came into Shipley’s in  London, you ran into me here and  want to show me the yacht. \\nKAT \\nHe’ll think we’re having an affair. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAnd he’ll want to meet me. \\nKAT \\nOr have you killed. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nLet me worry about that. \\n55.\\nKAT \\nDid I look worried? \\nEXT. DOCK, AMALFI – DAY \\nThe Protagonist and Kat look out at an enormous yacht. \\nKAT \\nSleeps 70, with crew. Four tenders,  \\ntwo helicopters, missile defences – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nJesus. Worried about pirates? \\nKAT \\nAndrei loves playing one government  \\noff another. The day they turn,  \\nthat’s his refuge. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhat if I joined you? \\nShe nods at Volkov, holding the launch’s line. \\nKAT \\nI’m not sure Volkov’s taking  \\npassengers just now. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThen let’s take mine. \\nThe Protagonist nods at Volkov as they walk past. EXT. HARBOUR, AMALFI – MOMENTS LATER \\nThe Protagonist GUNS his boat hard, carving a GLITTERING PATH  across the calm harbour. Kat sits, enjoying the speed. \\nThe Protagonist pulls up alongside the yacht, CREW MEMBERS  SCRAMBLE, unaccustomed to unauthorized approaches. The  Protagonist follows Kat’s gaze to a FIGURE above, but the sun  is behind it. Kat steps onto the yacht. \\nThe Protagonist gives the figure a JAUNTY SALUTE. No  response. The Protagonist ZIPS back towards shore, passing  the yacht’s launch. He waves at Volkov. \\nINT./EXT. YACHT – MOMENTS LATER \\nFollow Kat into the enormous lounge. She drops her bags – \\nMALE VOICE (O.S.) \\nWho’s the American? \\n56.\\nShe turns. A middle-aged man with cold eyes and a thin beard  stands in the doorway. THIS IS SATOR. \\nA friend. \\nKAT \\nSATOR \\nThe man from Shipley’s? \\nKAT \\nWho you tried to have beaten up? \\nSATOR \\nI ask again. Who is he? \\nKAT \\nWe met in Riyadh. In June at the  \\nAmerican Embassy. \\nSATOR \\nGood with fists for a diplomat... \\nKAT \\nParanoia’s your department. He  \\nseems nice, I invited him to the  \\ndinner.(turns away) \\nMax?... Max?!... \\nSATOR \\nHe’s visiting Pompeii and  \\nHerculaneum. \\nKAT \\nOvernight? You just sent him off?! \\nSATOR \\nHe’s my son. \\nKAT \\nOur son. I told him I’d go with him  \\n– \\nSATOR \\nI explained you were busy. With  \\nyour friend. \\nHe turns, walks away. She watches him leave. \\nINT. RESTAURANT, AMALFI COAST – EVENING \\nThe Protagonist walks towards a table where Sator, holding  court, attacks some crabs. Volkov stops the Protagonist and  FRISKS him, in full view of the diners. \\n57.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhere I’m from, you buy me dinner  \\nfirst. \\nWithout looking, Sator gestures at a seat, Volkov lets the  Protagonist pass. He sits. \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) \\nMr Sator? I’m – \\nSATOR \\n(quiet) \\nDon’t bother. Just tell me if  \\nyou’ve slept with my wife, yet. \\nThe Protagonist glances up at Kat, opposite, chatting. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nNo. Not yet. \\nA glance from Sator between buttery mouthfuls of crab. \\nSATOR \\nHow would you like to die? \\nOld. \\nPROTAGONIST SATOR \\nYou chose the wrong profession. \\nSator returns a toast from a grinning guest. Reaches a greasy  palm to the Protagonist’s cheek, as if in friendliness... \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nThere’s a walled garden up the  \\nroad. We’re going to take you  \\nthere, cut your throat, not across,  \\nin the middle, like a hole. Then we  \\ntake your balls, stuff them in the  \\ncut, block the windpipe. \\nComplex. \\nPROTAGONIST SATOR \\nIt’s gratifying to watch a man you  don’t like try to pull his own  balls out of his throat before he  chokes. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nIs this how you treat all your  guests? \\nSATOR \\nThe ones using my family to get to  me. \\n58.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nHow else is someone supposed to get  \\nto you? \\nSATOR \\nOnly a fool wants to be near me. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nOr someone who has something worth  \\ndelaying your gratification for... \\nSator signals Volkov – Kat glances over as Volkov RISES – \\nSATOR \\nWe’re finished. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nDo you like opera? \\nAt this, Sator pauses. Waves off Volkov. \\nSATOR \\nNot here. You sail? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’ve messed around on boats. \\nSATOR \\nBe on the dock at eight. Ready to  \\ndo more than mess around. \\nKat, relieved, watches the Protagonist leave. \\nEXT. DINING ROOM, YACHT – MORNING \\nKat enters, dressed in sailing gear. Sator is already seated,  similarly dressed, reading his phone, with a cup of coffee. \\nKAT \\nMax has missed too much school this  \\nyear. I’m taking him back to \\nEngland. \\nSATOR \\nNo, you’re not. He has a tutor  \\nhere. \\nKAT \\nThe school won’t be okay with – \\nSATOR \\nYes, they will. \\nKAT \\nCan I finish?! \\n59.\\nSATOR \\nLook around you – he has everything  \\nhe needs here. \\nA SERVANT places a plate with a silver cover in front of Kat,  then pours her coffee. \\nKAT \\nYou don’t care what he needs. You  \\nbought the trappings of a king, but \\nwe both know you’re a grubby little  \\nman playing power games with a wife  \\nwho doesn’t love him any more. \\nSator looks at her. \\nSATOR \\nYou seem spirited today. \\nKAT \\nDo I? \\n(defiant) \\nSator barely nods at the servant, who pulls off the lid... \\nSATOR \\nYes. You do. \\nOn the plate, instead of breakfast, is a small drawing. A  ‘Rubens’. Kat freezes. \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nWere you worried it had been  \\ndestroyed? Rest assured, instinct  \\ntold me to remove it from the  \\nvault. I’ve always had instincts  \\nabout the future. That’s how I  \\nbuilt this life you no longer  \\nvalue. \\nKat looks up at him, not knowing what to say or do. \\nEXT. DOCK, AMALFI – MORNING \\nThe Protagonist stands on the dock, dressed for sailing,  watching the launch approach... \\nMorning. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAs he gets on, Kat ignores him. Sator enjoys this. \\nEXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI – MOMENTS LATER \\nThe Protagonist tries to catch Kat’s eye, but she will not  look his way.  \\n60.\\nSator hands the Protagonist a HARNESS and a HELMET... he  looks at them, taken aback, then looks ahead – towards TWO  GRAPHITE DARK, HIGHEST TECH AMERICA’S CUP SAILING YACHTS,  trimmed and ready. \\nPROTAGONIST \\n(impressed) \\nWhen you said sailing... \\nEXT. SAILING YACHT DECK – MOMENTS LATER \\nKat gets on, followed by Sator and the Protagonist. The  rigging crew departs. Kat checks the sheets and winches.  Sator indicates the harness. \\nSATOR \\nYou know how? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAye, Captain. \\nSator gestures at Kat. \\nSATOR \\nShe’s captain. \\nEXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI – LATER \\nThe boats FLY, SKIMMING THE WATER ON THEIR HYDROFOILS...  Sator and the Protagonist are next to each other, standing on  one pontoon, LEANING OUT IN THEIR HARNESSES... Kat is at the  wheel, concentrating... \\nSATOR \\nWhat do you know about opera? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nIn 2008 a remote Russian missile  \\nstation was overwhelmed and held  \\nfor a week. When the station was  \\nretaken, the plutonium 241 on one \\nwarhead was three quarters of a  \\nkilo lighter. The missing 241  \\nsurfaced at the opera-house siege  \\nin Kiev on the 14th. \\nSATOR \\nYou’re well informed. But that  \\ndoesn’t mean you have the  \\nplutonium. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI didn’t say I had it. I’m saying I  \\nknow how to get it – \\n61.\\nKAT (O.S.) \\nCOMING ABOUT! \\nKat SWINGS the boat into the wind, SAIL FLAPPING FURIOUSLY as  the wind catches it on the other side, and Sator and the  Protagonist DUCK under the boom, RACING to the other side,  their harnesses SNAPPING TAUT as they lean out... \\nSATOR \\nWhat do you propose? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nPartnership. \\nSATOR \\nI wouldn’t partner with you. \\nKat works the wheel, tracking the other boat. Her look is one  of BOTTLED RAGE... \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhat’s wrong with me? \\nSATOR \\nYou know how to handle yourself,  \\nyou have no record. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nSomeone in the arms trade with  \\ntraining who covers his tracks? Not  \\nthat shocking. \\nSATOR \\nFor an intelligence agent. \\nSator holds the Protagonist’s gaze... \\nKAT \\nSecure your jib line. \\nThe Protagonist turns – Kat leans in to Sator – \\nKAT (CONT\\'D) \\nBurn in hell, Andrei – \\n– and YANKS HIS QUICK-RELEASE – he FLIES off the boat,  SMASHING HEAD-FIRST into the waves – \\nThe Protagonist sees Sator FACE-DOWN, UNCONSCIOUS – he  UNCLIPS, JUMPS to the wheel, SPINNING the boat OFF THE WIND – \\nKAT (CONT\\'D) \\nYOU CAN’T JIBE A BOAT LIKE THIS – ! \\nThe Protagonist STEERS the boat across the wind, SNAPPING THE  BOOM ACROSS, ALMOST LOSING THE MAST – \\n62.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou can if you have to – \\nHe RELEASES THE SHEETS, SPILLING WIND, LOSING SPEED – as they  pass Sator he DIVES into the water – GRABS the oligarch –  PULLS his face out of the water... Sator starts COUGHING... \\nINT. STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – DAY \\nThe Protagonist dries himself – the door opens – Kat BURSTS  in – \\nKAT \\nWHY DIDN’T YOU LET HIM DROWN?! \\nShe is on him, smashing her fists into his chest – \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI need him. \\nKAT \\nTo sell guns?! \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI’m not who you think I am. \\nKAT \\nThat, I know – he showed me the  \\ndrawing. \\nI’m sorry. \\nPROTAGONIST KAT \\nDo you have any idea what you’ve  \\ndone? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI had to get close to him. I don’t  \\nknow what you think your husband is  \\n– \\nKAT \\nWe both know he’s an arms dealer. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nHe’s so much more. \\nKAT \\nWhat, then? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAndrei Sator holds all our lives in  \\nhis hands. Not just yours. \\nShe looks bemused. A KNOCK at the door – she hides behind it  – \\n63.\\nVOLKOV \\nMr Sator wants to see you. \\nThe Protagonist nods – pushes the door – Volkov stops it – \\nNow. \\nVOLKOV (CONT\\'D) PROTAGONIST \\nHe wants to see me without pants? \\nVolkov lets the door shut. The Protagonist turns to Kat – \\nTrust me. \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) KAT \\nSave it. I’m not falling for it  \\ntwice. \\nThe Protagonist looks at Kat. Sighs. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou have a better option? \\nShe looks into the Protagonist’s eyes. Assessing. \\nKAT \\nWhatever it takes to get what you  \\nwant. Just like him. Not a second’s \\nthought about me. My son. What do  \\nyou think he’s going to do to me \\nnow? \\nHe pulls a gun from his bag. Offers it to her. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nTry not to use this – \\nShe takes it – lets it point at him. \\nOn anyone. \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) \\nINT. STUDY, SATOR’S YACHT – EVENING \\nThe Protagonist is shown in. Sator is sitting behind his  desk. A DOCTOR is taking his blood pressure. \\nEnough – \\nSATOR \\nSator RIPS the cuff off his arm, sending the doctor out –  checks a fitness tracker on his wrist. \\n64.\\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nSee? Pulse of a man half my age.  \\nDrink with me. \\nSator pours them both tumblers of vodka. \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nIt seems I now owe you my life. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nIt’s nothing. \\nSator fixes his black gaze on the Protagonist. \\nSATOR \\nMy life is not nothing. And I don’t  \\nlike to be in debt. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThen pay me. No retribution against  \\nyour wife. \\nA dangerous beat. Then Sator GRINS – \\nSATOR \\nYou think she released my harness? \\n(laughs) \\nIt was my own mistake. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThen help me steal the 241. I need  \\nresources. It’s weapons-grade \\nplutonium – that means special  \\nhandling, containment facilities – \\nSATOR \\nI know what it means. You lecture  \\nme about radiation. Andrei Sator, \\ndigging plutonium from the rubble  \\nof my city as a teenager? \\nWhere? \\nPROTAGONIST SATOR \\nStalsk-12. My home. \\nSator sips his drink. Looks the Protagonist in the eye. \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nOne pod of a warhead exploded at  \\nground level, scattering the  \\nothers.

HE LIFTS OUT SOME  PAPERS, WHICH HAVE HIS NAME ON THEM, REVEALING GOLD BARS  UNDERNEATH. THE FELLOW WORKER LEANS IN, STUDYING THE GOLD.  THEY MAKE EYE CONTACT... SATOR STRIKES THE FELLOW WORKER WITH  HIS CROWBAR, KILLING HIM... \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nI staked my claim in the new  \\nRussia. Even now, my company is the  \\nonly one to operate in the ruins. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThe 241’s being transported through  \\nNorthern Europe on its way to the \\nlong-term nuclear storage depot at  \\nTrieste. I’m told you have  \\nresources in Tallinn. \\nSator downs his vodka. \\nSATOR \\nStay with us tonight. I insist. \\nINT. KAT’S STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – NIGHT \\nKat slips the gun under her mattress, feels the lump – pulls  it out – moves to the desk, puts it in her jewellery case –  hearing a noise she jumps onto the bed, picks up a book. The  door opens. Sator. He locks the door. \\nKAT \\nWhat do you want, Andrei? \\nSATOR \\nWe’re going to talk about today. \\nKAT \\nNo, we’re not. \\n66.\\nHe removes a DIAMOND CUFFLINK... \\nNo? \\nSATOR \\nKat starts to get off the bed – \\nKAT \\nDon’t think for a minute you can  \\ntreat me the way you treat your  \\nother women. \\nSator shifts to lean on the desk, cutting her off from the  jewellery box. She sits back down. He removes his belt... \\nSATOR \\nAnd how do you imagine I treat  \\nthese other women? \\nSator slips the cufflink through a belt hole... \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nYou think I force them into  \\nconversation? \\nSator tests the diamond studded belt against his palm. \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nYou want to be quiet? Fine... \\nHe tosses her a pillow. \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nBite down on that... \\nSator moves towards her – she looks at the jewellery box on  the desk – no way around him – Sator looks down at her. She  looks up at his cold eyes... \\nKAT \\nEven a soul as blank and brittle as  \\nyours needs a response. Is fear and \\npain enough? Because that’s all I  \\nhave to offer. \\nSATOR \\nThen it’ll have to do. \\nKAT \\nWhy didn’t you just throw me out? \\nSATOR \\nIf I can’t have you, no one can. \\nKAT \\nAt what point do you give up and  \\nkill me? \\n67.\\nSator shrugs, wraps the belt a turn around his fist... \\nTurn over. \\nSATOR KAT \\nTouch me, I scream so loud he  \\nhears. \\nSATOR \\nYou think I’d let him interfere? \\nKAT \\nIf he tried you’d have to kill him.  End of deal. So leave me the fuck \\nalone. \\nA KNOCK at the door. \\nNOT NOW! \\nSATOR \\nBut he hears a RUMBLING... Sator, without a word, exits – \\nEXT.

Sator puts his hand over the  open capsule, letting small, flat GOLD BARS leap from the  capsule into his hand... he looks up, expectantly...  \\nThe Crew SHOVES a CREW MEMBER forwards, onto his knees...  eyes downcast, he reaches behind – pulls a gold bar from his  rear pocket. He offers it to Sator with TREMBLING hands.  \\nSator takes it, eyes never leaving the Crew Member... who  finally, tentatively looks up –  \\nBAM!

How do you come by \\nyour information about the opera? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nDo I work for intelligence  \\nservices? Several, just like you.  \\nYou wouldn’t do business with  \\nsomeone who wasn’t savvy enough to  \\nbe recruited. Hell, the CIA  \\nprovides two-thirds of the market  \\nfor fissile material. \\nSATOR \\nThey’re usually buying, not  \\nselling. But we do live in a  \\ntwilight world... \\nPROTAGONIST \\nIs that Whitman?

Where’s he bury it? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nSomeplace that won’t be disturbed  for centuries. What did the soil sample show? \\n71.\\nNEIL \\nNorthern Europe or Asia,  \\nradioactive. Dried blood was  \\nEuropean. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nPretty broad. \\nNEIL \\nThis is the start of the run. \\nThe Protagonist looks back where they came. Then up ahead. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nWhen does the material arrive? \\nNEIL \\nThursday. When does Sator arrive? \\nPROTAGONIST \\nI don’t know. But he’ll be here. \\nNEIL \\nCargo’s in a reinforced truck.  \\nNuclear police front and back –  \\nSUVs with serious armour – you  \\ncan’t break in through the windows. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nAnd they can’t break out. \\nNEIL \\nI don’t follow. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nYou will. So, light convoy through  \\ndowntown, what’s the thinking? \\nNEIL \\nA crowded, unpredictable traffic  \\npattern makes planning an ambush \\nalmost impossible. \\nThe Protagonist looks around at the congestion. \\nPROTAGONIST \\nThey have a point. Is the convoy  \\nmonitored from the air? \\nNEIL \\nNo, tracked by GPS – a wrong turn  \\nor an unscheduled stop, in comes  \\nthe cavalry. \\nNeil and the Protagonist hop a tram. The Protagonist studies  the journey along the multi-lane road out of town. \\n72.\\nPROTAGONIST \\nWe need big guns, guns that make  \\nthe point without being fired. We \\nneed a fast car that doesn’t look  \\nfast and four heavy vehicles, all \\ndifferent – bus, coach, eighteen wheeler... \\nNeil nods. \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) \\nOne of them has to be a fire truck. \\nNeil looks up, interested. \\nPROTAGONIST (CONT\\'D) \\nMost of all, we need to set this up  \\nwith nothing in the record –  \\nnothing electronic, nothing paper –  \\nI don’t want Sator ambushing us the  \\nsecond we spring the material. His  \\nignorance is our only protection. \\nINT./EXT.

Sator is at a table covered in WEAPONS. \\nSATOR \\nSee, Kat? Some of my favourites... \\nHe picks up a MACHINE GUN. \\n73.\\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nSinged but salvageable, wouldn’t  \\nyou say? \\nShe stares at the weaponry as if she’s never seen anything  like it before... \\nKAT \\nIt’s not my area of expertise. \\nSATOR \\nThat’s right. You’d never have  \\nanything to do with such things.  \\nBut this is where our worlds  \\ncollide. \\nKAT \\nAndrei, what is this? \\nSATOR \\nYou know perfectly well what it is,  \\nKat – the filthy business that put \\nthose clothes on your back and our  \\nboy in his school. That you thought  \\nyou could negotiate your way  \\naround. \\nVOLKOV \\n(in Russian, subtitled) \\nThe convoy’s due downtown in ten. \\nSator checks his watch. Nods at Volkov. Turns to Kat. \\nSATOR \\nIt’s time to go. \\nKAT \\nI’m not going anywhere with you. \\nSator SLAMS the machine gun back down on the table. Kat  FLINCHES. Sator TURNS, enraged... \\nSATOR \\nLook at me and understand – you  \\ndon’t negotiate with a tiger – you \\nadmire a tiger, until it turns on  \\nyou and you feel its TRUE. FUCKING. \\nNATURE! \\nSator moves towards her – Kat pulls out a gun. \\nDon’t... \\nKAT \\n74.\\nEXT.

You’re  \\nnot going to shoot me in cold blood  \\n– \\nKAT \\nMy blood’s not cold, Andrei. \\nSATOR \\nNo, but you’re not angry enough. \\nSator edges towards Kat... \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nBecause anger scars over into  \\ndespair. I look in your eyes... \\nHe casually GESTURES at her – \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nI see despair. \\nHe SMACKS the gun out of her hands – PUNCHES her – she DROPS  – \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nVengeful bitch. Living off me,  \\npretending to be better... \\nWith a primal, animal viciousness, Sator SPITS at Kat. \\nENOUGH! \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nSator KICKS her once, in the side. \\n76.\\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nYou wanted to know when it’s better  \\nto kill you? You’ll have your \\nanswer. \\nHe motions to Volkov, who, with a guard, lifts Kat and  \\ncarries her towards the door. Sator puts an earpiece in his  ear... \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nTell me everything as it happens. \\nVolkov nods, leaving – Sator walks through a large door. \\nSATOR (CONT\\'D) \\nSeal us this side! \\nAs the door shuts behind him, he walks towards a RED DOOR  WITH A SMALL PORTHOLE, finding a spot in the shadows  nearby... \\nEXT.

Mum sung me to sleep. \\nYou\\'re the only person \\nPage 37/87\\nwho can make being sung to \\nsleep sound like waterboarding. Well, it\\'s not that dissimilar. \\n(laughing): \\nThese, um, folk songs \\nmake you want \\nto string yourself up. \\nIs that where you get \\nyour singing from? \\nYeah, she was a singer \\nback in, um, the homeland. \\nWhere was that? \\nFormer Yugoslavia. \\nWe had to escape. \\n-\\'Cause of the war? \\n-Exactly. \\nMm. Must have been hard. \\nYeah. Dad was a lawyer. \\nUm, and now he stays away \\nfrom home as much as he can \\nbecause he\\'d rather be dead. \\n(chuckles) \\nExcept he\\'s a minicab driver, \\nwhich is sort of \\nthe same thing. \\nCan he not practice here? \\nNo, he couldn\\'t afford \\nto retrain, \\nso he\\'s out all the time. \\nAlso to avoid my mother, \\nwho\\'s given to depression \\nin much the same way as, um... What? \\nYou\\'re looking at me like \\nsome sort of science experiment that\\'s gone wrong. \\nSorry. \\n-No, I\\'m interested. \\n-Huh. \\nI mean, your mother-- \\nwhen was the last time \\nyou saw her \\nnot being depressed? \\nPage 38/87\\n(chuckles) \\nOoh, I think \\nwhen I got really ill. \\nAnd she was happy about that? \\nNo, but she was happy \\nabout the attention. \\nI mean, \\nI got a lot of attention, \\nbut I was unconscious. \\nShe got more. \\nJust the doctors, \\nthe nurses, the hospital staff. Drama. God, she loved it. \\nShe sort of flowered \\nunder it like a... \\nlike a late blossoming \\nor something. \\nAnyway, when I got better, \\nit all went away, \\nand she\\'s just never \\nbeen the same since. \\nWell, maybe she enjoyed \\nbeing needed again. \\nOh, trust you to come up \\nwith something understanding. \\n-That is truly horrific. \\n-(Kate chuckles) \\nI mean, who buys this stuff? \\nSanta. She\\'s Chinese, \\nso she\\'s, you know, \\ngot access to some \\nreally freaky outlets. \\nShe just loves Christmas \\nmore than anything else. \\n-More than taste or sanity. \\n-Yes, exactly. \\nAnd that isn\\'t even \\nthe nastiest thing we sell. \\nInconceivable. \\nHang on. \\n-Oh! \\n-Check it out. \\n-What is it? \\nPage 39/87\\n-Is that donkey actually \\nsmiling at me? -Yeah. Yeah. \\nAnd that baby \\nhas a full set of teeth. \\n-Oof. -I sold four of these \\nlast week.

Good to have dreams. \\nNot really. I\\'m 26. \\nOh, thank God. \\nYou still have time. \\n(chuckles) \\n-Come on. Get rid of that. \\n-Where...?
