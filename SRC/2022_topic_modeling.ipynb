(07/11/21) 4. \\nUNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE \\nMr. Chairperson, I believe I speak  \\nfor all of the member states when I  \\nsay, I am deeply disappointed by  \\nWakanda’s failure to stand by the  \\npromises made after the blip by the  \\nlate King T’Challa. Promises to  \\nparticipate in global efforts to  \\ntackle international challenges, to  \\nshare resources, technology and  \\nfull technical cooperation  \\nconcerning vibranium. \\n(beat) \\nPromises, Mr. Chairperson, that the  \\nQueen of Wakanda is failing to  \\ndeliver on. The United States  \\nshares a deep concern over the lack  \\nof Wakanda’s transparency and urges  \\nmeaningful dialogue in consultation  \\nwith key partners and Wakanda to  \\nstrengthen efforts to achieve our  \\ncommitments to international  \\ndevelopment and security. Thank  \\nyou, Mr. Chairperson. \\nThe Other Dignitaries nod in agreement. Ramonda looks back  silently and strongly.  \\nCHAIRPERSON OF UN \\nMy thanks to the Secretary of State  \\nof the United States of America for  \\nthat statement. I now give the  \\nfloor to the Minister of Foreign  \\nAffairs for France.  \\nSECRETARY OF STATE OF FRANCE (SUBTITLE) \\n(in French) \\nThank you, Mr. Chairperson, France  \\nhas information that states  \\nvibranium has limitless potential  \\nas a renewable energy source. And  \\nyet Queen Ramonda has still  \\ndeclined to open access to the  \\nmaterial through international  \\ntrade, or any of Wakanda’s  \\nphilanthropic ventures. We also  \\nhave information that vibranium can  \\nbe used to make weapons of mass  \\ndestruction. It is a substance that  \\ndoes not trigger any known metal  \\ndetector. It could be smuggled. It  \\nis a direct threat to the global  \\nsecurity environment and the  \\nnonproliferation regime. \\nGreen Rev. (07/11/21) 4A. \\nGreen Rev.

UNITED NATIONS - GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - DAY 8 The Secretary of State of France continues.  \\nSECRETARY OF STATE OF FRANCE (SUBTITLE) \\n(in French) \\nI would like to put the question to  \\nher majesty. “Why is there so much  \\nsecrecy around this particular  \\nresource?” “If her nation’s  \\nintentions really are to help other  \\nnations, why is that help only  \\nextended to certain groups of  \\npeople in those nations?” And “what  \\nof our intelligence in France, in  \\nBelgium, and in the United States,  \\nthat vibranium has properties that  \\ncan be weaponized?”  \\n(beat) \\nMr. Chairperson, Wakanda has  \\ndeliberately chosen, in a recurrent  \\nmanner, to defy our collective  \\nsecurity architecture. The  \\ndurability of our international  \\nsecurity would be at stake if we  \\nwere to overlook the potential  \\nthreat of vibranium today. Thank  \\nyou, Mr. Chairperson. \\nCHAIRPERSON OF UN  \\nMy thanks to the Minister of  \\nForeign Affairs for France. I now  \\ngive the floor to her majesty,  \\nQueen Ramonda. \\nRamonda leans into her mic.  \\nRAMONDA \\nThank you Mr. Chairperson,  \\nWakanda’s offerings to the global  \\ncommunity do not begin and end with  \\nour nation’s most valuable  \\nresource. It has always been our  \\npolicy to never trade vibranium  \\nunder any circumstance. Not because  \\nof the dangerous potential of  \\nvibranium, but because of the  \\ndangerous potential of some of the  \\npeople in this room.  \\n(beat)(MORE) \\n(MORE) \\nSalmon Rev.

But we know what you  \\nwhisper in your halls of  \\nleadership, in your military  \\nfacilities. \\n(sotto voce imitation) \\nThe King is dead. The Black Panther  \\nis gone. They have lost their  \\nprotector. Now is our time to  \\nstrike.  \\n9 INT. SAND FILTER TREATMENT FLOOR - NIGHT 9 \\nThe Female Mali Tech keys into the vault triggering an  elaborate locking mechanism that opens the dark, cavernous  vault.  \\nShe then steps back, removing her scarf, tucking it behind  her back. \\nMerc #2 turns to the Female Tech, confused. She looks back at  him her expression now icy, her head clean shaven and smooth.  This is ANEKA of the Dora Milaje. \\nCherry Rev. (09/30/21) 6.\\nCherry Rev. (09/30/21) 6. \\nThe unnerved Mercenaries look into the safe as someone steps  forward from darkness. It’s OKOYE, in full Dora Milaje  regalia. As she steps forward we reveal AYO and NOMBLE  flanking her.  \\nOKOYE \\nPHAMBILLI!!! \\nOn cue, both clusters of hostages trigger dome shaped SONIC  FORCEFIELDS from their KIMOYO BEADS.  \\nTHE DORA SPRING INTO ACTION. The Mercenaries unleash a HAIL  of automatic gunfire, but it is ineffective against the  DORA’S BALLETIC COMBAT MOVEMENT, vibranium weave uniforms,  and high tech spears.  \\nOkoye and the other Dora DISPATCH THE MERCENARIES. \\nNomble throws her spear up at the upper level where we reveal  ANOTHER DORA disguised as a scientist taking out another Merc  on the upper level.  \\nAneka pulls 2 PURPLE ENERGY DAGGERS as SHE AND AYO fight back  to back while Okoye hits Mercs with the HIGH POWERED TASER on  the back end of her spear, rendering them unconscious.  \\nAneka dispatches Merc #2. Okoye clocks this.  \\nOKOYE (CONT’D) \\nAneka, where is your spear?  \\nANEKA \\nThe Princess gave me these to try  \\nout. I like them better.  \\nOkoye takes out another Merc. \\nOKOYE \\nWe are Dora Milaje. Not space  \\ncadets. Our foremothers used spears  \\nfor millennia. It will not change  \\nunder my watch.  \\nAyo blocks a bullet for Aneka and takes out a Merc.  \\nAYO \\nI told you not to bring them.  \\nAneka rolls her eyes and takes down another Merc with the  daggers. \\nGreen Rev.

The doors of the chamber swing open,  revealing Okoye, Ayo, Aneka, and several DORA, escorting the  now conscious and handcuffed Mercenaries from Mali,  \\ndelivering them to the desk of the Frenchman. The dignitaries  and UN Staff react.  \\nOKOYE (SUBTITLE) \\n(in Xhosa) \\nKneel.(to the French Minister) \\nJe vous on prie. \\nRAMONDA \\nLet our gracious response to this  \\nincursion be an olive branch.  \\nFurther attempts on our resources  \\nwill be considered an act of  \\naggression and met with a much  \\nsteeper response. \\n(beat) \\nWe mourn the loss of our King, but  \\ndon’t think for a second, that  \\nWakanda has lost her ability to  \\nprotect our resources. We are aware  \\nof the ongoing efforts by some to  \\nfind Vibranium outside of Wakanda  \\nand wish you the best of luck.  \\nThe leaders deflate.

ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY 11 A CARGO SHIP travels in the middle of the Atlantic.  \\nAn enormous underwater mining vehicle sits on deck as a DATA  UMBILICAL CORD extends off the back into the water.  \\n12 EXT. DEEP OCEAN - DAY - CONTINUOUS 12 \\nWe see what is connected to the umbilical cord: A LARGE  VIBRANIUM DETECTOR on treads, rolls along the ocean floor  below the ship as they move together through the water until  an INDICATOR LIGHT changes colors.  \\n13 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - DAY 13 \\nAn advanced control system with several DEEP SEA MINING  TECHNICIANS monitoring readings. \\nSMITTY (50s, CIA) sits to the side, playing PUBG Mobile on  his phone, when a display reading suddenly CHIRPS, grabbing  everyone’s attention.  \\nExcited miners gather, wide-eyed as Smitty turns to the LEAD  MINING TECHNICIAN who nods.  \\nGetting to his feet, Smitty grabs a walkie-talkie.  \\nSMITTY \\n(radioing) \\nStop the ship! \\n14 EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 14 \\nThe LARGE MINING VEHICLE is missing from the deck but A GROUP  OF HEAVILY ARMED MILITARY TYPES have replaced it.  \\nSmitty, holding two coffees watches as A CHOPPER LANDS and  JACKSON and SALAZAR, two specialized NAVAL DIVERS, disembark  followed by DR. GRAHAM (50s, CIA). Smitty casually salutes  her. She smiles and takes the coffee.  \\nDR. GRAHAM \\nI thought you were retired.  \\nSMITTY \\nI thought I was too.  \\n(beat) \\nSaid that machine had a one in a  \\nbillion chance of finding  \\nvibranium.  \\nPink Rev. (06/13/21) 9.\\nPink Rev. (06/13/21) 9. \\nDR. GRAHAM \\nLess than that.  \\nSmitty shrugs, then lets out a whistle to the Military Types  who start unloading gear.  \\n15 EXT. DECK - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT - LATER 15 A CRANE removes a MOON POOL COVER, exposing the ocean below.  \\nMilitary Types guard the umbilical cable system that extends  over the edge of the ship.  \\nSalazar and Jackson are strapped into ATMOSPHERIC DIVING  SUITS and lowered into the ocean.  \\n16 INT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT 16 \\nThe moonlight barely penetrates the water as we TRACK ALONG  THE CABLES, ascending to greater and greater depths until...  \\nWe see Salazar and Jackson approaching the ocean floor...  STEAM FROM HYDROTHERMAL VENTS spewing into the water from a  distance.  \\nWe reveal the expanse of the black depth around Salazar and  Jackson. As they descend further, distant LIGHTS ON AN  UNDERWATER MINING VEHICLE reveal their destination. \\nSALAZAR \\nApproaching the floor now. \\nThe VEHICLE has dug a large TRENCH, the VB DETECTOR (lights  on) sits close by. \\nThe JACKSON AND SALAZAR land, sending a thick CLOUD of  sediment up into the water.  \\nSALAZAR (CONT’D) \\nWe’ve touched down. \\n17 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 17 \\nDr. Graham sits in front of a bank of monitors showing deep  ocean camera footage from the ocean bed as well as body mounted cameras on Salazar and Jackson. Smitty watches over  her shoulder.  \\nCherry Rev. (09/30/21) 10.\\nCherry Rev. (09/30/21) 10. \\nDR. GRAHAM \\nYou shouldn’t be too far from the  \\nspot.  \\nSALAZAR (O.S.) \\nYeah, we see it. \\n18 INT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT 18 \\nSalazar and Jackson step off the submersible, surveying the  landscape, then travel along the ocean floor. \\nThe divers approach the back of the enormous mining rig. As  they come around to the front, THE METAL DIGGING MECHANISM is  revealed.  \\nIt’s completely DESTROYED, bent back on itself like scrap  metal. Then, as they near the trench, Salazar and Jackson’s  eyes grow wide. \\nWe reveal a large mining trench where the machine met its  fate... a SMALL VEIN of a METAL.  \\nDR. GRAHAM (O.S.) \\nSalazar, report. \\nSALAZAR \\nYeah. It’s astonishing. The drill  \\nseems to have made contact with a  \\nmetallic substance. \\n19 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 19 \\nDr. Graham reacts to this, her poker face giving slight way  to excitement. Smitty sees this and beams.  \\nSMITTY \\nI’ll be. Vibranium in the ocean. \\nDR. GRAHAM \\nNicely done. Let’s get the detector  \\nout of there. It’s the only one  \\nwe’ve got. \\n20 INT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT 20 Salazar turns. \\nCopy that. \\nSALAZAR \\nYellow Rev.

CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 21 \\nDr. Graham watches as the monitor images from the underwater  camera feeds go dark at the loss of light.  \\nDR. GRAHAM  \\nSalazar, Jackson, I’ve lost  \\nvisual...  \\nSALAZAR (O.S.) \\nAll the lights went out down here. \\n22 INT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT 22 \\nSalazar and Jackson still have their SUIT MOUNTED LIGHTS,  granting them enough visibility to continue.  \\nJACKSON  \\nBut we’re still good. \\nThen, something catches Salazar’s eye.  \\nSALAZAR’S POV \\nIn the distance, a BIOLUMENESCANT ANIMAL floats toward them  rhythmically.  \\nSALAZAR \\nJackson, do you see this?  \\n23 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 23 \\nDr. Graham glances at the display showing the DIVERS’ VITALS.  Salazar’s heart rate is slowly rising. \\nDR. GRAHAM  \\nSalazar, what is your visual?  \\n24 EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT 24 \\nOne of the Military Men notices something in the water: a  BLUE-SKINNED WOMAN (20s) treading water with her eyes trained  on the boat. \\nWhite Production Draft 05/08/21 12.\\nWhite Production Draft 05/08/21 12. \\n25 INT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT 25 Salazar, still focused on the Squid, about 50 feet away now.  \\nSALAZAR \\n(whispering) \\nJackson. Tell me you’re seeing  \\nthis.  \\nJackson approaches behind her, looking on, speechless, until  WOOSH, he’s snatched into the DARKNESS by an unseen FIGURE. \\nSalazar awaits an answer, her eyes still on the creature. \\nSALAZAR (CONT’D) \\n(whispering) \\nJackson?  \\nSalazar turns to find nothing left of him but an umbilical.  \\nDR. GRAHAM (O.S.) \\nSalazar, we just lost Jackson’s  \\nvitals. Can you see him?  \\nSALAZAR \\nH-He’s gone.  \\n26 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 26 Dr. Graham and Smitty watch the monitors, dread setting in.  \\nDR. GRAHAM \\nWhat do you mean he’s gone?  \\n27 INT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT 27 \\nSalazar stares at Jackson’s severed umbilical with horror  while the SQUID comes within arm’s reach.  \\nShe slowly spins and we see the squid EXPANDING.  \\nDR. GRAHAM (O.S.) \\nRita! Do you copy?! What is going  \\non down there?  \\nRita’s eyes fix on something terrifying before she lets out  the beginning of a SCREAM that is cut off.  \\nPink Rev.

Dr. Graham and Smitty stare at the  screen in shock... for a long beat... then.  \\nDR. GRAHAM  \\nWe lost them! GODDAMN IT.  \\nDr. Graham turns to Smitty as...  \\nMILITARY MAN (O.S.) \\n(over radio) \\nSmitty, we got a situation out  \\nhere.  \\n29 EXT. BOAT DECK - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 29 \\nMilitary Man #1 taps Military Man #2 and motions for him to  peer over the deck at the waves below.  \\nMore Military Men come from the other side of the ship to see  and peering over, watch... \\n30 EXT. OCEAN’S SURFACE - NIGHT 30 \\nThe SWIMMING WOMAN... now joined by NINE OTHER TALOCANIL  WOMEN AND MEN, all staring at the ship.  \\nSome start to “sing” a guttural sound... like a cross between  a human and a whale. Others play OCARINAS. \\nIt’s haunting, otherworldly, but beautiful.  \\n31 EXT. BOAT DECK - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 31 \\nThe men become TRANSFIXED by the SOUND, their facial muscles  going slack and they begin to walk toward the edge and JUMP  OFF! \\n32 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 32 \\nSmitty turns to Dr. Graham as we hear the “singing” faintly  through the walls.  \\nDR. GRAHAM  \\nYou hear that?  \\nHe nods.  \\nGoldenrod Rev.

Smitty produces his own  PISTOL and cocks it. Smitty looks at the surveillance  monitors where he sees his SOLDIERS LEAPING INTO THE OCEAN.  \\nDisbelief sweeps across Smitty’s face. He opens the door and  HEARS the singing loudly. Immediately covering his ears, he  ducks back inside.  \\nSMITTY (CONT’D) \\nIt’s some sort of sonic attack.  \\nShit.  \\nDR. GRAHAM  \\nDr. Graham whips out her radio, speaking into it. \\nDR. GRAHAM (CONT’D) \\nWe’re under attack.

UPPER BOAT DECK - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS A34 Smitty jumps from the ladder first, Dr. Graham lands behind.  \\nThen, they spot the Lead Mining Technician walking towards  the edge. Smitty slows down while Dr. Graham heads for the  stairs.  \\nSMITTY \\nHenderson!!! \\nThe man doesn’t react, preparing to jump.  \\nCome on! \\nDR. GRAHAM \\nSmitty ignores her, lifts his pistol and FIRES into the air.  The lead technician startles at the sound, snapping out of  his trance.  \\n34 EXT. OCEAN’S SURFACE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 34 \\nThe Sirens stop singing at the gunshot and vanish underwater.  We see fast SWIMMERS pass by them, headed toward the surface.  \\n35 EXT. UPPER BOAT DECK - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 35 \\nAs the singing stops, the lead mining technician turns,  noticing Smitty.  \\nLEAD MINING TECHNICIAN \\nSmitty... what’s going on?  \\nSMITTY \\nGet off the edge!  \\nThe mining tech realizes where he is and nods, confused.  Smitty grins just as SOMETHING YANKS THE LEAD MINING  \\nTECHNICIAN OFF the boat.  \\nSMITTY (CONT’D) \\nHenderson!! \\nGoldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 16.\\nGoldenrod Rev.

Attuma pulls his spear out and Dr. Graham fires  shots at him. Attuma Turns towards her as more TALOCANIL  WARRIORS scale the boat and land on the deck.  \\nShe starts for the stairs leading to the Helicopter Pad, but  a SECOND TALOCANIL WARRIOR pulls onto it, cutting her off.  \\nShe heads for a CATWALK that runs the length of the HELIPAD.  \\nA36 EXT.

I  \\nwasn’t trying to save the Black  \\nPanther with the herb, I was trying  \\nto save my brother... and I failed. \\nRamonda studies Shuri closely. \\nRAMONDA \\nDo you know what day it is? \\nTuesday.  \\nSHURI \\nRamonda looks at her.  \\nRAMONDA \\nThe date, child.  \\nShuri thinks on this. And it hits her.  \\nSHURI \\nBrother’s passing. \\nRAMONDA \\nIt has been a year.  \\nThis hits Shuri very hard. She turns her back to Ramonda who  tries to embrace her, but Shuri steps away.  \\nRamonda thinks for a beat while Shuri gathers herself.  \\nSHURI \\nDo you have anything planned?  \\nRAMONDA \\nYes. It involves you taking your  \\nmother for a drive.  \\nSHURI \\nRight now?  \\nRAMONDA \\nYes. And you can leave your kimoyo  \\nbeads here. You won’t need them  \\nwhere we’re going. \\nShuri reluctantly takes them off and sets them on the table. \\nGreen Rev. (07/11/21) 20A. \\nGreen Rev. (07/11/21) 20A.\\nRAMONDA (CONT’D) \\nThe other ones too, Shuri. \\nShuri sighs, then pulls hidden kimoyo beads that look like  earrings from her hers.  \\nSHURI \\nOk Mother, where to?  \\nGreen Rev.

RIVERBANK - WAKANDAN BUSH - NIGHT - HOURS LATER 49 \\nShuri scoops water from a river while Ramonda tends to a  fire. A makeshift shelter sits behind them. \\nRAMONDA \\nIn the River Tribe, we have a  \\nritual to honor our connection to  \\nthose that have passed on.  \\nSHURI \\nThere is a ritual for everything  \\nhere. Somebody has died, you have  \\nto do the ritual. My neighbor hates  \\nme, oh just do ritual. I can’t find  \\na boyfriend... don’t worry there’s  \\na ritual for that. \\nRAMONDA \\nAfter your father died. I performed  \\nthis ritual, with T’Challa by my  \\nside, and Nakia.  \\nTan Rev. (02/23/22) 23.\\nTan Rev. (02/23/22) 23. \\nSHURI \\nUgh. Don’t mention her name. I know  \\nshe hated being here, but that is  \\nno excuse for missing his funeral.  \\nShuri hands a gourd to Ramonda and looks deep into the flame.  \\nRAMONDA \\nIf rituals are pointless to you,  \\nwhy does it bother you that she  \\nwasn’t there that day? What is a  \\nfuneral if not a ritual? \\nSHURI \\nBecause that was my brothers’ day.  \\nAnd for some stupid reason rituals  \\nmattered to him. I don’t have time  \\nfor this, Mother. I need to get  \\nback to my lab.  \\nSuddenly, they hear a stirring in the bush. They observe as a  MOTHER ELEPHANT emerges from the brush with her TWO BABIES.  \\nDangerous and majestic, she gently ambles over to the  riverbank with her young in tow.  \\nThe Mother Elephant sprays water from the river onto her  young, bathing them and herself underneath the moonlit night. \\nRamonda and Shuri observe this quiet, almost spiritual  moment.  \\nRAMONDA \\nYou need to sit here with me, and  \\nwith yourself. It’s the only way  \\nyou are going to heal from the  \\nwound T’Challa’s death caused.  \\nSHURI \\nI have healed.  \\n(beat) \\nI wake up every day, and I work on  \\nthings for Wakanda’s future. Even  \\nthough my brother is gone.  \\n(alt) \\nI’m not like I was before. I’m  \\nmoving forward, even though my  \\nbrother is gone.  \\nTan Rev. (02/23/22) 24.\\nTan Rev. (02/23/22) 24. \\nRAMONDA \\nT’Challa is dead. But that doesn’t  \\nmean he is gone. When Thanos took  \\nyou and your brother from me, I had  \\nto lead a wounded nation and a  \\nbroken world. But I still took time  \\nin the bush. I wandered until I  \\nfound water and I sat, then I did  \\nthis ritual that I am about to show  \\nyou now. I found your brother in  \\nthe breeze. Pushing me gently, but  \\nfirm, like his hand on my shoulder.  \\nAnd I found you in the chirp of the  \\nsunbirds. It took some time, but  \\nyou both were there.  \\nSHURI \\nBut that wasn’t us, mother. In the  \\nsnap, everything that we were,  \\nceased to exist. Our presence was a  \\nconstruct of your mind. Brought on  \\nso you could experience comfort, or  \\njoy.  \\nRAMONDA \\nAnd what construct does your mind  \\ncreate when you think of your  \\nbrother?  \\n(beat) \\nDo they offer you comfort? Or  \\ntorment?  \\nShuri thinks on this, moved by her mother’s question. Ramonda  stands up.  \\nRAMONDA (CONT’D) \\nCome, child.  \\nShe leads Shuri back to the fire. She goes to her knapsack  and pulls out a pile of white garments. Shuri stares,  affronted. Ramonda hands a garment to Shuri.  \\nSHURI \\nHow did you get these?  \\nRAMONDA \\nWhat does it matter? \\nSHURI \\nThese are my clothes. How do they  \\nfigure into your ritual?  \\n2nd White Rev. (08/12/22) 24A. \\n2nd White Rev. (08/12/22) 24A.\\nRAMONDA \\nBurning the funeral garments marks * the end of the mourning period.  \\nRamonda casts her clothes into the fire.  \\nRAMONDA (CONT’D) \\nAnd the beginning of a new  \\nrelationship with our loved ones  \\nthat have passed on.  \\nSHURI \\nI was wearing those clothes, the  \\nlast time I held him, mother.  \\n(turns, resolute) \\nI cannot burn them.  \\nShuri... \\nRAMONDA \\n2nd White Rev. (08/12/22) 25.\\n2nd White Rev. (08/12/22) 25. \\nShuri stares off. * \\nSHURI * \\nIt’s not torment I feel. It’s rage. * My brother, who saved me, saved * Wakanda, saved the world. He showed * kindness and grace, even to his * enemies. And for what? For the love * of his life to run off and never * come back? For some illness to take * him before he was old enough to * grow gray hair? An illness. Not * even an enemy in combat. * \\nRAMONDA * \\nAnd that would have been better? * \\nSHURI * \\nYes! Because then I could take my * revenge! I don’t want to sit with * you and think of my brother, * because I fear it won’t be clothes * I will want to burn, it will be the * world and everyone in it. * \\nRamonda looks at Shuri with compassion. * \\nRAMONDA * \\nShuri, there is something I have to * tell you about your brother- * \\nBut then, something in the water startles the Mother Elephant  who rears back and SHRIEKS LOUDLY. She and her children RUN  in the opposite direction as...  \\nShuri and Ramonda perk up. Ramonda stands and walks down  toward the river where the WATER STIRS.  \\nSHURI \\nMother! What are you doing?  \\nShuri runs to Ramonda’s side just as A MAN’S head breaches  the surface of the river and NAMOR rises up, flying over the  surface of the water toward Ramonda and Shuri. He carries a  CONCH SHELL, his winged ankles on full display. \\nSHURI (CONT’D) \\nThis better not be a part of the  \\nritual... \\nIt’s not. \\nRAMONDA \\n2nd White Rev. (08/12/22) 25A. \\n2nd White Rev. (08/12/22) 25A.\\nShuri and Ramonda assume battle stances, traditional spears  extended. \\nRAMONDA (CONT’D) \\nStop! Right there! Who are you?!  \\nAnd how did you get in here?! Speak  \\ntrespasser! \\nNamor smiles and holds his hands up. He looks at Shuri almost  as if they have met before. \\nNAMOR \\nI mean you both no harm. This place  \\nis amazing. The air is pristine.  \\nNot a trace of pollution. \\n(looks back at the water) \\nAnd the water... \\n(beat) \\nMy mother told stories of a place  \\nlike this. A protected land with  \\npeople that never had to leave,  \\nnever had to change who they were.  \\nWhat reason did you have, to reveal  \\nyour secret to the world?  \\nTan Rev. (02/23/22) 26.\\nTan Rev. (02/23/22) 26. \\nRamonda points her spear venomously now. \\nRAMONDA \\nI am not a woman who enjoys  \\nrepeating herself. Who are you?  \\nNAMOR \\nI have many names.  \\nRAMONDA \\nWhich one did your mother give you?  \\nNamor smiles at her bluntness.  \\nNAMOR \\nShe named me Ch’ah Toh Almehen,  \\ncitizens of my realm call me  \\nKu’Kul’Kan, and my enemies call me  \\nNamor.  \\nSHURI \\nWhat kind of name is Namor \\nRAMONDA \\nHush, child. \\n(to Namor) \\nWhy are you here?  \\nNAMOR \\nWe have a problem. The American  \\nmilitary detected Vibranium  \\nembedded beneath my nation’s  \\ndomain. I was able to stop them  \\nfrom mining it, but I need  \\nWakanda’s help to prevent it from  \\nhappening again.  \\nRAMONDA \\nVibranium exists only here, in  \\nWakanda.  \\nNamor offers the queen a questioning glance in response as  Shuri looks closely at Namor’s adornments.  \\nSHURI \\nMother, he’s covered in it. \\nRamonda observes Namor’s VB necklace and earrings. \\nRAMONDA \\nWhere are you from?  \\nNAMOR \\nThe oceans. \\nTan Rev. (02/23/22) 26A.\\nTan Rev. (02/23/22) 26A. \\nShuri jumps in.  \\nSHURI \\nAnd the Americans detected it  \\nthere? How? Detecting vibranium is  \\npractical impossible.  \\nNamor turns to Shuri. \\nNAMOR \\nThey used a machine that we  \\nconfiscated. Did you help them  \\nbuild it? \\nSHURI \\nOf course not.  \\nNAMOR  \\nWe have information that the  \\nmachine was designed by an American  \\nscientist. But we could not find  \\nany record on their identity. I  \\nwould prefer to deal with the  \\nscientist as opposed to waging war  \\non the entire nation.  \\n(beat) \\nI imagine Wakanda has more diverse  \\nmethods of gathering intelligence,  \\nand could find the identity of the  \\nscientist, and bring them to me.  \\nRAMONDA \\nWhy should we help you?  \\nNAMOR \\nYour former King exposed the power  \\nof vibranium to the world. In  \\nresponse other nations have begun  \\nscouring the planet for it. We do  \\nnot wish to be exposed, but your  \\nchoices have compromised us. It is  \\nonly fair that you help resolve our  \\ndilemma. \\nRAMONDA \\nYou don’t sneak into our country  \\nand tell me what is fair. Wakanda  \\nwill look into it if we deem it  \\nnecessary.  \\nNamor smiles at this.  \\nTan Rev. (02/23/22) 27.Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 27. \\nNAMOR \\nI have more soldiers than this land  \\nhas blades of grass. But my only  \\ndesire is that my people remain  \\nhidden from the world. I hope you  \\ncan understand my urgency, because  \\nI would hate to come back under  \\ndifferent circumstances.  \\n(beat) \\nThere is a beautiful island off the  \\ncoast of Madagascar: Nosy Nato. Do  \\nyou know it?  \\nI do.  \\nRAMONDA \\nNamor places the conch on the ground. \\nNAMOR \\nWhen you have the scientist, blow  \\ninto this and place it in the ocean  \\non the north beach. I’ll be there  \\nshortly afterwards.  \\nNamor turns to head back into the river as Ramonda and Shuri  sit with his threat for a moment. He peers back. \\nNAMOR (CONT’D) \\nAnd please for your sake, don’t  \\nmention anything about me to anyone  \\noutside of Wakanda.  \\nNamor eyes Shuri slyly.  \\nPrincess. \\nNAMOR (CONT’D) \\nNamor dives back into the river, DISAPPEARING BENEATH THE WATER.  Shaken, Ramonda and Shuri share looks. \\nSHURI \\nDid you see those things on his  \\nankles?  \\nRAMONDA \\n(impatient) \\nCome on, Shuri. \\nShuri reluctantly starts back for the shelter with Ramonda  only to freeze as sitting by their fire, dripping with water  is the... LARGE VB DETECTOR from the cargo ship. Ramonda and  Shuri gape at it. \\nYellow Rev. (06/28/21) 28.\\nYellow Rev. (06/28/21) 28. \\nRAMONDA (CONT’D) \\nWe must convene the council.  \\n50 INT.

THREE NAVAL OFFICERS are here as well,  contrite. \\nEveryone gives wary looks as M’Baku enters, prepared for his  antics. He doesn’t disappoint.  \\nM’BAKU \\nSo our river border has been  \\nbreached? I once more offer the  \\nsupport of my Jabari Hell screamers. If my soldiers were  \\npresent this... fish man would be  \\nbound before us as we speak.  \\nOKOYE \\nIf you’re soldiers were present  \\nthey’d still be choking on their  \\nfurry costumes.  \\nRAMONDA \\nShow some respect you two.  \\nM’BAKU \\nRespect? They allowed an outsider  \\nto walk directly up to our Queen.  \\nWhat good is Wakanda if we cannot  \\nprotect our borders? These men  \\nshould not show their faces. \\n(to River Tribe Elder) \\nWhy are they guarding the river  \\nanyway? Because they did well in  \\nswimming school? \\nM’Baku points to M’BELE, one of his accompanying warriors.  \\nM’BAKU (CONT’D) \\nTake M’Bele there. He swims with  \\nthe gracefulness of a cinder block,  \\nbut he would die before he allowed  \\na fish man to swim up to our Queen.  \\nYellow Rev. (06/28/21) 28A. Yellow Rev.

(02/23/22) 29. \\nOKOYE \\nThere is no aerial surveillance  \\nfootage of him.  \\nNAVAL OFFICER \\nAnd nothing on radar as well. \\nThe elders look at the officer like he is out of his mind.  \\nRIVER TRIBE ELDER \\nSo he swam underwater for 60 miles.  \\nRAMONDA \\nAnd claims to command a massive  \\narmy.  \\nMERCHANT TRIBE ELDER \\nHe wants us to deliver one American  \\nscientist? So he can kill them.  \\nRAMONDA \\nHe didn’t explicitly state that,  \\nbut I believe that is his  \\nintention.  \\nSo do it. \\nMINING TRIBE ELDER \\n(off the council’s  \\nreactions) \\nWe have never faced an enemy with  \\naccess to Vibranium before, and we  have no Black Panther to protect  \\nus. \\nM’BAKU \\nBecause this wise council allowed  \\nKillmonger to take the throne and  \\nburn up all of your precious Heart Shaped Herb. Ramonda ponders this.  \\nRAMONDA \\nWhat would you have us do?  \\nM’BAKU \\nWe find the fish man and kill him. \\nBORDER TRIBE ELDER \\nWho is being foolish now? You would  have us make war with a man we know  nothing about. At least we have  \\nintelligence on the Americans.  \\nGoldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 30.\\nGoldenrod Rev.

SHURI’S LAB - WAKANDAN DESIGN GROUP - DAY - LATER 51 \\nShuri has the VB DETECTOR in pieces like a mechanic, STUDYING  its parts with deep fascination as Ramonda and Okoye walk in. \\nOkoye observes a hologram of the MIDNIGHT ANGELS prototypes.  Shuri clocks this.  \\nOKOYE \\nPrincess, is it just me, or did  \\nthese things get uglier?  \\nShuri rolls her eyes. \\nSHURI \\nIt’s you. I haven’t touched them  \\nsince the last time you saw them. \\nRamonda studies the vibranium detector. \\nRAMONDA \\nSo, does it work? \\nSHURI \\nYes, I’m still not sure how they  \\ndid it though. It can detect the  \\naltered frequency of vibranium  \\nthrough water, stone, even heavy  \\nmetals.  \\n(beat) \\nWhoever built this is brilliant.  \\nRAMONDA \\nBrilliant, like you? \\nSHURI \\nOf course not. But it’s strange -  \\nthe parts are mismatched. Some are  \\ncustom, others look like they  \\npulled it from a junkyard. \\nRAMONDA \\nHave you ever tried to make one  \\nhere? \\nGoldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 30A.\\nGoldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 30A. \\nSHURI \\nVibranium is all around us. We have  \\nnever needed anything like this.  \\nNecessity breeds invention. \\nOkoye ponders this.  \\nOKOYE \\nI can’t believe it exists outside  \\nof Wakanda. How is that possible?  \\nSHURI \\nPerhaps the meteorite that struck  \\nthe continent, broke apart as it  \\nentered the earth’s atmosphere. The  \\nplanet is mostly covered by water.  \\nIt’s reasonable that some landed  \\nthere.  \\nRAMONDA \\nThis changes everything we know.  \\nOKOYE \\nThe Great Mound. All of the legends  \\nand fables. Those stories are  \\nseared in my mind. \\nSHURI \\nThat sounds very painful. \\nOkoye ignores her. \\nGoldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 31.\\nGoldenrod Rev.

(beat) \\nOKOYE \\nI have an idea, but I’m going to  \\nneed the Princess. \\n(alt) \\nNo, but I have an idea. I’m going  \\nto need the Princess. I have to  \\ndeal with that churlish little  \\nAmerican. She’s good at that. \\nRAMONDA \\nOut of the question. She is in no  \\nstate to be in the field.  \\nOKOYE \\nMy Queen, with all due respect. It  would do her some good to get out.  She has been isolated in this lab  \\nsince it happened. May be just what  May be just what she needs. \\n(beat) \\nBesides, I can handle an American  \\nassignment with my eyes closed.  \\nRAMONDA \\nIt is not the Americans that I am  \\nworried about. \\n(unnerved) \\nThis Namor... he snuck past our  \\ndefenses.  \\nOKOYE \\nIt won’t happen again.  \\nRAMONDA \\nHe wasn’t alone. \\nOkoye thinks on this.  \\nGoldenrod Rev.

It\\'s been\\nthree decades since the deadly\\n\\n\\nevents of Jurassic Park and\\nwe\\'ve yet to find a way for\\n\\n\\nthese animals to live safely\\namong us. After the devastating\\n\\n\\neruption of Isla Nublar\\'s long\\ndormant volcano, those who\\n\\n\\nsurvived were transported to\\nthe mainland. Many of the\\n\\n\\nlarger predators were captured.\\nBut the remaining creatures\\n\\n\\nscattered here in Big Rock\\nNational Park. While most\\n\\n\\nremained in the wild, those who\\nmade their way to civilizations\\n\\n\\nstruggled to adapt to\\nunfamiliar conditions. Look the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nboys have warned the animals\\nare unpredictable and when\\n\\n\\nHungary extremely violent. As\\nthe dinosaurs spread across\\n\\n\\nborders, a global black market\\nhas\\n\\n\\nrisen. To combat the growing\\nthreat of illegal poachers, the\\n\\n\\nUS Congress awards sole\\ncollection rights to the global\\n\\n\\ngiant, Biosom Genetics. At\\nBiosin, we\\'re dedicated to the\\n\\n\\nidea that dinosaurs can teach\\nus more about ourselves. CEO\\n\\n\\nLouis Dodson has created a\\nsanctuary in Italy\\'s Dolomite\\n\\n\\nMountains where he hopes to\\nstudy the dinosaur\\'s ancient\\n\\n\\nimmune systems for unique\\npharmaceutical properties.\\n\\n\\nWhile Biosin believes we can\\nhandle genetic power\\n\\n\\nresponsibly. The public remains\\nskeptical. Some note that these\\n\\n\\ngovernment contracts have led\\nto massive spikes in Biosin\\'s\\n\\n\\nprofits. And rumors persist of\\na human clone who mysteriously\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndisappeared leading to a\\nworldwide search. Some believe\\n\\n\\nshe\\'s genetically identical to\\nCharlotte Lockwood, deceased\\n\\n\\ndaughter of Jurassic Park\\nco-founder Benjamin Lockwood.\\n\\n\\nNow we brought these animals\\nback from extinction, can we\\n\\n\\nface the consequences? Are we\\nresponsible for them or should\\n\\n\\nthey be left to fend for\\nthemselves? As we adapt to an\\n\\n\\never-changing world, we must\\nfind answers to these questions\\n\\n\\nfor their safety as well as for\\nour own.\\n\\n\\nWe are headed inside the\\nillegal breeding facility.

Noah. What are\\nyou burning? Oh nothing just\\n\\n\\nsome old blankets. You sure you\\ndidn\\'t go pass the bridge? I\\n\\n\\nsaid it could give you anything\\nunderlying. What are you? No.\\n\\n\\nMaisie, you\\'re literally\\nlooking everywhere but you. I\\n\\n\\nsaid I didn\\'t go pass the\\nbridge.\\n\\n\\nI know Claire. There are people\\nout there who do anything to\\n\\n\\nfind me. I\\'m not angry. So that\\nmeans you don\\'t have to be\\n\\n\\nangry. I\\'m not angry. I can\\ntake care of myself. Hey, it\\'s\\n\\n\\nokay for us to depend on each\\nother. That\\'s what people do.\\n\\n\\nHow would I know what people\\ndo? The only people I\\'ve spoken\\n\\n\\nto in the past four years are\\nyou both. Besides, I\\'m not even\\n\\n\\nI speak from someone else.\\n\\n\\nYou were the only you who ever\\nwas. What? Who\\'s that? It\\'s\\n\\n\\nlike really cool. That\\'s so\\ncool. Can we keep that between\\n\\n\\nus? Compromise.\\n\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n\\nOh.\\n\\n\\nOh, I like that. Yeah. Okay. Um\\nI\\'m going to Everything okay?\\n\\n\\nShe went into town again.\\n\\n\\nThis kid, did you talk to him?\\nI tried.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll talk to her.\\n\\n\\nWell,\\n\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n\\nTwo,\\n\\n\\nagain.\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\nAmen.\\n\\n\\nAlright. Away from yourself.\\n\\n\\nI would not mess with\\neverything either way.\\n\\n\\nAs a kiddo, we should probably\\ntalk about you going into I\\n\\n\\ndon\\'t think you understand how\\nbad it is being trapped. You\\'re\\n\\n\\nnot trapped here. We just don\\'t\\ntrust people. No, you just\\n\\n\\ndon\\'t trust me and then you\\nexpect me to trust you. Why\\n\\n\\ncan\\'t I have any freedom?\\nBecause you can\\'t.\\n\\n\\nHi\\n\\n\\nWhat is happening? She\\'s 14.\\nYeah. Do you remember what that\\n\\n\\nwas like? I do. We can\\'t keep\\nher here forever. If we don\\'t\\n\\n\\nfigure this out, she\\'s going to\\ngo a lot further from the\\n\\n\\nbridge. They find her when her\\nagain. We gotta protect her.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s our job. That\\'s what\\nwe\\'re going to do. Protect her\\n\\n\\nhow? By locking her inside?\\nShe\\'s got questions. You know,\\n\\n\\nquestions we can\\'t answer. She\\nwants to know who she is.\\n\\n\\nWho Charlotte Lockwood was.\\n\\n\\nDragging grading to his house.\\nRaptors got Judah. Listen to\\n\\n\\nsomething else. I found a girl\\nthat went after.\\n\\n\\nThanks for coming. Wasn\\'t sure\\nwho to call. Missing well, I\\n\\n\\ndidn\\'t even want to say it if\\nthere wasn\\'t a dinosaur. Yeah,\\n\\n\\nwell, they get all the\\nattention. You guys want to\\n\\n\\nbury the same place plots 100\\nyards each? Is this students?\\n\\n\\nYeah, we\\'ve been looking into\\nthe impact of industrial\\n\\n\\nfarming on the environment. So,\\nthis is right up our alley.\\n\\n\\nThey hit 60 fields in the\\ncounty. Is it anything like\\n\\n\\nthis before? No, not like this.\\nThey\\'ve been leaving degraded\\n\\n\\nfields all across the Midwest.\\nFirst these big companies try\\n\\n\\nto kill off all the insects.\\nNow this.\\n\\n\\nIs that your land? That\\'s the\\nBennett\\'s garden. The locust\\n\\n\\ndidn\\'t mean that. You plant the\\nsame seed as the Bennetts? No.\\n\\n\\nWe are independent. They use\\nbiosin seed. Yeah, I bet they\\n\\n\\ndo. You say you caught a live\\none?\\n\\n\\nBecause paleontology is science\\nand science is about the truth\\n\\n\\nand there is truth in these\\nboxes. Red, You\\'re going to\\n\\n\\nwant to see this.\\n\\n\\nAlan Grant, you look the same.\\nIn this place. So you too. I\\'m\\n\\n\\nsorry. I didn\\'t know you were\\ncoming over to\\n\\n\\nCan I get you something a beer?\\nUm, maybe not at 10 AM but iced\\n\\n\\ntea or. Tea, yeah. Tea, I can\\ndo that. Saw a lot of tourists\\n\\n\\non the way in. All the\\nfunding\\'s dried up so\\n\\n\\nsomebody\\'s gotta pay for all\\nthis. I can\\'t.\\n\\n\\nI read your articles about soil\\nscience and regenerative\\n\\n\\nfarming. Can\\'t be grounds for\\nsome hope for change. How are\\n\\n\\nyou kids? Hm. Amazing. Grown.\\nIt\\'s shocking. They\\'re both in\\n\\n\\ncollege. Can you believe that?\\nAnd Mark, It\\'s over. Oh. Oh,\\n\\n\\nI\\'m sorry to hear it. It\\'s\\nokay. I\\'m back to me, my work.\\n\\n\\nYou know, it\\'s. That\\'s great.\\nIt\\'s good. It is. I\\'m alone at\\n\\n\\nlast. Exciting times. Yeah, I\\'m\\nliving the Alan Grant life.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s just. It\\'s going to be\\nlonely. So free.\\n\\n\\nAlly. You didn\\'t come out all\\nthis way just to catch up now,\\n\\n\\ndid you?\\n\\n\\nPlants of locust, mandibles,\\nwings, thorax but god, the size\\n\\n\\nof it is massive. It has genes\\nthat have been extinct since\\n\\n\\nthe cretaceous and swarms of\\nthem are decimating crops from\\n\\n\\nIowa to Texas. Terrifying,\\nright? Started as a few\\n\\n\\nhundred. There could be\\nmillions by the end of the\\n\\n\\nsummer. If they keep going,\\nthere will be no grain to feed\\n\\n\\nchickens, cattle, the entire\\nfood chain would collapse. I\\n\\n\\nwas clearly designed but why\\nwould anyone do that? None of\\n\\n\\nthe crops they\\'re eating are\\nbiosin seed. The biasin. Same\\n\\n\\nbiasing made this. I mean, it\\nwould not shock me that they\\n\\n\\nwant to control the world\\'s\\nfood supply. Up or a few\\n\\n\\nmillion stars. Can\\'t waste that\\nsaying three meals away from\\n\\n\\nanarchy. If we don\\'t stop them,\\nyou can pick your last three\\n\\n\\nmeals. So why are you bringing\\nit to me? I need concrete\\n\\n\\nevidence. Bias is responsible\\nfor all this. I need to go to\\n\\n\\ntheir sanctuary and get DNA\\nfrom another locust there. But\\n\\n\\nI need a witness. Ellen, you\\ncommand respect. People believe\\n\\n\\nyou. Why I\\'m here. It\\'s quiet.\\nI\\'m done with all that. Are you\\n\\n\\nokay? Well, I\\'m sorry. I mean,\\nnobody gets that luxury\\n\\n\\nanymore. Not even you and you\\nknow what? You\\'re the one I\\n\\n\\ntrust.\\n\\n\\nThis bison sanctuary is what? 1\\nhundred miles from anywhere?\\n\\n\\nHow do you even get in there? I\\ngot an invite from their\\n\\n\\nin-house philosopher. Seems\\nthere\\'s a lot of money in being\\n\\n\\na chaotician these days. And he\\njust happened to invite you out\\n\\n\\nof the blue. He said there were\\nthings I\\'d want to see. Uh\\n\\n\\nEvery animal captured on the\\nmainland comes through here\\n\\n\\nbefore shipping out to Bison\\'s\\nsanctuary in the Dolomites. We\\n\\n\\ngive them medical attention and\\nmake sure they live healthy. So\\n\\n\\nmuch security. Those are just\\nthe ones you see. A lot of\\n\\n\\nshady types out there want\\nthese guys. Your plane\\'s just\\n\\n\\nfilling up. Bonnie sends a\\ntough invite. You guys must\\n\\n\\nknow somebody. Do you mind? Of\\ncourse.\\n\\n\\nFollow me. We rescued these\\nguys from the legal breeding\\n\\n\\nfarm in Nevada a few weeks ago.\\nShut the whole place down. Not\\n\\n\\nthis time. Good girl.\\n\\n\\nYou never get used to it. Take\\ncare. Thanks. Bye.\\n\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n\\nYou look just like blue.\\n\\n\\nThis? You want to try it? Okay?\\n\\n\\nWhoo.\\n\\n\\nMacy, don\\'t move.\\n\\n\\nGirl. Staying out of trouble.\\nBaby, that\\'s impossible.\\n\\n\\nShe won\\'t hurt us, right? Oh,\\nyou damn right she will. Just\\n\\n\\nbreathe. If you don\\'t, she\\'ll\\nthink you\\'re scared. I am\\n\\n\\nscared. She doesn\\'t need to\\nknow that.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m Vanessa\\'s gotta be nearby.\\nMaisie, get inside. I\\'m coming\\n\\n\\nwith you. What did I just say?\\n\\n\\nWe gotta move. Not yet. We need\\nthe girl.\\n\\n\\nMaisie. Maisie.\\n\\n\\nOkay. Where are you going? You\\ncan\\'t keep me here under my\\n\\n\\nmother.\\n\\n\\nShe\\'s leaving the house.\\n\\n\\nYou.\\n\\n\\nHey.\\n\\n\\nGreece of\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s go.\\n\\n\\nWho are you?\\n\\n\\nThey found her. What? Who are\\nthey? Walters. I\\'ve seen them\\n\\n\\naround. Leaders are real ****\\ny\\'all. They must have\\n\\n\\nrecognized and followed me\\nhere. Where is she? Go get the\\n\\n\\ntruck.\\n\\n\\nHey. No.\\n\\n\\nThey took her kid too.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m going to get her back. I\\npromise you that.\\n\\n\\nAnd\\n\\n\\nthis year man. What\\'s next?\\nHistorically darkness, blood,\\n\\n\\nraid of fire, I think frogs.\\nWe\\'re not going to be around\\n\\n\\nfor much longer anyway. These\\nlocusts in Nebraska are about\\n\\n\\nto wrap it up. We basically all\\nof our food and our food\\'s\\n\\n\\nfood. So you can say goodbye to\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nFranklin, it\\'s me. Okay, you\\'re\\na bit of a subject of interest\\n\\n\\naround here since I\\'d be\\ntalking to you. Come on, I\\'m in\\n\\n\\ntrouble. I really need your\\nhelp. Please. Yeah, and I could\\n\\n\\nlose my job and you know I\\'m\\nnot qualified to do anything\\n\\n\\nelse. We\\'re outside. Let me\\ntalk to him.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s him. Name\\'s Rain\\nDelacourt. Little piece of\\n\\n\\nwork. What do you think?\\nSomething we care about very\\n\\n\\nmuch. I told you somebody would\\ncome looking for her. You can\\'t\\n\\n\\njust take a person, Claire. I\\nhad no choice. Not in the eyes\\n\\n\\nof the law. This guy is not the\\nlaw. Tell us how to find him.\\n\\n\\nWhere\\'d you guys call me from?\\nWe have a minute on the inside\\n\\n\\nof Dela Court\\'s operation.\\nThere\\'s an exchange in Malta\\n\\n\\nsometime tomorrow, cash for\\ncargo. There\\'s no mention but\\n\\n\\nwe have people on the ground\\nalready. One of them you know a\\n\\n\\nlot of us got recruited by the\\nCIA after Very stretchy toe\\n\\n\\nloop stone. I need to talk to\\nhim. We can\\'t just call him.\\n\\n\\nHe\\'s deep cover. Look, once we\\nmake the bus to Malta, our guys\\n\\n\\nwill see Delacore knows where\\nshe is. Our guys, not you.\\n\\n\\nPromise me you will go in there\\nwith your vest and mess\\n\\n\\neverything up. Why would I do\\nthat? You guys are both crazy\\n\\n\\nbut you seem like you\\'re good\\nparents or whatever you\\'re\\n\\n\\ntrying to be. Just lucky to\\nhave you. Don\\'t get killed,\\n\\n\\nokay?\\n\\n\\nThink we\\'re almost there. Yeah.\\n\\n\\nDoctor Santler, Doctor Grant,\\nRamsey Cole, Communications.\\n\\n\\nOh, thank you. Uh, I have to\\nwarn you, everyone\\'s so excited\\n\\n\\nto have you. You guys are\\nabsolute legends around here.\\n\\n\\nHm, you must be confusing us\\nwith somebody else. You know,\\n\\n\\nit\\'s great that you guys are\\nstill so close to Doctor\\n\\n\\nMalcolm. I mean, sometimes you\\nmeet your heroes and they\\n\\n\\ndisappoint you but he\\'s exactly\\nthe way you\\'d want him to be. I\\n\\n\\nmean, such fertility of\\nthought, it\\'s incredible. Which\\n\\n\\ntime he has found with it? Uh\\nwell I know that was sarcastic\\n\\n\\nbut honestly not enough. Oh\\nplease have to wash your head.\\n\\n\\nSo Bison bought this land for\\nthe amb deposits back in the\\n\\n\\n90s, but we\\'ve managed to turn\\ninto a safe haven for about 20\\n\\n\\ndisplaced species. First\\ngeneration came from Sorna.\\n\\n\\nMost of new bar dinosaurs are\\nhere too. Took fish and\\n\\n\\nwildlife three years to catch\\nthe T-rex. But the T-rex is\\n\\n\\nhere. Oh yeah. Yeah. Just\\nbefore you guys.\\n\\n\\nRestricted airspace. Protects\\nthe airborne life. Keeps the\\n\\n\\nterror source below 5 million\\nfeet. Airborne.\\n\\n\\nDead Broadus.\\n\\n\\nBeautiful, right? Her name\\nmeans fear nothing. You know\\n\\n\\nthat. What did they graze on?\\nHawthorn and firm. All\\n\\n\\nindigenous. Nothing stocked\\nexcept for the deer\\n\\n\\npopulations. Great mesening\\nspecies for the apex predator.\\n\\n\\nHoly apex predator.\\nPiganosaurus. At least for now.\\n\\n\\nUm, you don\\'t let people in\\nthere. Our our research, our\\n\\n\\nresearch office are connected\\ncompletely underground. If we\\n\\n\\nhave to, we could just bird the\\nanimals remotely using neuro\\n\\n\\nimplant that sends electrical\\nsignals directly to the brain.\\n\\n\\nLike shocked. Uh no, like like\\nsignals. Strike you is a little\\n\\n\\nbit for a little cruel. Do you\\nknow how much voltage is in the\\n\\n\\nelectric fences at Jurassic\\nPark?\\n\\n\\nDoctor Ian Dominion New from\\nthe lecture hall for the ethics\\n\\n\\nof Genetic Ocala. God it must\\nserve the honor. Oh well it is\\n\\n\\npart of our ethos attract the\\nbest and brightest. Doctors.\\n\\n\\nRespected. Renowned. Doctor\\nSattler. Doctor Grant. I\\'m well\\n\\n\\nthis is big. I\\'m I\\'m Lewis.\\nDodson. Yeah. Hi. You\\'re Louis\\n\\n\\nDutch and how do you do? We\\ndidn\\'t expect to actually see\\n\\n\\nyou here. Oh well. I wouldn\\'t\\nbe anywhere else. I mean the\\n\\n\\npeople you see here who are\\nchanging the world. Would you\\n\\n\\nmind if we just it would mean a\\nlot. Yeah. One, two, one, Oh,\\n\\n\\ngreat. Thank you so much. Oh,\\nThat\\'s good. That\\'s good fun.\\n\\n\\nSo you are going to see some\\nremarkable things today. We are\\n\\n\\nunlocking the true power of the\\ngenome or this close we\\'d be.\\n\\n\\nWe could fortune with that. No,\\nit\\'s not about money. No, we\\'ve\\n\\n\\nalready identified dozens of\\napplications for pamio DNA\\n\\n\\nWe will be saving lives. Um\\nanyway, I wish I could take you\\n\\n\\naround myself but it\\'s so\\nyou\\'re in more than capable\\n\\n\\nhands with Ramsey. He\\'s\\nbasically a young me. Only\\n\\n\\nDo you have food? Like one of\\nmy bars? Pardon? Um no never\\n\\n\\nmind. I\\'ll I\\'ll find something.\\nSo I want to do more of this\\n\\n\\nlater on if we oh we booked you\\na private pod for the trip out.\\n\\n\\nSo it\\'s beautiful. We love it\\nthrough the caverns and\\n\\n\\neverything. Uh you better\\nhurry. Malcolm\\'s on it. He\\'s a\\n\\n\\nbit of a contrarian but I like\\nhim. He keeps us on our toes.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, thank you for being\\nhere. It\\'s\\n\\n\\nOkay, follow me please.\\n\\n\\nHuman beings have no more right\\nto safety or liberty than any\\n\\n\\nother creature on this planet\\nWe not only lack dominion over\\n\\n\\nnature, we\\'re supportive to it.\\nNow, here we are with the\\n\\n\\nopportunity to rewrite life at\\nour fingertips and just like\\n\\n\\nnuclear power. Nobody knew what\\nto expect with genetic\\n\\n\\nengineering but they pressed\\nthe button and hoped for the\\n\\n\\nbest just like you are doing\\nnow. Yep,\\n\\n\\ncontrol the future of our\\nsurvival on planet Earth.\\n\\n\\nAccording to you the solution\\nis genetic power. But that same\\n\\n\\npower could devastate the food\\nsupply. Create new diseases\\n\\n\\nalter the climate even further.\\nUnforeseen consequences occur.\\n\\n\\nAnd every time, every single\\ntime We all act surprised\\n\\n\\nbecause deep down, I don\\'t\\nthink that any of us actually\\n\\n\\nbelieve that these dangers are\\nreal.\\n\\n\\nIn order to instigate\\nrevolutionary change, we must\\n\\n\\nTransform human consciousness.\\n\\n\\nVery good. There there you go.\\nHey, I don\\'t want to be rude\\n\\n\\nabout friends. Thank you. Catch\\nme on my way out. Thanks\\n\\n\\neverybody. Look at you. Look at\\nme. Oh, look at you.

He slid into my DMs. You\\n\\n\\nknow what? It\\'s urgently.\\nWhat\\'d you do? 7 minutes to\\n\\n\\nmidnight still. Uh the doomsday\\nclock might be about out of\\n\\n\\ntime but as they say it\\'s\\nalways darkest just before\\n\\n\\neternal nothingness. What?\\nLocusts altered with credaceous\\n\\n\\nera DNA. Yeah, that\\'s not my\\nfield. Yeah, but these things\\n\\n\\ncontinue to multiply. We\\'re\\ntalking about gasoline system\\n\\n\\nwide effects in. Gosh, that\\'s a\\ndrag. This dragon matter with\\n\\n\\nyou. Fine, is there something\\nspecial we\\'re going to do? Give\\n\\n\\nit to us not to care. Hey, I I\\ngave my opinion robustly for\\n\\n\\nyears as expected to some part\\neven the difference led to our\\n\\n\\nannihilation and the only play\\nnow is to take the time we have\\n\\n\\nleft and you know, just let go\\nto a squadron. Honestly, Ian,\\n\\n\\nthat\\'s **** Can I offer you\\nguys some Joe? Uh Tyler,\\n\\n\\nplease, two cappuccinos? I\\ndon\\'t want a cappuccino. Trust\\n\\n\\nme, it\\'s real tough that jet\\nlag is going to park you right\\n\\n\\nup.\\n\\n\\n6 weeks\\n\\n\\nago. I was not raising my\\nvoice. And\\n\\n\\nall my models are pointing\\ntoward a global down the\\n\\n\\nstairs. It\\'s about six. That\\'s\\nwhere they keep the locusts.\\n\\n\\nHey, this looks so silky. May I\\ntouch the spice? You know what\\n\\n\\nit is? Don\\'t talk the wrong\\ntone. This is sustainable\\n\\n\\nbamboo. It is sustainable\\nbamboo spice. You know that.\\n\\n\\nYeah. I\\'ve got cumin. It\\'s very\\ncinnamon. I\\'ve got all spice\\n\\n\\nwhich is not very popular. I\\'ve\\ngot five spices. I\\'m from the\\n\\n\\nfield. Yeah. There\\'s still\\nmilks. Okay. Soy milk. Yes. It\\n\\n\\njust happened.\\n\\n\\nSeven level six, restricted.\\n\\n\\nLouis, you\\'re not listening to\\nme. The Lucas prehistoric DNA\\n\\n\\nhas made them stronger than\\nthey should be. They\\'re\\n\\n\\nmultiplying like crazy and\\nthey\\'re not dying. What part of\\n\\n\\nthis, don\\'t you understand? Oh,\\nI do understand. This is\\n\\n\\ngoing to be a global family.\\nHey, hey, we can\\'t anticipate\\n\\n\\neverything. We need to\\neradicate the ones we released.\\n\\n\\nWhat? All of them. No. No.\\nHenry. Like yesterday. We don\\'t\\n\\n\\nwant to cause a panic. We want\\ncontrol. There\\'s no such thing.\\n\\n\\nWhen we\\'re afraid, what do we\\ndo?

You\\n\\n\\nunderstand the value of these\\ncreatures? You always have. I\\n\\n\\ndo too. And we don\\'t stop\\nbecause of what? Little side\\n\\n\\nproject went south. If they\\ntrace the locusts back to us,\\n\\n\\nthey come from the dinosaurs.\\nAll your work, gone. Billions\\n\\n\\nof dollars in assets, gone.\\nDiamonds with noone to mind\\n\\n\\nthem. You really think she\\'s\\nthe solution?\\n\\n\\nOkay. Everything involved in\\nthe girl goes through me,\\n\\n\\nright? Is she alright? She\\nbetter be. Most valuable\\n\\n\\nintellectual property on the\\nplanet.\\n\\n\\nI said I\\'d call you. They\\ndidn\\'t end yet? Second plane is\\n\\n\\nincoming. You said anything\\nabout a second plane. We flew\\n\\n\\nthem separately. I\\'m not taking\\nany chances. And we\\'ll need\\n\\n\\npayments before delivery. I\\ndidn\\'t like what happened last\\n\\n\\ntime. Okay, okay.

We\\'ve brought back\\n\\n\\nnumerous species into purest\\nform and I mean complete\\n\\n\\nuntouched genives. Like Morris\\nand Tripodus. What?\\n\\n\\nWhat about splicing DNA? You\\nknow, creating new species. No,\\n\\n\\nDoctor Satlin, we don\\'t do that\\nhere. We like to think we\\'re\\n\\n\\nmore involved.\\n\\n\\nOkay, it looks like we still\\nhave some time left before you\\n\\n\\narrive. Uh would you guys like\\nto try the facilities\\n\\n\\nyourselves? Oh,\\n\\n\\nYeah, why not? Great. I\\'ll meet\\nyou guys at the Hyperloop\\n\\n\\nStation three in about 30\\nminutes. Elevators are down\\n\\n\\nthis hall, not not those. Those\\nlead you down to the sub\\n\\n\\nlevels. Need special clearance\\nto get down there? Okay. 30\\n\\n\\nminutes.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m really sorry that it hadn\\'t\\nhappened this way. Yep, that\\'s\\n\\n\\nwhat kidnappers say. Claire\\nshould never have hidden you\\n\\n\\naway. You\\'re way too important,\\nMaisie.\\n\\n\\nYou took her too.\\n\\n\\nWe needed her to help us\\nunderstand you.\\n\\n\\nHey, Veda. You okay? Did you\\nsay Beta? Is that her name?\\n\\n\\nGenetically identical and\\nthat\\'s what they have in common\\n\\n\\nand if you and. Charlotte.\\n\\n\\nWhat do you know about\\nCharlotte? She died. A long\\n\\n\\ntime ago. It broke my grandpa\\'s\\nheart. So he made me No,\\n\\n\\nMaisie. Actually, he didn\\'t.\\nCharlotte made you.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m so excited for everyone to\\nsee what we\\'ve been doing here.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s new technology being\\nmade, new science like every\\n\\n\\nday almost and it\\'s great to\\nbe, it\\'s great to be in the\\n\\n\\ncenter, center of that.\\nCharlotte lived on site B with\\n\\n\\nall of us till the storm. Loved\\ndinosaurs. Charlotte, be\\n\\n\\ncareful. Yeah, I will. She grew\\nup around scientists and\\n\\n\\neventually, She became one\\nherself. A butterfly flew into\\n\\n\\nmy office this morning. They\\nsay tiny things have huge\\n\\n\\nimpacts and I agree\\nwholeheartedly. She was\\n\\n\\nbrilliant. Support my mom. In\\nways that I\\'ll never be. In the\\n\\n\\nmetaphysics of identity, can a\\nreplica truly be the original?\\n\\n\\nAnd if it\\'s possible,\\n\\n\\nlost my pen.\\n\\n\\nIs that me? Yeah. Just like\\nBlue, Charlotte was able to\\n\\n\\nhave a child all by herself.\\nShe created you with her own\\n\\n\\nDNA. So, I do have a mother.\\nYour grandfather didn\\'t want\\n\\n\\nanyone to know the truth. He\\nwas protecting her and you. And\\n\\n\\nwe\\'re the same. It were. When\\nyou were a baby, Charlotte\\n\\n\\nstarted to show symptoms of a\\ngenetic disorder. That\\'s how\\n\\n\\nshe died. She didn\\'t know she\\nhad it until after you were\\n\\n\\nborn. Do I have it too? No. To\\nchange\\n\\n\\nNo one on earth has ever known\\nhow to do that. She said\\n\\n\\nCharlotte\\'s discovery is a part\\nof you now. Your DNA could\\n\\n\\nchange the world. To know how\\nshe did it but I just can\\'t\\n\\n\\nreplicate her work if I could\\njust study you. And Beta whose\\n\\n\\nDNA was never changed. I could\\nfix a terrible mistake that\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve made. What kind of\\nmistake?\\n\\n\\nRestricted.\\n\\n\\nThanks for coming. I Which left\\nthem say?\\n\\n\\nGet the sample and get and off\\nso well, they can swarm at the\\n\\n\\nslightest disturbance.\\n\\n\\nIs that necessary? What did you\\nthink was going to happen? I\\n\\n\\nhave to take the sample. Need\\nconcrete evidence. This is it.\\n\\n\\nAllen, you said there was no\\ntime. Hit you, Kenneth. For a\\n\\n\\nsecond, Jared.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s sound signal in between\\nmy open the screen.\\n\\n\\nHow does she remain in an\\nasset, Henry, if you\\'re\\n\\n\\nincriminating both of us by\\nshowing her classified things\\n\\n\\non the computer. Jurassic Park\\nfor cure disease. She was\\n\\n\\nright. Having filled the gaps\\nin Maisie\\'s genome with altered\\n\\n\\nDNA, she used a pathogen to\\ndeliver the repaired sequence\\n\\n\\nto every cell. Here I can\\nrepurpose what she did, I could\\n\\n\\nchange Melody\\'s DNA,\\neradicating them in a single\\n\\n\\ngeneration. Maisy and the baby\\nraptor will provide the missing\\n\\n\\ndata.\\n\\n\\nHey, do you want to get out of\\nhere? You.\\n\\n\\nAmazing.\\n\\n\\nAsset containment breach,\\nplease remain at your stations.\\n\\n\\nAsset containment breach.\\nPlease remain at your stations.\\n\\n\\nNothing.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re Doctor Ellie Satler and\\nyou are a trusted pal. What\\n\\n\\nwhat are you doing here? What\\nare you doing here? I\\'m Mitty\\n\\n\\nLockwood. My grandpa, Neutron\\nHanland.\\n\\n\\nWe don\\'t we\\'re not we don\\'t\\nwork for bias. I can tell.\\n\\n\\nYeah, we should go.\\n\\n\\nOkay. In and out. You find your\\ngirl and go. Tower, this is N\\n\\n\\none four one. Request the land\\nfor free delivery. Over. Uh N\\n\\n\\none four one negative. We\\'ve\\nbeen advised you\\'re carrying an\\n\\n\\nauthorized passengers over.\\nCopy that tower. Be advised.\\n\\n\\nShipment is perishable. We need\\nimmediate clearance. In order\\n\\n\\nto be over. No. Uh negative.\\nReturn to point of origin. Uh\\n\\n\\nyou think I need breaking up?\\nAre are you hearing me on your\\n\\n\\nside? Nice try Kayla. They\\nDaniel Bird. Who is this? Is\\n\\n\\nthis Denise? You do not want me\\nto stop spelling sneakers\\n\\n\\nDenise. You remember the broad\\nname.\\n\\n\\nDenise, in accounts.\\n\\n\\nTalk to Santos. It\\'s the girl\\'s\\nparents.\\n\\n\\nShut off the ADS.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s the that\\'s the aerial\\ndeterrent system. Why is it\\n\\n\\nblinking? Because dead ****\\nDenise retired. Just turn it\\n\\n\\noff. We gotta get out of this\\nairspace right now.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s going to play, right? Not\\nexactly.\\n\\n\\nShould\\'ve stayed there.\\n\\n\\nOkay. Okay. It\\'s cool. We\\'re\\ngood. It\\'s gone.\\n\\n\\nWe gotta get you off this\\nplate. What? Parachute is\\n\\n\\ngoing to open automatically. If\\nit doesn\\'t, you pull this\\n\\n\\nlever. Do you understand me? If\\nit doesn\\'t open automatically,\\n\\n\\nyou\\'re going to pull this lever\\nhere. Seat. Hey, your loader\\'s\\n\\n\\ngotta go get you. Get her mom.\\nGet her only shot.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll see you again.\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s the plan?\\n\\n\\nThree. We need the code.\\n\\n\\nWatch out.\\n\\n\\nThis place is such a maze. We\\nwere so confused, right? I\\n\\n\\nthought we were straight of\\nloss and you said station\\n\\n\\nthree. Do you have a sample?\\nWhat? What are you talking\\n\\n\\nabout? The DNA sample. Do you\\nhave it? Bias is responsible\\n\\n\\nfor the locust epidemic.\\nDoction\\'s covering it up. You\\n\\n\\nwere right. I\\'m I\\'m here to\\nhelp you. Do you have it?\\n\\n\\nThis pod will take you straight\\nto the airfield. We have a\\n\\n\\nplane ready to fly. Ian told\\nyou about Axon allies? No, I\\n\\n\\ntold him.\\n\\n\\nGuys, gotta go. Wait.\\n\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n\\nJosh.\\n\\n\\nThis\\n\\n\\nAmen.\\n\\n\\nThat was my baby.\\n\\n\\nWhere\\'d you learn to fly? Uh\\nAir Force. Legacy on my mama\\'s\\n\\n\\nside. Yeah. I\\'m So how\\'d you\\nend up doing this? I was a\\n\\n\\nlegit contract pilot for a bit\\nbut didn\\'t exactly pay not to\\n\\n\\nbe out here sending money home\\nso I had a few contacts for the\\n\\n\\nmore lucrative shady show.\\nHonestly, I might be done with\\n\\n\\nthis line. What? Is that why\\nyou\\'re helping us?\\n\\n\\nI was there when they handed\\nyour girl off the bias. Could\\n\\n\\nhave said something but I did\\nit. And when I saw a picture It\\n\\n\\nisn\\'t enough to do nothing.\\n\\n\\nWhoo.\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\nNope.\\n\\n\\nWhat an ****\\n\\n\\nHey.\\n\\n\\nAh.\\n\\n\\nYou good?\\n\\n\\nYep.\\n\\n\\nThe joy should see beacon.\\nWe\\'ll find her. Really love\\n\\n\\nhim, huh?\\n\\n\\nI like red hats too. But can\\'t.\\n\\n\\nDisaster live we were tracking\\nan escaped asset. The guys\\n\\n\\nmissed it. Been stolen to the\\nnext angle.

One of our cameras\\n\\n\\nsaw Ian Malcolm hit something\\nin Satner\\'s pocket.\\n\\n\\nAnd get Ramsey up here too with\\nWhere are they now? On the way\\n\\n\\nto New Yearfield. They called\\nthe hype loop broad on\\n\\n\\nschedule.\\n\\n\\nHow are you? You alright? Not\\nreally no.\\n\\n\\nFew years after Hammond died\\nShe came to my university to\\n\\n\\nlecture and We became good\\nfriends. What was she like?\\n\\n\\nBrilliant, light years ahead of\\neverybody else. She had a\\n\\n\\nconscience. While they were out\\nbuilding theme parks, well, she\\n\\n\\nwas determined to prove that\\ngenetic power could save lives.\\n\\n\\nThat was our experiment.\\n\\n\\nIf you wanted a child more than\\nanything, she wanted you to\\n\\n\\nhave but she couldn\\'t. And fall\\naway.\\n\\n\\nAnd I\\'m never alone.\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s happening?\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s supposed to be the old\\napermines. They must have made\\n\\n\\naccess to us when they built\\nthese tunnels.\\n\\n\\nHey. I heard the alarm.\\nEverything alright? Yeah. No.\\n\\n\\nNo. Listen. We can\\'t handle\\nlisten. You\\'re right? Uh good.\\n\\n\\nDoctor Malcolm, you are What?\\nIt was such a cushion gig and\\n\\n\\ngive your access key to\\nsecurity if you still have it.\\n\\n\\nThe hypolepods are shut down at\\nAmber Mike\\'s. What? Wow. This\\n\\n\\nday. Uh which which pod are we\\nare there? Um dinosaurs in our\\n\\n\\nminds? Merit dinosaurs\\neverywhere. I mean, you know,\\n\\n\\ntechnically birds are dinosaurs\\ngenetically speaking. Okay,\\n\\n\\nLouis. Grant Santler in this\\npub, we need to send a security\\n\\n\\nteam out there. Absolutely,\\nRamsey. Thank you. Uh let\\'s all\\n\\n\\njust stay in our lanes though.\\nWe can take care of it. Thank\\n\\n\\nyou, doctor. That\\'s it, huh?\\nNothing else to see here. I\\'m\\n\\n\\nnot sure I admire your tone\\nright now. You need to leave.\\n\\n\\nYeah, I do. But first, I owe\\nall these folks an apology. I\\n\\n\\nthink that by lending my cachet\\nto this joint. I admit it may\\n\\n\\nit seem as if by and wasn\\'t\\nrotten to the core. That\\'s\\n\\n\\nenough, Ian. See, here\\'s how\\nthey get it. They give you so\\n\\n\\nmany promotions in a short\\nperiod of time that bludgeons\\n\\n\\nyour capacity for critical\\nthinking. Oh my god. So then\\n\\n\\nthere are doors that you don\\'t\\nopen things that you ignore but\\n\\n\\nmainly he\\'s exploiting your\\nenchantment with these. Is\\n\\n\\nthere an actual concern here or\\nyou just. You\\'re racing toward\\n\\n\\nthe extinction of our species\\nand you don\\'t care. You know\\n\\n\\nexactly what you\\'re doing but\\nyou won\\'t stop. You You know, I\\n\\n\\nthought you might be different\\nbut you\\'re just like everyone\\n\\n\\nelse. You see what you want to\\nsee. You imagine unchecked\\n\\n\\nEverest. So, that\\'s what you\\nfind. You envision what? An\\n\\n\\nevil onbound Prometheus so\\nthat\\'s what I am to you.\\n\\n\\nPrometheus got gored. So will\\nyou. You rapacious rat bastard.\\n\\n\\nRamsey, you helped Doctor\\nMalcolm gather his things? His\\n\\n\\nroom and then to the airfield.\\nThat\\'s it.\\n\\n\\nKick.\\n\\n\\nAnother source.

It\\'s an air\\ncrew. Must be another thing\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve had. Oh, this is my mimic.\\nJust breathe. Just watch out\\n\\n\\nfor bats. Say anything about\\nbats. Well, there\\'s probably no\\n\\n\\nbats. No falling rocks.\\nDispossibility of toxic gas,\\n\\n\\ndehydration, hypothermia,\\ndispossibilities, nothing for\\n\\n\\ncertain. I should have left you\\neverywhere. Why did I bring him\\n\\n\\ninto this? You were happy in\\nyour element. What? I wasn\\'t\\n\\n\\nhappy. Do you guys have kids?\\nWhat? Uh no, I I do too but no\\n\\n\\npen.\\n\\n\\nNo? No?\\n\\n\\nJust old friends.\\n\\n\\nWon\\'t be long before security\\nknows you\\'re gone. Oh, map.\\n\\n\\nLooks like an old map. You want\\na new map? There\\'s an access\\n\\n\\ngate at the northeast corner of\\nthe mine. If your friends make\\n\\n\\nit out to you, when they make\\nit out. Yes, sir. That\\'s where\\n\\n\\nthey\\'ll be. These roads are\\nprotected, right? Uh yeah, I\\n\\n\\ndrive fast.\\n\\n\\nYou did good. Yeah. Well,\\nactually it\\'s a complete\\n\\n\\ndisaster but thanks.

Come on.\\nLet\\'s go.\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\n\\nGrandma.\\n\\n\\nGo on. Yuck.\\n\\n\\nI made\\n\\n\\nI better get inside.\\n\\n\\nGo ahead.\\n\\n\\nGonna need something heavy,\\nsomething sharp, or both.\\n\\n\\nHe\\'s putting the evidence.\\n\\n\\nBananas.\\n\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n\\nI know.

Yeah.\\n\\n\\nStop.\\n\\n\\nYeah, I never. We\\'re fine.\\nSerious? Is it fun?\\n\\n\\nI was there for you.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s my parents.\\n\\n\\nTo\\n\\n\\nI remember hearing Remember you\\ntoo.\\n\\n\\nThey hope you escape.\\n\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n\\nWe gotta go.

Doctor\\n\\n\\nSegler, get some water. Doctor\\nGrant. You are? I\\'m I\\'m Owen\\n\\n\\nGrady, big fan. I read your\\nbook. Well, book on tape. Owen\\n\\n\\nGrady. Owen Grady, I know who\\nyou are. You trade raptors.\\n\\n\\nYeah. I tried. Yeah. How you\\ndoing? You you\\'re a Jurassic\\n\\n\\nWorld. Jurassic World? Not a\\nfan and Okay. So, we good to\\n\\n\\nfind a way out of here? Yep.\\nLet\\'s get it. There\\'s a\\n\\n\\nhelicopter out in the main\\ncomplex. We turn the ADS back\\n\\n\\non, we go home. Wait, what\\'s an\\nADS? Aerodyterrant system. You\\n\\n\\nknow, for the pterodactyls and\\n**** Keeps them away from the\\n\\n\\nhelicopters. Well, how do we\\nturn it back home? Okay, it\\n\\n\\nlooks like all the systems run\\nthrough to the control room\\n\\n\\nwhich is on the third floor.\\nYeah.\\n\\n\\nEasy rainbow.\\n\\n\\nWow or what happens? You just\\ntell them what to do and they\\n\\n\\nthey comply or human animal\\nbond based on ritual respect.\\n\\n\\nHad a dog once helped my legs\\nso much.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s a true starter.\\n\\n\\nAh, Kyle. Hey, good. Here\\'s\\nwhat I\\'m thinking. We get\\n\\n\\nstarted again. You and me. I\\ncan get money. Yeah. Money\\'s\\n\\n\\ncheap these days. What what\\'s\\nthe matter? Don\\'t look so\\n\\n\\nworried. Just there\\'s\\nopportunity in everything\\n\\n\\nPeach. Even this. You you\\'ll\\nearn that. I\\'ve been thinking\\n\\n\\nmaybe you take more of the lead\\nnow. Okay? You ready I think?\\n\\n\\nWhat the hell is the matter\\nwith you?\\n\\n\\nIt was you. You told Malcolm\\nabout the program. You you you\\n\\n\\nset this whole thing up. You\\nset me up. I gave you every\\n\\n\\nopportunity I did not have. We\\nhave an understanding, Ramsey\\n\\n\\nand you do not break that.\\n\\n\\nI would not break this.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not new.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s very bad. This is the same\\nsystem we used at the park.\\n\\n\\nGreat. So we can turn on the\\nthe thing and then we all get\\n\\n\\nEDS? What\\'s this? What what\\'s\\nerror 99? Not enough power.\\n\\n\\nGonna break down all available\\npower to see us by the primary\\n\\n\\nsystem to keep running. We need\\nall that power to reactivate\\n\\n\\nthe EDS. So the system\\'s safety\\nfeatures what\\'s going to catch?\\n\\n\\nCool. Of course. How do we get\\nmore power? Uh well we can\\'t\\n\\n\\nbut we can\\'t redistribute what\\nwe have. We just just need to.\\n\\n\\nShut down the primary system.\\nYes exactly. Where is it? Uh\\n\\n\\nnext floor up. I\\'ll call you\\nwith you. We escaped on him.\\n\\n\\nWhere is that? Water shoot you\\nsir. How\\'d your electric system\\n\\n\\nsub eight? Give me eight\\nminutes I can find her. Wait.\\n\\n\\nWho\\'s this now? Beta. Beneath\\nbaby. Velociraptor. What? A\\n\\n\\nbaby raptor? And you gave her a\\nname. How about that? I made a\\n\\n\\npromise when you burn home. You\\nmade a promise to a dinosaur.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re home with us right?\\nThanks again. Please.\\n\\n\\nBe on channel five, okay? Run\\nthree. Come back. But I always\\n\\n\\ncome back. I\\'ll have that\\nchopper hot tint wait for my\\n\\n\\nsignal. Evacuation place for a\\nseat. Assets now containment\\n\\n\\nStill get night gears all the\\ntime.\\n\\n\\nWe hold on to regret and we\\nstay in the past.\\n\\n\\nWhat matters I guess is is what\\nwe do now.\\n\\n\\nNobody except her be backs. B\\n4, she\\'s in here. Watch the\\n\\n\\ncharge. Come from the sides.\\nAnd at first we thought They\\n\\n\\ndisembow their prey but no,\\nthey\\'re smart enough to go\\n\\n\\nstraight to the throat. The\\narteries. It\\'s not supposed at\\n\\n\\nthe same time. Okay.\\n\\n\\nWe\\'ve got you. It\\'s right down\\nthat aisle. It\\'s right down\\n\\n\\nthat aisle where you are. Why\\nare they scooping into this?\\n\\n\\nYou can sprint right for it.\\nHere it is. Okay, so it\\'ll be a\\n\\n\\nyellow button and the grid is\\nsix. There\\'s a green button. Do\\n\\n\\nyou see a green button? It\\'s\\nnot that green button that\\'s\\n\\n\\nformed. Four from the bottom.\\nFourth one up. Third one down\\n\\n\\nor fourth one up. Same thing.\\nIan, be specific.\\n\\n\\nShe was here. Lights off.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know how I could\\npossibly be more specific other\\n\\n\\nthan to say that the one you\\nwant is marked with E one. E\\n\\n\\none. Any more?\\n\\n\\nNo. No. No. No. No.\\n\\n\\nEyes on me.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve got a hitter on the side\\nof the neck. Maisie, you\\'re\\n\\n\\ngoing to hold her focus? Grant\\nI\\'m trying you later.\\n\\n\\nSorry girl. I promised your mom\\nI\\'d get you home. Perfect\\n\\n\\nsystem.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s rebooting. No, I shouldn\\'t\\nbe doing that.\\n\\n\\nWe\\'re going to make it work.\\nWe\\'re going to figure this out.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s very complex.

Victory.\\n\\n\\nDo you feel good?\\n\\n\\nPower.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s\\n\\n\\nShh. What\\'s your story?\\n\\n\\nWe\\'re dedicated to the idea\\nthat dinosaurs can teach us\\n\\n\\nmore about ourselves.\\n\\n\\nAlright, Kila. We\\'re good to\\ngo.\\n\\n\\nOkay, cutie.\\n\\n\\nHey.\\n\\n\\nPlease, you have to listen to\\nme. You created an ecological\\n\\n\\ndisaster and I can fix it.\\nCharlotte Lock would change\\n\\n\\nevery cell at Macy\\'s body. It\\nsaved her life. If I can\\n\\n\\nunderstand how Charlotte\\nrewrote Macy\\'s DNA, I can\\n\\n\\nspread change from one locust\\nto the entire swarm before it\\'s\\n\\n\\ntoo late. It\\'s okay. It\\'s okay.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s what she would\\'ve wanted.\\n\\n\\nNo, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.\\nHim, not him, not him, it\\'s\\n\\n\\nalways him. Every is that a\\ndinosaur on your shoulder?\\n\\n\\nMeet me in the center.\\n\\n\\nLanding here. I\\'ll have a\\nchoice, dude. The valley is\\n\\n\\ninsane. They\\'re not in the\\nvalley anymore.

Systemic\\ncorruption.\\n\\n\\nNo, and then and then we\\ncrashed into this ice thing,\\n\\n\\nright? I mean, they literally\\nowe me a plane. I need to get\\n\\n\\nthis sample better to laugh or\\nI take into my contact at the\\n\\n\\ntimes. You could come with me.\\nUnless you need to get back to\\n\\n\\nyour dig.\\n\\n\\nEllie? Yeah. I am coming with\\nyou.\\n\\n\\nKnow. Mark will win it then\\nwe\\'ll send you home with your\\n\\n\\nfolks.\\n\\n\\nToday marks the first day of\\ntestimony from Bios and\\n\\n\\nwhistleblower Ramsey Cole. The\\nSenate will also hear from\\n\\n\\ndoctors Grant, Sattler, and\\nMalcolm who have been vocal in\\n\\n\\nthis debate since the incident\\nat Jurassic Park.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m trustworthy.\\n\\n\\nYeah. Not getting used to it.\\nLet\\'s finish this. Yeah.\\n\\n\\nDoctor Henry Wu has found an\\nemergency solution to the\\n\\n\\necological crisis. His use of a\\npathogen to alter the locust\\n\\n\\nDNA has revolutionized modern\\ngenetics. He attributed the\\n\\n\\ndiscovery to another scientist,\\nCharlotte Lockwood, who died\\n\\n\\nnearly 13 years ago.\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\nBy human decree, Biosen Valley\\nhas been designated a global\\n\\n\\nsanctuary.

We did not order a poltergeist.\\nIf this is the pizza guy, this is really unprofessional.\\nEggman?\\nHello, hedgehog.\\nDid you miss me?\\nI don’t know how you got back, but you made a big mistake coming here.\\nAu contraire, mon frere.\\nThe mistake was thinking you’d won.\\nBut that was just a prelude, an hors d’oeuvre, an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.\\nI get it.\\nI don’t think you do.\\nBut you’re about to.\\nAnd so will that idiot sheriff and his wife.\\nAnd your little dog too!\\nPitiful.\\nWhat? Who are you?\\nWhere are my manners?\\nSonic, meet knuckles.\\nMy new bffae.\\nBestest friend forever and ever!\\nLook, robotnik, I don’t care who you brought to help you.\\nYou’re never going to get my power.\\nDo I look like I need your power?\\nSo nice when diabolical evil lives up to the hype.\\nWhere is it?\\nYou want it? Here it comes.\\nI was expecting more of you. You’re unskilled.\\nUntrained.\\nAnd unworthy!\\nYou forgot one. Unstoppable.\\nIt is my destiny to do what my ancestors could not…\\nTo restore the ultimate power to the home of my people.\\nUltimate power? I don’t know what you’re talking about.\\nYou’ve got the wrong guy.\\nUltimate power?\\nNow you’re speaking my language.\\nDon’t play dumb with me, apprentice of longclaw.\\nYou knew longclaw?\\nLongclaw and her people were the sworn enemy of my tribe, the echidna.\\nWe fought and died at their hands, and now you will die at mine.\\nCome on. Get in! I’m on your side.\\nI’m sorry. Who are you?\\nYou know what? It doesn’t matter.\\nGet us out of here! Go, go, go, go, go!\\nHe’s gone rabid!\\nGross! Is he licking it?\\nSee ya!\\nMake sure to get your shots, Eggman!\\nWow. Okay. Let me just say it is an honor to finally meet you, Sonic.\\nIs it okay if I call you Sonic?\\nEveryone calls me tails. You’re probably wondering why.\\nLet me guess. Because of the extra tail?\\nThat’s right! I should’ve known you’d get that.\\nCool. Also, what is going on? Robotnik’s back?\\nAnd who is Clifford the big red rage monster?\\nThat’s knuckles, the last of the echidnas\\nand the most dangerous warrior in the galaxy.\\nHe’s obsessed with finding the master emerald.\\nAre you serious? The master emerald?\\nThat’s just a bedtime story.\\nWell, he believes it’s real.\\nAnd he must think you’re the key to finding it.\\nRed light! Give me the wheel!\\nHey, what are you…\\nMove your foot.\\nI think we lost him.\\nWe did not lose him. We definitely did not lose him!\\nI’ve got an idea. Do you trust me?\\nOf course not! I literally just met you!\\nJust let me. Come on!\\nWhat are you doing?\\nWe’re flying.\\nDid your butt just turn into a helicopter?\\nA butt-copter!\\nOnly Sonic the hedgehog could come up with something like that.\\nFoxy move.\\nYou want something done right…\\nYou have to hire someone you can push around.\\nAll caps.\\nDoctor, where are you?\\nFreak.\\nI, I’m sorry, folks.\\nI have to close early. Everybody out!\\nEverybody out. Thank you for visiting the mean bean.\\nAll right, good night. Good night.\\nHe’s back.\\nHe’s back!\\nThat’s more like it.\\nI’ve been re-hatched!\\nSo, my massively metacarpaled friend, you mentioned…\\nUltimate power.\\nBack at the house?\\nThe master emerald?\\nIt does not concern you.\\nI got you off that planet and you brought me to the hedgehog.\\nWe have no more use for each other.\\nWell, I hate to be a contrarian, but…\\nI think we might.\\nYou think these machines are a match for me?\\nI will shatter them like the bones from a fallen…\\nThey are stairs.\\nYou see, earth is my turf, g.\\nIf you don’t know how to floss, you’ll be lost without me.\\nI understand nothing of what you just said.\\nI help you retrieve the emerald, and you use it to…\\nDestroy the hedgehog!\\nYou’re suggesting an alliance.\\nAround here we simply grip each other’s hands tightly.\\nYou truculent space bumpkin!\\nYou’ve crushed my favorite hand!\\nReally? My hand is uninjured.\\nBut I’m now convinced of your commitment.\\n“Oh, goody,” he exclaimed, while he reset two of his knuckles.\\nI’m…\\nDelighted to be on the same team.\\nRoad trip!\\nI’ll let you stick your nose out the window.\\nSonic, where are we?\\nWelcome to the Wade cave.\\nWhich is something I hope to someday say to a woman.\\nA woman who’s not my mom.\\nWade, focus.\\nWe need to figure out why knuckles thinks I’m the key to finding the master emerald.\\nAnd why did he mention longclaw?\\nThere must be a connection.\\nWait a minute. There is.\\nLook. There’s an emerald symbol on the map longclaw gave me.\\nI never knew what it meant before.\\nSomething’s happening.\\nLongclaw?\\nHello, Sonic.\\nIf you’re watching this, then something has happened to me.\\nAnd I pray you’ve made it to earth unharmed.\\nThis world has been chosen for a very important reason.\\nIt’s the secret location of the master emerald.\\nThe emerald has the power to turn thoughts into reality.\\nLike the stay puft marshmallow man from ghostbusters.\\nIn the wrong hands it could threaten all life in the universe.\\nProtecting the emerald was my sacred duty.\\nAnd now I must pass that responsibility to you.\\nThis is my moment.\\nFollow the map, find the emerald, and keep it safe.\\nMy dear Sonic,\\nyou have a heart like no creature I’ve ever known.\\nI love you so much.\\nGoodbye.\\nNo, no, no, wait.\\nI won’t let you down, longclaw.\\nSo is that you, your dad?\\nWhat?\\nNo?\\nAccording to this map, the first clue is in Siberia.\\nIt’s a compass that will lead to the emerald.\\nAnd with knuckles already here, it’s a race.\\nKnuckles?\\nI knew a kid in middle school named knuckles.\\nCould fit his whole fist in his mouth.\\nIf this is the same knuckles, we are screwed.\\nThis knuckles, that knuckles. It doesn’t matter.\\nWe’re gonna get there first.\\nWhat do you mean, “we”?\\nYou’re coming with me.\\nNo, no, no, no, no.\\nI just came here to warn you. I’m not a field guy.\\nDon’t worry. I got your back. I won’t let anything happen to you.\\nIt’s a power bump. On earth, it means an unbreakable promise.\\nOkay, I’m in.\\nDoctor. It’s really you.\\nYou look different.\\nPapa’s got a brand new ‘stache.\\nI knew it. I knew it! I knew you’d come back, sir.\\nI never stopped steaming your Austrian goat’s milk.\\nCould use some mushroom.\\nYou brought something.\\nSome kind of space porcupine.\\nPorcupine? I am an echidna!\\nTrained since birth in all forms of lethal combat, destined to restore honor to my tribe, and willing to destroy anything that gets in my way.\\nWelcome to the team.\\nThat means he trusts you, stone.\\nNow let’s renovate this dump!\\nLatte with steamed Austrian goat milk!\\nGood one. Solid.\\nSorry, fellas.\\nThat’s game!\\nThat’s how we do! That’s how we do!\\nBut are they good at math?\\nTeamwork makes the dream work!\\nSorry about that, big Tom.\\nAre you good?\\nAll good. Fine.\\nHey. Thanks for inviting me out to hang with you and your groomsmen.\\nGood quality bonding.\\nYou know, bro, those guys right there, they’re way more than my groomsmen.\\nThat’s my squad.\\nNever would’ve made it through life without ’em.\\nGet over here!\\nYeah, I’m coming! I’m coming!\\nI’ll catch you later.\\nHey. Yeah!\\nLet me know if you’re ready for some power yoga.\\nYou bet.\\nCome on, Tommy boy. Let’s go.\\nLet’s go.\\nDon’t make me.\\nWhat am I doing?\\nHey, uncle Tommy!\\nHey, girls!\\nHow you do.\\nAre those the wedding rings?\\nUh-huh.\\nMay I?\\nThis little ring bearer has been taking her job very seriously.\\nShe’s been practicing all morning.\\nI can see that.\\nHow very responsible of you.\\nExcept aren’t there supposed to be two wedding rings?\\nUh-oh.\\nUncle Tommy?\\nHang on. What’s going on here?\\nYou’re gonna do great, kiddo.\\nBye.\\nHey, baby.\\nHi.\\nThat’s right! Groom in the building!\\nLook at those guys.\\nI wish Sonic had that.\\nMuscles?\\nControl yourself.\\nNo. Buddies. Wingmen. A squad.\\nSonic doesn’t have anything like that. He’s flying solo.\\nBaby, you got to relax.\\nYou’re at the four seasons.\\nHave a Mai Tai. Spend some time with your wife.\\nThat’s what he said. Seriously, his exact words.\\nSee? He’s a smart kid. He’ll find his way.\\nI absolutely cannot find my way.\\nWe are completely, totally, unequivocally lost.\\nSonic, in this weather, there’s no way we’re gonna get any readings on this thing!\\nShould we go back?\\nNo, no, no.\\nThere’s a light up ahead. Maybe we can take shelter in there.\\nPerfect.\\nAre you sure about this? We don’t know who’s inside.\\nDon’t worry. On earth, people are very welcoming, and love taking complete strangers into their homes.\\nRun.\\nTable for two, please!\\nWhat would you like to order?\\nTwo beef stews, please.\\nWhere’d you get all these cool gadgets?\\nI invented ’em.\\nThat’s kinda my thing.\\nIn fact, my inventions are how I discovered you.\\nRemember that night at the baseball field?\\nYour energy blast reached all the way to my home planet.\\nI saw you save your whole village from that crazy mustache guy.\\nWait, so you’ve been watching me this whole time?\\nEven in the shower?\\nThat’s a trick question.\\nSonic the hedgehog prefers bubble baths.\\nMan, you’re good!\\nWhen I learned knuckles was on your trail, I knew I couldn’t just sit back and watch anymore.\\nI had to come warn you.\\nWhat? Hang on one sec.\\nDonut lord is checking in.\\n“Just chilling. Watching TV.”\\nDot, dot, dot.\\nDot, dot, dot.\\nDot, dot, dot.\\nDot, dot, dot.\\nDot, dot, dot.\\nDoctor,\\nwhy are we working with this imbecile?\\nBecause that simpleminded space trash is the key to something extraordinary.\\nSomething to help you get revenge on the hedgehog.\\nThink bigger, stone.\\nThe emerald he seeks could power my wildest designs.\\nMy genius wouldn’t just be recognized on earth.\\nIt would spread virally to every corner of the galaxy, allowing me to harness all the negative forces of the universe and commune with darkness itself.\\nWow. That sounds big.\\nIt’s been on my vision board for years. It’s the law of attraction.\\nDidn’t you see the secret?\\nKaplooey!\\nKaplooey.\\n“Another boring night at home.”\\nThe hedgehog has returned home!\\nFalsa. Which is Latin for “wrong-o.”\\nAccording to my worldwide network cell tower triangulation, he’s lying, all the way from the majestic hinterlands of eastern Siberia.\\nHe’s a long-distance liar!\\nYeah, there’s more where that came from.\\nTiny magic hedgehog destroyed.\\nNow let’s begin our quest.\\nWait.\\nWhat about your Minion? The goat milker.\\nThere’s no room on the ship for stone.\\nI say we ditch him, ghost him, blow him off.\\nDishonor!\\n“Dis” is how I roll.\\nI’m sorry, but I asked for the beef stew.\\nYour breath smells like goat poop.\\nWhat did you say?\\nWhat’s going on?\\nMaybe they think it’s my birthday?\\nDon’t worry, I’ll take care of this. Okay, everybody, take it easy.\\nI’m sure there’s a perfectly good explanation for whatever my friend said or did.\\nStand back.\\nI just farted.\\nMeow?\\nThrow these monsters in the fire!\\nOh, no, no. Come on, guys. Take it easy. Let’s talk this through.\\nLet’s talk this through!\\nCome on, come on. Scanning Siberian customs.\\nThere’s got to be something in here.\\nTails, whatever you’re doing, do it fast.\\nI think I got it!\\nPivonka! Pivonka!\\nPivonka!\\nDa.\\nPivonka!\\nTails, what’s a “pivonka”?\\nIt’s a siberian custom to resolve disputes.\\nIf we win, they let us go. If we lose…\\nOkay, we have to grab the map and get out of here.\\nWhere’s the map?\\nOh, no. I left it on the table! Look!\\nWhat?\\nOh, my god, it’s a dance fight.\\nSonic, what do we do?\\nWe dance and get that map.\\nHere we go.\\nOkay, now let’s do. No, we’re gonna go…\\nOkay.\\nOkay, this is not going well. Channing Tatum makes it look so easy.\\nWait, Sonic. Look!\\nThe map! Come on, let’s grab it!\\nYou want?\\nCome get.\\nFreaks!\\nFreaks!\\nFreaks! Freaks! Freaks!\\nFreaks! Freaks! Freaks!\\nFreaks! Freaks! Freaks!\\nFreaks! Freaks! Freaks!\\nWhat’s wrong, tails? Come on. I need you!\\nI can’t do this, Sonic. I’m not brave like you.\\nMy gadget got us in this mess, and I lost your map, and we’re gonna get tossed into a fire!\\nNew deejay coming in.\\nCome on, pal. I got an idea.\\nThey called us freaks, so let’s get freaky.\\nJust follow my moves. You’ll be fine.\\nAll right! Backup dancers!\\nHere we go!\\nThere’s a lot of me up here!\\nI love pivonka!\\nAnd big dismount!\\nYeah!\\nI’ll take that.\\nWe did it!\\nThat was amazing! Way to go, tails.\\nWow. Only Sonic the hedgehog could win a dance battle that epic.\\nWell, stick with me, pal.\\nEarth can be a scary place, but I know everything about this old pale blue dot.\\nDo you really mean that?\\nI mean, not everything. But I watch a lot of discovery channel and…\\nI meant about me being your pal.\\nOf course, buddy.\\nComin’ in hot.\\nGrowing up, I didn’t have any friends.\\nEveryone in my village thought my two tails were weird.\\nHey, I know that feeling.\\nBut then I saw you, the fastest creature in the galaxy.\\nYou were weird too. But you were a legend.\\nThat made me think, maybe being weird isn’t so bad.\\nYou inspired me to leave my village, to find you and help you in your mission.\\nI’m really glad you’re here, tails.\\nI’m glad I’m here too, Sonic.\\nWell, might as well get some sleep.\\nThis feels like a good place to spend the night.\\nYou’ll be able to get clear readings on your gizmo thing once the storm is over, so I…\\nNight, tails.\\nTails. Tails. We have a situation.\\nToday’s forecast calls for clear, sunny skies and a 100% chance of adventure.\\nI pinpointed the coordinates. It’s right up ahead.\\nHey, tails. Wait up.\\nOkay, we got a giant owl door. Seems encouraging.\\nCheck this out.\\nCan you translate that?\\nYeah.\\nAges ago, a fearsome group of warriors, known as the echidnas, forged the seven chaos emeralds into the most unstoppable weapon ever created.\\nThe master emerald.\\nWith it, a single warrior could defeat entire armies.\\nBelieving no one should have such power, an order of heroes recovered the emerald and swore to protect it from evil.\\nSounds like the owls and the echidnas have been fighting each other for centuries.\\nLike vin diesel and the rock.\\nWait for me.\\nOkay, giant owl door, giant owl. Makes sense.\\nWait a second. I’ve seen these symbols before.\\nHere we go.\\nWell, that did something.\\nThe compass!\\nThis will lead us to the emerald!\\nHey, you got a little something on your…\\nOh, no. Tails, get back.\\nRun!\\nThat guy again?\\nHeads up, my little stalagmites. Someone call an Uber?\\nHey, thanks for doing all the hard stuff.\\nBut we’ll take it from here.\\nOkay, we really gotta talk about your new look.\\nIt’s like professor x meets the monopoly man.\\nAnd what kind of genius shows up to Siberia in a convertible?\\nThe kind of genius that can turn up the heat…\\nWith a flick of a switch.\\nGood one! I’m sure that wasn’t important.\\nTails, that’s our exit. Come on.\\nLet’s split up.\\nYou go high, I go low.\\nRight.\\nQuick little stretch and here we go.\\nSo you want to play?\\nThat’s new.\\nSonic!\\nSnowball fight!\\nIt’s too easy. Come on, challenge me!\\nWe are talking style and pizzazz.\\nYeah! I make this look good.\\nOh, great. The winter soldier.\\nFor a guy named knuckles, you are really bad at punching.\\nSurrender the compass! You are no match for me.\\nI’ve been training for this my entire life.\\nAnd I had no training at all, yet here I am ahead of you.\\nThat’s gotta be embarrassing.\\nMy rings!\\nHas anyone ever told you you’ve got serious anger issues?\\nYou mock me with your weak jokes, but you know nothing about me, hedgehog.\\nWell, I know you echidnas have a habit of showing up uninvited and ruining my life.\\nRuining your life? Another bad joke.\\nI lost everything because of you.\\nMy tribe was on the verge of its greatest victory.\\nThe last of the owl warriors had been located.\\nSoon longclaw’s emerald secrets would be ours.\\nBut my father stopped me from joining the fight.\\nHe said my moment to honor our tribe would come, but it was not this moment.\\nThose were the last words he spoke to me.\\nI never saw him again.\\nWe both lost everything that day.\\nGoodbye, Sonic.\\nNo!\\nLongclaw!\\nSonic! Are you okay?\\nDeceiver!\\nNo, it wasn’t a trick.\\nTails, take the compass and get out of here!\\nYeah!\\nLater, haters!\\nTails!\\nTails, come on. Wake up.\\nHe chose helping the fox over pursuing the compass.\\nOf course he did. New friend, same pathetic weakness.\\nOh, no. No, no, no. We’re in real trouble here.\\nCome on, tails. I need you to fly us out of here.\\nTime to wake up.\\nSee ya, kids. Enjoy the fresh powder.\\nDid you…\\nThese rings signify the…\\nSorry.\\nThought it was on silent.\\nThese rings…\\nSo help me, Thomas!\\nOkay, sorry, sorry.\\nExcuse me, this is an emergency.\\nSorry.\\nWhat? This better be important. I just…\\nAre you skiing?\\nSnowboarding, actually. But I need your help now.\\nLife or death situation this very second.\\nI need you to use the ring I gave you to save me.\\nLike right now.\\nOkay, slow down. I don’t even know where you are.\\nYou just gotta picture where you want the ring to go.\\nSo picture this.\\nOh, my god. Okay, okay. Hang on.\\nWhat?\\nDid you throw it?\\nOh, god.\\nWhat? Tell me what “oh, god.”\\nI mixed up the rings when I was teasing JoJo.\\nWhat? Where is it then? Where is it then?\\nYou don’t want to know.\\nBut I do, Tom.\\nI very much want to know, before I become a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.\\nHang tight, buddy. I got this.\\nWith this ring, Rachel…\\nHey! Hi.\\nEverything okay, bud?\\nNot really.\\nWhat are you doing?\\nThis is gonna sound crazy, but I need to see that ring for just one second, one second.\\nHave you lost your mind?\\nI’m gonna give it right back, I promise.\\nPlease, Randall, it’s really important.\\nNo, bro. Go sit down.\\nGive me the ring, please?\\nRandall, don’t look at him, look at me.\\nRandall, Randall.\\nOne second.\\nPut the ring on my finger.\\nNo, Randall, listen to me.\\nRandall! Look at me. Ring on my finger.\\nGive me the ring! Just one second.\\nPut a ring on it!\\nPlease, love? Okay?\\nWith this ring…\\nYes, baby.\\nI’m so sorry about this.\\nSnow, my god.\\nOh, boy.\\nIncoming!\\nAnybody hurt?\\nSonic!\\nHawaii.\\nAre you okay?\\nWhat’s happening? Are you hurt?\\nNo, no, no, I’m fine.\\nOkay, good.\\nBecause you’re in so much trouble!\\nOkay, you calm down.\\nYou talk.\\nOkay, quick version.\\nRobotnik is back on earth and he’s after a magic emerald.\\nWe need to get it back or the world is doomed.\\nTails!\\nWait! All this happened since yesterday?\\nWait. Who’s tails?\\nTails, can you hear me?\\nOh, lord, there are two of them now.\\nOkay, okay, let me think, let me think. Tails, come on, buddy.\\nHey!\\nRandall, why do all of your friends have weapons?\\nYou really should have taken me up on that brunch, Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.\\nOlive garden guy?\\nIt’s okay, everyone. We’re federal agents.\\nYou, too, agent. Go ahead.\\nYou mean to tell me that this entire wedding was a setup?\\nRachel, wait a minute.\\nWhat?\\nThat’s correct, ma’am.\\nEvery single aspect of operation catfish was a complete fabrication.\\nOperation catfish?\\nSo is everyone here an agent?\\nAre you an agent?\\nSon of a…\\nWas the florist an agent? How about the photographer?\\nThe woman who waxed my…\\nAt the spa?\\nIs JoJo an agent?\\nRachel.\\nWhat?\\nRachel, listen to me.\\nI’m done listening! I am done listening!\\nI am so sorry. I am so sorry.\\nI really am. I am so sorry.\\nNo. Hey, no!\\nLet him go! Hey!\\nSonic, hang on.\\nTake it easy. It’s not worth it.\\nTom!\\nSonic is not a threat. He’s on our side.\\nHe’s an uncontrolled extraterrestrial.\\nAnd your days of aiding and abetting him are over.\\nSecure them in the hotel until the chopper arrives.\\nYou’re making a mistake.\\nHold on, major a-hole!\\nThis is still my day, and someone is gonna explain to me what the hell is going on here!\\nAfter the events in San Francisco, a global task force was created, devoted to protecting our planet from alien threats.\\nThat day, guardian units of nations was born.\\nG-u-n. Seriously?\\nGun, yeah.\\nLook, what about protecting our planet from Dr. Robotnik?\\nRobotnik is dead.\\nYou’re wrong. He’s back.\\nAnd you just hauled away the only ones who could stop him.\\nSounds like Robotnik might be back in play.\\nIf he is, I want him found immediately.\\nAnd cancel my five o’clock at the olive garden.\\nAunt Maddie?\\nYeah.\\nSonic and his friend dropped this.\\nI have an idea.\\nAnd I want to have a word with my fiancé.\\nAnd that word is “murder.”\\nHey, come on. You can’t just leave us in here.\\nMy friend is hurt! He needs a doctor, a vet, anyone!\\nTails, you got to wake up, buddy. Please wake up.\\nAll clear.\\nAll right. Game plan.\\nI get inside the hotel and find where they’re hiding Tom and Sonic.\\nOkay. Then I find Randall, right?\\nAnd then I squeeze the breath\\nfrom his lying, deceitful, perfectly manscaped body!\\nI’m going through a lot right now.\\nSo let me process this my own way, okay?\\nSure, sure.\\nNo judgment.\\nShould’ve brought a journal.\\nOkay…\\nOkay. Is this meant to be a weapon? This is adorable.\\nTake that, Randall!\\nRun, Randall!\\nAll right.\\nWe’re about to find out.\\nAll right!\\nLet’s go kick some Booty.\\nRachel! No. Rachel!\\nIn a minute.\\nStop right there!\\nGet the bag.\\nHe’s gonna come back down, right?\\nI don’t know.\\nGood luck!\\nLook. Tom and Sonic have to be inside.\\nI got a fiancé to vaporize.\\nWatch your back, sis.\\nOkay.\\nRandall!\\nWe got her. Move in.\\nOkay.\\nI did not mean to do that!\\nSomething bothering you, agent?\\nI just feel a little guilty about what I did to Rachel, sir.\\nDon’t worry about it. We’ll send her a gift card.\\nNow, I propose a toast.\\nTo a perfectly executed operation.\\nSir, we’re under attack.\\nRandall, wifey’s home!\\nOh, my god. Rachel.\\nWhat a woman.\\nYou no-good, lowdown, dirty, lying…\\nRachel, just listen to me.\\nWhat kind of twisted sicko tricks someone into a fake wedding?\\nParty’s over, bridezilla. Stop right there.\\nYou son of a…\\nHave it your way.\\nNo!\\nNo!\\nVery disappointing, agent Handel.\\nIs that supposed to be a weapon?\\nI don’t know, but we gonna find out.\\nHaven’t you caused enough trouble for one day?\\nI haven’t even begun causing trouble.\\nHell hath no fury like a bride scorned.\\nLooks like it’s real, huh?\\nNo. Right.\\nBe honest. How bad is it?\\nNot bad at all. You got tased. You’ll be fine.\\nI’m so cold.\\nYou landed on our ice sculpture.\\nGet up.\\nJust…\\nJust tell me the truth, for once.\\nIs there anything about you or about us that was real?\\nRachel, look at me.\\nBefore I met you, I didn’t think that I was even capable of real happiness.\\nBut that all changed when you walked into my life.\\nAnd I ended up breaking the first rule of undercover work.\\nWhich is?\\nNever fall in love.\\nMaddie!\\nWe’re busting out of here.\\nHow’d you get past the guards?\\nBecause that little fox is into some crazy stuff.\\nCome on.\\nLet’s go.\\nYou’re amazing.\\nThe owls were fools to think they could hide this.\\nWhat’s happening?\\nWait for it.\\nYes. Eureka!\\nI’ve found it!\\nSonic.\\nWhat is that?\\nA big problem.\\nThe compass led Robotnik to the emerald.\\nThat’s got to be hundreds of miles away.\\nAll right. Huddle up. Let’s figure out a plan.\\nTogether.\\nThere’s no time for that.\\nI’m the only one that can get there fast enough.\\nSonic, this is way too big for you to do by yourself.\\nYou see that little fox over there?\\nHe came all the way across the universe to meet his hero.\\nAnd what did his hero do? I practically got him killed.\\nYou know what? You were right.\\nMy moment came and I blew it. I’m no hero.\\nWait.\\nNo.\\nI’m not letting anyone else get hurt because of me.\\nI’m gonna fix this while I still can.\\nSonic!\\nSonic, wait!\\nHold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.\\nDon’t move. Don’t move.\\nTake it easy, little guy. You’re hurt.\\nBut we have to help him. You don’t know what he’s up against.\\nYou believe us now?\\nHey, Bob!\\nHey, Maria, how you doing?\\nWorking on my moves.\\nJust keepin’ it green. No need to burn the fuel.\\nSpeaking of fuel…\\nClosed?\\nThat doesn’t seem right.\\nClose.\\nYes.\\nMakeover, makeover. Look at you.\\nFreeze! Police!\\nOh, my god, you got robot hands. You got robot hands.\\nNo, they’re gloves.\\nGet ’em up. Now spread your fingers!\\nNow wiggle ’em! Wiggle your digits!\\nYes! Like you just finished a big musical number.\\nGood.\\nWhy is there a light on your head?\\n‘Cause I’m the sheriff for the weekend, pal.\\nWater.\\nWhy did it have to be water?\\nOkay, you can do this.\\nGotta go fast.\\nI don’t want to die like this! It’s derivative!\\nMake room for daddy!\\nTwo and two.\\nGreat! We’re still bipedals, more or less.\\nFire in the hole!\\nI’ve solved it. There is a booby trap every seven seco…\\nThat was a little early.\\nSo glad it didn’t cut off my mustache.\\nHey, little red wrecking ball.\\nI know you’re dying to get your emerald on, but can we be a little bit more mindful of our surroundings?\\nMay I?\\nIn 30 feet, turn left.\\nWork smarter, not harder.\\nMy pelvis.\\nOkay, secret temple, let’s see what you’ve got.\\nNo, no, no! No!\\nNo.\\nYes!\\nYou have arrived at your destination.\\nWow. That really opened up the space.\\nI can’t even picture it with an impenetrable wall now.\\nAnd the rubble is always a nice touch.\\nAt last. The master emerald.\\nUltimate power.\\nSoon order will be restored.\\nAll because of what we have done together.\\nSuch a lovely sentiment, knuckles.\\nI think I feel a single tear forming.\\nSadly…\\nYou’re as useful to me now as a backstage pass to Limp Bizkit.\\nNailed it.\\nThis guy is always trying to spoil a bad thing!\\nYou guys are here, too? Took the long way, huh?\\nIs everything a joke to you?\\nWhy must you constantly interfere with my destiny?\\nBecause my destiny is to protect my friends and family.\\nI think I just threw up in my mouth.\\nAnd if you want that emerald, you’re gonna have to go through me.\\nThe echidna’s taking no prisoners today!\\nSonic has heart, but will he lose the quill to live?\\nI don’t want to fight you, but you’re not giving me much choice.\\nToo easy. Let’s do this.\\nWhy don’t you stand still and die with honor?\\nLet me think about it.\\nOkay, I thought about it and I pass.\\nHi there, beautiful.\\nYou’re the real deal, aren’t you?\\nWhere have you been all my life?\\nSay goodbye, hedgehog.\\nKnuckles, stop. Robotnik’s stealing the emerald!\\nWhat kind of fool do you take me for?\\nJust look.\\nMine.\\nWait! That wasn’t the deal.\\nYou poor, naïve creature.\\nIt’s not your fault.\\nA more advanced intellect would have seen this move coming a mile away.\\nOr 1.6 kilometers.\\nBut I trusted you! You were my friend!\\nI’m sorry. That just hit me funny.\\nLet this be my final lesson to you, you dim-witted celestial skin tag.\\nFriends…\\nAre open, honest and vulnerable with each other.\\nWhich means x squared times the hypotenuse of y squared, divided by the absolute value of friendship, equals…\\nDookie!\\nOh, no.\\nChaos is power!\\nLet’s get out of here!\\nKnuckles!\\nWater again? Come on!\\nYou saved me.\\nDon’t talk to me. I’m not in the mood.\\nHow dare you attack me in my hour of sorrow!\\nWhy did you save me?\\nBecause you saved me first, which clearly gave you a tactical advantage I do not understand.\\nIt wasn’t a tactic. I couldn’t just let you die.\\nWhy? I’ve been trying to destroy you since the moment we met.\\nBecause being a hero isn’t about taking care of yourself.\\nIt’s about taking responsibility for other people.\\nWise words. An ancient earth proverb?\\nNo, sir, that’s a Wachowski family special.\\nI got it from a guy in a rowboat.\\nSomeone who means a lot to me.\\nWait a second. What’s that sound?\\nOnly Sonic the hedgehog needs rescuing this much.\\nThat sly little fox!\\nCome on, knucklehead. We’re not beat yet.\\nOn the mountain, you told me you’d lost everything.\\nThe way I did.\\nBut you seem so hopeful and free.\\nHow did you move forward despite failing again?\\nAnd again. And again. And again. And again.\\nOkay, I didn’t fail that much. But I didn’t do this all alone.\\nI found a new family. New friends.\\nAnd you can too.\\nYou don’t have to be alone anymore.\\nAre you kidding me with that handshake?\\nI’m done playing games, pal.\\nYou’re gonna tell me what I want to know.\\nAnd I am asking you for the last time…\\nWhat would you like on your bagel?\\nI’m not telling you anything.\\nAnd that is a display bagel.\\nI don’t get it with you! I mean, I’ve tried everything.\\nI was good cop. I was bad cop. I was cop who offers you a bagel.\\nAnd nothing. It’s like…\\nThat is a display bagel. Wow.\\nDoctor, you’re here.\\nYes, I’m here, and yet I’m…\\nNot all there.\\nSir, are you feeling okay?\\nI’m more than okay.\\nI’m upgraded.\\nSinister 3.0.\\nMy game is next level.\\nHi.\\nI can smell the electricity in your brain.\\nYou smell like a snack plate.\\nYeah, that’s fair. I had a couple today.\\nSit down.\\nIn the chair.\\nI didn’t know.\\n‘Cause he, ’cause he was in the chair, so I didn’t.\\nOkay.\\nSir? We have a problem.\\nAll teams in position!\\nSet up a perimeter!\\nMove! Move! Move!\\nIncorrectus, my trusty barnacle.\\nAfter all these years, what I finally got…\\nIs a solution.\\nCommander.\\nStatus report.\\nRobotnik is in there with stone and a hostage. Possibly local PD.\\nI’m not saying he’s dumb, but if he is local PD,\\nthis town’s in a lot of trouble.\\nWade.\\nWade.\\nOkay.\\nRockin’ that new spring collection, I see.\\nWell, if it isn’t the pastry king.\\nThe donut lord.\\nA real genius would remember the name of the guy who helped kick your butt off this planet.\\nAnd I’ll do it again if you mess with green hills.\\nCongratulations on your oh-so-temporary sense of superiority.\\nYou’re finished, Robotnik! We’ve taken everything.\\nYour lab, your drones, your funding!\\nLet’s see how big of a man you are without your silly little robots.\\nWould you like to see…\\nHow big a man I can be?\\nWelcome to the new norm.\\nMy god!\\nDoctor! Take me with you!\\nHe’s taking everything apart.\\nHe’s building something.\\nThat can only be one thing.\\nThe fearsome power of the emerald.\\nIf that thing really turns thoughts into power, we are in big trouble.\\nRobotnik has a lot of bad thoughts.\\nHey, Sonic, are you sure it was a good idea bringing you-know-who aboard?\\nKnuckles isn’t really a bad guy. He’s just a little mixed up.\\nI am not mixed up!\\nI have steely focus. And I’m complex. And that’s a lot for some people.\\nHope you’re not still mad I hit you with that car.\\nI was completely uninjured.\\nAnd my revenge will come when you least expect it, fox.\\nSir, you’re magnificent!\\nThank you, sycophant.\\nYour admiration is inevitable.\\nI knew it!\\nJust like the stay puft Marshmallow Man.\\nWorld domination playlist.\\nFall back.\\nFall back! Quick! Retreat!\\nHow are we supposed to beat this thing?\\nWe need a plan.\\nKnuckles, use your strength to…\\nJump off the plane. Wow.\\nOkay, this is what we’re gonna do.

Shoot the missiles. Make a decision.\\nI need a moment, sir. I’m trying to figure out how to do this.\\nDid you even glance at a manual?\\nNo!\\nI’ll do it.\\nPardon my lightning.\\nYou might want to ground yourself.\\nI’m gonna pop that thing open like a can of chili…\\nHang on!\\nYeah!\\nClose one.\\nSonic!\\nRobotnik!\\nDeceiver!\\nDie, mosquito.\\nI felt that.\\nWhat just happened?\\nIt’s the stache masher. Right here in the manual.\\nReturn to sender.\\nStone?\\nGreat. Next thing you know, there’ll be a report about a hostile work environment.\\nThose were our best attacks, and they did nothing!\\nWe can’t beat Robotnik as long as he’s got that emerald.\\nHe’s too powerful.\\nLook, we aren’t strong enough to beat Robotnik on our own.\\nBut there’s three of us.\\nYour strength, your smarts and my speed.\\nTogether. That’s how we win.\\nSo we make our stand here on the field of battle.\\nAs a team.\\nThis is it.\\nThis is our moment.\\nTime to fight.\\nBad time to say this, but I don’t actually have a plan.\\nTails, any ideas?\\nWe have to find his weak spot.\\nI suggest the groin.\\nWhat? No. No!\\nTraditionally, yes, the groin is the weakest spot.\\nStop saying “groin.”\\nHedgehog!\\nLook out!\\nI know what his weak spot is. It’s me.\\nI’m the groin!\\nThink about it. I live rent-free in this dude’s head.\\nSo if I go out there and rile him up…\\nHe’ll focus on only you, leaving himself open to a flanking maneuver from me and the fox!\\nHedgehog, you are a brave and noble warrior.\\nGo to your certain death with honor.\\nWe’re gonna have to work on your pep talks, pal.\\nYeah.\\nLet’s go.\\nAll right, mustache.\\nYou want me?

MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT 37 \\nMATTHEW (SENIOR) \\nNine-nine... Jesus.  \\nMach TEN. \\nJACK (JADED) \\nThe team CHEERS. Hondo notes the data recorder exploding with  new data. A gusher. Cain realizes what this means. The geeky  engineer pumps a fist: \\nSIMON (MEEK) \\nPut THAT in your Pentagon budget. \\n(catching Cain’s stare) \\nUh... Sir. \\nBut Hondo stares at his monitor. He knows his friend well. \\nHONDO (TO SELF) \\nArright. You made your point, Mav.  \\nNow bring it home. \\n38 INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT 38 The speed gauge needle trembles ever so higher... \\nMAVERICK \\nThat’s it, just a little. 10.1. \\n10.1... 10.2... \\nMAVERICK (CONT’D) \\nYou see? I knew you could do it. \\nBut now Darkstar JOLTS VIOLENTLY. WARNING LIGHTS pepper the  console, ALARMS buzzing in his ear. He swallows hard: \\nBOOM. Maverick is slammed against the canopy. \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 19.\\n39 INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT 39 All screens go DARK. The stream of flight data vanishes. \\nMAVERICK? \\nHONDO (INTO RADIO) \\nStatic. Cain doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t need to. SILENCE \\n44 EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAWN 44 A country highway. Some trucks blow past; a tumbleweed rolls. \\nA46 INT. TRUCK STOP - DAWN A46 \\nA bell jingles. One by one, PATRONS take in a sight at the  door in awe. REVEAL: \\nMaverick, dazed, parched, helmet in one hand, stick in the  other. Patrons stare. A WAITRESS at the counter pours water  for a dumbstruck CUSTOMER and his YOUNG SON eating ice cream. \\nMAVERICK \\nExcuse me, miss? \\nMaverick motions towards the ice water she just poured. She  hands it to him. He drinks it. All of it. \\nMAVERICK (CONT’D) \\nWhere am I? \\nEarth. \\nKID WITH ICE CREAM \\nNOISE O.S. Helicopters. The sound of his fate. \\n46 EXT. TEST HANGAR - DAY 46 \\nA Navy “Rescue Hawk” HH-60 helicopter lands. Maverick is  escorted into the waiting embrace of TWO MPs.  \\nMaverick glances back at the heli as it flies away. He sighs,  walks away with the MPs to face the music. \\nB47 INT. LONG CORRIDOR - DAY B47 Mav enters, followed by the MPs. He stops. REVEAL: \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 20.\\nB47 CONTINUED: B47 \\nHondo and the same Darkstar team members Maverick left behind  are here to greet him. The emotions are mixed; they are proud  of what they’ve all achieved, but unsure of the cost was  worth it. \\nHe moves on. They part for him, offering muted thanks, some  words of encouragement. Some can’t even look him in the eye. \\nIt is a solemn moment of farewell. The passing of a legend. As he passes the last of them, he stops and looks back. \\n(Note: We stay in the wide so as not to undercut the moment  later in Cain’s office) \\nMAVERICK \\nY’all built one helluva a plane. \\nBittersweet smiles from the team. Yes they did. Mavericks  walks on, ready to face the music. Out on his terms. \\n47 INT. HANGAR OFFICE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 47 \\nSILENCE. The SPs flank the door. Cain sits behind a desk,  turns page after page of a file. Mav waits, sweating in his  flight suit, gently thumbing the stick in his hand. \\nCAIN \\n(looking at file) \\nMaverick... \\n(sighs) \\nThirty plus years of service...  \\ncombat medals... citations... the  \\nonly man to shoot down three enemy  \\naircraft in the last forty years...  \\nALT: distinguished...distinguished. \\nAfter a long wait, Cain closes the file, stares. \\nCAIN (CONT’D) \\nYet you can’t get a promotion, you  \\nwon’t retire and, despite your best  \\nefforts, you refuse to die. You  \\nshould be a two-star admiral by  \\nnow. If not a senator. Yet here you  \\nare... Captain. Why is that? \\nMAVERICK \\nOne of life’s mysteries, sir.  \\nCAIN \\nThis isn’t a joke. I asked you a  \\nquestion. \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 21.\\n47 CONTINUED: 47 \\nHe stares, waits. Maverick’s smile flickers ever so slightly.  This is the end of the line. Beat: \\nMAVERICK \\nI’m where I belong... sir. \\nCAIN \\nNavy doesn’t see it that way. Not  \\nanymore. \\nCain stands. Stares out the window at the future. \\nCAIN (CONT’D) \\nThese planes you’ve been testing,  \\nCaptain, one day they won’t need  \\npilots at all. Pilots that need to  \\nsleep, eat, take a piss... Pilots  \\nthat can disobey. All you did was  \\nbuy time for those men out there. \\n(turns to Maverick) \\nThe future is coming. And you’re  \\nnot in it. \\nWithout taking his eyes off Maverick: \\nCAIN (CONT’D) \\nEscort this man off the base...  \\ntake to him to his quarters... wait  \\nwith him while he packs his gear...  \\n(turns away) \\nI want him on the road to North  \\nIsland within the hour.  \\nBeat. \\nMAVERICK \\nNorth Island... sir? \\nCAIN \\nCall came in with impeccable  \\ntiming. Right when I was driving  \\nhere to ground your ass once and  \\nfor all. It galls me to say it, but  \\nfor reasons known only to the  \\nalmighty and your guardian angel...  \\nyou’ve been called back to Top Gun. \\nCain turns, sits back at the desk. Even Maverick is confused. \\nSir \\nMAVERICK CAIN \\nYou are dismissed, Captain. \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 22.\\n47 CONTINUED: (2) 47 Maverick stands, hesitates, can’t help himself: \\nMAVERICK \\nOn behalf of the team... \\nHe plants the DARKSTAR’S STICK on the desk. \\nMAVERICK (CONT’D) \\nMach 10 capable, sir. As promised. \\nCain never looks up. Maverick turns to leave, stopping on: \\nCAIN \\nThe end is inevitable, Maverick.  \\nYour kind is headed for extinction. \\nMAVERICK \\nYes, sir... But not today.  \\nALT: Maybe so, but not today, Sir. \\nAnd with a sly grin, Maverick is gone. \\n49 EXT. POINT LOMA - DAY 49 \\nAERIAL RIPS over Point Loma revealing the North Island NAS,  as the TOP GUN ANTHEM theme kicks in. \\n50 EXT. NAVAL AIR STATION NORTH ISLAND, CORONADO - DAY 50 \\nMaverick rips down a taxiway as an F-18 Super Hornet takes  off beyond. He watches it soar. Can’t believe he’s back. \\nA51 EXT. AIRBASE ENTRANCE A51 Mav rides along an entry drive, stopping to look up at: \\nAn old F-14 TOMCAT displayed on a museum pedestal like a  relic from a bygone era. \\nCLOSE ON: The faded name just under the canopy: \\nLT. PETE “MAVERICK” MITCHELL \\nUnder that are the silhouettes of three planes, all X’d out. Maverick drives on. \\n51 EXT. OFFICERS’ BUILDING 51 Maverick enters the North Island NAS Headquarters. \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 23.\\n52 INT. HALLWAY - DUSK 52 \\nCLOSE ON: Photos of faces we might recognize: ICEMAN, SLIDER  and, of course, GOOSE. For anyone unfamiliar, it’s obvious  there is story here - Glory and ghosts. We pass a photo of  ICEMAN AND MAVERICK, settle on a prominent photo of: \\nA stern-jawed ADMIRAL TOM KAZANSKY aka ICEMAN. “Commander of  the Pacific Fleet”. \\nREVEAL: Maverick, staring at the past. \\nADMIRAL’S AIDE (O.S.) \\nCaptain Mitchell... Captain  \\nMitchell. \\nMaverick snaps from his thoughts. \\n53 INT. OFFICERS’ BOARDROOM - DUSK 53 \\nA MONITOR with an image that means little to us now but will  come to dominate our thoughts. A HANDSOME, SQUARE-JAWED MAN  (40s) steps in front of it. This is: \\nCYCLONE \\nAt ease. Captain Pete “Maverick”  \\nMitchell. Your reputation precedes  \\nyou. \\nMAVERICK \\nThank you, sir. \\nCYCLONE \\nIt wasn’t a compliment. Admiral  \\nBeau Simpson. I’m the Airboss. I  \\nbelieve you know Admiral Bates. \\nCLOSE ON: ADMIRAL BATES (55). An affable, brilliant two-star,  otherwise known as:  \\nMAVERICK \\nWarlock, Sir. I must admit, I  \\nwasn’t expecting an invitation  \\nback. \\nWARLOCK \\nThey’re called orders, Maverick. \\nHis tone is friendly enough, but the meaning is clear. No one  is exactly excited to see Maverick back. \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 24.\\n53 CONTINUED: 53 \\nWARLOCK (CONT’D) \\nYou two have something in common.  \\nCyclone here was first in his class  \\nback in ‘88. \\nMAVERICK \\nActually, sir, I finished second.  \\nJust want to manage expectations. \\nAwkward silence. Cyclone nods to Warlock who takes a remote  and summons images on the monitors on the walls. Warlock  clicks through SURVEILLANCE IMAGES of INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS at  the base of a forbidding valley. \\nWARLOCK \\nThe target is an unsanctioned  \\nuranium enrichment plant,  \\nconstructed in violation of a  \\nunilateral NATO treaty. The uranium  \\nproduced there represents a direct  \\nthreat to our allies in the region.  \\nThe Pentagon has tasked us with  \\nassembling a strike team and taking  \\nit out before it becomes fully  \\noperational. \\nMaverick steps closer, studying the screens as Warlock points  to corresponding satellite and archival images, along with a  profile of the run: \\nWARLOCK (CONT’D) \\nThe plant sits in a recess at the  \\nend of this valley. Said valley is  \\nGPS jammed and defended by an  \\nextensive radar array, serving a  \\nlimited number of fifth generation  \\nfighters which, in turn, are backed  \\nup by a plentiful reserve of  \\nsurplus aircraft; F-16s and even a  \\nfew old F-14s. \\nCYCLONE \\nSeems we’re not the only ones  \\nholding on to old relics. \\nMaverick lets that go. He has to. \\nWARLOCK \\nWhat’s your read, Captain? \\nMAVERICK \\nNormally, this would be a cake-walk  \\nfor the F-35’s stealth. But the GPS  \\njamming negates that.  \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 25.\\n53 CONTINUED: (2) 53 \\nThe surface-to-air threat  \\nnecessitates a low level, laser guided strike, tailor made for the  \\nF-18. I figure two precision bombs  \\nminimum. Makes it four planes,  \\nflying in pairs. \\n(studies topography) \\nThat’s one helluva steep climb out,  \\nexposing you to all the surface-to air missiles. Survive that, it’s a  \\ndogfight all the way home. \\nWARLOCK \\nAll requirements for which you have  \\nreal-world experience. \\nMAVERICK \\nNot in the same mission, sir. \\nBeat. Maverick realizes. \\nMAVERICK (CONT’D) \\nSomebody’s not coming back from  \\nthis. \\nCYCLONE \\nCan it be done or not? \\nMAVERICK \\nHow soon until the plant becomes  \\noperational? \\nWARLOCK \\nThree weeks. Maybe less. \\nMaverick realizes... \\nMAVERICK \\nWell, it’s a been a while since  \\nI’ve flown an F-18... And I’m not  \\nsure who I’d trust to fly the other  \\nthree. \\nBeat. \\nWARLOCK \\nI think you misunderstand, Captain. \\nSir? \\nMAVERICK CYCLONE \\nWe don’t want you to fly it. We  \\nwant you to teach it.  \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 26.\\n53 CONTINUED: (3) 53 The words just hang there. \\nMAVERICK \\nTeach... sir... \\nWarlock hits a button and TWELVE PILOT I.D. PHOTOS appear: \\nCYCLONE \\nWe’ve recalled twelve Top Gun  \\ngraduates from their squadrons, all  \\ntop of their class. You will narrow  \\nthis pool down to six - the best of  \\nthe best. They will fly the  \\nmission. \\nMaverick’s eyes lock on one face in particular. The stoic  face of BRADLEY “ROOSTER” BRADSHAW.  \\nCYCLONE (CONT’D) \\nIs there a problem, Captain? \\nMAVERICK \\nYou know there is... sir. \\nCYCLONE \\n(glances at screen) \\nBradley Bradshaw. AKA Rooster. I  \\nunderstand you flew with his old  \\nman... What was his call sign? \\nMAVERICK \\nGoose. Sir. \\nCYCLONE \\nTragic what happened. \\nWarlock is uncomfortable with this: \\nWARLOCK \\nCaptain Mitchell was cleared of any  \\nwrongdoing. Goose’s death was an  \\naccident.  \\nCYCLONE \\nThat how you see it, Captain? \\n(points to Bradshaw) \\nIs that how Goose’s son sees it? \\nMaverick has had about enough of this shit, but soldiers on. \\nMAVERICK \\nWith all due respect, sir. I’m not  \\na teacher. \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 27.\\n53 CONTINUED: (4) 53 \\nCYCLONE \\nYou were a Top Gun instructor  \\nbefore. \\nMAVERICK \\nSir, that was thirty years ago. I  \\nlasted two months. This is not  \\nwhere I belong. \\nCYCLONE \\nLet me be perfectly blunt. You  \\nweren’t our first choice. You  \\nweren’t even on the list. But  \\nsomeone put your name in the  \\nSECDEF’s ear. We all know who. \\nWARLOCK \\nCaptain Mitchell has real-world  \\nexperience akin to every segment of  \\nthis operation. \\nCYCLONE \\nWhat Captain Mitchell has is a  \\nfriend in the Pacific Fleet. \\n(to Maverick) \\nYou’re here at the request of  \\nAdmiral Kazansky. Iceman is a man I  \\ndeeply admire. He seems to think  \\nyou still have something to offer  \\nthe Navy. What that is, I can’t  \\nimagine. You don’t have to take the  \\njob, but I should make it clear:  \\nThis is your last post, Captain.  \\nYou fly for Top Gun or you don’t  \\nfly for the Navy. Ever again. \\nMaverick looks at the picture of Rooster one more time.  \\n54 EXT. “THE HARD DECK” BAR - DUSK - ESTABLISHING 54 \\nAn old yacht club converted into a ramshackle shrine to wild  nights and Naval history, beneath a big sign (”The Hard  Deck”) and a small one (“Help Wanted”). \\n55 INT. HARD DECK - BAR AREA - DUSK 55 \\nQuiet. A FEW PATRONS waiting for the evening to kick off.  Maverick, in his civvies, sits at the bar, his back to the  door. In the corner, he sees TWO YOUNG PILOTS playing darts:  \\nJAVY “COYOTE” MACHADO and JAKE “HANGMAN” SERESIN. \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 28.\\n55 CONTINUED: 55 \\nHangman hits three bulls-eyes in a row, smiles, doesn’t crow,  takes money from Coyote before making brief eye contact with  Maverick - no idea who he’s looking at. \\nCLOSE ON: Mav’s phone buzzes on the bar. The icon photo is  that of ICEMAN, in Admiral’s uniform.  \\n ICE: That went well. \\nMav grudgingly responds. \\n M: The kid’s not ready for this mission.  ICE: No one is. That’s why you’re here. \\n M: You could have warned me. \\n ICE: Would you have come? \\nMaverick’s thumbs hover, unsure how to reply. Beat. \\n ICE: Sorry I couldn’t be there. \\n M: Where were you? \\nBeat. \\n ICE: Think it over. \\nHe sighs, places his phone on the bar. \\nVOICE (O.S.) \\nOf all the gin joints in all the  \\ntowns in all the world, he walks  \\ninto mine. \\nHe looks up at THE BARTENDER: PENNY BENJAMIN has a striking  face with kind eyes that have seen it all - so much that  nothing really ever gets her down. \\nPenny.  \\n(sighs) \\nPete. \\nMAVERICK PENNY \\nMAVERICK \\nWhat are you doing here? \\nPENNY \\nI should ask you the same thing. \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 29.\\n55 CONTINUED: (2) 55 \\nMAVERICK \\nLong story. \\nPENNY \\nI doubt that. Who’d you piss off  \\nthis time? \\nMAVERICK \\nAnother Admiral. Speaking of -  \\nhow’s your father? \\nPENNY \\nStill mad at you. Retired. I moved  \\nback to be closer. And I have to  \\nadmit it was the one place I  \\nthought for sure I’d never run into  \\nyou. \\nMAVERICK \\nI’m just as surprised as you are. \\nHow long have you been here? \\nPENNY \\nI bought this place three years a  \\ngo... You must be in a lotta  \\ntrouble. No way you’d come back  \\nhere willingly. \\n(off his look) \\nWell, you’ll sort it out. \\nMAVERICK \\nNo, this is... I think this is it. \\nPENNY \\nCome on. You’ve been saying that  \\nfor thirty years. You said it after  \\nmy father chased you out my bedroom  \\nwindow. You said it again when they  \\nbusted you for that high speed  \\npass. Next thing I know you’re off  \\nto Bosnia. Then Iraq. Both times. I  \\ndon’t even remember the charges  \\nbefore they shipped you off to the  \\ndesert, test-flying God knows what.  \\nYou get yourself in trouble, Iceman  \\nmakes a call, you’re back in the  \\nair. \\nMAVERICK \\nPenny, this is different. \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 30.\\n55 CONTINUED: (3) 55 \\nPENNY \\nTrust me.

I swear. \\nPENNY \\nIt’s the only look you got. And  \\nthis is not happening.  \\nMAVERICK \\nI’m not asking. \\nPENNY \\nYou never ask. That way I never get  to say no.

The entire bar CHEERS. AN AVIATOR slaps him on the back: \\nFERG  \\nMuch appreciated, pal. \\nMAVERICK \\nWhat I miss? \\nPenny points to a “House Rules” sign:  \\n(reads) \\nMAVERICK (CONT’D) \\nDisrespect a lady, the Navy, or put  \\nyour cell phone on my bar...  \\nPENNY \\nYou buy a round. \\nMAVERICK \\nFor everyone? \\nPENNY \\nI’m afraid rules are rules. You’re  \\nlucky it’s early. \\nHANGMAN \\nWHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? \\nMaverick follows Hangman’s eyeline to the door. \\nThe first of the night’s REVELERS enter, occupying tables,  circling the bar, giving the joint a little life. \\nAmong them are THREE PILOTS: REUBEN “PAYBACK” FLOYD, MICKEY  “FANBOY” GARCIA, and NATASHA “PHOENIX” TRACE. \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 32.\\n55 CONTINUED: (5) 55 Maverick watches them over to the pool table with interest. \\nA56 INT.

Keepin’ it tight, I  \\nsee, Phoenix. \\nPhoenix smiles, annoyed but patient. As she approaches: \\nPHOENIX \\nFellas, this here’s Bagman. \\nHangman. Whatever.  \\nHANGMAN PHOENIX \\n(to Payback and Fanboy) \\nYou’re looking at the only Naval  \\nAviator on active duty with a  \\nconfirmed air-to-air kill. \\nHangman demurs with a bit of false modesty. \\nPHOENIX (CONT’D) \\nMind you, the other guy was in a  \\nmuseum piece from the Korean War. \\nHangman’s smile fades. Coyote jumps in to defend. \\nCold war. \\nCOYOTE PAYBACK \\nSame century.  \\nFANBOY \\nNot this one. \\nHangman looks at Coyote. “Thanks for nothing.”  \\nCOYOTE \\n(to Phoenix) \\nWho’re your friends? \\nPHOENIX \\nPayback, Fanboy, that’s Coyote. \\n(nodding) \\nWho’s he? \\n(CONTINUED) \\nCHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 33.\\nA56 CONTINUED: A56 \\nWho’s who? \\nCOYOTE \\nPhoenix motions, Coyote sees a guy with glasses sitting in  the corner - human wallpaper: LT ROBERT “BOB” FLOYD. \\nCOYOTE (CONT’D) \\nWhen did you come in? \\nBOB \\nI’ve been here the whole time. \\nBeat. The other share a look. Bob would have to be invisible  for no one to have noticed. And that’s exactly what Bob is. \\nHANGMAN \\nThe man’s a stealth pilot.  \\nLiterally. \\nBOB \\nWeapons Systems Officer, actually. \\nHANGMAN \\nWith no sense of humor. \\nHangman walks away toward the bar as: \\nPHOENIX \\nWhat do they call you? \\nBob. \\nBOB \\nPAYBACK \\nNo, your call sign. \\n...Bob. \\nBOB \\nAwkward pause. Phoenix studies him. \\nPHOENIX \\nYou’re my new back-seater. Sent  \\nfrom Lemoore. \\nBOB \\nLooks like it.  \\nLong pause.

Phoenix strides over with open arms: \\nPHOENIX (CONT’D) \\nThis is how I find out you’re  \\nstateside? \\nROOSTER \\nI thought I’d surprise you. \\nHe goes to hug her. She feints a punch to his gut, he  flinches. \\nPHOENIX \\nGuess I surprised you back. \\nROOSTER \\n(recovering) \\nIt’s good to see you. \\nPHOENIX \\nGood to see you, too. \\nMaverick watches with renewed interest as the pilots settle  around the pool table everyone sizing everyone up. All of  them are good.

They  stare for a beat, then Rooster turns back to Phoenix. \\nPenny sees this entire thing. \\nMAVERICK \\nHow’s about ringing me out before  \\nthe evening rush. \\nMaverick hands her his card. Penny heads off with it to close  him out. \\nC56 INT. HARD DECK - POOL AREA - DUSK C56 ON THE PILOTS: \\nHANGMAN \\nBradshaw.

HARD DECK - BAR AREA - NIGHT D56 Penny drops Mav’s card on the bar. \\nPENNY \\nIt’s been declined. \\nMAVERICK \\nYou’re kidding me. \\nAs Maverick sighs, reaches into his pocket: \\nCLOSE ON: A hand grabs a power cord and yanks it from the  wall. All of the music in the bar stops. The crowd groans,  catcalls, whistles. \\nCLOSE ON: Hands pull up a bench, open the lid of a piano.  \\nWIDE SHOT of the crowd, all heads turning as someone starts  pounding on the piano. \\nAt the bar, Maverick turns and sees Rooster at the piano,  playing away, the reaction in the room skeptical. \\nIn the back, Phoenix smiles, nods to Payback and Fanboy to  follow her. They do, unsure of what’s going on. \\nHangman stands up from his next shot at the pool table, left  alone with Coyote. The party is no longer his. \\nCLOSE ON: Rooster banging away on the keys, finishing the  intro. He starts singing. Phoenix joins in, motions for  Fanboy and Payback to do the same.  \\nIt takes a moment, but people in the bar get into it.

Maverick looks back to  Penny.  \\nPENNY \\nGreat to see you, Mav. \\nShe waves him away. Maverick is dragged back, hoisted bodily  into the air, carried to the door as the crowd chants: \\nCROWD \\nOVERBOARD. OVERBOARD. \\nAt the piano, Rooster plays on, his friends singing.
