Pandora's forests
hold many dangers.


But the most dangerous
thing about Pandora is…


that you can come to
like her too much.


We sing the chords to remember.
Each pearl is a story from our life.


A gem for the birth of our son.


Not finished!


Not finished!


A gem for our adopted
daughter, Kiri, -


- born of Grace's avatar, -


- and whose conception
was a complete mystery.






A gem for the first
meeting with Eywa.


The people say we
live in Eywa, -


- and Eywa lives in us.


The almother takes care
of all her children.


Happiness is straightforward.


Think a toad like
me would find it.


The first time I met your
father, I tried to kill him.


Love at first sight.


Before I knew it, we had four.


We sent the sky people back to
Earth, but some stayed here.


Scientists who were
loyal to the Na'vi.


And then there was Spider.
He was trapped here.


Too young for a cryocapsule.


The war had taken his parents, so
he was raised by the scientists.






He was like a stray cat
that kept coming running.


He and our kids
were inseparable.


To Neytiri he would always
be a stranger. One of them.


He belongs among his own.


- I had it first!
- Why do you have to have it?


I was a few years away from having
the language hammered into the tuber.


But now it comes
naturally to me.


I hate you!


I hate you to no end,
Lo'ak! Crazy face!


Whoa, that's good. Soon
firewood falls down.


He immediately emerges from
the rocks. There he is.


Like, take it.


Neteyam, the great
fisherman. Good boy.


- It's a big crab.
- By the stones, as you said.


- How tall is he? - So tall.


Time flies. Like a dream.


- Kiri. - Come here, bro.


Smile, skxawng.


Happiness is straightforward.


It can be a date night
without children.


There's just that about luck...


that it can end abruptly.


A new star in the night sky.


That could only mean one thing.


Ships slowing down.


The Sky People had returned.


A YEAR LATER


The pulse rises.


They'll probably make
it. Take it easy.


Good pupillary reaction.


Remove it there.


Colonel, can you hear me?


Please lie down.


- Stun him! - Hurry up!


- Call the guards! - Grab him!


Hold him! Calm down, Colonel!


It's me, Corporal Wainfleet!


Lyle? Is it you?


Yes, and Z Dog.


And Fig.


Just let me go. I'm
completely calm.


It didn't matter.


Attention. Two minutes
to land on Pandora.


The umbilical cord is gone.


Oxygen uptake: 89.


In case you were in any doubt,
you are Colonel Miles Quaritch, -


- just younger, taller,
bluer and less pretty.


In two hours I will
attack the Na'vi fortress.


It was thought advisable
that I make this backup.


And if you see it, it means
I've put the clogs away.


Parker, what the
hell else can I say?


Just remind him how it works.


Your memories and your personality
are sent back to Earth, -


- where you are being cultivated.
You will have them instilled…


Is it me or you doing this?


The idea is to transfer the psyche from
the toughest extraterrestrial actors -


- as Corporal Wainfleet
there and signed -


- til recombinant body.


You are a recombinant souled
with my memories and my charm.


You won't be able to remember my
death because it hasn't happened yet.


And it won't come
to that either.


Whatever happened, you as a clone
of me will thirst for revenge, -


- primarily over Jake Sully.


Remember that a Marine
can never be defeated.


You can kill us, but
we'll regroup in hell.


Semper fi.


Land force, now!


Day ago!


Two minutes, guys.


- We have to go down there, bro.
- Father will kill us.


Now don't be such a douchebag.


Lo'ak, come back!


The entire box must be included,
both magazines and rocket guides.


- Come on bro! - Lo'ak!


Take it. Take a weapon, kid.


Lo'ak, you don't even
know how to use it.


Dad showed me that.


A helicopter gunship!


Come on bro!


Lo'ak, where are you? Netay!


Are you unharmed?
where is your brother


- Over there. - Hurry away!


Not finished!


Oh no.


Far?


What the hell were
you doing here?


Pardon.


Sorry, Dad.


We're not in Kansas anymore.


We're on our way to Pandora.


I know you are all asking
yourselves the same question:


Is it blue monday?


The sins of the past have made us
reborn in the form of our enemies.


We have their size, their
strength, their speed.


Added to our training,
it's a powerful cocktail.


- Have we got a mission?
- We have that.


Our mission is to find and kill
the leader of the na'vi rebel army.


Him they call "toruk makto".


Jake Sully.


Attack, attack! Got you!


Come on now, Tuk.


I'm clearly faster when I'm blue.
And the animals show me more respect.


- They don't see me as a person.
- Wait, are you human?


They are coming!


THE FORTRESS OF THE OMATIKAYAS


They come! Kiri! Spider!


The warriors have
returned! Came!


Come along.


- Mor! - Tuck, Tuck, Tuck.


Step up.


You are scouts. You must keep an
eye out for enemies. At a distance!


Does that sound familiar? Here I let
you fly a mission and then you disobey.


- Kiri, help with the wounded.
- My brother is also injured.


- Tuk, go with her.
- Father, I take full responsibility.


Yes, because you are the oldest
and you must behave accordingly.


- MaJake, your son is bleeding.
- It doesn't matter, mother.


Go in and get patched up.


You must be aware that you
almost had your brother killed.


You are banned from
flying for a month.


Look at the Ukrainians. All of them.
And wipe the nastiness off your face.


- Should I breathe on it?
- Give him this.


- I would use yalnabark.
- Aha. Who is tsahik here?


You are, grandma, but
yalnabark is better.


- It hurts less.
- Mighty warriors.


What is it?


Neteyam and Lo'ak try
to live up to you.


It's hard for them.


I know.


You are hard on them.


I am their father.
That's my job.


We are not a platoon.
We are a family.


I thought we had lost him.


- Hi there. - Hey, Spider.


- I'll knock you out.
- Just come.


Only avatars are allowed
here. Walk around.


- The blue stripes don't make you bigger.
- I can still spread you out.


- What a day. - It was long.


Very funny. It is so clean down there
that you can breathe earth air for hours.


I can only inhale
yours for ten seconds.


Yes, it's downright,
monkey cat. For you.


- Hey, Max. - Hey, kids.


Hi Mom.


Maybe I'm getting cocky,
but I see real evidence -


- on a systemic response
at global level.


I can not...


I will not use the
word "intelligence".


"Awareness" is
probably a better word.


It's as if the entire
biosphere on Pandora -


- is conscious and able
to respond cognitively.


I can't say that.
Then they crucify me.


Who do you think did her roe?


- It was guaranteed Norm.
- Definitely.


- You don't deserve to live.
- Think about it.


He is with her constantly.


I wanted to commit suicide.
I wanted to drink acid.


He is in all recordings. Look
at the look he gives her.


I imagine their avatars
together out in the woods…


Ad!


It's not always cool to
know who your father was.


Hole in it. I don't
even remember him.


No, Spider...


Spider...


You are not him.


BRIDGEHEAD CITY


Inside the terminal!


No stay! Go!


Masks off.


Colonel, it's the general.


General Ardmore.


Nice to meet you, Colonel.
I hear good things.


But a lot has changed since
you were here last. Came.


The new command center here
has just been commissioned.


The crowd fitters can erect
a building in six days.


We have done more here in one year
than in the previous 30 years.


We are not here to run a mine. I
have a far more important mission.


The earth is dying.


Our task is to tame
the wilderness -


- with the aim of making Pandora
the new home of humanity.


But before we can do that, we
have to pacify the savages.


Sully's whims have become
bolder and more frequent.


His attacks are well executed. There is
good coordination between the troops.


They go after mines and pipelines
and sabotage our supply chain.


They attacked a mag
train two days ago.


- Do we know anything about Sully's base?
- Yes. Show me the mountains.


There is a cave system in
the Hallelujah Mountains.


But every time we send troops
up there, we suffer losses.


It's like poking a wasp's nest.


After ten minutes in their
airspace they swarm around us.


Colonel, we think your blue team
will be mistaken for natives -


- and not trigger
an immune reaction.


How do we test that hypothesis?


The hard way.


Wonderful.


- We are approaching enemy airspace.
- Received.


- Come on, monkey!
- Wait for me!


- Tuk, come on. - Okay, okay.


Why did you bring her?


The honking princess. "I'm gossiping.
You must not go out to the battlefield.


I'll tell mother if
you don't take me."


Come on.


- How crazy! - Is there a body?


Hold that up.


Kiri? Kiri.


Kiri. Kiri...


- Are you okay?
- I did it again, didn't I?


Yes, you did.


Skin!


- We have to see to come back.
- Came.


What is it?


We must be home before dark.


- Too big to be human.
- Avatars?


Maybe, but not any of ours.


- What are you doing?
- Following the tracks.


Keep your back covered.


Secured.


Make a call.


Holy shit.


We shouldn't be here at all.


Dad gives you a no-fly zone
for the rest of your life.


We have to look into it.


Bro, that's where your
father and my father fought.


- It's your father's suit.
- Holy shit...


Lyle, check for
data on the camera.


- It's stone dead, Colonel.
- We were too.


- I have to report this.
- We get so much trouble.


- They will Dog, it's Eagle Eye.
- Eagle Eye, come forward.


I've spotted someone.
They look like avatars, -


- but they wear camouflage and
assault rifles. There are six of them.


What is your position?


We are at the old cabin.


Who are we"?


Me, Spider, Kiri...


and Tuk.


Now you are listening very
well. Retreat silently.


- Hurry out of there. Understood?
- Yes. We are on the way.


Dad, I know a loophole.


- You get into so much trouble.
- Now stop, Kiri.


It's eclipse right away.


- Put it down or I'll shoot!
- Come with me.


- Drop it! - Right now!


Put it, put it.


Come here! Down on your
knees! Stop bragging.


- Visit them for weapons.
- Kiri!


Take it easy.


Shut up!


What do we have here?


Look, Colonel. Four
fingers. It's a half-breed.


Show me your fingers.


You're his, aren't you?


Yes, you are his.


Where is he?


Unfortunately I
don't speak English -


- with assholes.


Where is your father?


Should it be with it on?


Shut up!


- Kiri! No, don't!
- You don't touch her!


You mustn't hurt her.


- Stand still.
- What's your name, kid?


Spider Socorro.


Miles?


Nobody calls me that.


It was hell. I assumed you
had been sent back to Earth.


Children cannot
tolerate cryo, clap hat.


What do we do, boss?


Iron Sky, Blue 1 here.


- Blue 1, come forward.
- We are ready for collection.


- Fly us in.
- Dragonfly begins collection.


We bring very
valuable prisoners.


- Blue 1, we're on our way.
- Arrival in ten.


We're counting down.


Lyle, get me sound on this one.


- It's Sully's wife.
- She's a wild animal.


Giv op, Quaritch.


- Sully. - Stupid pig.


It's not over as long
as I'm breathing.


I was hoping you would say that.


- You stay with the Iranians.
- But I'm a warrior like you.


I won't say it again.


Bleach.


There is no more after that.


Should we salvage the remains?


Blue 1, we'll be there
in three minutes.


Three minutes.


Cover our backs.


Shut up!


Then clap in!


Skirmish in the rear!


Lo'ak!


You little shit!


- Tuck, come on! - Race!


Come along!


In cover!


Come now!


Is that you, Mrs. Sully? I
recognize your business card.


Come forward freely, Mrs. Sully. The
two of us have an unfinished business.


Demon! I will kill you as
many times as it takes.


You and the corporal have been
really diligent, haven't you?


You have raised a
litter of half-breeds.


After' four!


Run, run, run!


Are you okay, kid?
Follow me. Clear?


Not!


Come on!


- Run, run, run! - After them!


Spider?


- Spider! - Kiri!


Come here!


Spider is down there!


- Then we are ahead. We have ten minutes.
- Blue 1, back to the collection point.


- Blue 1, fall back. - Back!


Back, back! Take off!


Kiri, come on! Come on!


Run, run, run!


- Are you hurt? - No, I'm fine.


Tuk, are you hurt?


Then the danger is over.
Is everyone unharmed?


Tuk!


We made it.


Thank you, All
courage is, thank you.


Where is Spider?


They took him. They took him.


Take it easy, honey.
He's a cool kid.


He'll probably make it.


We'll probably make
it all together.


Before hell!


Let me out!


He has become like a savage.
He thinks he is one of them.


The Quaritch creature can wade in
here without Eywa spotting him.


- Our home is here.
- This applies to our children.


You can't ask me for that.


I cannot leave my
people. I will not.


He's chasing us. He's
after our family.


You can't ask me for that. The children
only know the forest. Our home is here!


He had our children. He
had them under his knife.


My father gave me the bow
here when he was dying.


He told me to protect the
people. You are toruk makto!


This will protect the people. Quaritch
has Spider and he knows everything.


He can lead them right here.


If the people hide us,
they will be killed.


Do you understand that?


I have nothing. I
don't have any plan.


But I can protect our family.


One thing I know.


Wherever we are,
family is our fortress.


- Where's Jake Sully?
- I do not know!


- We know, you know.
- I do not know!


Form a picture in your mind. Does
it represent the floating mountains?


- Release me!
- He bristles against.


Dan a thought, and we'll see.


- I do not know!
- I don't enjoy this either.


- Which clans protect him?
- I have no idea!


The forehead patch
goes absolutely crazy.


It won't stop until you
tell us where he is.


I don't know, you assholes!


Let me try the personal angle.


He is not your son.


Funny, Tarzan, funny.


Are you calm?


You're cool, kid. The researchers
gave you the rough file, -


- but you didn't
reveal anything.


I respect that.


Maybe you want this.


This is Colonel Miles
Quaritch. Deceased.


The decline in service.


I'm not him.


But I have his memories.


And they tell me, -


- that he wasn't the
world's best father.


But that is not an excuse.


I'm not your father. Technically,
the two of us are not related.


But I can help you. I
can get you out of here.


I won't ask you to betray Jake Sully.
You would never do that. You are loyal.


And I admire loyalty.


Now just take it.


Otherwise I must leave
you to the coattails.


My heart is heavy as stone.


Tarsem is young but wise. He
will become a strong olo'eyktan.


The leader must die...


so that the leader can be born.


Toruk makto will disappear.


The people will be
able to know for sure.


A father protects. That
is his purpose in life.


One life ends.


Another begins.


Oh, Tuk...


The sea clans inhabit a world of
their own. Thousands of islands.


An unknown area where we will be
able to disappear without a trace.


Aren't we there soon?


AWA'ATLU, IN METKAYINA-LANDSBY


Let it stay.


Follow me.


Tuk.


Behave nicely.


Behave nicely.


Take it easy.


What is it? Should
it represent a tail?


It is then too
small to swim with.


Hang on, Rotxo and Ao'nung.


Hi.


Tonowari was chief of the
Metkayina, the reef people.


- I see you, Tonowari.
- Jake Sully.


He was known as a harsh leader.


But it wasn't Tonowari
that worried me.


I see you, Ron al, the
tsahik of the metkayinas.


I see you, Ron al.


- What do you want from us, Jake Sully?
- We are looking for a trip...


- Uturu? - Asylum for my family.


We are reef people. You are forest
people. Your skills cannot be used here.


So we want to get to
know yours, right?


Their arms are thin.


Their tails are weak. You
will be slow in the water.


The kids aren't even true Na'vi.


Yes, we are.


There is demon blood in them!


Se her.


I was born of the sky people and
now I am na'vi. You can adapt.


We will adapt.


My husband was toruk makto.


He led the clans to victory
over the Sky People.


Do you call it a victory
to hide among strangers?


Eywa has apparently turned her
back on you, you chosen one.


You must bear with my mate. She has
flown a long way and is exhausted.


Toruk makto is a mighty war
hero. All Na'vi know his story.


But we Metkayina are not at war.


We can't let you
take the war here.


I'm done with war, okay?


I just want to
protect my family.


We have asked for an outing...


- Will we be sent away?
- It will be OK.


Toruk makto and his
family stay with us.


Consider them our brothers and
sisters. But they don't know the sea.


Therefore, they will be like
newborns taking their first breath.


Teach them about our way of life so that they
will not suffer the shame of being useless.


- What do you say then?
- Thanks.


So.


My son Ao'nung and daughter
Tsireya will guide your children.


- Why? - It has been decided.


Come and see our village.


This way.


Come on now, Tuk.


It's right up here.


This is your new home.


It's possible.


That's cool, huh?


- Sully is, step up.
- There is a family meeting.


- Down on your knees. - Kiri.


What?


I need you to behave in an
exemplary manner. I mean it.


Learn quickly, take your turn, and
avoid making trouble. Understood?


Bleach.


I want to go home.


Oh, Tuk...


Tuk, this is our home now.


We'll probably make it.


- As long as we look after each other.
- What is it that dad always says?


Sully is a stickler.


Yes, Sully is a stickler.
Then say it with conviction.


- Sully is a stickler.
- Sully is a stickler.


Come on!


Swim with us.


- What's wrong with them?
- They are bad at diving.


Stop. They just
have to learn it.


- Are you okay?
- You swim far too fast.


Just breathe.


You are not good at diving. You are
probably better at swinging in the trees.


- Stop it.
- We don't understand your sign language.


- I'll probably teach you that.
- Where has Kiri gone?


- Where is she?
- Have you seen her?


Hop on board, find a seat,
and don't get in the way.


- Come on, hurry up! - Coolest.


Stop halfway, Karl Smart.


Listen. There is a transmitter
built into the mask.


If you run away, I'll catch
you at zero point five -


- and gives you an old-fashioned
finish. Understood?


- Understood? - Yes.


- Clear? - All clear.


Listen carefully. Jake
Sully has gone underground.


But we'll probably find
him and his crazy madame.


To be able to do that,
we must be na'vi.


Too full screw.


We must eat like the Na'vi, ride like
the Na'vi and think like the Na'vi.


And first of all,
we must speak Na'vi.


Do you call that speaking na'vi?
You sound like a three year old.


Okay, klogeåge.


You've just been promoted from our
monkey mascot to our interpreter.


It's an illusion. If you want to
live here, you must be able to ride.


Tie the ribbon carefully.


Feel his breath.
Feel his strength.


Hold fast her.


- Look at his legs.
- Hold tight.


Everything okay, wood goblin?


This warwalker is difficult to master.
Maybe you should start with an il...


No, this one.


Remember, when diving, it is
important to take the right position.


I can do it.


Yes like that.


Calm.


I love her already.


Breathe in…


and exhale.


Imagine breathing into a flame.


You must say your heartbeat.


Breathe in.


Breathe all the way down here.


And exhale slowly.


Lo'ak, your heart beats
fast. Try to concentrate.


Breathe in…


and exhale. Empty your mind.


You are learning to breathe.


Come on, losers!


Let me.


What is it?


Na'vi children do this
with their bare fists.


- Did Sully do it the hard way?
- What do you think?


What do we do?


This is going to be good.


Forward.


It's you and me, baby.


Did I say you have to tie
the beak together first?


Ih, tak!


Forward!


Can you see them?


Come on, we have to move on.


Take off.


Yes, because!


That's right, Colonel!


Whose turn is it then?


The being of water has
no beginning and no end.


The sea is around
you and in you.


The sea is your home
before your birth...


and after your death.


Our hearts beat in
the lap of the world.


Our breath burns in the
shadows of the deep.


The sea gives and the sea takes.


Water ties everything together.


Life and death.


The dark and the light.


- I got it! Tsireya!
- You did it.


They let us breathe underwater.


What is she doing?


- Have no idea.
- She just stares at the sand.


What did you say?


Are you a form of deformity?


Are you a deformity?


No.


Are you sure? You
are not a real na'vi.


Look at those hands. See.


Skrid, fish face.


- Another four-fingered deformity.
- Look at his little baby tail.


- Let us be! - He's not normal.


Look at his tail.
It is very cute.


You heard her. Leave them alone.


Big Brother...


Step with you. Now.


Sensible. And from now on,
please respect my sister.


Come on.


Farewell!


They are deformities,
the whole family.


- Lo'ak... - Calm down bro.


Yes, my hand is weird.
I am a deformity.


But it can do something cool.
First I tie it really tight.


And then…


It's called a stroke, weakling. You
will never touch my sister again.


Hold on!


Stop it!


That's too stupid!


Off, my tail!


My ear! Let it go!
He rips my ear!


- What had I asked you?
- To avoid making trouble.


- It was my fault.
- You must not take out the rubbish for him.


Ao'nung called Kiri a deformity.


Say sorry to Ao'nung.
He is the chief's son.


I don't care how, as long
as you make peace with him.


- What did the others look like?
- Worse.


- Well. - Much worse.


Go away.


What's wrong?


Nothing. I'm fine.
Why shouldn't I?


Why can't I just be
like everyone else?


Skin...


What is the tree
runner doing here?


Sorry, I hit you a
whole bunch of times.


Let's be friends.


Join us on a hunt outside the
reef. This is where the men hunt.


- I must not.
- I asked the wrong brother.


Let's do it.


Come on!


Stay tuned, forest troll!


THE WOODEN BREAD CUTTERS


- You survived.
- It was awesome!


Come on, I know a good place.


Cold on the fish.


What a fool.


Gutter?


Yes!


It's not funny!


Yes!


Holy shit.


You are a tulkun.


You saved my life. Thanks.


So.


I have no idea what you said.


They have done you harm.


I try to pull it out.


Trust me.


Friends?


Yes, we are friends.


Bro!


I am sorry.


What's the matter, honey?
Do you miss Spider?


Yes, but it's not.


Okay. What is it then?


I can feel her, Dad.


- Mark who? - Eywa.


I can hear her breathing.
I can hear her heartbeat.


She is so close.


She is present...


like a word that is
right on the tongue.


I know you think I'm crazy.


You're not crazy, honey.


So what does Eywa's
heartbeat sound like?


Powerful.


Tell him what you told me.


Do you like stargazing?


My father came from a star.


The one right there.


- Lo'ak! - Now I'm on it.


We will meet again.


- The boy has been found!
- The Sully boy has been found!


Let me see you.


He is unharmed. It's
just a few scratches.


Give me strength not to
tear my eyes out at my son.


No. My son knew not to
take him outside the reef.


The fault is his.


Come on.


No. It's not Ao'nung's
fault. It was my idea.


Ao'nung actually tried
to talk me out of it.


- Lo'ak. - Pardon.


Come on.


I will probably.


- Is it true?
- What were you thinking?


You yourself said I should
be friends with them.


I don't want to hear about it. You
have brought shame on the family.


- Can I leave now?
- Next time I'll tie a knot in your tail.


- Is that understood?
- Yes. Lima Charlie.


- Where were you?
- You should keep an eye on your brother.


Pardon.


Why did you speak for me?


Because I know what it's like
to be one big disappointment.


Wish I had been there.
The sea gave you a gift.


The tulkuns have not come yet,
and no tulkun swims alone.


It did here.


He was missing his one fin.
The left one was only a stump.


Payakan. Det er Payakan.


- Who is Payakan?
- A young, unruly bull.


He is outcast and missing a fin.


- He was supposed to be a killer.
- He has killed Na'vi and Tulkuns.


- Far down south.
- He's not a killer.


- You're lucky you survived.
- Well, he saved my life.


- He is my friend.
- My little brother...


The mighty warrior who fought
a killer tulkun and survived.


You don't listen.


- I'm listening.
- Lo'ak, come back.


Payakan!


Payakan!


Payakan!


Good to see you.


Why are you outcast?
What happened?


It's too painful.


I trust you. You can trust me.


Oh, that's lame.


Faster!


So here we are.


The Vig of the Ancestors
is our holiest place.


Eclipse is the best
time to be here.


There it is. The Spirit Tree.


My pretty daughter.


Hi Mom.


It's nice to see you.
But you look worried.


Sweetie, it'll be fine.


- What's wrong?
- Why am I different?


What does the Almother want me?


Who was my father?


Oh, my own…


- Come now! - Kiri!


Skin!


- What's wrong?
- She had a seizure.


Is she breathing?


- Get her home to the village.
- Lets go!


- Good to see you.
- Neteyam, keep them away.


- How is she?
- Still unconscious.


No bleeding, no breakage.


The lack of oxygen has
not damaged the brain.


But there is interictal
activity in the frontal lobe.


She must have had a seizure.
We can rule out toxins.


- I'm not needed here.
- You are tsahik.


- Remove the remedies.
- Out! You have done nothing!


- Come on, we're taking a break.
- Let me just take the drop out.


Tuktirey.


She said she could feel
Eywa and hear her heartbeat.


- It is typical frontal lobe epilepsy.
- Epilepsy?


One sees visions and experiences religious
ecstasy like the one she described.


The association with the Spirit
Tree must have triggered it.


Don't let her do that again.


Never?


Jake, if she has another seizure
underwater, she could die.


Kiri, you are awake.


Kiri, sweet child.
My lovely girl.


Try this one: "I see you."


I said that too.


I don't know. Ngaati.


Okay, it's going out
through the nose.


Chief, one of the patrols has detected
a helicopter gunship on the radar.


- Where?
- Above the sea, 400 km to the north.


Hold fast.


The signal disappeared
out over the open sea.


But if you continue the course,
you will hit this archipelago.


There are hundreds of islands
with countless villages.


It's him. Give me some vessels and
I will return home with his scalp.


- We will be flown in.
- Skipper.


- Stop the engines. - Yes.


Are you Scoresby?


Are you the badass
taking my ship?


It is me.


The target is the
entire archipelago.


I've never been up there. You
know the waters. Who lives there?


Primarily metkayinas,
about 50 villages.


Who are you?


Ian Garvin, marinbiolog.


If there are 100 villages,
we search them all.


I hunt tulkuns. That's what
we do. I have quotas to meet.


I'm being polite the first
time. Then it's over.


If you can't avoid
it, get into it.


- All men at their posts!
- Hello, no pills.


- Rudder threads, airspeed.
- Yes.


- What was it?
- What's going on?


The Tulkuns have returned! Our
brothers and sisters are back!


Their endless cycle of wandering
had brought the Tulkuns home.


Skin!


- Kiri, come!
- Tuk, leave me alone.


- What is it you want? - Look!


Let's go out and meet them.


There is my soul sister.


Sister, I see you.


I see you and I am happy.


Your son is very handsome.


Thanks. How is your little one?


My little one is strong.


I have met a boy.


Now stories had to be told about
the time they had been apart.


About death and births.


About old friends and new love.


TA'UNUI-LANDSBY


Keep calm.


We are looking for weapons,
radios, technical equipment.


Down on your knees!
Can you see it here?


Shut up!


We know this man resides somewhere
here on the islands. Is he here?


Our tribe lives in seclusion. The man
in the picture is from the forest.


- What is he saying?
- That forest people never come here.


I don't buy it.


He must search in the forest
if he is to find that man.


They know nothing.


Shoot that animal.


What are you doing?


Take it easy.


Are your ears working now? Now
you have seen what they can do.


Jake Sully. Toruk makto!


He knows nothing.


Kill her.


Stop! Stop!


Cut it out of cardboard for him. If he
doesn't expose Sully, we'll kill the tsahik.


No, I refuse. I don't
want to be part of this.


They know nothing!


Are we really going to kill her?


You must not do that. What you
are doing here is so wrong!


Do not.


- Burn the cabins.
- Set them on fire.


Set fire to it all!


- Forgive me. I did not know it.
- You must stop the madness!


- Forgive me. - We have slipped.


Don't touch me!


Come on. Sit up!


- What's wrong? - Sky people.


They're looking for you down south. They
have a human boy with them who speaks Na'vi.


- Have they killed anyone?
- Not yet.


They threaten to, but no one will
reveal where you are. On my command.


We must hunt this demon.
Catch him and kill him.


We have to think about it.


If we attack Quaritch, they will
follow us here with their full force.


So what do we do?


We are looking for toruk
makto! Has he been here?


- It is no use.
- They are silent as the grave.


If we continue, he'll just run
away. We have to lure him out.


I'm done. I have quotas to meet.


Do you want to
hunt? Then we hunt.


Well not here? There are
too many villages here.


No no no.


They do not understand the bond
of community between the Tulkuns -


- and the Havna'vi. It would
be like murdering their family.


If we hunt here, the
savages will come after us.


Exactly. One definitely wild.


I know how you feel.


I also feel completely alone.


Tell me. Why were you expelled?


I am sorry. It
hurts me terribly.


It is okay.


You allowed it.


You allowed him to
bond with the outcast.


Tsireya... You
disappoint me, daughter.


And you are the son of a great warrior.
You are better raised than that.


Payakan saved my life.
They don't know him.


Sit.


Sit.


Sit down!


Hear my words, boy.


In the time of the first songs, the
tulkuns fought among themselves -


- to gain territory
and to get revenge.


But they realized that
killing, justified or not, -


- just leads to more killing.


Therefore, it was
forbidden to kill.


It is the way of
life of the tulkuns.


Payakan is a killer and
therefore he is an outcast.


- Sorry, but you are wrong.
- Lo'ak, you are speaking to the olo'eyktan.


- Well... - That's good!


I know what I know.


Then it's good.


I'll take care of him.


The storm will
probably blow over.


Lo'ak, I saw something today.


I saw a forest boy
selected by a tulkun.


I am very proud of you.


It was not Payakan who
killed the boys. I saw it.


The demon ship killed his mother,
so he gathered the young bulls -


- and the reef boys to attack the
ship, and they were all killed.

What’s the confidence rate?  
29.1%.  
Print it.  
GRIOT (V.O.) SHURI 
Shuri runs over to a 3D printer, where lasers begin to build  a mature HEART SHAPED HERB SEED.  
GRIOT (V.O.) 
The synthetic herb will have a less  
than 30% chance of effectiveness.  
SHURI 
I DON’T CARE! 
(to herself) 
Come on, come on, come on.  
Tears well in Shuri’s eyes as the herb is printed. She pulls  it out and turns for the door, but stops as she sees RAMONDA  standing in the doorway... her face tear soaked.  
SHURI (CONT’D) 
Griot, what is my brother’s heart  
rate?  
Shuri waits for a response... nothing.  
RAMONDA 
The King...  
(long beat) 
Your brother is with the ancestors.  
Shuri stares back at her mother, heartbroken.

Okoye nods at the other Dora, and they walk over to the  casket and lift it. 
A2 EXT. NORTH TRIANGLE - GOLDEN CITY - WAKANDA - DAY A2 
It’s a full SECOND LINE. A funeral procession of Ramonda,  Shuri, Sope, the Tribal Elders, M’Baku, Okoye and the Dora  lead a SEA OF DRUMMING, DANCING WAKANDAN PEOPLE toward  Bashenga Triangle where TRADITIONAL DANCERS PERFORM.  
Okoye and the Dora lead the way holding T’Challa’s casket.  Behind them Shuri and Ramonda walk holding T’Challa’s  traditional shield and helmet, respectively. A SINGER,  TALKING DRUMMERS, AND DJEMBE DRUMMERS lead the Tribal Elders  behind them. BURUNDI DRUMMERS stand on the ceilings of North  Triangle homes.  
They carry the casket into...  
B2 EXT. BASHENGA TRIANGLE - NORTH TRIANGLE - WAKANDA - DAY B2 
The Dora pass the casket through the entryway and set it down  in front of BASHENGA’S HUT. ZAWAVARI, the new Shaman for  Wakanda and former Mining Tribe Elder, waits for the  procession to land. She ululates and performs a prayer in  Xhosa as they approach.  
ZAWAVARI (SUBTITLE) 
Here in front of the home of King

IN THE SKY the ROYAL TALON FIGHTER flies past the palace  towards Bashenga Triangle. It hovers 300ft above T’Challa’s  casket.  
Shuri sees this with everyone dancing around her and  
something changes in her face, she moves towards the casket  and holds it one last time.  
She looks up as the casket continues to rise. The rest of the  Wakandans watch as the casket tilts into a vertical position  with the life-size panther seal giving a Wakanda Forever  salute.  
The Wakandans all salute T’Challa, holding their arms to  their chests for him, one last time.  
The casket enters the iris of the Royal Talon Fighter, and  the aircraft rockets off towards the Hall Of Kings where he  will be laid to rest.  
The Wakandans release the salute in unison, all except Shuri,  who still holds her arms tight to her chest. Head down.  
ROLL MARVEL LOGO 
Under the logo we HEAR global reactions to T’Challa’s death:  “We are profoundly saddened by the shocking news of King  T’Challa’s death.” “This is a day of mourning for all  nations.” “We lost another giant.” “With his words and  actions, King T’Challa touched the world. He will never be  forgotten.” “He was not only a noble man but an inspiring  hero so we celebrate his image in all of us.”

UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE 
Mr. Chairperson, I believe I speak  
for all of the member states when I  
say, I am deeply disappointed by  
Wakanda’s failure to stand by the  
promises made after the blip by the  
late King T’Challa. Promises to  
participate in global efforts to  
tackle international challenges, to  
share resources, technology and  
full technical cooperation  
concerning vibranium. 
(beat) 
Promises, Mr. Chairperson, that the  
Queen of Wakanda is failing to  
deliver on. The United States  
shares a deep concern over the lack  
of Wakanda’s transparency and urges  
meaningful dialogue in consultation  
with key partners and Wakanda to  
strengthen efforts to achieve our  
commitments to international  
development and security. Thank  
you, Mr. Chairperson. 
The Other Dignitaries nod in agreement. Ramonda looks back  silently and strongly.  
CHAIRPERSON OF UN 
My thanks to the Secretary of State  
of the United States of America for  
that statement. I now give the  
floor to the Minister of Foreign  
Affairs for France.  
SECRETARY OF STATE OF FRANCE (SUBTITLE) 
(in French) 
Thank you, Mr. Chairperson, France  
has information that states  
vibranium has limitless potential  
as a renewable energy source. And  
yet Queen Ramonda has still  
declined to open access to the  
material through international  
trade, or any of Wakanda’s  
philanthropic ventures. We also  
have information that vibranium can  
be used to make weapons of mass  
destruction. It is a substance that  
does not trigger any known metal  
detector. It could be smuggled. It  
is a direct threat to the global  
security environment and the  
nonproliferation regime.

8 INT. UNITED NATIONS - GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - DAY 8 The Secretary of State of France continues.  
SECRETARY OF STATE OF FRANCE (SUBTITLE) 
(in French) 
I would like to put the question to  
her majesty. “Why is there so much  
secrecy around this particular  
resource?” “If her nation’s  
intentions really are to help other  
nations, why is that help only  
extended to certain groups of  
people in those nations?” And “what  
of our intelligence in France, in  
Belgium, and in the United States,  
that vibranium has properties that  
can be weaponized?”  
(beat) 
Mr. Chairperson, Wakanda has  
deliberately chosen, in a recurrent  
manner, to defy our collective  
security architecture. The  
durability of our international  
security would be at stake if we  
were to overlook the potential  
threat of vibranium today. Thank  
you, Mr. Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON OF UN  
My thanks to the Minister of  
Foreign Affairs for France. I now  
give the floor to her majesty,  
Queen Ramonda. 
Ramonda leans into her mic.  
RAMONDA 
Thank you Mr. Chairperson,  
Wakanda’s offerings to the global  
community do not begin and end with  
our nation’s most valuable  
resource. It has always been our  
policy to never trade vibranium  
under any circumstance. Not because  
of the dangerous potential of  
vibranium, but because of the  
dangerous potential of some of the  
people in this room.

You see we have information in  
Wakanda as well. You perform  
civility here. But we know what you  
whisper in your halls of  
leadership, in your military

The King is dead. The Black Panther

protector. Now is our time to  
strike.  
9 INT. SAND FILTER TREATMENT FLOOR - NIGHT 9 
The Female Mali Tech keys into the vault triggering an  elaborate locking mechanism that opens the dark, cavernous  vault.  
She then steps back, removing her scarf, tucking it behind  her back. 
Merc #2 turns to the Female Tech, confused. She looks back at  him her expression now icy, her head clean shaven and smooth.  This is ANEKA of the Dora Milaje.

The unnerved Mercenaries look into the safe as someone steps  forward from darkness. It’s OKOYE, in full Dora Milaje  regalia. As she steps forward we reveal AYO and NOMBLE  flanking her.  
OKOYE 
PHAMBILLI!!! 
On cue, both clusters of hostages trigger dome shaped SONIC  FORCEFIELDS from their KIMOYO BEADS.  
THE DORA SPRING INTO ACTION. The Mercenaries unleash a HAIL  of automatic gunfire, but it is ineffective against the  DORA’S BALLETIC COMBAT MOVEMENT, vibranium weave uniforms,  and high tech spears.  
Okoye and the other Dora DISPATCH THE MERCENARIES. 
Nomble throws her spear up at the upper level where we reveal  ANOTHER DORA disguised as a scientist taking out another Merc  on the upper level.  
Aneka pulls 2 PURPLE ENERGY DAGGERS as SHE AND AYO fight back  to back while Okoye hits Mercs with the HIGH POWERED TASER on  the back end of her spear, rendering them unconscious.  
Aneka dispatches Merc #2. Okoye clocks this.  
OKOYE (CONT’D) 
Aneka, where is your spear?  
ANEKA 
The Princess gave me these to try  
out. I like them better.  
Okoye takes out another Merc. 
OKOYE 
We are Dora Milaje. Not space  
cadets. Our foremothers used spears  
for millennia. It will not change  
under my watch.  
Ayo blocks a bullet for Aneka and takes out a Merc.  
AYO 
I told you not to bring them.  
Aneka rolls her eyes and takes down another Merc with the  daggers.

Ramonda looks around as everyone reacts to this information.  
RAMONDA (CONT’D) 
And as for the identity of the  
attackers.  
Ramonda stands. The doors of the chamber swing open,  revealing Okoye, Ayo, Aneka, and several DORA, escorting the  now conscious and handcuffed Mercenaries from Mali,  
delivering them to the desk of the Frenchman. The dignitaries  and UN Staff react.

Let our gracious response to this  
incursion be an olive branch.  
Further attempts on our resources  
will be considered an act of  
aggression and met with a much  
steeper response. 
(beat) 
We mourn the loss of our King, but  
don’t think for a second, that  
Wakanda has lost her ability to  
protect our resources. We are aware  
of the ongoing efforts by some to  
find Vibranium outside of Wakanda  
and wish you the best of luck.  
The leaders deflate. All except... the United States  Secretary of State.

11 EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY 11 A CARGO SHIP travels in the middle of the Atlantic.  
An enormous underwater mining vehicle sits on deck as a DATA  UMBILICAL CORD extends off the back into the water.  
12 EXT. DEEP OCEAN - DAY - CONTINUOUS 12 
We see what is connected to the umbilical cord: A LARGE  VIBRANIUM DETECTOR on treads, rolls along the ocean floor  below the ship as they move together through the water until  an INDICATOR LIGHT changes colors.  
13 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - DAY 13 
An advanced control system with several DEEP SEA MINING  TECHNICIANS monitoring readings. 
SMITTY (50s, CIA) sits to the side, playing PUBG Mobile on  his phone, when a display reading suddenly CHIRPS, grabbing  everyone’s attention.  
Excited miners gather, wide-eyed as Smitty turns to the LEAD  MINING TECHNICIAN who nods.  
Getting to his feet, Smitty grabs a walkie-talkie.  
SMITTY

Stop the ship! 
14 EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 14 
The LARGE MINING VEHICLE is missing from the deck but A GROUP  OF HEAVILY ARMED MILITARY TYPES have replaced it.  
Smitty, holding two coffees watches as A CHOPPER LANDS and  JACKSON and SALAZAR, two specialized NAVAL DIVERS, disembark  followed by DR. GRAHAM (50s, CIA). Smitty casually salutes  her. She smiles and takes the coffee.  
DR. GRAHAM 
I thought you were retired.  
SMITTY

Smitty shrugs, then lets out a whistle to the Military Types  who start unloading gear.  
15 EXT. DECK - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT - LATER 15 A CRANE removes a MOON POOL COVER, exposing the ocean below.  
Military Types guard the umbilical cable system that extends  over the edge of the ship.  
Salazar and Jackson are strapped into ATMOSPHERIC DIVING  SUITS and lowered into the ocean.  
16 INT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT 16 
The moonlight barely penetrates the water as we TRACK ALONG  THE CABLES, ascending to greater and greater depths until...  
We see Salazar and Jackson approaching the ocean floor...  STEAM FROM HYDROTHERMAL VENTS spewing into the water from a  distance.  
We reveal the expanse of the black depth around Salazar and  Jackson. As they descend further, distant LIGHTS ON AN  UNDERWATER MINING VEHICLE reveal their destination. 
SALAZAR 
Approaching the floor now. 
The VEHICLE has dug a large TRENCH, the VB DETECTOR (lights  on) sits close by. 
The JACKSON AND SALAZAR land, sending a thick CLOUD of  sediment up into the water.  
SALAZAR (CONT’D) 
We’ve touched down. 
17 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 17

Yeah, we see it. 
18 INT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT 18 
Salazar and Jackson step off the submersible, surveying the  landscape, then travel along the ocean floor. 
The divers approach the back of the enormous mining rig. As  they come around to the front, THE METAL DIGGING MECHANISM is  revealed.  
It’s completely DESTROYED, bent back on itself like scrap  metal. Then, as they near the trench, Salazar and Jackson’s  eyes grow wide. 
We reveal a large mining trench where the machine met its  fate... a SMALL VEIN of a METAL.  
DR. GRAHAM (O.S.) 
Salazar, report. 
SALAZAR 
Yeah. It’s astonishing. The drill  
seems to have made contact with a  
metallic substance. 
19 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 19 
Dr. Graham reacts to this, her poker face giving slight way  to excitement. Smitty sees this and beams.  
SMITTY 
I’ll be. Vibranium in the ocean. 
DR. GRAHAM 
Nicely done. Let’s get the detector  
out of there. It’s the only one  
we’ve got. 
20 INT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT 20 Salazar turns. 
Copy that.

21 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 21 
Dr. Graham watches as the monitor images from the underwater  camera feeds go dark at the loss of light.  
DR. GRAHAM  
Salazar, Jackson, I’ve lost  
visual...  
SALAZAR (O.S.) 
All the lights went out down here. 
22 INT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT 22 
Salazar and Jackson still have their SUIT MOUNTED LIGHTS,  granting them enough visibility to continue.  
JACKSON  
But we’re still good. 
Then, something catches Salazar’s eye.  
SALAZAR’S POV 
In the distance, a BIOLUMENESCANT ANIMAL floats toward them  rhythmically.  
SALAZAR 
Jackson, do you see this?  
23 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 23 
Dr. Graham glances at the display showing the DIVERS’ VITALS.  Salazar’s heart rate is slowly rising. 
DR. GRAHAM  
Salazar, what is your visual?  
24 EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT 24 
One of the Military Men notices something in the water: a  BLUE-SKINNED WOMAN (20s) treading water with her eyes trained  on the boat.

Jackson. Tell me you’re seeing  
this.  
Jackson approaches behind her, looking on, speechless, until  WOOSH, he’s snatched into the DARKNESS by an unseen FIGURE. 
Salazar awaits an answer, her eyes still on the creature. 
SALAZAR (CONT’D) 
(whispering) 
Jackson?  
Salazar turns to find nothing left of him but an umbilical.  
DR. GRAHAM (O.S.) 
Salazar, we just lost Jackson’s  
vitals. Can you see him?  
SALAZAR 
H-He’s gone.  
26 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 26 Dr. Graham and Smitty watch the monitors, dread setting in.  
DR. GRAHAM 
What do you mean he’s gone?  
27 INT. OCEAN FLOOR - NIGHT 27 
Salazar stares at Jackson’s severed umbilical with horror  while the SQUID comes within arm’s reach.  
She slowly spins and we see the squid EXPANDING.  
DR. GRAHAM (O.S.)

More Military Men come from the other side of the ship to see  and peering over, watch... 
30 EXT. OCEAN’S SURFACE - NIGHT 30 
The SWIMMING WOMAN... now joined by NINE OTHER TALOCANIL  WOMEN AND MEN, all staring at the ship.  
Some start to “sing” a guttural sound... like a cross between  a human and a whale. Others play OCARINAS. 
It’s haunting, otherworldly, but beautiful.  
31 EXT. BOAT DECK - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 31 
The men become TRANSFIXED by the SOUND, their facial muscles  going slack and they begin to walk toward the edge and JUMP  OFF! 
32 INT. CONTROL ROOM - CARGO SHIP - NIGHT 32

Dr. Graham unholsters her PISTOL. Smitty produces his own  PISTOL and cocks it. Smitty looks at the surveillance  monitors where he sees his SOLDIERS LEAPING INTO THE OCEAN.  
Disbelief sweeps across Smitty’s face. He opens the door and  HEARS the singing loudly. Immediately covering his ears, he  ducks back inside.  
SMITTY (CONT’D) 
It’s some sort of sonic attack.  
Shit.

Dying he looks up to see ATTUMA, a massive MALE TALOCANIL  (blue skinned humanoid) WARRIOR, pulls himself up onto the  boat deck.  
Dr. Graham looks back in terror as Attuma approaches and  Smitty dies. Attuma pulls his spear out and Dr. Graham fires  shots at him. Attuma Turns towards her as more TALOCANIL  WARRIORS scale the boat and land on the deck.  
She starts for the stairs leading to the Helicopter Pad, but  a SECOND TALOCANIL WARRIOR pulls onto it, cutting her off.  
She heads for a CATWALK that runs the length of the HELIPAD.

We don’t need the herb. We need new  
technology.

Green Rev. (07/11/21) 20. 
RAMONDA 
What of the Black Panther? The  
mantle -  
SHURI 
The mantle is a relic, mother. I  
wasn’t trying to save the Black  
Panther with the herb, I was trying  
to save my brother... and I failed. 
Ramonda studies Shuri closely. 
RAMONDA 
Do you know what day it is? 
Tuesday.  
SHURI 
Ramonda looks at her.  
RAMONDA 
The date, child.  
Shuri thinks on this. And it hits her.  
SHURI 
Brother’s passing. 
RAMONDA 
It has been a year.  
This hits Shuri very hard. She turns her back to Ramonda who  tries to embrace her, but Shuri steps away.  
Ramonda thinks for a beat while Shuri gathers herself.  
SHURI 
Do you have anything planned?  
RAMONDA 
Yes. It involves you taking your  
mother for a drive.  
SHURI 
Right now?  
RAMONDA 
Yes. And you can leave your kimoyo  
beads here. You won’t need them  
where we’re going. 
Shuri reluctantly takes them off and sets them on the table. 
Green Rev. (07/11/21) 20A. 
Green Rev. (07/11/21) 20A.
RAMONDA (CONT’D)

SHURI 
Ok Mother, where to?  
Green Rev. (07/11/21) 21. 
Green Rev. (07/11/21) 21.
RAMONDA 
You’ll see.  
47 EXT. WAKANDA - DUSK - SERIES OF SHOTS 47 
Shuri pilots her HOVERCRAFT with Ramonda in tow. We see  LITTLE RIVERTOWN and the natural wonders of the GOLDEN CITY  OUTSKIRTS as they head toward the Wakandan Bush.

49 EXT. RIVERBANK - WAKANDAN BUSH - NIGHT - HOURS LATER 49 
Shuri scoops water from a river while Ramonda tends to a  fire. A makeshift shelter sits behind them. 
RAMONDA 
In the River Tribe, we have a  
ritual to honor our connection to  
those that have passed on.  
SHURI 
There is a ritual for everything  
here. Somebody has died, you have  
to do the ritual. My neighbor hates  
me, oh just do ritual. I can’t find  
a boyfriend... don’t worry there’s  
a ritual for that. 
RAMONDA 
After your father died. I performed  
this ritual, with T’Challa by my  
side, and Nakia.  
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 23.
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 23. 
SHURI 
Ugh. Don’t mention her name. I know  
she hated being here, but that is  
no excuse for missing his funeral.  
Shuri hands a gourd to Ramonda and looks deep into the flame.  
RAMONDA 
If rituals are pointless to you,  
why does it bother you that she  
wasn’t there that day? What is a  
funeral if not a ritual? 
SHURI 
Because that was my brothers’ day.  
And for some stupid reason rituals  
mattered to him. I don’t have time  
for this, Mother. I need to get  
back to my lab.  
Suddenly, they hear a stirring in the bush. They observe as a  MOTHER ELEPHANT emerges from the brush with her TWO BABIES.  
Dangerous and majestic, she gently ambles over to the  riverbank with her young in tow.  
The Mother Elephant sprays water from the river onto her  young, bathing them and herself underneath the moonlit night. 
Ramonda and Shuri observe this quiet, almost spiritual  moment.  
RAMONDA 
You need to sit here with me, and  
with yourself. It’s the only way  
you are going to heal from the  
wound T’Challa’s death caused.  
SHURI 
I have healed.  
(beat) 
I wake up every day, and I work on  
things for Wakanda’s future. Even  
though my brother is gone.  
(alt) 
I’m not like I was before. I’m  
moving forward, even though my  
brother is gone.  
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 24.
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 24. 
RAMONDA 
T’Challa is dead. But that doesn’t  
mean he is gone. When Thanos took  
you and your brother from me, I had  
to lead a wounded nation and a  
broken world. But I still took time  
in the bush. I wandered until I  
found water and I sat, then I did  
this ritual that I am about to show  
you now. I found your brother in  
the breeze. Pushing me gently, but  
firm, like his hand on my shoulder.  
And I found you in the chirp of the  
sunbirds. It took some time, but  
you both were there.  
SHURI 
But that wasn’t us, mother. In the  
snap, everything that we were,  
ceased to exist. Our presence was a  
construct of your mind. Brought on  
so you could experience comfort, or  
joy.  
RAMONDA 
And what construct does your mind  
create when you think of your  
brother?  
(beat) 
Do they offer you comfort? Or  
torment?  
Shuri thinks on this, moved by her mother’s question. Ramonda  stands up.  
RAMONDA (CONT’D) 
Come, child.  
She leads Shuri back to the fire. She goes to her knapsack  and pulls out a pile of white garments. Shuri stares,  affronted. Ramonda hands a garment to Shuri.  
SHURI 
How did you get these?  
RAMONDA 
What does it matter? 
SHURI 
These are my clothes. How do they  
figure into your ritual?  
2nd White Rev. (08/12/22) 24A. 
2nd White Rev. (08/12/22) 24A.
RAMONDA 
Burning the funeral garments marks * the end of the mourning period.  
Ramonda casts her clothes into the fire.  
RAMONDA (CONT’D) 
And the beginning of a new  
relationship with our loved ones  
that have passed on.  
SHURI 
I was wearing those clothes, the  
last time I held him, mother.  
(turns, resolute) 
I cannot burn them.  
Shuri... 
RAMONDA 
2nd White Rev. (08/12/22) 25.
2nd White Rev. (08/12/22) 25. 
Shuri stares off. * 
SHURI * 
It’s not torment I feel. It’s rage. * My brother, who saved me, saved * Wakanda, saved the world. He showed * kindness and grace, even to his * enemies. And for what? For the love * of his life to run off and never * come back? For some illness to take * him before he was old enough to * grow gray hair? An illness. Not * even an enemy in combat. * 
RAMONDA * 
And that would have been better? * 
SHURI * 
Yes! Because then I could take my * revenge! I don’t want to sit with * you and think of my brother, * because I fear it won’t be clothes * I will want to burn, it will be the * world and everyone in it. * 
Ramonda looks at Shuri with compassion. * 
RAMONDA * 
Shuri, there is something I have to * tell you about your brother- * 
But then, something in the water startles the Mother Elephant  who rears back and SHRIEKS LOUDLY. She and her children RUN  in the opposite direction as...  
Shuri and Ramonda perk up. Ramonda stands and walks down  toward the river where the WATER STIRS.  
SHURI 
Mother! What are you doing?  
Shuri runs to Ramonda’s side just as A MAN’S head breaches  the surface of the river and NAMOR rises up, flying over the  surface of the water toward Ramonda and Shuri. He carries a  CONCH SHELL, his winged ankles on full display. 
SHURI (CONT’D) 
This better not be a part of the  
ritual... 
It’s not. 
RAMONDA 
2nd White Rev. (08/12/22) 25A.

RAMONDA (CONT’D) 
Stop! Right there! Who are you?!  
And how did you get in here?! Speak  
trespasser! 
Namor smiles and holds his hands up. He looks at Shuri almost  as if they have met before. 
NAMOR 
I mean you both no harm. This place  
is amazing. The air is pristine.  
Not a trace of pollution. 
(looks back at the water) 
And the water... 
(beat) 
My mother told stories of a place  
like this. A protected land with  
people that never had to leave,  
never had to change who they were.  
What reason did you have, to reveal  
your secret to the world?  
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 26.
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 26. 
Ramonda points her spear venomously now. 
RAMONDA 
I am not a woman who enjoys  
repeating herself. Who are you?  
NAMOR 
I have many names.  
RAMONDA 
Which one did your mother give you?  
Namor smiles at her bluntness.  
NAMOR 
She named me Ch’ah Toh Almehen,  
citizens of my realm call me  
Ku’Kul’Kan, and my enemies call me  
Namor.  
SHURI 
What kind of name is Namor 
RAMONDA 
Hush, child. 
(to Namor) 
Why are you here?  
NAMOR 
We have a problem. The American  
military detected Vibranium  
embedded beneath my nation’s  
domain. I was able to stop them  
from mining it, but I need  
Wakanda’s help to prevent it from  
happening again.  
RAMONDA 
Vibranium exists only here, in  
Wakanda.  
Namor offers the queen a questioning glance in response as  Shuri looks closely at Namor’s adornments.  
SHURI 
Mother, he’s covered in it. 
Ramonda observes Namor’s VB necklace and earrings. 
RAMONDA 
Where are you from?  
NAMOR 
The oceans. 
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 26A.
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 26A. 
Shuri jumps in.  
SHURI 
And the Americans detected it  
there? How? Detecting vibranium is  
practical impossible.  
Namor turns to Shuri. 
NAMOR 
They used a machine that we  
confiscated. Did you help them  
build it? 
SHURI 
Of course not.  
NAMOR  
We have information that the  
machine was designed by an American  
scientist. But we could not find  
any record on their identity. I  
would prefer to deal with the  
scientist as opposed to waging war  
on the entire nation.  
(beat) 
I imagine Wakanda has more diverse  
methods of gathering intelligence,  
and could find the identity of the  
scientist, and bring them to me.  
RAMONDA 
Why should we help you?  
NAMOR 
Your former King exposed the power  
of vibranium to the world. In  
response other nations have begun  
scouring the planet for it. We do  
not wish to be exposed, but your  
choices have compromised us. It is  
only fair that you help resolve our  
dilemma. 
RAMONDA 
You don’t sneak into our country  
and tell me what is fair. Wakanda  
will look into it if we deem it  
necessary.  
Namor smiles at this.  
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 27.Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 27. 
NAMOR 
I have more soldiers than this land  
has blades of grass. But my only  
desire is that my people remain  
hidden from the world. I hope you  
can understand my urgency, because  
I would hate to come back under  
different circumstances.  
(beat) 
There is a beautiful island off the  
coast of Madagascar: Nosy Nato. Do  
you know it?  
I do.  
RAMONDA 
Namor places the conch on the ground. 
NAMOR 
When you have the scientist, blow  
into this and place it in the ocean  
on the north beach. I’ll be there  
shortly afterwards.  
Namor turns to head back into the river as Ramonda and Shuri  sit with his threat for a moment. He peers back. 
NAMOR (CONT’D) 
And please for your sake, don’t  
mention anything about me to anyone  
outside of Wakanda.  
Namor eyes Shuri slyly.  
Princess. 
NAMOR (CONT’D) 
Namor dives back into the river, DISAPPEARING BENEATH THE WATER.  Shaken, Ramonda and Shuri share looks. 
SHURI 
Did you see those things on his  
ankles?  
RAMONDA 
(impatient) 
Come on, Shuri. 
Shuri reluctantly starts back for the shelter with Ramonda  only to freeze as sitting by their fire, dripping with water  is the... LARGE VB DETECTOR from the cargo ship. Ramonda and  Shuri gape at it. 
Yellow Rev. (06/28/21) 28.
Yellow Rev. (06/28/21) 28. 
RAMONDA (CONT’D) 
We must convene the council.  
50 INT. TRIBAL COUNCIL ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 50 
M’BAKU, flanked by FOUR JABARI WARRIORS, marches in with a  leisurely swagger, chomping a PURPLE BROCCOLI STALK.  
Ramonda, Okoye, Ayo, Aneka and the TRIBAL ELDERS (RIVER TRIBE  ELDER, MERCHANT TRIBE ELDER, BORDER TRIBE ELDER, and the  MINING TRIBE ELDER) are all gathered around in a circle.  
The DORA MILAJE are flanked out across the room in their  traditional spots. THREE NAVAL OFFICERS are here as well,  contrite. 
Everyone gives wary looks as M’Baku enters, prepared for his  antics. He doesn’t disappoint.  
M’BAKU 
So our river border has been  
breached? I once more offer the  
support of my Jabari Hell screamers. If my soldiers were  
present this... fish man would be  
bound before us as we speak.  
OKOYE 
If you’re soldiers were present  
they’d still be choking on their  
furry costumes.  
RAMONDA 
Show some respect you two.  
M’BAKU 
Respect? They allowed an outsider  
to walk directly up to our Queen.  
What good is Wakanda if we cannot  
protect our borders? These men  
should not show their faces. 
(to River Tribe Elder) 
Why are they guarding the river  
anyway? Because they did well in  
swimming school? 
M’Baku points to M’BELE, one of his accompanying warriors.  
M’BAKU (CONT’D) 
Take M’Bele there. He swims with  
the gracefulness of a cinder block,  
but he would die before he allowed  
a fish man to swim up to our Queen.  
Yellow Rev. (06/28/21) 28A. Yellow Rev. (06/28/21) 28A.
RAMONDA 
M’Baku, if you are done with your  
lecture, I would like to discuss  
the matter at hand.  
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 29.
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 29. 
OKOYE 
There is no aerial surveillance  
footage of him.  
NAVAL OFFICER 
And nothing on radar as well. 
The elders look at the officer like he is out of his mind.  
RIVER TRIBE ELDER 
So he swam underwater for 60 miles.  
RAMONDA 
And claims to command a massive  
army.  
MERCHANT TRIBE ELDER 
He wants us to deliver one American  
scientist? So he can kill them.  
RAMONDA 
He didn’t explicitly state that,  
but I believe that is his  
intention.  
So do it. 
MINING TRIBE ELDER 
(off the council’s  
reactions) 
We have never faced an enemy with  
access to Vibranium before, and we  have no Black Panther to protect  
us. 
M’BAKU 
Because this wise council allowed  
Killmonger to take the throne and  
burn up all of your precious Heart Shaped Herb. Ramonda ponders this.  
RAMONDA 
What would you have us do?  
M’BAKU 
We find the fish man and kill him. 
BORDER TRIBE ELDER 
Who is being foolish now? You would  have us make war with a man we know  nothing about. At least we have  
intelligence on the Americans.  
Goldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 30.
Goldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 30.

M’BAKU 
If we do what he wants now what’s  
to prevent him from coming back and  
asking for more? 
Ramonda considers. 
51 INT. SHURI’S LAB - WAKANDAN DESIGN GROUP - DAY - LATER 51 
Shuri has the VB DETECTOR in pieces like a mechanic, STUDYING  its parts with deep fascination as Ramonda and Okoye walk in. 
Okoye observes a hologram of the MIDNIGHT ANGELS prototypes.  Shuri clocks this.  
OKOYE 
Princess, is it just me, or did  
these things get uglier?  
Shuri rolls her eyes. 
SHURI 
It’s you. I haven’t touched them  
since the last time you saw them. 
Ramonda studies the vibranium detector. 
RAMONDA 
So, does it work? 
SHURI 
Yes, I’m still not sure how they  
did it though. It can detect the  
altered frequency of vibranium  
through water, stone, even heavy  
metals.  
(beat) 
Whoever built this is brilliant.  
RAMONDA 
Brilliant, like you? 
SHURI 
Of course not. But it’s strange -  
the parts are mismatched. Some are  
custom, others look like they  
pulled it from a junkyard. 
RAMONDA 
Have you ever tried to make one  
here? 
Goldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 30A.
Goldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 30A. 
SHURI 
Vibranium is all around us. We have  
never needed anything like this.  
Necessity breeds invention. 
Okoye ponders this.  
OKOYE 
I can’t believe it exists outside  
of Wakanda. How is that possible?  
SHURI 
Perhaps the meteorite that struck  
the continent, broke apart as it  
entered the earth’s atmosphere. The  
planet is mostly covered by water.  
It’s reasonable that some landed  
there.  
RAMONDA 
This changes everything we know.  
OKOYE 
The Great Mound. All of the legends  
and fables. Those stories are  
seared in my mind. 
SHURI 
That sounds very painful. 
Okoye ignores her.

RAMONDA 
Do the War Dogs have any leads? 
Nothing. (beat) 
OKOYE 
I have an idea, but I’m going to  
need the Princess. 
(alt) 
No, but I have an idea. I’m going  
to need the Princess. I have to  
deal with that churlish little  
American. She’s good at that. 
RAMONDA 
Out of the question. She is in no  
state to be in the field.  
OKOYE 
My Queen, with all due respect. It  would do her some good to get out.  She has been isolated in this lab  
since it happened. May be just what  May be just what she needs. 
(beat) 
Besides, I can handle an American  
assignment with my eyes closed.  
RAMONDA 
It is not the Americans that I am  
worried about. 
(unnerved) 
This Namor... he snuck past our  
defenses.

52 EXT. ROSS' HOUSE - VIRGINIA - EARLY MORNING 52 EVERETT ROSS exits wearing running gear and begins to jog. 
A52 EXT. VIRGINIA WOODS - EARLY MORNING A52 
Ross runs through a thick wooded area. After some distance,  he notices a FLYING BUG and bats at it.  
The bug comes at him again and Ross steps back. The bug  mimics him. Ross looks closely, discovering it’s a WINGED  KIMOYO BEAD DRONE. Ross eyes around, realizing he’s being  summoned. The drone flies off and he follows.

Shuri steps into a cluttered college apartment. Riri walks in  behind her, closes the door.  
RIRI 
What the hell are you doing here?  
Are you doing a guest lecture or  
something?  
SHURI 
I’m here about the vibranium  
detector you made for the CIA.  
RIRI 
I didn’t build that detector for  
the CIA. I built it for my  
metallurgy class.  
Shuri can’t help but smile at this.  
SHURI 
It was a school project?  
RIRI 
Yeah. My professor said it was  
impossible. Not the first time that  
someone took a look at me and  
didn’t think I was worth shit. To  
be young, gifted and black, right?

...You probably don’t say that in  
Wakanda. So, I had to do it.

Okoye grips her COLLAPSED SPEAR. 
OKOYE

Riri hurls the speaker at Okoye’s head. It sails end over end  at Okoye, who extends her spear and cuts clean through it  like a game of Fruit Ninja.

She grabs  a lightning connector cable and extends it out, plugs it into  her iPhone and begins to punch in an absurdly long security  code.

Shuri walks over to the window, Okoye and Riri follow behind  her. They look outside to see.  
SEVERAL ARMED FEDERAL OFFICERS surround the garage. An  ARMORED CAR has the driveway blocked, and a HELICOPTER  CIRCLES THE SKY. FEDS POKE THE TIRES SHURI’S LEXUS.  
RIRI  
I thought you said a merman was  
after me. That’s the Feds.  
Ripping blueprints from the walls and grabbing them from  tables, Riri dumps them into a barrel that she lights on fire. 
SHURI 
THEY’RE NOT HERE FOR YOU.

Shuri sighs, rounding to the passenger’s side of the  Barracuda. But before climbing in, she slyly attaches a  Kimoyo Bead to the hood. 
Okoye gets behind the wheel as TEAR GAS CANNISTERS and FLASH  BANG GRENADES suddenly crash through the windows... and TWO  HEAVILY ARMED LAW OFFICERS slam through the second garage  door.

Dislodging the rebreathers, the Talocanil gasp for water and  Okoye lands kill shots on each.  
She looks around for Attuma but sees him- standing over Riri  about to deliver a fatal blow.  
Okoye charges at him and at the last second deflects his  spear, cuts his face and stands on guard between the warrior  and the unconscious young women.  
Attuma backs up and speaks to the fallen Talocanil warriors.  
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 52.
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 52. 
ATTUMA (SUBTITLE) 
Go to Namora.  
Okoye looks on, shocked to see her deathblows were only wounds  for the warriors as they stand and jump back into the water. 
ATTUMA nods, then rushes Okoye, unnaturally fast for his size.  
Okoye fearlessly engages Attuma but he is too big, too  skilled, too fast and too strong. After a series of  exchanges, Attuma pauses, unimpressed.  
ATTUMA (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D) 
You’re not worth my blade. 
Sensing his slight, Okoye charges forward and PUNCHES ATTUMA  knocking him back. Excited, he grins. Someone on his level to  tangle with. 
But PUSHING the Cambridge police car into the river, Namora  turns, speaking in Maya.  
NAMORA (SUBTITLE) 
What’s taking so long?  
Irked by the pending face-off, she throws a HYDROBOMB at Attuma  who hip checks it into Okoye.  
Catching sight of it, Okoye fruit ninja’s the bomb with her  spear unwittingly causes ANOTHER MASSIVE EXPLOSION OF WATER. 
OVERWHELMED BY THE DELUGE, OKOYE IS SWEPT OVER THE SIDE OF  THE BRIDGE INTO THE CHARLES RIVER BELOW. 
Shuri is jarred awake by the SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION, just in  time to see Attuma preparing to execute her. As he  approaches, Shuri moves between them. 
Wait! 
SHURI 
Shuri removes her helmet.  
GRIOT 
He can’t understand you Princess.  
They’re speaking Yucatec Maya. 
Attuma continues toward them. 
SHURI 
Translate...  
Shuri holds up her KIMOYO BRACELET and Griot translates her  words in Maya. 
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 52A. 
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 52A.
SHURI (CONT’D) 
I am Shuri, Princess of Wakanda. I  
ask that you take me to Namor.  
Before you harm this woman please  
allow me to speak with him. 
GRIOT (YUCATEC) 
I am Shuri, Princess of Wakanda. I  
ask that you take me to Namor.  
Before you harm this woman please  
allow me to speak with him. 
Attuma and Namora consider this.  
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 53.
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 53. 
(points at Shuri) 
They are coming with us... alive!  
Attuma pulls off Shuri’s Kimoyo Bracelet and tosses it, then  removes his REBREATHER and places it over her face. Shuri  breathes in and loses consciousness.  
Namora motions to the other Talocanil. 
NAMORA (SUBTITLE) 
Take that flying machine as well. 
Namora approaches Riri, rebreather in hand... 
97 EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT - A MOMENT LATER 97 
Okoye regains consciousness seeing ATTUMA and NAMORA fleeing  with Shuri and Riri into the distant depths. She screams. 
98 EXT. HARVARD BRIDGE - MORNING 98 
FBI AGENTS work the crime scene with CAMBRIDGE POLICE.  Everyone involved was killed. Ross takes in the destruction,  then stops a passing FEDERAL AGENT. 
ROSS 
Any witnesses? 
FEDERAL AGENT 
None... But we know it was the  
Wakandans. We knew they were  
coming.  
This throws Ross. 
Excuse me? 
ROSS 
FEDERAL AGENT 
Our field office got a call from  you guys at Langley.  
ROSS 
Who made the call? 
She did. 
FEDERAL AGENT 
Ross watches the agent walk away as a tinted BLACK SUV pulls  up in front of him. 
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 53A. 
Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 53A.
VAL (50’s, White, CIA Shadow Director) climbs out of the back.  She’s in a plain business suit with the eyes of a soldier. Val  steps to Ross, taking in the scene with razor sharp focus. 
ROSS 
Director de Fontaine...  
Really?  
VAL  
Ross shrugs that off. Val sighs. They stroll a bit.


XOCHITL GOMEZ and EL MEDICO EXTRANO are fleeing the SINGLE MESSIEST SPECIAL EFFECT IN THE ENTIRE MCU but it is TOO STRONG!
RANCHEROS CUMBERBATCH
I can't let that beast kill you and take your powers! The only option is if I kill you and take your powers, since there's no way this beast could ever kill ME and take
(dead)
XOCHITL GOMEZ
Oh shit! There's no way out of THIS predicament unless I'm so terrified that I reflexively unleash my multiverse-hopping powers!
(does so)
I'm sure we won't go to that well TOO often.
XOCHITL and DEADS BENEDICT get sucked into the PORTAL and OUR BENEDICT wakes up, from a DREAM! He rushes off to...
INT. DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE BUSTLING CHURCH OF MATRIMONY
BENEDICT attends the WEDDING of RACHEL MCADAMS... to SOMEONE ELSE WHAAAAAAT okay this can't have come as a shock to ANYONE.
RACHEL MCADAMS
I'm sure you understand. Yes, you saved half the universe and you're all that, but you gotta admit you were a bit of a dick about it.
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
I'm a bit surprised you invited me honestly, though even more surprised you invited that GIANT TENTACLE MONSTER YOIKS BE RIGHT BACK
CUMBERBATCH flies into the STREET where XOCHITL is being menaced by the selfsame GIANT TENTACLE MONSTER which has a SINGLE GIANT EYE and yet also DEPTH PERCEPTION SOMEHOW!
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Don't worry little one, I'm everyone's magical surrogate Dad now, I got this!
BENEDICT conjures an ENERGY BLADE to chop off one of the MONSTER’S TENTACLES! Then he conjures another ENERGY BLADE to chop off another one of the MONSTER’S TENTACLES! Then the MONSTER throws a BUS at him, so he conjures an ENORMOUS ENERGY BLADE to chop the ENTIRE BUS IN HALF LENGTHWAYS!
XOCHITL GOMEZ
Why the hell aren’t you using one of those things on ITS GODDAMN HEAD?! IT IS NINETY PERCENT HEAD FOR FUCK’S SAKE
BENEDICT WONG appears and the TWO BENNYS attack with POINTY THINGS ON MAGIC ROPES which are USELESS, until finally they STAB it right in the FUCKING EYE, which as it turns out, was also its BRAIN. They WIN!
XOCHITL GOMEZ
Yuck, did we really have to pluck out the WHOLE eye? Gross. Which reminds me, I'm FAMISHED.
INT. DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE RESTAURANT OF MUNCHIES
The BENNYS take XOCHITL for lunch and explanations.
XOCHITL GOMEZ
So yeah I'm playing the character America Chavez, who can travel between multiverses although as of now, I also can't control it. Also if you turn on subtitles you can appreciate the timeliness of certain captions like "America groans", "America struggles", "America cries", and so on.
(eats)
Anyway monsters are after me so Dead Benny and I were searching for the Book of Vishanti, a magical artifact which can conveniently do anything at all.
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Oh I call bullshit, that's ludicrously overpowered and vague even by OUR standards. And we only have your word for any of this...
XOCHITL GOMEZ
(drops Dead Benny on table)
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Okay I believe you. We gotta figure out who's behind this... hm, that monster had RUNES on it, and runes are used by WITCHES. Hmmm....
BENEDICT WONG
Maybe we should check with the one and only character in the entire MCU we know of that has any connection to witchcraft whatsoever, even though technically she only identified her powers as "witchcraft" during her own Disney+ series that we weren't in.
EXT. DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE CHERRY TREES OF OLSEN
ELIZABETH OLSEN is tending to her immaculate cherry orchard when CUMBERBATCH arrives.
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Don't worry, I'm not here to Chekhov on you. I need your help with-
ELIZABETH OLSEN
Oh no is Xochitl Gomez in trouble?!? I'd be totes happy to help Xochitl Gomez, why not bring Xochitl Gomez right here and put her in that bubbling cauldron I've prepared next to the cookbook titled "TO SERVE XOCHITL GOMEZ"???
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Waaaiiiiit a second.... you're not in my "Names I Wish I Could Play in Scrabble" group chat, so how did you know...
ELIZABETH OLSEN
UGH OKAY FINE I'M EVIL, this orchard is an elaborate illusion I made in case visitors dropped by.
(reveals scarlet deathscape)
This might seem to throw WandaVision under the bus, but it's okay! My Scarlet Witch powers actually have a sinister will of their own and have taken me over, and the Darkhold ALSO has a sinister will of its own and has taken me over, so anything I do in this movie I technically do under two separate layers of the MCU’s beloved MMMMIND CONTROL.
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Oh. So instead of a betrayal of the character that contradicts your arc from WandaVision, it’s just a hacky copout that renders your arc from WandaVision basically moot. That’s... worse?
EVILIZABETH OLSEN
Whatevs, just bring me Xochitl so I can drain her powers, killing her, and go to a multiverse where I can be finally reunited with my entire family!
(Paul Bettany has scheduling conflict)
...where I can be finally reunited with my children, and only them!
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
What if we help Xochitl control her powers and then ask nicely? We might even find a multiverse where you died and Bettany lived, so that-
EVILIZABETH OLSEN
MMMMMMMMIND CONTROL SAYS FUCK THAT, I GIVE YOU UNTIL SUNRISE TO COMPLY THEN IMA WRECK YOUR SHIT
INT. DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE KAMAR-TAJ OF SCAREDNESS
BENNY returns with the less than awesome news.
XOCHITL GOMEZ
Crap, the evil witch who wants to kill me knows exactly where I am! Oh, if only I were surrounded by dozens of people who could instantly teleport me anywhere else in the galaxy!
(looks around pointedly)
Everybody instead PREPS FOR BATTLE and sure enough LIZ eventually arrives all floaty and scary like.
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Right, I got this.
(floats upwards)
Perhaps instead of what you originally came for, I might offer you BOFA DEEZ NUTS
(does crotch-chop hip thrust)
(lands)
That should do it.
However EVILIZABETH uses her MAGIC and MMMMIND CONTROL to MASSACRE almost everyone and CORNER our heroes!
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Shit, she made my Sling Ring vanish! We REALLY should learn how to do this one spell without needing accessories. Wait a sec, accessories!
(slaps head)
Why didn't I think of this sooner, I can use my magical whip to teleport Liz to the Sanctum's escape-proof dungeon...
(handed note)
"Unavailable"?!? The fuck? That was ONE MOVIE AGO. From last DECEMBER. Holy crap people.
EVILIZABETH OLSEN
Ha ha, now the Benedicts shall die--no, instant disintegration's TOO GOOD for you two, I shall KNOCK YOU OUT instead! Nyah ha ha!
(does so)
LIZ starts to ABSORB XOCHITL'S POWERS but she gets scared enough to OPEN A MULTIVERSE PORTAL! CUMBERBATCH revives and TACKLES XOCHITL into it! They find themselves falling through EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE A HANDFUL OF WACKY SCREENSAVERS FOR TEN SECONDS OR SO before landing in--
EXT. DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE N.Y.C. OF WTF-NESS
CUMBERBATCH and XOCHITL arrive in a bizarre alternate NEW YORK where you WALK ON RED and call it THE BIG BANANA and the entire state is NEVER EVER ON BILLY JOEL'S MIND, NOT EVEN ONCE. XOCHITL grabs some STREET FOOD thinking it's FREE but it is NOT FREE.
OBLIGATORY CAMEO BY BRUCE CAMPBELL
Hey, she stole that! And you're a knockoff!
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Oh, so you've been robbed AND you're a little rude, huh?
(casts spell)
Well hope you enjoy PUNCHING YOURSELF FOR THREE WEEKS there that's a perfectly proportional response, I'm clearly the hero in this encounter.
(to Xochitl)
Please understand we had to do some kind of Evil Dead 2 shoutout and that's one of the only things anyone remembers about it.
They proceed down the street in this amazing NEW MULTIVERSE, full of wonders only limited by the screenwriters' imaginations! What fantastical delights lie in store-
EXPOSITION MACHINE
HELLO I AM A MACHINE THAT PROVIDES EXPOSITION AND BACKSTORY TO THE AUDIENCE, STEP RIGHT UP, GET YER BACKSTORY EXPOSITED RIGHT HERE
XOCHITL GOMEZ
(activates machine)
Oh wow, a memory of me with my (gasp) TWO MOMS! Don't worry though, they're very ethereal and chaste with hardly any lines. But this was the day a bee scared me SO MUCH that it triggered my power, hurtling all of us through a portal, I haven't seen them since!
(America sobs at the perilous situation of her LGBTQ family)
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Yeah I see what you mean about the timely captions. Buck up kid, I'm sure there's a heartwarming reunion scene in your future. I give it two, three more movies tops.
They find the SANCTUM SANCTORUM which has a statue dedicated to a version of CUMBERBATCH that shockingly has NO GOATEE!! NO FACIAL HAIR AT ALL WHAT IN GOD'S NAME oh also and is dead.
CHIWETEL EJIOFOR
Hello! Ha ha ha, yes, OUR Cumberbatch died in battle with Thanos, I run the Sanctum here. Please, come in, have some tea. THIS tea in particular. Drink lots and lots of this tea.
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
(drinks)
Urk.. whaaa.. the tea... DRUGGED!! Losing... consciousness...
(passes out)
XOCHITL GOMEZ
So... am I! whurg
(passes out)
MAGIC CLOAK
(somehow... is also... drugged! Didn't even... drink...)
(passes out)
INT. DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE JUDGMENT ROOM OF FUCKWITS
CUMBERBATCH is brought in magic-proof cuffs to be judged by THE FULL VERSION OF ALL THOSE TEASER TRAILERS FINALLY AW YEEEAHHH
CHIWETEL EJIOFOR
Our Cumberbatch was an even bigger asshole than you, big enough to swallow entire multiverses inside. So we had to kill him, and maybe you too just to be safe. And now, may I introduce YOOOUUUR STARTING LINEUP for the EARTH 838 ILLUUUUUMINAATIIII!!!
HAYLEY ATWELL
Captain Carter, reporting! Next to me is Anson Mount as Black Bolt, leader of the Inhumans, because in this universe his show didn't BLOW ASS CHUNKS
LASHANA LYNCH
And here, I'M Captain Marvel! Presumably in this continuity I took the mission Brie Larson did, but I didn't have a fun enough jacket for my daughter to suggest a new colour scheme.
JOHN KRASINSKI
HEY-OH REED RICHARDS, LEADER OF THE FAN-CASTED FOUR, IN THE HOUUUUSE! Is anyone else feeling these reveals would have been way better if we hadn't spoiled them all months ago? But we still have the ultimate power move... SIR PATRICK STEW-
PATRICK STEWART
Look, don’t get too excited. After the whole Ralph Bohner incident I wouldn’t be surprised if I turned out to actually be a retired plumber’s assistant called Randy Glascock or something.
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
(looking around)
No Tom Cruise Iron Man then? Bummer. Oh well, not like any of you will still be around ten minutes from now, could have had Jaxxon T. Tumperakki up there for all it matters.
EVILIZABETH OLSEN
(over loudspeakers)
Hey gang it's me, I've possessed my Earth-838 counterpart Elizabeth Wholesome! I'd have gotten here sooner but some rando Wong stan destroyed my Darkhold, and I had to go find the mystical mountaintop with the original session tapes.
HAYLEY, LASHANA, ANSON, and JOHN rush over to the BIG BATTLE CHAMBER to confront LIZ.
EVILIZABETH OLSEN
Right let's kick things off by magically erasing Anson's mouth, a tactic which would really help defeat all of you but I like each of my murders to be a little special, y'know?
ANSON MOUTHLESS
oh shit well i'm fine as long as i don't WHOOPS
(dead)
JOHN KRASINSKI
Dammit Liz don't make me use my stretchy powers! They look really silly!
(stretches goofily)
(dies of embarrassment)
HAYLEY ATWELL
You won't kill me THAT easily, I’m an already-established character in this franchise! That means I get to have an actual fight, even if that makes no sense.
EVILIZABETH OLSEN
All right fine, I’ll brawl with you instead of instantly making your head explode I guess.
(brawls)
HAYLEY ATWELL
Heh heh, I can do this all day.
(bisected with own shield)
Or not.
(dies)
LASHANA ATTACKS! But somehow LIZ sucks all LASHANA'S POWER out of her so she can be killed by a LARGE ROCK in a dignified heroic way.
EVILIZABETH OLSEN
Wow, let's hope that "totally drain opponent's powers" spell isn't something that would instantly get me out of any future jam, or past one! In fact, what spell?
Back in the JUDGMENT CHAMBER, CHIWETEL guards BENNY.
CHIWETEL EJIOFOR
(poutily)
Don’t think you’re getting out of that vote, Benedict! Once my fellow Illuminati finish getting slaughtered, I’m dragging their corpses RIGHT BACK HERE and we are gonna VOTE.
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Gonna take some quick thinking to get out of this jam... hm. Hey Chiwetel, sure would SUCK if you ATTACKED me right now! Especially if you did so swinging your SWORD towards my magic cuffs!
CHIWETEL EJIOFOR
Oh YEAH well maybe I WILL then!
(cuts cuffs in two!)
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
(clamping one cuff on Chiwetel)
Heh heh, now neither of us can use magic, so you’ll have to face me in hand-to-hand combat! So prepare to face the martial arts chops of a middle-aged neurosurgeon with busted hands!
(pause)
I may not have thought this all the way through.
In an adjoining room, XOCHITL is trapped in a special holding cell built by EARTH-838 SCIENTIST RACHEL MCADAMS, WHAAA?!
XOCHITL GOMEZ
Whuh oh, Evilizabeth’s here to murder everyone and then me, this is terrifying! Good thing I have a superpower specifically designed to let me escape places, which triggers whenever I’m afraid.
(nothing happens)
What, seriously? Damn, if only there were something REALLY scary here, like a bee.
RACHEL MCADAMS
Don't worry, these cages designed to imprison superbeings can surely be smashed by a common fire extinguisher!
(they cannot)
XOCHITL GOMEZ
Or wait, I also have a star-punch power I used before and then kind of forgot about!
(punches hole in cage)
LIZ arrives but is interrupted by SIR PATRICK! PSYCHIC BATTLE is JOINED!
PATRICK STEWART
Now for an epic battle on par with the great Prof. X vs. Phoenix battles-
(neck snapped)
Oh fucking hell, this is the third time I’ve been murdered playing this role. You’d think I would’ve learned my lesson by now.
(dies)
Fortunately this buys ENOUGH TIME for CUMBERBATCH to regroup with RACHEL and XOCHITL and his MAGIC CLOAK that's been busy doing FUCK KNOWS WHAT, and together they find a door to the FLOATY DIMENSION WITH THE BOOK OF VISHANTI YAY!
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Okay all-powerful book, time for that instant-win spell which is--a magic energy blast?! I was doing that before! Well maybe this one is better
(zapped by Liz!)
FNORTZ I GUESS NOT
XOCHITL is finally scared enough to open a PORTAL! LIZ boots BENNY and RACHEL through it, then uses her MMMMMIND CONTROL to direct the portal to EARTH-616 MOUNT WUNDERBAR.
XOCHITL GOMEZ
Hey why not just MMMMIND CONTROL me to go to the multiverse you want?
EVILIZABETH OLSEN
We addressed this in the movie, what if the kids get sick and the cure exists in some other multiverse? Or what if the wifi goes out during the third period of the Stanley Cup finals and we need to find a multiverse where it didn't? What if I forget to pick up fibre pills and... well you get the idea. It's just WAY more convenient if I have the power myself.
(throws Xochitl on evil altar)
NOW FOR THE UNNECESSARILY LONG SACRIFICIAL RITUAL!
(sets timer, waits)
EXT. DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE FUCKED-UP REALM OF CRAPNESS
CUMBERBATCH and RACHEL land in a dark and sinister New York where reality is FUCKED. Since BENEDICT'S solution to everything is "find another me" they DO THAT, and he comes face-to-face with YET ANOTHERBATCH!
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
(to self)
Right, must tread carefully here, we don't know what's what.
(loudly)
Wow, this place is a trashheap hey you've got a Darkhold! Gimme!
(casts spell)
DERELICT CUMBERBATCH
(counters)
Fuck you, I need that to keep murdering my multiverse-selves in ways that give you nightmares!
(pops open third eye)
Surprise, I'm evil, in case the captioning calling me "Sinister Strange" hadn't tipped you off already.
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Dammit! Once again my turning to someone for help has initially appeared promising, only for it to be revealed they're plotting my doom... shit that's three times now in this movie alone! I really suck at turning to someone for help.
BENEDICT is thrown by BEING-A-DICK SLUMBERBAD into a PIANO!!
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Oh so it's a CLASSICAL MUSIC FIGHT you want, huh? Well take that!
(casts "Einstein on the Beach")
BEING-A-DICK SLUMBERBAD
(cut by shards of Glass)
Ow! Well two can play at THAT game!
(casts "4 Minutes 33 Seconds")
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
(trapped in a Cage)
I'm not beaten so easily!
(casts "Reverse Bolero")
BEING-A-DICK SLUMBERBAD
(beginning to un-Ravel)
NOOOOO
(casts "Clair de lune")
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
(pelted with cats)
ARGH DAMMIT
(casts "Das Lied von der Erde")
BEING-A-DICK SLUMBERBAD
(Mahlered by bears)
FUUUUUUCK
(thrown out window, impaled on spike)
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
(composes self, har har)
Phew. Now I can use the Darkhold to possess my corpse-self back in the 616 universe! Rachel, please be ready to battle any swarms of undead souls that attack us here. I'll use as many as I can to create a new soul-cape of screaming wraiths for my rotting zombie self!
RACHEL MCADAMS
(shrugs)
Hey if Marvel didn't want Sam Raimi, they shouldn't have hired Sam Raimi.
EXT. DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MOUNTAIN REALM OF SACRIFICE
Meanwhile LIZ is finally about to murder XOCHITL when her GUARD BEASTIES get fragged by BENEDEAD CORPSERBATCH and BENEDICT WONG! They trap LIZ in a giant WRAITH GLOWBALL!
XOCHITL GOMEZ
That won't hold her long. It's okay, you can take my power, even though you two won't shut up about how you can't possibly stand up to Liz without some all-powerful ultraweapon.
BENEDEAD CORPSERBATCH
Don’t you see, Xochitl, you’ve been subconsciously controlling your powers the whole time! You intentionally brought us to all the correct universes to connect the story together!
XOCHITL GOMEZ
Um, no, that doesn’t make any sense. I didn’t possess any of the information necessary to enact that plan, consciously or not.
BENEDEAD CORPSERBATCH
Hm, true. Well then I guess the only explanation is that your powers include the ability to pick an optimal course of action by pure dumb luck! So go out there, open a portal at random, and trust that it’ll happen to resolve the plot for us!
XOCHITL GOMEZ
Yes! Deus ex machina powers for the win!
XOCHITL opens a portal to ELIZABETH WHOLESOME'S HOUSE where the KIDS see EVIL LIZ and are TERRIFIED!
EVILIZABETH OLSEN
Huh, seems my kids DON'T want their Mom to be a crazed murdering supervillain. Well this kind of fucks my whole plan to shit doesn't it. Oops.
XOCHITL GOMEZ
(closes portal)
Yay I control my powers now! C'mon Wongers, let's go rescue Cumberbatch and Rachel from their half-baked romantic subplot before they have to kiss or something.
(they portal away)
ELIZABETH OLSEN
Ah, I'm myself again. Now I seem to remember people being all pissed off I never faced consequences for WandaVision, so why don't I pull this whole mountain down on myself, see if that makes them happy.
(does so)
ELIZABETH is crushed by a few million tons of ROCK, although eagle-eyed viewers will have spotted a FINAL FLASH OF SCARLET ENERGY which suggests that MAYBE JUST MAYBE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST OF well you know how this works.
EXT. DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE HAPPY REALM OF GLADNESS
Back at KAMAR-TAJ everything is awesome again! XOCHITL trains alongside other sorcerors and presumably JACOB BATALON is juuuust off-camera since we know CUMBERBATCH remembers SPIDER-MAN so should remember NED, right?
XOCHITL GOMEZ
Now that I've gained control of my multiverse powers you might think I'd be actively searching for my Moms, but sure, let's learn some whole different skills from absolute scratch.
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
Speaking of Moms, let's take a MOMent to appreciate how "Multiverse of Madness" abbreviates to MOM, and we released this movie on Mother's Day weekend!
(grins)
XOCHITL GOMEZ
Yes having the primary mother being a raving child-obsessed homicidal maniac, and two other mothers banished to an unknown fate, that's quite the tribute there guys.
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH
True but, ah, the thing is, er... OH NO A THIRD EYE JUST GREW IN MY HEAD WHAAAAAT
(dramatic chords!!)
AMERICA sighs.
END
EXT. DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE BONUS SCENE OF MID-CREDITS-NESS
BENEDICT is walking along when suddenly!
CHARLIZE THERON
Hihihi everyone it's me and look, I have a funky costume! Not too late to jump on board, there's still room for even more new heroes, I hope?
BINIDICT CUMBERBATCH
(popping third eye open to try and view entire upcoming slate of MCU projects at once)
Fuck it, why not.
(leaps through portal with Charlize)
CHIWETEL EJIOFOR
(across street)
Um, so are we ever picking up my 616-storyline again or what?
EXT. DOCTOR STRANGE NOT IN THE BONUS SCENE OF END-CREDITS-NESS
BRUCE CAMPBELL finally stops punching himself.
BRUCE CAMPBELL
Sweet! So y'know, with Stan Lee gone, if you're looking for someone new to cameo in every single MCU project--
(resumes punching himself)
AW C'MON


Dinosaurs are in our world and
in every confrontation, we


learn more about this
frightening reality.


How did we get here? It's been
three decades since the deadly


events of Jurassic Park and
we've yet to find a way for


these animals to live safely
among us. After the devastating


eruption of Isla Nublar's long
dormant volcano, those who


survived were transported to
the mainland. Many of the


larger predators were captured.
But the remaining creatures


scattered here in Big Rock
National Park. While most


remained in the wild, those who
made their way to civilizations


struggled to adapt to
unfamiliar conditions. Look the






boys have warned the animals
are unpredictable and when


Hungary extremely violent. As
the dinosaurs spread across


borders, a global black market
has


risen. To combat the growing
threat of illegal poachers, the


US Congress awards sole
collection rights to the global


giant, Biosom Genetics. At
Biosin, we're dedicated to the


idea that dinosaurs can teach
us more about ourselves. CEO


Louis Dodson has created a
sanctuary in Italy's Dolomite


Mountains where he hopes to
study the dinosaur's ancient


immune systems for unique
pharmaceutical properties.


While Biosin believes we can
handle genetic power


responsibly. The public remains
skeptical. Some note that these


government contracts have led
to massive spikes in Biosin's


profits. And rumors persist of
a human clone who mysteriously






disappeared leading to a
worldwide search. Some believe


she's genetically identical to
Charlotte Lockwood, deceased


daughter of Jurassic Park
co-founder Benjamin Lockwood.


Now we brought these animals
back from extinction, can we


face the consequences? Are we
responsible for them or should


they be left to fend for
themselves? As we adapt to an


ever-changing world, we must
find answers to these questions


for their safety as well as for
our own.


We are headed inside the
illegal breeding facility. The


juveniles are kept in cages to
keep cost out. It's medieval.


Clap


Why do you think he separated
from the rest? I don't think


he's going to make it.


Two, What are you doing? We're
going to report this. The DFW


takes days to investigate. We
can save this one now.


Nope. Nope.


Jump.


We're going to get shot.


Protection.


Everybody good?


Okay, so I think we get this
one to the DFW and then we hit


them again. Yeah, you saw that
breeding ground, right? We're


done. I got a call last week.
It's a real job. Something I


could do to effectively change
things. I gotta take it. They


need us. Are you saving these
dinosaurs because they need us?


Or are you saving them to
absolve yourself? Claire. I


mean this is crazy. Claire,
you're doing the right thing.


But this, this is the way to go
about it anymore. Honestly, you


need someone who's good at
being shot at.


It's not that weird. You need
to be weird. He meant like


surprising.


Yeah.


Okay.


You.


Yeah.


We're going to get you some
place safe.


Go.


Five, four,


I


Where you been? Noah. What are
you burning? Oh nothing just


some old blankets. You sure you
didn't go pass the bridge? I


said it could give you anything
underlying. What are you? No.


Maisie, you're literally
looking everywhere but you. I


said I didn't go pass the
bridge.


I know Claire. There are people
out there who do anything to


find me. I'm not angry. So that
means you don't have to be


angry. I'm not angry. I can
take care of myself. Hey, it's


okay for us to depend on each
other. That's what people do.


How would I know what people
do? The only people I've spoken


to in the past four years are
you both. Besides, I'm not even


I speak from someone else.


You were the only you who ever
was. What? Who's that? It's


like really cool. That's so
cool. Can we keep that between


us? Compromise.


Thank you.


Oh.


Oh, I like that. Yeah. Okay. Um
I'm going to Everything okay?


She went into town again.


This kid, did you talk to him?
I tried.


I'll talk to her.


Well,


Yeah.


Two,


again.


I


Amen.


Alright. Away from yourself.


I would not mess with
everything either way.


As a kiddo, we should probably
talk about you going into I


don't think you understand how
bad it is being trapped. You're


not trapped here. We just don't
trust people. No, you just


don't trust me and then you
expect me to trust you. Why


can't I have any freedom?
Because you can't.


Hi


What is happening? She's 14.
Yeah. Do you remember what that


was like? I do. We can't keep
her here forever. If we don't


figure this out, she's going to
go a lot further from the


bridge. They find her when her
again. We gotta protect her.


That's our job. That's what
we're going to do. Protect her


how? By locking her inside?
She's got questions. You know,


questions we can't answer. She
wants to know who she is.


Who Charlotte Lockwood was.


Dragging grading to his house.
Raptors got Judah. Listen to


something else. I found a girl
that went after.


Thanks for coming. Wasn't sure
who to call. Missing well, I


didn't even want to say it if
there wasn't a dinosaur. Yeah,


well, they get all the
attention. You guys want to


bury the same place plots 100
yards each? Is this students?


Yeah, we've been looking into
the impact of industrial


farming on the environment. So,
this is right up our alley.


They hit 60 fields in the
county. Is it anything like


this before? No, not like this.
They've been leaving degraded


fields all across the Midwest.
First these big companies try


to kill off all the insects.
Now this.


Is that your land? That's the
Bennett's garden. The locust


didn't mean that. You plant the
same seed as the Bennetts? No.


We are independent. They use
biosin seed. Yeah, I bet they


do. You say you caught a live
one?


Because paleontology is science
and science is about the truth


and there is truth in these
boxes. Red, You're going to


want to see this.


Alan Grant, you look the same.
In this place. So you too. I'm


sorry. I didn't know you were
coming over to


Can I get you something a beer?
Um, maybe not at 10 AM but iced


tea or. Tea, yeah. Tea, I can
do that. Saw a lot of tourists


on the way in. All the
funding's dried up so


somebody's gotta pay for all
this. I can't.


I read your articles about soil
science and regenerative


farming. Can't be grounds for
some hope for change. How are


you kids? Hm. Amazing. Grown.
It's shocking. They're both in


college. Can you believe that?
And Mark, It's over. Oh. Oh,


I'm sorry to hear it. It's
okay. I'm back to me, my work.


You know, it's. That's great.
It's good. It is. I'm alone at


last. Exciting times. Yeah, I'm
living the Alan Grant life.


It's just. It's going to be
lonely. So free.


Ally. You didn't come out all
this way just to catch up now,


did you?


Plants of locust, mandibles,
wings, thorax but god, the size


of it is massive. It has genes
that have been extinct since


the cretaceous and swarms of
them are decimating crops from


Iowa to Texas. Terrifying,
right? Started as a few


hundred. There could be
millions by the end of the


summer. If they keep going,
there will be no grain to feed


chickens, cattle, the entire
food chain would collapse. I


was clearly designed but why
would anyone do that? None of


the crops they're eating are
biosin seed. The biasin. Same


biasing made this. I mean, it
would not shock me that they


want to control the world's
food supply. Up or a few


million stars. Can't waste that
saying three meals away from


anarchy. If we don't stop them,
you can pick your last three


meals. So why are you bringing
it to me? I need concrete


evidence. Bias is responsible
for all this. I need to go to


their sanctuary and get DNA
from another locust there. But


I need a witness. Ellen, you
command respect. People believe


you. Why I'm here. It's quiet.
I'm done with all that. Are you


okay? Well, I'm sorry. I mean,
nobody gets that luxury


anymore. Not even you and you
know what? You're the one I


trust.


This bison sanctuary is what? 1
hundred miles from anywhere?


How do you even get in there? I
got an invite from their


in-house philosopher. Seems
there's a lot of money in being


a chaotician these days. And he
just happened to invite you out


of the blue. He said there were
things I'd want to see. Uh


Every animal captured on the
mainland comes through here


before shipping out to Bison's
sanctuary in the Dolomites. We


give them medical attention and
make sure they live healthy. So


much security. Those are just
the ones you see. A lot of


shady types out there want
these guys. Your plane's just


filling up. Bonnie sends a
tough invite. You guys must


know somebody. Do you mind? Of
course.


Follow me. We rescued these
guys from the legal breeding


farm in Nevada a few weeks ago.
Shut the whole place down. Not


this time. Good girl.


You never get used to it. Take
care. Thanks. Bye.


Yeah.


You look just like blue.


This? You want to try it? Okay?


Whoo.


Macy, don't move.


Girl. Staying out of trouble.
Baby, that's impossible.


She won't hurt us, right? Oh,
you damn right she will. Just


breathe. If you don't, she'll
think you're scared. I am


scared. She doesn't need to
know that.


I'm Vanessa's gotta be nearby.
Maisie, get inside. I'm coming


with you. What did I just say?


We gotta move. Not yet. We need
the girl.


Maisie. Maisie.


Okay. Where are you going? You
can't keep me here under my


mother.


She's leaving the house.


You.


Hey.


Greece of


Let's go.


Who are you?


They found her. What? Who are
they? Walters. I've seen them


around. Leaders are real ****
y'all. They must have


recognized and followed me
here. Where is she? Go get the


truck.


Hey. No.


They took her kid too.


I'm going to get her back. I
promise you that.


And


this year man. What's next?
Historically darkness, blood,


raid of fire, I think frogs.
We're not going to be around


for much longer anyway. These
locusts in Nebraska are about


to wrap it up. We basically all
of our food and our food's


food. So you can say goodbye to
this.


Franklin, it's me. Okay, you're
a bit of a subject of interest


around here since I'd be
talking to you. Come on, I'm in


trouble. I really need your
help. Please. Yeah, and I could


lose my job and you know I'm
not qualified to do anything


else. We're outside. Let me
talk to him.


That's him. Name's Rain
Delacourt. Little piece of


work. What do you think?
Something we care about very


much. I told you somebody would
come looking for her. You can't


just take a person, Claire. I
had no choice. Not in the eyes


of the law. This guy is not the
law. Tell us how to find him.


Where'd you guys call me from?
We have a minute on the inside


of Dela Court's operation.
There's an exchange in Malta


sometime tomorrow, cash for
cargo. There's no mention but


we have people on the ground
already. One of them you know a


lot of us got recruited by the
CIA after Very stretchy toe


loop stone. I need to talk to
him. We can't just call him.


He's deep cover. Look, once we
make the bus to Malta, our guys


will see Delacore knows where
she is. Our guys, not you.


Promise me you will go in there
with your vest and mess


everything up. Why would I do
that? You guys are both crazy


but you seem like you're good
parents or whatever you're


trying to be. Just lucky to
have you. Don't get killed,


okay?


Think we're almost there. Yeah.


Doctor Santler, Doctor Grant,
Ramsey Cole, Communications.


Oh, thank you. Uh, I have to
warn you, everyone's so excited


to have you. You guys are
absolute legends around here.


Hm, you must be confusing us
with somebody else. You know,


it's great that you guys are
still so close to Doctor


Malcolm. I mean, sometimes you
meet your heroes and they


disappoint you but he's exactly
the way you'd want him to be. I


mean, such fertility of
thought, it's incredible. Which


time he has found with it? Uh
well I know that was sarcastic


but honestly not enough. Oh
please have to wash your head.


So Bison bought this land for
the amb deposits back in the


90s, but we've managed to turn
into a safe haven for about 20


displaced species. First
generation came from Sorna.


Most of new bar dinosaurs are
here too. Took fish and


wildlife three years to catch
the T-rex. But the T-rex is


here. Oh yeah. Yeah. Just
before you guys.


Restricted airspace. Protects
the airborne life. Keeps the


terror source below 5 million
feet. Airborne.


Dead Broadus.


Beautiful, right? Her name
means fear nothing. You know


that. What did they graze on?
Hawthorn and firm. All


indigenous. Nothing stocked
except for the deer


populations. Great mesening
species for the apex predator.


Holy apex predator.
Piganosaurus. At least for now.


Um, you don't let people in
there. Our our research, our


research office are connected
completely underground. If we


have to, we could just bird the
animals remotely using neuro


implant that sends electrical
signals directly to the brain.


Like shocked. Uh no, like like
signals. Strike you is a little


bit for a little cruel. Do you
know how much voltage is in the


electric fences at Jurassic
Park?


Doctor Ian Dominion New from
the lecture hall for the ethics


of Genetic Ocala. God it must
serve the honor. Oh well it is


part of our ethos attract the
best and brightest. Doctors.


Respected. Renowned. Doctor
Sattler. Doctor Grant. I'm well


this is big. I'm I'm Lewis.
Dodson. Yeah. Hi. You're Louis


Dutch and how do you do? We
didn't expect to actually see


you here. Oh well. I wouldn't
be anywhere else. I mean the


people you see here who are
changing the world. Would you


mind if we just it would mean a
lot. Yeah. One, two, one, Oh,


great. Thank you so much. Oh,
That's good. That's good fun.


So you are going to see some
remarkable things today. We are


unlocking the true power of the
genome or this close we'd be.


We could fortune with that. No,
it's not about money. No, we've


already identified dozens of
applications for pamio DNA


We will be saving lives. Um
anyway, I wish I could take you


around myself but it's so
you're in more than capable


hands with Ramsey. He's
basically a young me. Only


Do you have food? Like one of
my bars? Pardon? Um no never


mind. I'll I'll find something.
So I want to do more of this


later on if we oh we booked you
a private pod for the trip out.


So it's beautiful. We love it
through the caverns and


everything. Uh you better
hurry. Malcolm's on it. He's a


bit of a contrarian but I like
him. He keeps us on our toes.


Anyway, thank you for being
here. It's


Okay, follow me please.


Human beings have no more right
to safety or liberty than any


other creature on this planet
We not only lack dominion over


nature, we're supportive to it.
Now, here we are with the


opportunity to rewrite life at
our fingertips and just like


nuclear power. Nobody knew what
to expect with genetic


engineering but they pressed
the button and hoped for the


best just like you are doing
now. Yep,


control the future of our
survival on planet Earth.


According to you the solution
is genetic power. But that same


power could devastate the food
supply. Create new diseases


alter the climate even further.
Unforeseen consequences occur.


And every time, every single
time We all act surprised


because deep down, I don't
think that any of us actually


believe that these dangers are
real.


In order to instigate
revolutionary change, we must


Transform human consciousness.


Very good. There there you go.
Hey, I don't want to be rude


about friends. Thank you. Catch
me on my way out. Thanks


everybody. Look at you. Look at
me. Oh, look at you. Wow, this


is so trippy. You look like
you're doing what? Well, I got


five kids. You know, my adore
more than life itself. So,


expenses added up. You, Allen,
are you, are you a yummy family


or? No. So I need to talk to
you. Yeah I need to talk to you


too. Privately. Do you two talk
a lot? He slid into my DMs. You


know what? It's urgently.
What'd you do? 7 minutes to


midnight still. Uh the doomsday
clock might be about out of


time but as they say it's
always darkest just before


eternal nothingness. What?
Locusts altered with credaceous


era DNA. Yeah, that's not my
field. Yeah, but these things


continue to multiply. We're
talking about gasoline system


wide effects in. Gosh, that's a
drag. This dragon matter with


you. Fine, is there something
special we're going to do? Give


it to us not to care. Hey, I I
gave my opinion robustly for


years as expected to some part
even the difference led to our


annihilation and the only play
now is to take the time we have


left and you know, just let go
to a squadron. Honestly, Ian,


that's **** Can I offer you
guys some Joe? Uh Tyler,


please, two cappuccinos? I
don't want a cappuccino. Trust


me, it's real tough that jet
lag is going to park you right


up.


6 weeks


ago. I was not raising my
voice. And


all my models are pointing
toward a global down the


stairs. It's about six. That's
where they keep the locusts.


Hey, this looks so silky. May I
touch the spice? You know what


it is? Don't talk the wrong
tone. This is sustainable


bamboo. It is sustainable
bamboo spice. You know that.


Yeah. I've got cumin. It's very
cinnamon. I've got all spice


which is not very popular. I've
got five spices. I'm from the


field. Yeah. There's still
milks. Okay. Soy milk. Yes. It


just happened.


Seven level six, restricted.


Louis, you're not listening to
me. The Lucas prehistoric DNA


has made them stronger than
they should be. They're


multiplying like crazy and
they're not dying. What part of


this, don't you understand? Oh,
I do understand. This is


going to be a global family.
Hey, hey, we can't anticipate


everything. We need to
eradicate the ones we released.


What? All of them. No. No.
Henry. Like yesterday. We don't


want to cause a panic. We want
control. There's no such thing.


When we're afraid, what do we
do? What have we done before?


We follow through.


We found a girl. She's on roof.
Cost me a fortune. What?


Waiting you found. Yeah, I
found them both. Her and the


little Raptor. Blue reproduced
to all in Rome. Just like you


said. You're so smart, aren't
That's why this works. You


understand the value of these
creatures? You always have. I


do too. And we don't stop
because of what? Little side


project went south. If they
trace the locusts back to us,


they come from the dinosaurs.
All your work, gone. Billions


of dollars in assets, gone.
Diamonds with noone to mind


them. You really think she's
the solution?


Okay. Everything involved in
the girl goes through me,


right? Is she alright? She
better be. Most valuable


intellectual property on the
planet.


I said I'd call you. They
didn't end yet? Second plane is


incoming. You said anything
about a second plane. We flew


them separately. I'm not taking
any chances. And we'll need


payments before delivery. I
didn't like what happened last


time. Okay, okay. Just call me
when it's done.


You said I was going something
safe. You are.


What you come. It's not a
choice.


Whoo.


50 grand. Not bad.


What's with the girl? Not your
problem.


I should done a visit.


Oh wait.


Hi, Claire. I thought you would
have chosen a quieter line of


work. I tried my caffeine and
lasted three weeks. It's hard


to look away Delapot was hired
by a broker in the underground


dinosaur trade. We don't have
intel on his cargo. But once


they make the exchange, we see
what they know about to go. You


can listen in. I promise you,
you will not make contact.


Yeah.


There's a big underground
market for dinosaurs now.


Europe, Middle East, Northern
Africa, it all comes


Don't look at anyone. Don't
talk to anyone. Just try to


blame it.


Are we live?


Yeah.


Still flying for Santos and you
must need money. What's the to


you? I've got Argo. A thousand
kilos of dinosaur topalermo. I


give you to downstretch. 2000.
How much is there?


You're American. Did that make
us friends? Listen, I just got


here. Oh. No. That was not an
invitation. Here. Souvenir. Go


back to the hotel. You know,
throw some bath salts in the


bath. This place, not your
vibe. Wait. Come here. I know


this must feel exotic but if
you mess with the wrong person


down here, you disappear. You
feel me? Good luck, okay? Wait.


What is this? I need your help.
I don't know you. I'm looking


for someone. Don't do that. She
is all alone. Please.


Dagger die? Yes.


Sorry, I can't get involved.


I


I think I got him. Tap it on
the move. That's our endocover


agent with him. He's headed on
the ground. See him? Yeah, I've


got him. Art.


It's Bravo one. Primary
targeted site.


Amen.


My people say the Raptor
arrived in good condition. You


boys didn't come the sun. Come
at me next. I do have no job


for you. Short hot money is
double. Where's the cargo? At


Trosa Raptors.


Kill who? Whoever they're told.
Laser marks the target they


attached to the center and
stopped it instead.


Inescapable. Those idiots make
a target sound all wrong. You


can't engineer loyalty but to
nurture it. 50, 000 to fly them


Jurassic. In or out. She's not
here. You. Where are we going?


Almost there.


Fly.


One.


This is round one.


One


Oh.


Yes. Deus.


OK


a Amen.


We had some trouble. What kind?
The parents. Thank you.


Can you take care of it? No
suffering. I'll do it.


Okay, listen.


Up.


You don't use it on people.
Where's my daughter? She wasn't


yours to begin with. Tell me.
Biasing. They're taking her to


bias.


Four.


Amen.


Come on.


Come on. Left.


Slow


and


Hold on tight. One,


Do you remember how we used to
get the Raptors in the truck?


Yeah. Yeah. You're up. No.
You're the last man to die for.


I do die for war. You'll be
fine. I never get the time


right.


Minute. Any minute now. No. No.
No.


Let's see. Please.


OK.


Quer o Whats? Luada.


Palmas pra Willing to risk your
life for people you never met?


You want to ask questions or
you want to ride?


We'll take the ride.


So this is our habitat
development vile out of


exciting discoveries as of
late. We've brought back


numerous species into purest
form and I mean complete


untouched genives. Like Morris
and Tripodus. What?


What about splicing DNA? You
know, creating new species. No,


Doctor Satlin, we don't do that
here. We like to think we're


more involved.


Okay, it looks like we still
have some time left before you


arrive. Uh would you guys like
to try the facilities


yourselves? Oh,


Yeah, why not? Great. I'll meet
you guys at the Hyperloop


Station three in about 30
minutes. Elevators are down


this hall, not not those. Those
lead you down to the sub


levels. Need special clearance
to get down there? Okay. 30


minutes.


I'm really sorry that it hadn't
happened this way. Yep, that's


what kidnappers say. Claire
should never have hidden you


away. You're way too important,
Maisie.


You took her too.


We needed her to help us
understand you.


Hey, Veda. You okay? Did you
say Beta? Is that her name?


Genetically identical and
that's what they have in common


and if you and. Charlotte.


What do you know about
Charlotte? She died. A long


time ago. It broke my grandpa's
heart. So he made me No,


Maisie. Actually, he didn't.
Charlotte made you.


I'm so excited for everyone to
see what we've been doing here.


There's new technology being
made, new science like every


day almost and it's great to
be, it's great to be in the


center, center of that.
Charlotte lived on site B with


all of us till the storm. Loved
dinosaurs. Charlotte, be


careful. Yeah, I will. She grew
up around scientists and


eventually, She became one
herself. A butterfly flew into


my office this morning. They
say tiny things have huge


impacts and I agree
wholeheartedly. She was


brilliant. Support my mom. In
ways that I'll never be. In the


metaphysics of identity, can a
replica truly be the original?


And if it's possible,


lost my pen.


Is that me? Yeah. Just like
Blue, Charlotte was able to


have a child all by herself.
She created you with her own


DNA. So, I do have a mother.
Your grandfather didn't want


anyone to know the truth. He
was protecting her and you. And


we're the same. It were. When
you were a baby, Charlotte


started to show symptoms of a
genetic disorder. That's how


she died. She didn't know she
had it until after you were


born. Do I have it too? No. To
change


No one on earth has ever known
how to do that. She said


Charlotte's discovery is a part
of you now. Your DNA could


change the world. To know how
she did it but I just can't


replicate her work if I could
just study you. And Beta whose


DNA was never changed. I could
fix a terrible mistake that


I've made. What kind of
mistake?


Restricted.


Thanks for coming. I Which left
them say?


Get the sample and get and off
so well, they can swarm at the


slightest disturbance.


Is that necessary? What did you
think was going to happen? I


have to take the sample. Need
concrete evidence. This is it.


Allen, you said there was no
time. Hit you, Kenneth. For a


second, Jared.


There's sound signal in between
my open the screen.


How does she remain in an
asset, Henry, if you're


incriminating both of us by
showing her classified things


on the computer. Jurassic Park
for cure disease. She was


right. Having filled the gaps
in Maisie's genome with altered


DNA, she used a pathogen to
deliver the repaired sequence


to every cell. Here I can
repurpose what she did, I could


change Melody's DNA,
eradicating them in a single


generation. Maisy and the baby
raptor will provide the missing


data.


Hey, do you want to get out of
here? You.


Amazing.


Asset containment breach,
please remain at your stations.


Asset containment breach.
Please remain at your stations.


Nothing.


You're Doctor Ellie Satler and
you are a trusted pal. What


what are you doing here? What
are you doing here? I'm Mitty


Lockwood. My grandpa, Neutron
Hanland.


We don't we're not we don't
work for bias. I can tell.


Yeah, we should go.


Okay. In and out. You find your
girl and go. Tower, this is N


one four one. Request the land
for free delivery. Over. Uh N


one four one negative. We've
been advised you're carrying an


authorized passengers over.
Copy that tower. Be advised.


Shipment is perishable. We need
immediate clearance. In order


to be over. No. Uh negative.
Return to point of origin. Uh


you think I need breaking up?
Are are you hearing me on your


side? Nice try Kayla. They
Daniel Bird. Who is this? Is


this Denise? You do not want me
to stop spelling sneakers


Denise. You remember the broad
name.


Denise, in accounts.


Talk to Santos. It's the girl's
parents.


Shut off the ADS.


That's the that's the aerial
deterrent system. Why is it


blinking? Because dead ****
Denise retired. Just turn it


off. We gotta get out of this
airspace right now.


It's going to play, right? Not
exactly.


Should've stayed there.


Okay. Okay. It's cool. We're
good. It's gone.


We gotta get you off this
plate. What? Parachute is


going to open automatically. If
it doesn't, you pull this


lever. Do you understand me? If
it doesn't open automatically,


you're going to pull this lever
here. Seat. Hey, your loader's


gotta go get you. Get her mom.
Get her only shot.


I'll see you again.


What's the plan?


Three. We need the code.


Watch out.


This place is such a maze. We
were so confused, right? I


thought we were straight of
loss and you said station


three. Do you have a sample?
What? What are you talking


about? The DNA sample. Do you
have it? Bias is responsible


for the locust epidemic.
Doction's covering it up. You


were right. I'm I'm here to
help you. Do you have it?


This pod will take you straight
to the airfield. We have a


plane ready to fly. Ian told
you about Axon allies? No, I


told him.


Guys, gotta go. Wait.


Thank you.


Josh.


This


Amen.


That was my baby.


Where'd you learn to fly? Uh
Air Force. Legacy on my mama's


side. Yeah. I'm So how'd you
end up doing this? I was a


legit contract pilot for a bit
but didn't exactly pay not to


be out here sending money home
so I had a few contacts for the


more lucrative shady show.
Honestly, I might be done with


this line. What? Is that why
you're helping us?


I was there when they handed
your girl off the bias. Could


have said something but I did
it. And when I saw a picture It


isn't enough to do nothing.


Whoo.


I


Nope.


What an ****


Hey.


Ah.


You good?


Yep.


The joy should see beacon.
We'll find her. Really love


him, huh?


I like red hats too. But can't.


Disaster live we were tracking
an escaped asset. The guys


missed it. Been stolen to the
next angle. In there. He's an


access key. Aqui. White
clearance. One of our cameras


saw Ian Malcolm hit something
in Satner's pocket.


And get Ramsey up here too with
Where are they now? On the way


to New Yearfield. They called
the hype loop broad on


schedule.


How are you? You alright? Not
really no.


Few years after Hammond died
She came to my university to


lecture and We became good
friends. What was she like?


Brilliant, light years ahead of
everybody else. She had a


conscience. While they were out
building theme parks, well, she


was determined to prove that
genetic power could save lives.


That was our experiment.


If you wanted a child more than
anything, she wanted you to


have but she couldn't. And fall
away.


And I'm never alone.


What's happening?


It's supposed to be the old
apermines. They must have made


access to us when they built
these tunnels.


Hey. I heard the alarm.
Everything alright? Yeah. No.


No. Listen. We can't handle
listen. You're right? Uh good.


Doctor Malcolm, you are What?
It was such a cushion gig and


give your access key to
security if you still have it.


The hypolepods are shut down at
Amber Mike's. What? Wow. This


day. Uh which which pod are we
are there? Um dinosaurs in our


minds? Merit dinosaurs
everywhere. I mean, you know,


technically birds are dinosaurs
genetically speaking. Okay,


Louis. Grant Santler in this
pub, we need to send a security


team out there. Absolutely,
Ramsey. Thank you. Uh let's all


just stay in our lanes though.
We can take care of it. Thank


you, doctor. That's it, huh?
Nothing else to see here. I'm


not sure I admire your tone
right now. You need to leave.


Yeah, I do. But first, I owe
all these folks an apology. I


think that by lending my cachet
to this joint. I admit it may


it seem as if by and wasn't
rotten to the core. That's


enough, Ian. See, here's how
they get it. They give you so


many promotions in a short
period of time that bludgeons


your capacity for critical
thinking. Oh my god. So then


there are doors that you don't
open things that you ignore but


mainly he's exploiting your
enchantment with these. Is


there an actual concern here or
you just. You're racing toward


the extinction of our species
and you don't care. You know


exactly what you're doing but
you won't stop. You You know, I


thought you might be different
but you're just like everyone


else. You see what you want to
see. You imagine unchecked


Everest. So, that's what you
find. You envision what? An


evil onbound Prometheus so
that's what I am to you.


Prometheus got gored. So will
you. You rapacious rat bastard.


Ramsey, you helped Doctor
Malcolm gather his things? His


room and then to the airfield.
That's it.


Kick.


Another source. Giganatosaurus
launches no terrestrial


carnivore. He booked two apex
predators in one valley. Pretty


soon there's only going to be
one.


You.


Did you feel that? It's an air
crew. Must be another thing


I've had. Oh, this is my mimic.
Just breathe. Just watch out


for bats. Say anything about
bats. Well, there's probably no


bats. No falling rocks.
Dispossibility of toxic gas,


dehydration, hypothermia,
dispossibilities, nothing for


certain. I should have left you
everywhere. Why did I bring him


into this? You were happy in
your element. What? I wasn't


happy. Do you guys have kids?
What? Uh no, I I do too but no


pen.


No? No?


Just old friends.


Won't be long before security
knows you're gone. Oh, map.


Looks like an old map. You want
a new map? There's an access


gate at the northeast corner of
the mine. If your friends make


it out to you, when they make
it out. Yes, sir. That's where


they'll be. These roads are
protected, right? Uh yeah, I


drive fast.


You did good. Yeah. Well,
actually it's a complete


disaster but thanks. Not yet.


Watch yourself.


Alright? Yeah.


Be careful.


Give you the code.


With 10, 000 possibilities.


I also spurs three zero five
two six.


Jump swam lane. Trying to stay
positive.


What do you know? It actually
works.


Ian, this is busy. I may We got
the DNA. You need to get out of


this valley. Yeah. Come on.
Let's go.


I


Okay.


Grandma.


Go on. Yuck.


I made


I better get inside.


Go ahead.


Gonna need something heavy,
something sharp, or both.


He's putting the evidence.


Bananas.


Thank you.


I know. This may seem
precarious but No, we're we're


tearing. Should we all lead to
the left or something? That's


very constructive. Thank you,
Maisie. Yeah.


Stop.


Yeah, I never. We're fine.
Serious? Is it fun?


I was there for you.


It's my parents.


To


I remember hearing Remember you
too.


They hope you escape.


Thank you.


We gotta go. Gonna have to
break a window to get inside


that thing. Nobody's afraid of
heights.


Jump out below.


It's over.


That.


Biggest carnivore the world has
ever seen.


Amen.


You.


You.


Alright.


Come on.


Yes.


Stop it.


I got you.


See?


Colin evacuation. We need to
bring the animals inside. The


regulations are clear that in
the event of the


Jeffrey.


Jump. Just call it. Attention,
attention, order. Remote


heading system is now active.
All living assets on route to


emergency containment.


Can't get hold of anybody since
everything is on fire. Doctor


Segler, get some water. Doctor
Grant. You are? I'm I'm Owen


Grady, big fan. I read your
book. Well, book on tape. Owen


Grady. Owen Grady, I know who
you are. You trade raptors.


Yeah. I tried. Yeah. How you
doing? You you're a Jurassic


World. Jurassic World? Not a
fan and Okay. So, we good to


find a way out of here? Yep.
Let's get it. There's a


helicopter out in the main
complex. We turn the ADS back


on, we go home. Wait, what's an
ADS? Aerodyterrant system. You


know, for the pterodactyls and
**** Keeps them away from the


helicopters. Well, how do we
turn it back home? Okay, it


looks like all the systems run
through to the control room


which is on the third floor.
Yeah.


Easy rainbow.


Wow or what happens? You just
tell them what to do and they


they comply or human animal
bond based on ritual respect.


Had a dog once helped my legs
so much.


It's a true starter.


Ah, Kyle. Hey, good. Here's
what I'm thinking. We get


started again. You and me. I
can get money. Yeah. Money's


cheap these days. What what's
the matter? Don't look so


worried. Just there's
opportunity in everything


Peach. Even this. You you'll
earn that. I've been thinking


maybe you take more of the lead
now. Okay? You ready I think?


What the hell is the matter
with you?


It was you. You told Malcolm
about the program. You you you


set this whole thing up. You
set me up. I gave you every


opportunity I did not have. We
have an understanding, Ramsey


and you do not break that.


I would not break this.


I'm not new.


It's very bad. This is the same
system we used at the park.


Great. So we can turn on the
the thing and then we all get


EDS? What's this? What what's
error 99? Not enough power.


Gonna break down all available
power to see us by the primary


system to keep running. We need
all that power to reactivate


the EDS. So the system's safety
features what's going to catch?


Cool. Of course. How do we get
more power? Uh well we can't


but we can't redistribute what
we have. We just just need to.


Shut down the primary system.
Yes exactly. Where is it? Uh


next floor up. I'll call you
with you. We escaped on him.


Where is that? Water shoot you
sir. How'd your electric system


sub eight? Give me eight
minutes I can find her. Wait.


Who's this now? Beta. Beneath
baby. Velociraptor. What? A


baby raptor? And you gave her a
name. How about that? I made a


promise when you burn home. You
made a promise to a dinosaur.


You're home with us right?
Thanks again. Please.


Be on channel five, okay? Run
three. Come back. But I always


come back. I'll have that
chopper hot tint wait for my


signal. Evacuation place for a
seat. Assets now containment


Still get night gears all the
time.


We hold on to regret and we
stay in the past.


What matters I guess is is what
we do now.


Nobody except her be backs. B
4, she's in here. Watch the


charge. Come from the sides.
And at first we thought They


disembow their prey but no,
they're smart enough to go


straight to the throat. The
arteries. It's not supposed at


the same time. Okay.


We've got you. It's right down
that aisle. It's right down


that aisle where you are. Why
are they scooping into this?


You can sprint right for it.
Here it is. Okay, so it'll be a


yellow button and the grid is
six. There's a green button. Do


you see a green button? It's
not that green button that's


formed. Four from the bottom.
Fourth one up. Third one down


or fourth one up. Same thing.
Ian, be specific.


She was here. Lights off.


I don't know how I could
possibly be more specific other


than to say that the one you
want is marked with E one. E


one. Any more?


No. No. No. No. No.


Eyes on me.


I've got a hitter on the side
of the neck. Maisie, you're


going to hold her focus? Grant
I'm trying you later.


Sorry girl. I promised your mom
I'd get you home. Perfect


system.


It's rebooting. No, I shouldn't
be doing that.


We're going to make it work.
We're going to figure this out.


It's very complex. We don't
have guns.


Primary system compromised.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.


Aerial deterrent system active.
Victory. Victory.


Do you feel good?


Power.


It's


Shh. What's your story?


We're dedicated to the idea
that dinosaurs can teach us


more about ourselves.


Alright, Kila. We're good to
go.


Okay, cutie.


Hey.


Please, you have to listen to
me. You created an ecological


disaster and I can fix it.
Charlotte Lock would change


every cell at Macy's body. It
saved her life. If I can


understand how Charlotte
rewrote Macy's DNA, I can


spread change from one locust
to the entire swarm before it's


too late. It's okay. It's okay.


It's what she would've wanted.


No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Him, not him, not him, it's


always him. Every is that a
dinosaur on your shoulder?


Meet me in the center.


Landing here. I'll have a
choice, dude. The valley is


insane. They're not in the
valley anymore. Mom,


This isn't about us.


Everybody hold on to somebody.


Wow.


No. At every level. Complete
systemic corruption in in the


executive lands. Systemic
corruption.


No, and then and then we
crashed into this ice thing,


right? I mean, they literally
owe me a plane. I need to get


this sample better to laugh or
I take into my contact at the


times. You could come with me.
Unless you need to get back to


your dig.


Ellie? Yeah. I am coming with
you.


Know. Mark will win it then
we'll send you home with your


folks.


Today marks the first day of
testimony from Bios and


whistleblower Ramsey Cole. The
Senate will also hear from


doctors Grant, Sattler, and
Malcolm who have been vocal in


this debate since the incident
at Jurassic Park.


I'm trustworthy.


Yeah. Not getting used to it.
Let's finish this. Yeah.


Doctor Henry Wu has found an
emergency solution to the


ecological crisis. His use of a
pathogen to alter the locust


DNA has revolutionized modern
genetics. He attributed the


discovery to another scientist,
Charlotte Lockwood, who died


nearly 13 years ago.


I


By human decree, Biosen Valley
has been designated a global


sanctuary. The animals will
live there free, safe from the


outside world.


Help.


Chuck.


You.


Life on earth has existed for
hundreds of millions of years


and dinosaurs were only a part
of that and we are even smaller


part of that. They really put
us in perspective. The idea


that life on earth existed 65
million years ago. It's


humbling. We act like we're
alone here but we're not. We're


part of a fragile system made
up of all living things. If


we're going to survive, we'll
have to trust each other,


depend on each other. Coexist.



Whoo, baby! The anti-villain league
can't catch this.


Guess who stole the map?

Hallelujah!

I got this.

Step on it, sister.


Hurry up! Come on!


I got it. I got the stone.


Party's over old man.
The vicious six has a new head honcho.


You just got played, poor sucker!


Hold on. I started this group.
We're a team!


Where's your loyalty?


Oh please, we're villains.


There's no such thing.

Holy guacamole.


Where can we listen?
Where can we listen?!


Hello Mr. Gru.


We've received your application to the world's

A recent opening has become available.


-And
-And?


Your interview is tomorrow at noon.


-Dy-na-mite!
-Dynamite!!


Please go to 417 Main Street.


The password is "you're no good."


"You're no good."


Now, get up from the down, son,
because this invitation is gonna explode, baby!


Explode?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!


Very big news, mom!


Mom?


Mom?


What?


Mom, who is this sweaty guy?
He's stinking up the house.


I thought you were cooking cabbage.


He's my new guru.


Hello, weird buddies.
They better stop pulling their weight around here.


or I'm kicking them out.


They are killing
my mellow vibes.


Hey! I heard that.


Come on, let's go tell
the troop the good news.


Gentlement, to the basement.
AKA, our new evil lair.


This is fantastic.
Oh. Such a good spray, guys.


My first evil lair. Goosebumps!


Well, you gotta break a few eggs
to make an omelette.


Am I right?


Great job, Ryan.


I said, "Great job."


Never mind.


Adrianne! Mack! Lookin' good.


Joe! How's the family?


Okay. Everybody, get over here.


Now, listen up. Button your overalls.
Hold on to your goggles.


The Vicious 6 wants to meet me tomorrow.


All right. All right.
I'm not mini.


Please stop calling me that,
and also, they haven't accepted me yet.


Hello, Otto. What is it?


Uh huh. Well, tha- tha- yes-


I would...
Okay, you know it would be fun?


Let's play the quiet game.


Anyway, thanks for the hard work today everyone.


I gotta go get some rest.


Tomorrow is the biggest day of my life.


Watch out, world.
Here comes Gru!


I'm not... uhh...


Oh, these guys are the best.
I can't believe it.


Yeah, I get it, but I need
a good night's sleep, so get out.


Okay, fine, fine. Because you had a
nightmare, but just tonight.


I'm not buying the nightmare story, though.


Oh really, you too?


Get in.


-Good night. -Good night.
-Yes, yes, yes. Good night.


I just want to get some sleep.


[Villain News Channel]


Breaking news! The Vicious 6 is ready to
rewrite the rules of villainy.


Villains of the world,


In three days when the clock strikes midnight
and the Chinese New Year begins,


this bad boys' power
is gonna be unleashed.


With the power of the Zodiac,


we're gonna take out
the anti villain league.


And The Vicious 6 will be
the most powerful villains on the planet.


Can you dig it?


What dig it? Do I dig it?


I don't dig it.
There's nothing to dig.


They thought they could leave me
for dead, huh?


Kick me to the curb
like a piece of old meat.


Oh. They got no idea what's coming?


Oh. I'm gonna make them suffer
for what they have done to me.


-Oh boy.
-Hey, Mr. Knuckles.


What?!


We uhh... just wanted to make sure
we be getting paid this week.


What about value?
I'm paying you with knowledge.


You are?


Lesson one,
always be prepared.


Lesson two,


The Belguim Five-arm Nose-Pinch.


And lesson 3,


The Lithuanian Haircut.


That's worth all the money in the world.


Hey guys, forget about it.
You're going to get paid.


But first, we got to
get my stone back.


I see a bad Gru arising.


I see I'm feeling on his way.


I'm going now in the room with my heroes.


They're gonna love me
because I'm the best.


Don't mess up tonight.


You're going to join The Vicious 6.


Here is the bad Gru
and did I...


Guys...


Oh, you want to come?


Right, right...
Okay...


When you guys tracked me down and
responded to my help, what did happen?


I was like
"who are these tiny tater tots?"


"And where did they get so much denim?"


And you're just wouldn't quit.


All right, I surrender.
Come on in.


We've had some great times since then,


But the thing is... The Vicious 6,
they're the big leagues.


And you guys...
are... great...


and so the job you did with the lair.


A plus.


It's just what I was thinking


is that there are a lot
of other villains in the world.


You know?


Never mind. Look.


I think I just need to fly solo.


See you later, alligator.


Here we go.


Excuse me.
Sir?


I was wondering if you're no good.


You're good. My mistake.


Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.


I was just trying out
this new invention of mine.


I call it "sticky fingers"
or "smart goo."


I haven't quite landed on the name yet.


Come here.


I overheard you were looking
for something...


Special.


I yes, I was hoping
you're no good.


I think you'll enjoy
listening in Booth 3.


Right this way.


This is it. Mums the word. Keep it down.


Good luck.
Let her have it, son.


Thanks mister


Nefario.


That's Doctor Nefario.


Here are the package.


If you ever get famous, remember
who gave you your first gadget.


Okay.


Try backwards.


Welcome to The Vicious 6.


That's pretty...


Hello.


Everybody here for the interview?


Me too.


So what do you guys
got going on later?


Are you up to no good?


Are you gonna get into some mischief?


Bring the first one in.


They're ready to see you Mr. Gru.


Oh, good good.


Distinguished villains,


My name is Gru.


I feel like I'm talking too loud,
even though our proximity


doesn't require this kind of volume.


If you told me when I was ten,


if I would have the chance to fill
the shoes of my favorite villain ever,


Wild Knuckles


I would say "you got
rocks in your head,"


but now that I'm 11 and 3/4
it makes a lot more sense.


All right, who let the kid in?


I thought he was this tiny man.


What's wrong with you?


You seriously think a puny little
child can be a villain.


Umm... Yes. I'm pretty despicable.


You don't want to cross me.


Evil is for adults,


who steal powerful ancient stones
and wreak havoc,


and not for tubby little pups
who should be at school learning


taking a recess.


Suck, I can't stop.


Come back when you've done
something to impress me.


Who's next?


I am Wingman,
the next member of The Vicious 6.


Behold, the power of flight, Sir.


All right, joke's over.
Show time.


right


Bring him in. Bring him in, boys!


He took the stone.


Caught him!


Lock down the building.


I did... nothing to see here.


Oh, look at you. Frampton Comes Alive!
Nice choice.


I uh...


Just keep walking.


Look at that. A kid?


Guys.


What are you doing here?


Okay. Just get on.


-Which way did he go?
-There is that little thief.


-Knock knock. Delivery!


The demon child!


Otto, take the stone back to the lair.


I'll distract them.


No, not now. Come on, come on.


Yeah, baby.


I'll handle this.


Hope you enjoy the rest of your short life.


Please work.
Come on, come on, come on.


We're coming for you, tiny man!


They all said a kid wouldn't
be a real villain.


We-he-ell... This kid just stole something
from the worst villains in the world.


When I bring it back to them,
they're going to say...


"We have made a terrible mistake."


"Please join us."


"Please Gru"
and I will say...


Yes! I will be the newest
member of The Vicious 6.


Now all I need is Otto.


Where is Otto?


No, not "Otto le komay"
He needs to come in now.


-Otto!
-Mini boss!


There you are...


You got it?


Is this... Are you pulling
on my legs right now?


Otto, where's the stone?


What about you?


Come up.


Did you just trade my future?


For a pet rock?!


Okay, I'll go...


Where was this birthday party?


This is unacceptable. Unacceptable!


I told you guys that you weren't
ready for the big leagues


and you have proven me correct.


All you do is mess everything up.


Ugh! What?!


My mom was right.


You do not belong here.
You're fired.


I'm going to find that stone.


When I get home,
you all better be gone.


And Otto, close your yapper!


I'll say goodbye.


No one ever cared if I should leave.


Kevin, no, I will be better
off on my own.


I'm sorry.
I thought you'll be impressed


Can I just speak to Belle Bottom?


Wild Knuckle!


You're alive?


Wow, my favorite villain
is also my kidnapper.


This could be a great opportunity
if you don't kill me.


Shut up and give me the stone.


Ahh. Yes. The stone.


Here's the thing about that.


It's kind of a funny story.


Give it to him.


It's all going to go south very quickly.


What the heck is this?


Where is it, boy?


I don't have it,
I don't have it.


I know you're hiding
it somewhere.


I'm not, I'm not. I swear.
Cross my heart and hope to die.


Stick a needle in my eye.


Don't actually do that though.


Somebody bring me a phone.


Call home. It's ransom time.


No, no, no. My mom will
probably pay you to keep me.


Good one. Call!


Who is this?


Kevin lay what?


You kidding me?
You got henchmen?


Well, that's the end of that.


Listen, you. Bring the stone to me
in San Francisco.


6830 Green Street, got it?
Now you got two days


or you are never gonna see
your little boss again.


Oh ho ho... The stone.


Gave that to my uncle.
It's more his style.


I told you, I don't know where
he went you stupid Twinkies.


Not cool, man.


San Francisco.


Let's rock and roll.
Time to get our stone back.


We're coming for you, Mr. Gru.


Hallelujah!


San Francisco. Okay.
How will you be paying?


Oh great. You know, if you have any hairballs,
we can upgrade you to 1st class.


Get out.


And I had to turn back
at LaGuardia.


Hey Dolly.


AD STARTING IN 40:14, ENDS IN 40:45.
SKIP FOR 30 SECONDS.


Oh. Yes, please.


You got real moxie kid,
stealing from The Vicious 6.


I got moxie, really? Did I just
receive a compliment from Wild Knuckles?


All my dreams are coming true right now.


Well, it's about to become your nightmare.


Welcome to my newest torture device.
Disco inferno.


Your minions better get it
by sundown tomorrow


because if 48 hours of disco won't kill you,
the blade will.


Oooh! No, no, no, no, no.


Go go go.


Next up, Green Street.


Wait a minute.


Trespassers!


Come back here.


Get your little butts back here.


OK, now. You might feel
a little pinch.


Got you now.


Time to bring some fun.


Any plans for the weekend?


Take five deep breaths.


I'll be right back.


You like picking
on little guys, huh?


Go take a nap, old lady.


Old lady?


I am a master of the ancient
Shaolin Art of Kung Fu.


No.


Get lost.


If you come back to our place,
you're dead.


Shh shh shh... You can thank me
by going away. I'm working.


You? Want to learn Kung Fu?


My teaching days are over.


This is my life now.


Fine.


I will teach you.


Hey,


those are not for you.


The name of the game
is sell, sell, sell.


Where is Gru?


How should I know?
What's with the costumes?


Halloween was four months ago.
You look stupid.


Buzz off. Shoo.


I'm getting my meat tenderizer.


Let me help you with that, dearie.


Now, where's the boy?


I didn't mean to scare you.


Don't worry,
we're not mad at him.


We just want to...


hire him.

Wild Knuckles? He's alive?


And working with the kid?


We're going to San Francisco.


Let's hit it.


You had better be paying for my roof.


Pretty groovy, huh?


[BASIC SKILLS]


We begin with a basic kick.


Now, you.


Okay... No kicking.


This is a melon hammer.
It's a weapon.


This is Fred.
He is a dummy.


Never underestimate a dummy.


Now, attack.


Don't tell to me
"I cannot break this wood."


But doubt exists
only in the mind.


You know what I say
to my mind.


Now, you.


kevin kevin kenny


Okay. Clearly, we are not ready
for philosophy.


Let's just train.


Rest up. Tomorrow's going
to be even worse.


What? You're quitting?


I told you, when I get that stone,


We're going to be unstoppable.


I have had enough.


There's nothing sadder
than an aging villain.


So long, old man.


Guys, come on. We're a team.


Hope you like it.


Is this?


I just had to fire my henchman.
You know why?


Because they weren't getting
the job done.


OK, I'm just gonna untie you now because I


I I I need you to do some stuff
for me around the house.


You might be, you know, kind of nice
to have a little company around here.


Oh, yeah.


Villains just doing some chores.


Who knows what kind of trouble
we could get into.


What's that?


-That's your evil chuckle?
-Obviously.


Well, it stinks.


You sound like a clown
who swallowed a kazoo.


Really? Well, you look like a wizard going
through an end of life crisis.


Easy now, Don Rickles.


Who's Don Rickles?


[RATTLESNAKES XING]


Dude.


I thought we lost you
there for a minute.


Hey, chill, chill.


You wanna try this one, little dude?


Hey soul brother,
where jetting off to?


Disco Frisco!


It's so lucky day chick
I'm heading up the coast.


I could drop you off on the way.


[WORLD'S BIGGEST BANANA]


Start with the pool.
This place gotta be spick and span.


What are you doing?


You look like the overcooked turkey
my mom makes on Thanksgiving.


Oh yeah, I forgot to mention,


the pool is filled
with my pet crocodiles.


Yeah, well, well... doesn't scare me.


Be careful. I can't have you lose an arm


because they need you to change
some light bulbs after this, yeah.


I'll show you how it's done.


Knock it off.


Hey. Whoa! Oh, no.


Marvin, no, no. Stop that.


The net.


I got you.


I got you. I got you.


I don't got you.


Take my hand.


Got you.


You could have ran.
But you... But you didn't.


I told you, you were my
favorite villain in the world.


I could not let you get
eaten by crocodiles.


Even though that would have been
kinda cool to watch.


So... So you want to be
a great villain, huh?


That's all I ever wanted.


You want to, I don't know, you want me...


You want me to teach you a thing or two?


Many fighters have asked me,
"how did I become a great master?"


[FINDING YOUR INNER BEAST]


Even the smallest of us are capable
of great things.


You just dig down deep,
find your inner beast, and...


Now, you try.


Find your inner beast.


Stop this kick.


We have a lot more work to do.


Kevin, Stuart, and Bob,
you are ready.


No, no, no, no, no.


Ready for your Kung Fu
junior chievement badges.


They're dead.

Well, that's my grandson who still has not learned
that children should be seen and not heard.


Haha, kids.

Yeah, you look so weird.


Oh haha, don't listen to him.

learn from the old school.

Well, you are old.


But you're not alone.

We are starting a new team
and it's going to be called


The Terrible Twos.


We can find a better name later,


but right now we are going

and show everybody that you still got it.

It's over.


-Go home.

Well, well, well, everybody...
Did you forget what time it is?


Happy New Year!


Fire!


Stand your ground.


No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, NO!


Where do you think you're going?


You stole from us,
and now you're gonna pay.


Enjoy being torn apart.


Guys!


Oh...
Why don't we make this a fair fight?


Oh... You thought I was serious?


Hello, traitors!


Remember me?


You?


You can leave me for dead,


You destroy everything I own,
but I will not let you hurt that kid.


Oh...
So you're gonna save the kid?


Yeah, you and what army?


Okay... this army.


Dig down deep.
Find your inner beast.


Otto.


Hurry! Faster!


Get away from him.


Destroy the kid.


No!


How does it feel to be beaten
by the tiny little bug?


You guys were amazing.

Obviously, you guys are re-hired.


Oh, no. Wild Knuckles.

-Hey


You're gonna be OK, right?


Don't worry about me, kid.


I'll be fine.


Finally.


You are going away
for a long, long time.


Yeah, well, I wouldn't bet on it.


No.


See you soon kiddo.

but the time we did have...

for all the terrible things
that I'm going to do.


Believe me,
they're gonna some awful things


But I'm going to make you proud.


I'm going to be the best villain
ever because of you.


Because you taught me what matters,
you can't do anything alone.


Find your tribe.


And never ever let them go.


Otto.


You better stay out of trouble, kid.


I will live a
good and honest life.


You're alive?


You just blew my mind.


How could you do that?

Oh, no, Pickles, you’re leaving?

Okay.
But if this Puss in Boots is such a big deal, maybe we shouldn’t be desecrating his grave.
No, I don’t think he would mind, because he…

How’s it going? Can you see anything up there?
Not yet, Perrito… (yells)
You okay?
Sí, I am good.
(chuckling): So good.
(screams, grunts)
(panting)
If you wanted to hold my hand, all you had to do is ask.
Uh, just, uh, feel free to pull me up whenever you get a chance.
Oh, I was just remembering
the last time I offered you my hand.
Only, that time, I believe you had cold feet.
(chuckles)
Kitty…
(sighs)
About that day.
Puss in Boots is not supposed to be afraid.
But outside that church in Santa Coloma, that was the first time I ever felt fear.
So I ran.
It was a mistake, Kitty.
It’s okay.
No, no. It was cowardly.
It’s okay.
You alone at the altar.
Puss.
In your beautiful, poofy wedding dress.
Puss! It’s okay.
I didn’t show up, either.
Wait, what?
What do you mean, you didn’t show up?
Well, I knew I could never compete with your one true love.
Who?
Yourself.
The legend.
Uh…
I wasn’t gonna show up for that guy.
But you don’t seem like that guy anymore.
Everything okay up there?
I’m giving you a thumbs-up, just so you know.
KITTY: Puss!
Look.
What do you think, bug?
Do I wait for the cats to steal the map and then kill them, or do I just kill everybody all at once?
You know, I’m starting to think you don’t appreciate the value of a life.
What? No.
I mean, I love these guys.
(screaming, groaning)
Flex the glutes. I need a solid surface.
There’s good in all people. There’s good in all people.
You know, Jack, maybe we need to dig a little deeper.
T-Tell me about your childhood.
(sighs)
You know, I never had much as a kid.
Just loving parents and stability and a mansion and a thriving baked goods enterprise for me to inherit.
Useless crap like that.
But once I get my wish, I’ll finally have the one thing that will make me happy.
Oh, well, what’s that?
All of the magic in the world.
(laughing maniacally)
For me.
And no one else gets any.
Is that so much?
Yes!
Agree to disagree.
All right, bring it over.

Uh, uh, guard our rear.
Yeah. Yeah.

Portobello purgatory.
My only companion is a rock I named stone.
The question is, for whom am I narrating this?
It seems I’ve become a featured player in the theater of the absurd.
Marooned in deep space by that wretched blue rodent.
But it’s all good, thanks to a breathable atmosphere and my supreme intellect, sharpened against the only competitor savvy enough to bring it.
Chanterelle to d4.
I’ve been striving to make fungi into a functional drink of choice…
Mushroom coffee.
With limited…
Limited…
Limited…
Success.
But today, day 243, has brought a new optimism to my most pressing endeavor…
Planetus exodus to returnicus and kick blue butticus.
If my calculations are correct, and there’s no reason to say “if” because they always are…
This quill is going to power my masterpiece.
Let’s light this candle…
And see who comes a-knockin’.

I’d be happy to show you the way.
They’re still on us.
This’ll slow ’em down.
Watch out. Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.
Good evening, gentlemen. Mind if I drive?
Better buckle up.
How we doing back there?
And now this way.
I’m sorry. I don’t speak duct tape.
What the heck are you?
Fear not, citizen.
I am the hero you need and the hero you deserve.
The blue dawn that banishes the darkest…
Holy crap!
Don’t worry. Nobody’s gonna get hurt.
What are those?
Bombs. Bombs.
They’re bombs! Those are bombs!
Relax. They’re not even lit.
So I’ll say again, nobody’s gonna get…
I was wrong! We’re all gonna die!
Why aren’t you slowing down?
That would require brakes.
It’s hot. Hot, hot, hot! Hot, hot, hot!
Why don’t you just let the police handle this?
Because that’s not what heroes do.
Thank you very much. Please hold your applause.
Do you hear that? There’s one bomb left.
Did you check under the seat?
Of course I checked under the seat!
You are terrible at this!
You know what?
Your negative attitude is not helping anyone.
It’s in your spiky things!
I can never find anything in here.
Drained it from downtown!
See? I told you nobody would get hurt.
Holy sherbet!
Oh, hello.
Don’t panic. This is only a drill.
Come here!
No need to thank me, citizens.
All in a night’s work for…
Blue justice!
You’re a terrible hero!
Morning, Wade!
Morning, Sonic!
Good morning, green hills!
Come on.
Sonic.
I miss you, longclaw.
I’m trying to make you proud.
And now for a little shut-eye.
Ozzy, morning breath!
Sonic. Are you still in bed?
You’re supposed to meet Tom, remember?
All right, all right, I’m up! I’m up.
What a day.
Thanks for coming out, bud.
I feel like you and me, we haven’t had much time together lately.
How’s it going over there? You getting any bites?
I can’t swim! Help!
If I die, don’t look in my closet!
Hey, hey, you’re good. You’re all right. Come on.
It’s freezing.
All right, okay. Take it easy.
You’re good. Okay.
But now that you’ve had a nap and a bath…
I went up to your room last night to bring you some new comics and…
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.
I wouldn’t come any closer, because this little hedgehog had way too many chili dogs.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I’m so embarrassed. Get out of here quick!
Oh, no, here comes another one!
Go. Now. Save yourself.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there.
I wouldn’t come any closer, because this little hedgehog had way too many chili dogs.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I’m so embarrassed. Get out of here…
I knew I should’ve used real farts.
How many times are we gonna do this?
What?
Cast your line and not catch anything? Seems like a billion.
I think you know what I’m talking about.
The lying. The sneaking out.
The pretending to be Batman.
Blue justice, trademark pending.
Whatever. You’re being reckless.
Not this conversation again.
Hey. It’s no fun for me, either.
But if you keep being irresponsible, we’re gonna keep having this conversation.
How is it irresponsible to use my powers?
Sonic, you destroyed an entire city block!
That block was already messed up. Who cares?
Look, I stopped a robbery. I was a hero.
No, you put people in danger and that’s not what a hero does.
You’re supposed to be my friend.
Stop trying to be my dad.
I can take care of myself.
Sonic, taking care of yourself is not what being a hero’s all about.
It’s about taking responsibility for other people.
And right now, whether you want to hear this or not, you are still just a kid.
You got some more growing up to do before you’re ready to be the big hero.
But trust me when I tell you, there will come a time when your powers will be needed.
But you don’t choose that moment.
That moment chooses you.
Look at you.
Look at that. I just got goose bumps.
Wait a second. Did you steal that from Oprah?
No, sir. That is a wachowski family special.
Came from my dad, in this very boat, on this very lake.
He would always try and steer me in the right direction.
And that’s what maddie and I have always tried to do with you.
So, until your moment arrives, I want you to work on being a little more responsible.
Comprende?
Comprende.
High five on it.
Yeah! Donut lord and the blue blur are back at it again!
Hang on.
Speedboat!
Sonic!
How excited are you, going to Hawaii with me?
Oh, yeah!
Welcome to Sonic air, the fastest way to travel.
Now boarding groups one and two.
Sonic, this is so fun!
I’m sorry, ma’am, you’re group three. Please wait your turn.
Anyone from groups one and two? Nobody?
Just let him get it out of his system.
Okay, then everybody else right this way.
Thank you.
And you, sir?
Terrible shirt detected.
There we go.
Okay, you’re free to go. Enjoy your trip. Bye-bye now.
Okay.
Bring it in.
Tom, I’m about to be hedgehog of the house for the first time.
I think I’m a little mature to hug you goodbye.
Okay, what about a power bump?
Power bump?
Yes, power bump.
That’s more like it.
Wachowski!
Wachowski!
Okay, use this one to get back home.
All right, we’re off. Be good.
Yes. You have our number.
Sorry! Can’t hear you!
You’re traveling through a cross-dimensional portal!
Miss you already!
Okay?
Have fun at Rachel’s wedding!
Okay, it’s 48 hours until they come back.
We’ve got TV channels, streaming channels, a house full of food and no supervision.
Let’s do this.
If these readings are accurate, he’s here.
I found him!
I just hope I’m not too late.
He’s close.
I just need a way to reach him without being spotted.
Standard human transport. Perfect.
Oh, boy.
Aloha!
How’s it going, bud?
Oh, you know.
Just a quiet night at home, settling in with a good book.
And you? What’s up with you?
I was just calling to say we’re here.
But now every word out of your mouth is making me suspicious.
What?
You got to relax, buddy. You’re at the four seasons oahu.
Have a Mai Tai. Enjoy some time with your wife.
Get sunburned somewhere embarrassing.
This weekend is about you.
You know what? You’re right. We power-bumped on it.
So whatever it is you’re doing, I’m sure you can undo it by the time we get home, yeah?
Exactly! I mean, I am deeply offended by such accusations!
So, how’s Rachel’s fiance?
Is he as good-looking in person as he is in pictures?
Somehow better-looking.
Wow! You’re about to be the third best-looking dude in the family.
But, hey, still on the podium.
All right, I better go and introduce myself.
Stay out of trouble.
Trouble? Don’t worry. Everything here is completely normal.
Uh-huh. Night, bud.
Hey! I was just coming over to say hi.
You’ve got a lot of nerve coming up in here after what you did to my fiancée.
Wait. What?
Totaling her car?
Leaving her tied to a chair? I should rip you limb from limb.
Oh, my god, look at your face!
Tommy, breathe, baby. Breathe. I was kidding.
Hey, man, I was totally kidding.
Okay.
You were kidding.
Yeah.
I’m sorry. Rachel put me up to it. It was totally her idea.
That rascal.
Listen, I don’t know if you’re aware. Rachel does not care for you at all.
I’m aware. Yeah.
Seriously, bro, you got work to do.
Hey!
Hey.
Good to see you! Thanks for coming, Tom.
Really glad you came.
Really?
Great to see you, too. Congratulations.
I mean, you guys, you guys seem really happy together.
You know, you’re all right, Thomas Wachowski.
Can we Bury the hatchet?
I’d love that.
Yeah?
Yeah.
All right, bring it in!
All right! Great.
And if you screw up my wedding, I will end you.
All right, Ozzy, it’s movie night at casa de Sonic, and it’s your turn to pick.
But I am not watching snow dogs again.
That movie is the worst!
Blackout!
Ozzy.
Sorry, buddy. Everything’s okay.
Excuse me. We did not order a poltergeist.
If this is the pizza guy, this is really unprofessional.
Eggman?
Hello, hedgehog.
Did you miss me?
I don’t know how you got back, but you made a big mistake coming here.
Au contraire, mon frere.
The mistake was thinking you’d won.
But that was just a prelude, an hors d’oeuvre, an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.
I get it.
I don’t think you do.
But you’re about to.
And so will that idiot sheriff and his wife.
And your little dog too!
Pitiful.
What? Who are you?
Where are my manners?
Sonic, meet knuckles.
My new bffae.
Bestest friend forever and ever!
Look, robotnik, I don’t care who you brought to help you.
You’re never going to get my power.
Do I look like I need your power?
So nice when diabolical evil lives up to the hype.
Where is it?
You want it? Here it comes.
I was expecting more of you. You’re unskilled.
Untrained.
And unworthy!
You forgot one. Unstoppable.
It is my destiny to do what my ancestors could not…
To restore the ultimate power to the home of my people.
Ultimate power? I don’t know what you’re talking about.
You’ve got the wrong guy.
Ultimate power?
Now you’re speaking my language.
Don’t play dumb with me, apprentice of longclaw.
You knew longclaw?
Longclaw and her people were the sworn enemy of my tribe, the echidna.
We fought and died at their hands, and now you will die at mine.
Come on. Get in! I’m on your side.
I’m sorry. Who are you?
You know what? It doesn’t matter.
Get us out of here! Go, go, go, go, go!
He’s gone rabid!
Gross! Is he licking it?
See ya!
Make sure to get your shots, Eggman!
Wow. Okay. Let me just say it is an honor to finally meet you, Sonic.
Is it okay if I call you Sonic?
Everyone calls me tails. You’re probably wondering why.
Let me guess. Because of the extra tail?
That’s right! I should’ve known you’d get that.
Cool. Also, what is going on? Robotnik’s back?
And who is Clifford the big red rage monster?
That’s knuckles, the last of the echidnas
and the most dangerous warrior in the galaxy.
He’s obsessed with finding the master emerald.
Are you serious? The master emerald?
That’s just a bedtime story.
Well, he believes it’s real.
And he must think you’re the key to finding it.
Red light! Give me the wheel!
Hey, what are you…
Move your foot.
I think we lost him.
We did not lose him. We definitely did not lose him!
I’ve got an idea. Do you trust me?
Of course not! I literally just met you!
Just let me. Come on!
What are you doing?
We’re flying.
Did your butt just turn into a helicopter?
A butt-copter!
Only Sonic the hedgehog could come up with something like that.
Foxy move.
You want something done right…
You have to hire someone you can push around.
All caps.
Doctor, where are you?
Freak.
I, I’m sorry, folks.
I have to close early. Everybody out!
Everybody out. Thank you for visiting the mean bean.
All right, good night. Good night.
He’s back.
He’s back!
That’s more like it.
I’ve been re-hatched!
So, my massively metacarpaled friend, you mentioned…
Ultimate power.
Back at the house?
The master emerald?
It does not concern you.
I got you off that planet and you brought me to the hedgehog.
We have no more use for each other.
Well, I hate to be a contrarian, but…
I think we might.
You think these machines are a match for me?
I will shatter them like the bones from a fallen…
They are stairs.
You see, earth is my turf, g.
If you don’t know how to floss, you’ll be lost without me.
I understand nothing of what you just said.
I help you retrieve the emerald, and you use it to…
Destroy the hedgehog!
You’re suggesting an alliance.
Around here we simply grip each other’s hands tightly.
You truculent space bumpkin!
You’ve crushed my favorite hand!
Really? My hand is uninjured.
But I’m now convinced of your commitment.
“Oh, goody,” he exclaimed, while he reset two of his knuckles.
I’m…
Delighted to be on the same team.
Road trip!
I’ll let you stick your nose out the window.
Sonic, where are we?
Welcome to the Wade cave.
Which is something I hope to someday say to a woman.
A woman who’s not my mom.
Wade, focus.
We need to figure out why knuckles thinks I’m the key to finding the master emerald.
And why did he mention longclaw?
There must be a connection.
Wait a minute. There is.
Look. There’s an emerald symbol on the map longclaw gave me.
I never knew what it meant before.
Something’s happening.
Longclaw?
Hello, Sonic.
If you’re watching this, then something has happened to me.
And I pray you’ve made it to earth unharmed.
This world has been chosen for a very important reason.
It’s the secret location of the master emerald.
The emerald has the power to turn thoughts into reality.
Like the stay puft marshmallow man from ghostbusters.
In the wrong hands it could threaten all life in the universe.
Protecting the emerald was my sacred duty.
And now I must pass that responsibility to you.
This is my moment.
Follow the map, find the emerald, and keep it safe.
My dear Sonic,
you have a heart like no creature I’ve ever known.
I love you so much.
Goodbye.
No, no, no, wait.
I won’t let you down, longclaw.
So is that you, your dad?
What?
No?
According to this map, the first clue is in Siberia.
It’s a compass that will lead to the emerald.
And with knuckles already here, it’s a race.
Knuckles?
I knew a kid in middle school named knuckles.
Could fit his whole fist in his mouth.
If this is the same knuckles, we are screwed.
This knuckles, that knuckles. It doesn’t matter.
We’re gonna get there first.
What do you mean, “we”?
You’re coming with me.
No, no, no, no, no.
I just came here to warn you. I’m not a field guy.
Don’t worry. I got your back. I won’t let anything happen to you.
It’s a power bump. On earth, it means an unbreakable promise.
Okay, I’m in.
Doctor. It’s really you.
You look different.
Papa’s got a brand new ‘stache.
I knew it. I knew it! I knew you’d come back, sir.
I never stopped steaming your Austrian goat’s milk.
Could use some mushroom.
You brought something.
Some kind of space porcupine.
Porcupine? I am an echidna!
Trained since birth in all forms of lethal combat, destined to restore honor to my tribe, and willing to destroy anything that gets in my way.
Welcome to the team.
That means he trusts you, stone.
Now let’s renovate this dump!
Latte with steamed Austrian goat milk!
Good one. Solid.
Sorry, fellas.
That’s game!
That’s how we do! That’s how we do!
But are they good at math?
Teamwork makes the dream work!
Sorry about that, big Tom.
Are you good?
All good. Fine.
Hey. Thanks for inviting me out to hang with you and your groomsmen.
Good quality bonding.
You know, bro, those guys right there, they’re way more than my groomsmen.
That’s my squad.
Never would’ve made it through life without ’em.
Get over here!
Yeah, I’m coming! I’m coming!
I’ll catch you later.
Hey. Yeah!
Let me know if you’re ready for some power yoga.
You bet.
Come on, Tommy boy. Let’s go.
Let’s go.
Don’t make me.
What am I doing?
Hey, uncle Tommy!
Hey, girls!
How you do.
Are those the wedding rings?
Uh-huh.
May I?
This little ring bearer has been taking her job very seriously.
She’s been practicing all morning.
I can see that.
How very responsible of you.
Except aren’t there supposed to be two wedding rings?
Uh-oh.
Uncle Tommy?
Hang on. What’s going on here?
You’re gonna do great, kiddo.
Bye.
Hey, baby.
Hi.
That’s right! Groom in the building!
Look at those guys.
I wish Sonic had that.
Muscles?
Control yourself.
No. Buddies. Wingmen. A squad.
Sonic doesn’t have anything like that. He’s flying solo.
Baby, you got to relax.
You’re at the four seasons.
Have a Mai Tai. Spend some time with your wife.
That’s what he said. Seriously, his exact words.
See? He’s a smart kid. He’ll find his way.
I absolutely cannot find my way.
We are completely, totally, unequivocally lost.
Sonic, in this weather, there’s no way we’re gonna get any readings on this thing!
Should we go back?
No, no, no.
There’s a light up ahead. Maybe we can take shelter in there.
Perfect.
Are you sure about this? We don’t know who’s inside.
Don’t worry. On earth, people are very welcoming, and love taking complete strangers into their homes.
Run.
Table for two, please!
What would you like to order?
Two beef stews, please.
Where’d you get all these cool gadgets?
I invented ’em.
That’s kinda my thing.
In fact, my inventions are how I discovered you.
Remember that night at the baseball field?
Your energy blast reached all the way to my home planet.
I saw you save your whole village from that crazy mustache guy.
Wait, so you’ve been watching me this whole time?
Even in the shower?
That’s a trick question.
Sonic the hedgehog prefers bubble baths.
Man, you’re good!
When I learned knuckles was on your trail, I knew I couldn’t just sit back and watch anymore.
I had to come warn you.
What? Hang on one sec.
Donut lord is checking in.
“Just chilling. Watching TV.”
Dot, dot, dot.
Dot, dot, dot.
Dot, dot, dot.
Dot, dot, dot.
Dot, dot, dot.
Doctor,
why are we working with this imbecile?
Because that simpleminded space trash is the key to something extraordinary.
Something to help you get revenge on the hedgehog.
Think bigger, stone.
The emerald he seeks could power my wildest designs.
My genius wouldn’t just be recognized on earth.
It would spread virally to every corner of the galaxy, allowing me to harness all the negative forces of the universe and commune with darkness itself.
Wow. That sounds big.
It’s been on my vision board for years. It’s the law of attraction.
Didn’t you see the secret?
Kaplooey!
Kaplooey.
“Another boring night at home.”
The hedgehog has returned home!
Falsa. Which is Latin for “wrong-o.”
According to my worldwide network cell tower triangulation, he’s lying, all the way from the majestic hinterlands of eastern Siberia.
He’s a long-distance liar!
Yeah, there’s more where that came from.
Tiny magic hedgehog destroyed.
Now let’s begin our quest.
Wait.
What about your Minion? The goat milker.
There’s no room on the ship for stone.
I say we ditch him, ghost him, blow him off.
Dishonor!
“Dis” is how I roll.
I’m sorry, but I asked for the beef stew.
Your breath smells like goat poop.
What did you say?
What’s going on?
Maybe they think it’s my birthday?
Don’t worry, I’ll take care of this. Okay, everybody, take it easy.
I’m sure there’s a perfectly good explanation for whatever my friend said or did.
Stand back.
I just farted.
Meow?
Throw these monsters in the fire!
Oh, no, no. Come on, guys. Take it easy. Let’s talk this through.
Let’s talk this through!
Come on, come on. Scanning Siberian customs.
There’s got to be something in here.
Tails, whatever you’re doing, do it fast.
I think I got it!
Pivonka! Pivonka!
Pivonka!
Da.
Pivonka!
Tails, what’s a “pivonka”?
It’s a siberian custom to resolve disputes.
If we win, they let us go. If we lose…
Okay, we have to grab the map and get out of here.
Where’s the map?
Oh, no. I left it on the table! Look!
What?
Oh, my god, it’s a dance fight.
Sonic, what do we do?
We dance and get that map.
Here we go.
Okay, now let’s do. No, we’re gonna go…
Okay.
Okay, this is not going well. Channing Tatum makes it look so easy.
Wait, Sonic. Look!
The map! Come on, let’s grab it!
You want?
Come get.
Freaks!
Freaks!
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!
What’s wrong, tails? Come on. I need you!
I can’t do this, Sonic. I’m not brave like you.
My gadget got us in this mess, and I lost your map, and we’re gonna get tossed into a fire!
New deejay coming in.
Come on, pal. I got an idea.
They called us freaks, so let’s get freaky.
Just follow my moves. You’ll be fine.
All right! Backup dancers!
Here we go!
There’s a lot of me up here!
I love pivonka!
And big dismount!
Yeah!
I’ll take that.
We did it!
That was amazing! Way to go, tails.
Wow. Only Sonic the hedgehog could win a dance battle that epic.
Well, stick with me, pal.
Earth can be a scary place, but I know everything about this old pale blue dot.
Do you really mean that?
I mean, not everything. But I watch a lot of discovery channel and…
I meant about me being your pal.
Of course, buddy.
Comin’ in hot.
Growing up, I didn’t have any friends.
Everyone in my village thought my two tails were weird.
Hey, I know that feeling.
But then I saw you, the fastest creature in the galaxy.
You were weird too. But you were a legend.
That made me think, maybe being weird isn’t so bad.
You inspired me to leave my village, to find you and help you in your mission.
I’m really glad you’re here, tails.
I’m glad I’m here too, Sonic.
Well, might as well get some sleep.
This feels like a good place to spend the night.
You’ll be able to get clear readings on your gizmo thing once the storm is over, so I…
Night, tails.
Tails. Tails. We have a situation.
Today’s forecast calls for clear, sunny skies and a 100% chance of adventure.
I pinpointed the coordinates. It’s right up ahead.
Hey, tails. Wait up.
Okay, we got a giant owl door. Seems encouraging.
Check this out.
Can you translate that?
Yeah.
Ages ago, a fearsome group of warriors, known as the echidnas, forged the seven chaos emeralds into the most unstoppable weapon ever created.
The master emerald.
With it, a single warrior could defeat entire armies.
Believing no one should have such power, an order of heroes recovered the emerald and swore to protect it from evil.
Sounds like the owls and the echidnas have been fighting each other for centuries.
Like vin diesel and the rock.
Wait for me.
Okay, giant owl door, giant owl. Makes sense.
Wait a second. I’ve seen these symbols before.
Here we go.
Well, that did something.
The compass!
This will lead us to the emerald!
Hey, you got a little something on your…
Oh, no. Tails, get back.
Run!
That guy again?
Heads up, my little stalagmites. Someone call an Uber?
Hey, thanks for doing all the hard stuff.
But we’ll take it from here.
Okay, we really gotta talk about your new look.
It’s like professor x meets the monopoly man.
And what kind of genius shows up to Siberia in a convertible?
The kind of genius that can turn up the heat…
With a flick of a switch.
Good one! I’m sure that wasn’t important.
Tails, that’s our exit. Come on.
Let’s split up.
You go high, I go low.
Right.
Quick little stretch and here we go.
So you want to play?
That’s new.
Sonic!
Snowball fight!
It’s too easy. Come on, challenge me!
We are talking style and pizzazz.
Yeah! I make this look good.
Oh, great. The winter soldier.
For a guy named knuckles, you are really bad at punching.
Surrender the compass! You are no match for me.
I’ve been training for this my entire life.
And I had no training at all, yet here I am ahead of you.
That’s gotta be embarrassing.
My rings!
Has anyone ever told you you’ve got serious anger issues?
You mock me with your weak jokes, but you know nothing about me, hedgehog.
Well, I know you echidnas have a habit of showing up uninvited and ruining my life.
Ruining your life? Another bad joke.
I lost everything because of you.
My tribe was on the verge of its greatest victory.
The last of the owl warriors had been located.
Soon longclaw’s emerald secrets would be ours.
But my father stopped me from joining the fight.
He said my moment to honor our tribe would come, but it was not this moment.
Those were the last words he spoke to me.
I never saw him again.
We both lost everything that day.
Goodbye, Sonic.
No!
Longclaw!
Sonic! Are you okay?
Deceiver!
No, it wasn’t a trick.
Tails, take the compass and get out of here!
Yeah!
Later, haters!
Tails!
Tails, come on. Wake up.
He chose helping the fox over pursuing the compass.
Of course he did. New friend, same pathetic weakness.
Oh, no. No, no, no. We’re in real trouble here.
Come on, tails. I need you to fly us out of here.
Time to wake up.
See ya, kids. Enjoy the fresh powder.
Did you…
These rings signify the…
Sorry.
Thought it was on silent.
These rings…
So help me, Thomas!
Okay, sorry, sorry.
Excuse me, this is an emergency.
Sorry.
What? This better be important. I just…
Are you skiing?
Snowboarding, actually. But I need your help now.
Life or death situation this very second.
I need you to use the ring I gave you to save me.
Like right now.
Okay, slow down. I don’t even know where you are.
You just gotta picture where you want the ring to go.
So picture this.
Oh, my god. Okay, okay. Hang on.
What?
Did you throw it?
Oh, god.
What? Tell me what “oh, god.”
I mixed up the rings when I was teasing JoJo.
What? Where is it then? Where is it then?
You don’t want to know.
But I do, Tom.
I very much want to know, before I become a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.
Hang tight, buddy. I got this.
With this ring, Rachel…
Hey! Hi.
Everything okay, bud?
Not really.
What are you doing?
This is gonna sound crazy, but I need to see that ring for just one second, one second.
Have you lost your mind?
I’m gonna give it right back, I promise.
Please, Randall, it’s really important.
No, bro. Go sit down.
Give me the ring, please?
Randall, don’t look at him, look at me.
Randall, Randall.
One second.
Put the ring on my finger.
No, Randall, listen to me.
Randall! Look at me. Ring on my finger.
Give me the ring! Just one second.
Put a ring on it!
Please, love? Okay?
With this ring…
Yes, baby.
I’m so sorry about this.
Snow, my god.
Oh, boy.
Incoming!
Anybody hurt?
Sonic!
Hawaii.
Are you okay?
What’s happening? Are you hurt?
No, no, no, I’m fine.
Okay, good.
Because you’re in so much trouble!
Okay, you calm down.
You talk.
Okay, quick version.
Robotnik is back on earth and he’s after a magic emerald.
We need to get it back or the world is doomed.
Tails!
Wait! All this happened since yesterday?
Wait. Who’s tails?
Tails, can you hear me?
Oh, lord, there are two of them now.
Okay, okay, let me think, let me think. Tails, come on, buddy.
Hey!
Randall, why do all of your friends have weapons?
You really should have taken me up on that brunch, Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.
Olive garden guy?
It’s okay, everyone. We’re federal agents.
You, too, agent. Go ahead.
You mean to tell me that this entire wedding was a setup?
Rachel, wait a minute.
What?
That’s correct, ma’am.
Every single aspect of operation catfish was a complete fabrication.
Operation catfish?
So is everyone here an agent?
Are you an agent?
Son of a…
Was the florist an agent? How about the photographer?
The woman who waxed my…
At the spa?
Is JoJo an agent?
Rachel.
What?
Rachel, listen to me.
I’m done listening! I am done listening!
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.
I really am. I am so sorry.
No. Hey, no!
Let him go! Hey!
Sonic, hang on.
Take it easy. It’s not worth it.
Tom!
Sonic is not a threat. He’s on our side.
He’s an uncontrolled extraterrestrial.
And your days of aiding and abetting him are over.
Secure them in the hotel until the chopper arrives.
You’re making a mistake.
Hold on, major a-hole!
This is still my day, and someone is gonna explain to me what the hell is going on here!
After the events in San Francisco, a global task force was created, devoted to protecting our planet from alien threats.
That day, guardian units of nations was born.
G-u-n. Seriously?
Gun, yeah.
Look, what about protecting our planet from Dr. Robotnik?
Robotnik is dead.
You’re wrong. He’s back.
And you just hauled away the only ones who could stop him.
Sounds like Robotnik might be back in play.
If he is, I want him found immediately.
And cancel my five o’clock at the olive garden.
Aunt Maddie?
Yeah.
Sonic and his friend dropped this.
I have an idea.
And I want to have a word with my fiancé.
And that word is “murder.”
Hey, come on. You can’t just leave us in here.
My friend is hurt! He needs a doctor, a vet, anyone!
Tails, you got to wake up, buddy. Please wake up.
All clear.
All right. Game plan.
I get inside the hotel and find where they’re hiding Tom and Sonic.
Okay. Then I find Randall, right?
And then I squeeze the breath
from his lying, deceitful, perfectly manscaped body!
I’m going through a lot right now.
So let me process this my own way, okay?
Sure, sure.
No judgment.
Should’ve brought a journal.
Okay…
Okay. Is this meant to be a weapon? This is adorable.
Take that, Randall!
Run, Randall!
All right.
We’re about to find out.
All right!
Let’s go kick some Booty.
Rachel! No. Rachel!
In a minute.
Stop right there!
Get the bag.
He’s gonna come back down, right?
I don’t know.
Good luck!
Look. Tom and Sonic have to be inside.
I got a fiancé to vaporize.
Watch your back, sis.
Okay.
Randall!
We got her. Move in.
Okay.
I did not mean to do that!
Something bothering you, agent?
I just feel a little guilty about what I did to Rachel, sir.
Don’t worry about it. We’ll send her a gift card.
Now, I propose a toast.
To a perfectly executed operation.
Sir, we’re under attack.
Randall, wifey’s home!
Oh, my god. Rachel.
What a woman.
You no-good, lowdown, dirty, lying…
Rachel, just listen to me.
What kind of twisted sicko tricks someone into a fake wedding?
Party’s over, bridezilla. Stop right there.
You son of a…
Have it your way.
No!
No!
Very disappointing, agent Handel.
Is that supposed to be a weapon?
I don’t know, but we gonna find out.
Haven’t you caused enough trouble for one day?
I haven’t even begun causing trouble.
Hell hath no fury like a bride scorned.
Looks like it’s real, huh?
No. Right.
Be honest. How bad is it?
Not bad at all. You got tased. You’ll be fine.
I’m so cold.
You landed on our ice sculpture.
Get up.
Just…
Just tell me the truth, for once.
Is there anything about you or about us that was real?
Rachel, look at me.
Before I met you, I didn’t think that I was even capable of real happiness.
But that all changed when you walked into my life.
And I ended up breaking the first rule of undercover work.
Which is?
Never fall in love.
Maddie!
We’re busting out of here.
How’d you get past the guards?
Because that little fox is into some crazy stuff.
Come on.
Let’s go.
You’re amazing.
The owls were fools to think they could hide this.
What’s happening?
Wait for it.
Yes. Eureka!
I’ve found it!
Sonic.
What is that?
A big problem.
The compass led Robotnik to the emerald.
That’s got to be hundreds of miles away.
All right. Huddle up. Let’s figure out a plan.
Together.
There’s no time for that.
I’m the only one that can get there fast enough.
Sonic, this is way too big for you to do by yourself.
You see that little fox over there?
He came all the way across the universe to meet his hero.
And what did his hero do? I practically got him killed.
You know what? You were right.
My moment came and I blew it. I’m no hero.
Wait.
No.
I’m not letting anyone else get hurt because of me.
I’m gonna fix this while I still can.
Sonic!
Sonic, wait!
Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.
Don’t move. Don’t move.
Take it easy, little guy. You’re hurt.
But we have to help him. You don’t know what he’s up against.
You believe us now?
Hey, Bob!
Hey, Maria, how you doing?
Working on my moves.
Just keepin’ it green. No need to burn the fuel.
Speaking of fuel…
Closed?
That doesn’t seem right.
Close.
Yes.
Makeover, makeover. Look at you.
Freeze! Police!
Oh, my god, you got robot hands. You got robot hands.
No, they’re gloves.
Get ’em up. Now spread your fingers!
Now wiggle ’em! Wiggle your digits!
Yes! Like you just finished a big musical number.
Good.
Why is there a light on your head?
‘Cause I’m the sheriff for the weekend, pal.
Water.
Why did it have to be water?
Okay, you can do this.
Gotta go fast.
I don’t want to die like this! It’s derivative!
Make room for daddy!
Two and two.
Great! We’re still bipedals, more or less.
Fire in the hole!
I’ve solved it. There is a booby trap every seven seco…
That was a little early.
So glad it didn’t cut off my mustache.
Hey, little red wrecking ball.
I know you’re dying to get your emerald on, but can we be a little bit more mindful of our surroundings?
May I?
In 30 feet, turn left.
Work smarter, not harder.
My pelvis.
Okay, secret temple, let’s see what you’ve got.
No, no, no! No!
No.
Yes!
You have arrived at your destination.
Wow. That really opened up the space.
I can’t even picture it with an impenetrable wall now.
And the rubble is always a nice touch.
At last. The master emerald.
Ultimate power.
Soon order will be restored.
All because of what we have done together.
Such a lovely sentiment, knuckles.
I think I feel a single tear forming.
Sadly…
You’re as useful to me now as a backstage pass to Limp Bizkit.
Nailed it.
This guy is always trying to spoil a bad thing!
You guys are here, too? Took the long way, huh?
Is everything a joke to you?
Why must you constantly interfere with my destiny?
Because my destiny is to protect my friends and family.
I think I just threw up in my mouth.
And if you want that emerald, you’re gonna have to go through me.
The echidna’s taking no prisoners today!
Sonic has heart, but will he lose the quill to live?
I don’t want to fight you, but you’re not giving me much choice.
Too easy. Let’s do this.
Why don’t you stand still and die with honor?
Let me think about it.
Okay, I thought about it and I pass.
Hi there, beautiful.
You’re the real deal, aren’t you?
Where have you been all my life?
Say goodbye, hedgehog.
Knuckles, stop. Robotnik’s stealing the emerald!
What kind of fool do you take me for?
Just look.
Mine.
Wait! That wasn’t the deal.
You poor, naïve creature.
It’s not your fault.
A more advanced intellect would have seen this move coming a mile away.
Or 1.6 kilometers.
But I trusted you! You were my friend!
I’m sorry. That just hit me funny.
Let this be my final lesson to you, you dim-witted celestial skin tag.
Friends…
Are open, honest and vulnerable with each other.
Which means x squared times the hypotenuse of y squared, divided by the absolute value of friendship, equals…
Dookie!
Oh, no.
Chaos is power!
Let’s get out of here!
Knuckles!
Water again? Come on!
You saved me.
Don’t talk to me. I’m not in the mood.
How dare you attack me in my hour of sorrow!
Why did you save me?
Because you saved me first, which clearly gave you a tactical advantage I do not understand.
It wasn’t a tactic. I couldn’t just let you die.
Why? I’ve been trying to destroy you since the moment we met.
Because being a hero isn’t about taking care of yourself.
It’s about taking responsibility for other people.
Wise words. An ancient earth proverb?
No, sir, that’s a Wachowski family special.
I got it from a guy in a rowboat.
Someone who means a lot to me.
Wait a second. What’s that sound?
Only Sonic the hedgehog needs rescuing this much.
That sly little fox!
Come on, knucklehead. We’re not beat yet.
On the mountain, you told me you’d lost everything.
The way I did.
But you seem so hopeful and free.
How did you move forward despite failing again?
And again. And again. And again. And again.
Okay, I didn’t fail that much. But I didn’t do this all alone.
I found a new family. New friends.
And you can too.
You don’t have to be alone anymore.
Are you kidding me with that handshake?
I’m done playing games, pal.
You’re gonna tell me what I want to know.
And I am asking you for the last time…
What would you like on your bagel?
I’m not telling you anything.
And that is a display bagel.
I don’t get it with you! I mean, I’ve tried everything.
I was good cop. I was bad cop. I was cop who offers you a bagel.
And nothing. It’s like…
That is a display bagel. Wow.
Doctor, you’re here.
Yes, I’m here, and yet I’m…
Not all there.
Sir, are you feeling okay?
I’m more than okay.
I’m upgraded.
Sinister 3.0.
My game is next level.
Hi.
I can smell the electricity in your brain.
You smell like a snack plate.
Yeah, that’s fair. I had a couple today.
Sit down.
In the chair.
I didn’t know.
‘Cause he, ’cause he was in the chair, so I didn’t.
Okay.
Sir? We have a problem.
All teams in position!
Set up a perimeter!
Move! Move! Move!
Incorrectus, my trusty barnacle.
After all these years, what I finally got…
Is a solution.
Commander.
Status report.
Robotnik is in there with stone and a hostage. Possibly local PD.
I’m not saying he’s dumb, but if he is local PD,
this town’s in a lot of trouble.
Wade.
Wade.
Okay.
Rockin’ that new spring collection, I see.
Well, if it isn’t the pastry king.
The donut lord.
A real genius would remember the name of the guy who helped kick your butt off this planet.
And I’ll do it again if you mess with green hills.
Congratulations on your oh-so-temporary sense of superiority.
You’re finished, Robotnik! We’ve taken everything.
Your lab, your drones, your funding!
Let’s see how big of a man you are without your silly little robots.
Would you like to see…
How big a man I can be?
Welcome to the new norm.
My god!
Doctor! Take me with you!
He’s taking everything apart.
He’s building something.
That can only be one thing.
The fearsome power of the emerald.
If that thing really turns thoughts into power, we are in big trouble.
Robotnik has a lot of bad thoughts.
Hey, Sonic, are you sure it was a good idea bringing you-know-who aboard?
Knuckles isn’t really a bad guy. He’s just a little mixed up.
I am not mixed up!
I have steely focus. And I’m complex. And that’s a lot for some people.
Hope you’re not still mad I hit you with that car.
I was completely uninjured.
And my revenge will come when you least expect it, fox.
Sir, you’re magnificent!
Thank you, sycophant.
Your admiration is inevitable.
I knew it!
Just like the stay puft Marshmallow Man.
World domination playlist.
Fall back.
Fall back! Quick! Retreat!
How are we supposed to beat this thing?
We need a plan.
Knuckles, use your strength to…
Jump off the plane. Wow.
Okay, this is what we’re gonna do. Step 1: Light taunting.
Step 2: I have no idea.
Sonic!
Nice action figure, Eggman.
Does it do anything or just stand there looking ugly?
Like a blister, he keeps coming back!
He’s on the okay-to-kill list. Shoot the missiles. Make a decision.
I need a moment, sir. I’m trying to figure out how to do this.
Did you even glance at a manual?
No!
I’ll do it.
Pardon my lightning.
You might want to ground yourself.
I’m gonna pop that thing open like a can of chili…
Hang on!
Yeah!
Close one.
Sonic!
Robotnik!
Deceiver!
Die, mosquito.
I felt that.
What just happened?
It’s the stache masher. Right here in the manual.
Return to sender.
Stone?
Great. Next thing you know, there’ll be a report about a hostile work environment.
Those were our best attacks, and they did nothing!
We can’t beat Robotnik as long as he’s got that emerald.
He’s too powerful.
Look, we aren’t strong enough to beat Robotnik on our own.
But there’s three of us.
Your strength, your smarts and my speed.
Together. That’s how we win.
So we make our stand here on the field of battle.
As a team.
This is it.
This is our moment.
Time to fight.
Bad time to say this, but I don’t actually have a plan.
Tails, any ideas?
We have to find his weak spot.
I suggest the groin.
What? No. No!
Traditionally, yes, the groin is the weakest spot.
Stop saying “groin.”
Hedgehog!
Look out!
I know what his weak spot is. It’s me.
I’m the groin!
Think about it. I live rent-free in this dude’s head.
So if I go out there and rile him up…
He’ll focus on only you, leaving himself open to a flanking maneuver from me and the fox!
Hedgehog, you are a brave and noble warrior.
Go to your certain death with honor.
We’re gonna have to work on your pep talks, pal.
Yeah.
Let’s go.
All right, mustache.
You want me? Come and get me.
You don’t tell me about coming and getting.
I am on the cutting edge of coming and getting!
Coming, getting.
Coming, getting. Coming, getting. Coming, getting.
You’re really heavy.
That’s because I am one million percent muscle.
Faster, fox!
Go! Move, guys! Move back!
Let’s go, that’s it! Go, go, go!
Keep going!
Go! Go!
No, no! Stop!
Stop the truck!
Tom, what happened here?
You thinking what I’m thinking?
Let’s get our kid.
We need your truck!
We need your truck!
Coming, getting.
So what’s the plan here?
You gonna build a big robot house? Get yourself a big robot wife?
I’m going to enslave humanity and force them to service my machines.
First, green hills. Then the universe.
Then the multiverse.
Then who knows? Maybe that’ll be enough.
Full disclosure?
You won’t be there.
Eye lasers? Really?
Snot rocket!
No, no, no! No, no, no!
Giving up already?
Not so tough when you’re fighting someone 700 times your size, are ya?
You can’t beat me!
I’m all-powerful! All-knowing!
All-seeing.
Looks like your fancy robot has a glitch.
Is it me? What about me? I’m over here.
Up top! Down below! Behind you!
I’m over here. Sorry! Over here.
Too slow!
You can’t outsmart me.
Missed me again.
I’m the outsmarter-er!
I didn’t outsmart you. I’m just the distraction.
Robotnik!
I am also a hologram.
Disloyal.
“Dis” is how I roll.
Where’s my emerald?
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!
Computer, auxiliary power.
The emerald. It’s right there.
Move, you hunk of junk!
I have to reach it.
Come on, come on, come on.
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!
No!
We got you, Sonic.
Hold on!
You guys okay?
Yeah.
Okay.
I got the emerald. We could still defeat him.
Come on, come on. How does this thing work? What do I do?
What?
No. No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no!
Look at the happy little family.
You have to get away from me. I’m the one he wants.
Hey.
We’re not going anywhere.
We’re family.
And families stick together…
No matter what.
I love you guys.
We love you too, Sonic.
No!
I got him!
I finally got him!
What was that?
It’s over, Eggman.
I like the new look. It works for you.
What do you say we just let bygones be bygones?
I did some things, you did some things. There are good people on both sides.
Surely two intelligent beings can work these things out!
Come on, buddy. Come on.
Get him, Sonic!
Yeah. Come on.
It’s like that?
Okay, we’re not friends.
Later, hater!
Sonic!
Buddy!
Wait! You cannot touch him!
The hedgehog holds the power of the emerald.
I am sorry. He is no longer the Sonic you once knew.
What?
You got to try this.
Okay. He is exactly the Sonic you once knew.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Sonic!
Bring it in, bud.
It’s good to be back in blue.
The golden god thing was fun, but blue has always been more my color.
Looks good on you.
Sonic, you were the most powerful hero in the universe, and you let it go.
Why?
Because I still have some growing up to do.
And I kind of like being a kid.
And you’re not just any kid.
You’re our kid.
That’s right.
Bring it in!
Yay. Hugs.
It’s a good thing we didn’t do this before. You would’ve blown up.
You fixed it.
I’ve spent my whole life questing for this.
Now I have it.
Now we have it.
What do we do with it? What next?
There were once two orders of heroes who protected the galaxy from those who would use the emerald for evil.
But they have all passed on to the great battleground in the sky.
So we start a new order. The three of us.
This is no light task.
We must make a vow to use our powers to keep the universe safe, to watch out for each other.
Our new tribe.
I know!
A power bump!
Good idea.
It’s an earth custom. An unbreakable promise.
Very well.
A power bump it is.
Power bump!
It’s truly a beautiful day for baseball here in green hills.
An exciting lineup today with the debut appearance of two new players!
On the mound, rookie sensation from across the galaxy, miles “tails” prower, facing off against the powerhouse, knuckles the echidna.
I don’t understand.
Why am I angry at the enemy ball?
You’re not angry.
You just want to hit it as hard as you can and then run around the bases.
But if my quest ends where I am standing, why run at all?
I can’t with this guy. Why do I even try?
This is just a game. We’re out here having fun.
Just having some fun.
Fun.
All right! Give him the heat, tails!
Hope you’re ready for my fastball.
Your fastball will be dishonored.
And so will you, fox.
Easy, guys!
Don’t think about it too much.
Just keep your elbow up, eye on the ball and give it a ride.
A ride? To where?
Power bump!
Victory is mine!
Hey, no fair! That shouldn’t count.
First base is also mine!
I think that was our only ball.
I have conquered the second of the bases!
Who wants ice cream?
Knocked the cover off that.
Ice cream!
Ice cream, yeah!
I am having the fun! What is ice cream?
It’s a dessert. If you like fun, you’re gonna love it.
Yum. Dessert. Does it have grapes in it?
No, not usually.
I’m proud of our little guy.
I really like his new friends, especially the red one.
He cracks me up.
Heck of a swing too.
Come on, fox. Our dessert adventure awaits.
Good job, guys.
Yeah.
You too, baby. Let’s go get some ice cream. Come on, come on.
I’m happy for you, pal.
Got your wingmen. Perfect friends to grow up with.
Come on, knuckles.
My victory chariot!
I’ve got a lot more than that… Dad.
Race you to the truck.
One, two, three, go!
No, don’t go easy on me. I want your best.
Sonic, I have just been told they have sprinkles.
Ice cream and sprinkles? This is your new destiny.
What a perfect meal to celebrate my victory over you in base of ball.
What?
I mean, you barely beat me.
You’ve never been beaten so hard.
Can’t forget this.
Agent, I want an update.
Still searching, sir. We haven’t found any sign of Robotnik.
No one could’ve survived that crash.
He’s toast. Good riddance.
What a mess that lunatic made.
Sir, there’s something else.
When we were wiping Robotnik off our database, we found something.
A file buried deep in our system and dating back over 50 years.
What was it?
Coordinates, sir.
Coordinates? To what?
A secret research facility.
It was a black site, sir.
Someone worked very hard to keep this hidden.
My god.
Project shadow.

The quiet hum of CITY TRAFFIC and DISTANT SIRENS.  
Gradually, we make out something unnerving, right beside  us: SOMEONE BREATHING ... A MASSIVE RED TITLE FADES UP:  
"T H E B A T M A N"  
HOLD; then SMASH OUT OF THE BLACKNESS TO REVEAL  
AN OUT OF FOCUS BINOCULAR POV - DUSK

We FOCUS, SEARCHING THE FACADE OF AN OPULENT TOWNHOUSE ...  The BREATHING SUDDENLY QUIETS as a SHAPE APPEARS IN A  WINDOW -- a LITTLE RED NINJA gazes out, clutching a small  sword. The ninja spins, brandishing the sword as TWO  SHAPES enter behind him -- a WOMAN, late 30s, dressed as  a WITCH -- and a MAN, late 50s, in a WELL-CUT SUIT.  
The little ninja rushes in, "stabbing" the Man, who  
collapses melodramatically. The Woman smiles -- speaks to  the ninja, and he grabs a PUMPKIN CANDY BUCKET as they  start to exit. The Man sits up, yells after them; the  ninja runs back for a hug. Finally, the ninja and Woman  exit, LEAVING THE MAN ALONE. He grows SOBER. As the Man  pulls himself up, the BREATHING BESIDE US RESUMES ...  
INT. OPULENT TOWNHOUSE - DIMLY-LIGHTED STUDY - NIGHT  3

In the light of the flickering TV, we see now the Man is  handsome, distinguished. He stands, sipping scotch,  
watching THE NEWS; a CHYRON reads, "GOTHAM MAYORAL RACE":  
FEMALE NEWSCASTER (ON TV)  
Just-released polls have incumbent  
mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr. and  
twenty-eight year old grassroots  
challenger, Bella Real in a dead  
heat. Things certainly got hot  
last night in their final debate  
before next Tuesday's election ...  
As the Man anxiously watches the DEBATE CLIP, we realize:  he is MAYOR MITCHELL; his female challenger, BELLA REAL,  young, intelligent, a force of nature, shares the stage -- 
MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV)  
Now my young opponent here wants  
to gut the Gotham Renewal Program  
established by the great Thomas  
Wayne, cutting the funds for vital  
projects like our sea wall, and  
the safety net for those in need-- 
(CONTINUED)

BELLA REAL (ON TV)  
-- the Renewal Program is broken!  
The city's been "renewing" for  
twenty years, look where it's  
gotten us! Crime has skyrocketed!  
MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV)  
Now wait a minute hold BELLA REAL (ON TV)  Murder and drug use are at  
.Q!!.  
historic highs! We have a  
masked vigilante running  
the streets!  
MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV)  
-- under my administration the  
Gotham PD dealt major blows  
against organized crime and drug  
trafficking! The Salvatore Maroni  
case was the biggest drug bust in  
city history  
BELLA REAL ( ON TV)  but drops and other  drugs are still rampant!  It's gotten worse!  
MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV)  I'm not saying there isn't  work to do -- but listen -­ I have a beautiful wife and  young son, ok? I will not  rest until this city is  safe for them -- and all  our citizens!  
Mitchell turns, startled, as a PHONE RINGS. As he EXITS  FRAME to answer, we STAY on a DARK HALL BEHIND THE STUDY  -- on the wall by the door way, we see a framed headline:  "MARONI DRUG BUST! MAYOR'S STING OPERATION HISTORIC".    
As the TV brightens, we SEE for the first time, SOMEONE IS IN THE HALL. Barely visible, the Figure wears a DARK,  OLIVE GREEN HOOD -- a homemade executioner's mask, with  PRESCRIPTION AVIATOR GLASSES bizarrely outside the hood.  
MAYOR MITCHELL (O.S.)  
Hey. Yeah, I'm watching GCl ...  
As Mitchell PACES IN AND OUT OF FRAME, the Figure's  hooded head ominously tracks him ...  
MAYOR MITCHELL (O.S.)  
Why is she still tied -- I thought  
we were getting a bump in the new  
Post poll ... ? Ok, you know what? I  
can't, I can't watch this anymore  
-- call me in the morning -- 
We HEAR the phone hang up, and Mitchell RE-ENTERS FRAME,  agitated; as he SHUTS OFF THE TV, the HALL BEHIND HIM  SUDDENLY GOES DARK, the FIGURE NO LONGER IN SIGHT.

A GLEAMING METAL TOOL. Whatever it is, it's WET with blood. The Figure turns,  PANTING, rises off the m otionless victim, trudges over to  us ... A GLOVED HAND retrieves the strange weapon.  
The Figure walks back, regarding the victim for a long,  creepy m oment ... then stretches its arms as far as they  will go, LOUDLY UNSPOOLING a LONG PIECE OF SILVER DUCT  TAPE ... And with a LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER, we SLAM INTO --

THE PENGUIN  
No, no -- it's ok, baby -- Mr. 
Vengeance here don't bite ...  
She hesitates, eyes on Batman; then saunters to Penguin,  sets down a drink tray; as Penguin touches her thigh, she  slyly brushes his hand away with a smile -- says low

Touch me again, Oz, I'll break  
those stubby little fingers, ok?

UNSEEN PRISONER'S VOICE  
Ok ... Ok ... I'll ... I'll tell you  
what I really think ...  
As the CAMERA STOPS, SUPER-TIGHT on the wired glass, the  BLURRED PRISONER finally lifts his head ... As he presses  HIS LIPS close to the window -- THEY COME INTO FOCUS -­ HIS MOUTH IS DISEASED, HORRIBLY DISTORTED INTO A RICTUS  GRIN -- THE PRISONER IS THE JOKER -- 
Batman faces the door, waiting for it to unlock -- as the  Joker continues, quiet, sadistic pleasure in his voice -- 
THE JOKER  
1 think you don't really care  
about his motives, whether he  
loves you or hates you ... I  
think ... somewhere deep down ...  
you're just ... terrified. Because  
you're not sure he's wrong ...

THE JOKER  
You think they deserved it. Don't

P.A. ANNOUNCER  
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you  
all for coming to today's memorial  
for our beloved mayor, Don  
Mitchell, Jr. Our program will  
begin shortly. As a reminder, the  
family asks that those wishing to  
honor the mayor's memory consider  
a donation to the cause most dear  
to his heart, the Gotham Renewal  
Fund, our city's safety net.

What good's a safety net doesn't  
catch anybody ... ?

Bruce turns -- to see A BITTER NOBODY in a hooded work  jacket, angry eyes on the VIPS as they file past -- 
BITTER NOBODY  
Didn't help !!!Y daughter when she  
needed it -- I can tell you that.  
Guy was just another rich  
scumsucker. He got what he  
deserved.  
Finally, his eyes shift to Bruce, a truly chilling look -- 
BITTER NOBODY  
Yeah, I said it ...  
Bruce studies his acne-scarred face -- nodding -- when -- the man's expression changes trying to place Bruce  
... hey ... don't I know you? A WOMAN'S VOICE  
BITTER NOBODY  
Bruce Wayne -- 
Startled, Bruce spins to see BELLA REAL coming at him -­ 
BELLA REAL  
Why haven't you called me back?  
BRUCE  
... I'm sorry -- ?  
BELLA REAL  
(no-nonsense)  
I'm Bella Real -- I'm running for  
mayor -- I wouldn't be bothering  
you here, but your people keep  
telling me you're "unavailable".  
Will you walk with me?

On the spot, Bruce glances back at the man -- who now  glowers -- Bella tucks her arm under Bruce's -- stealing  him -- he sneaks a look at the BITTER NOBODY who glares  as they recede -- then turns, disappearing in the crowd -- 
She leads Bruce to THE SEATED AREA, quiets, still blunt:  
BELLA REAL  
You know you really could be doing  
more for the city -- your family  
has a history of philanthropy, but  
as far as I can tell, you're not  
doing anything -- if I'm elected,  
I wanna change that -- 
She smiles disarmingly as they near the front -- a BOY'S  CHOIR on the central steps begins SHUBERT'S "AVE MARIA" -- 
BELLA REAL  
Will you wait for me? I wanna go  
pay my respects -- my God, what a  
mess -- his poor wife and son ...  
And she leaves him; struck by her nerve and charisma,  Bruce watches her lean into the row to greet the widow  when the Mayor's Ten-Year-Old Son glances awkwardly back  making brief eye-contact -- a sad moment -- when -- 
HUSHED, FAMILIAR VOICE (O.S.)  
'Scuse me, C hief? Can I talk to  
you ... ?  
Bruce turns to spy GORDON with OFFICERS, a few rows back  -- Gordon touches the arm of the seated CHIEF OF POLICE -- 
GORDON  
Gil Colson is missing ...

CHIEF BOCK  GORDON  
He hasn't been heard from since  
last night --

GORDON AND TEN COPS SURROUNDING THE SUV -- GUNS RAISED -­ THE SUV IS COVERED IN A SCRAWLED CROSSWORD PUZZLE PATTERN  -- THE ENDLESSLY REPEATING MESSAGE: "D.A. -- D.O.A.?"  
BRUCE edges closer past FLEEING MOURNERS -- WHEN -- THE  DENTED DRIVER DOOR SUDDENLY CRACKS OPEN -- THE HALL RINGS  WITH THE CLAMOR OF DOZENS OF BULLETS CHAMBERED AT ONCE -- 
GORDON  
GET OUTTA THE CAR! HANDS UP!  
Bruce watches the driver door slowly open all the way ...  A FIGURE staggers out, hands raised, terrified -- 
GORDON  
Holy Christ ... it's Colson.  
The D.A. has a bloody face, tape over his mouth with the  words "NO MORE LIES" the CLAMP STILL AROUND HIS NECK -- LIGHTS RAPIDLY FLASH ON IT -- a cop notices, horrified --

THOMAS WAYNE  
I believe in Gotham. I believe in  
its promise. But too many have  
been left behind for too long. And  
that's why I'm here today to  
announce, not only my candidacy  
for mayor, but also the creation  
of the Gotham Renewal Fund. Win or  
lose, the Wayne Foundation pledges  
a one billion dollar donation to  
start a charitable endowment for  
public works. I want to bypass  
political gridlock to get money to  
people and projects who need it  
llilli -- like these children behind  
me. Renewal is about growth. It's  
about planting seeds. And renewing  
Gotham's promise.

Look at it. It's
gobbling up all my fruit.


It's one of mine.


Last few disciples, you've lost
everything, my Lord. The land is dry.






Life is lost without faith in you never
wavered, and now we await the promise.


They told me it was.


This is why you celebrate.


He thinks there's an eternal reward.


No, no, sorry. There's no
eternal reward for you, dog.


What was celebrated as a fresh kill?


Which is vanquished. The holder of the Necro sword before he could harm any
other guards will get curse and trends. Jews threatened to wind my entire empire.


My Lord.


Your empire is over at the end.


It'll be more followers to
replace you. They're always over.


We have suffered.


And we have started.


Right.


And well, you should suffer if
your God is your only purpose.






There's nothing for you
after death except death.


Got it.


I will answer you.


Now your meaningless life
finally does have a purpose.


Sacrifice yourself to me.


Kill the golden goose.


Juice.


Salmon.


Delete.


So choosy.


You are no good.


Doesn't feel like it 'cause.


Sounds like a promise.


So this is my vow.


Gosh, one tie.


Yeah.


Come, gather round and listen to the legend of the
Space biking, AKA the God of Thunder, AKA 4 odors.


Raised in the way of the world, soul was taught to help win
Benz fighting the good fight for those who can't find him.


The group and he grew and he grew. He was sensitive
like a smile and his loving nature did not discriminate.


He once loved us, swashbuckling, passionista
another time. He loved a woman on a woman, wolf.


It shows one true love was an Earth woman
named Jane Fonda. Wigner Jane Foster.


But sadly,
in the battle for love for last.


In fact, he lost a lot of people
in those days. His mum is dead.


That guy, that guy, whoever
that is it hot dog and his brother.


And his brother again and again.


Also had to watch his planet
explode, Daily said. Whatever though.


It seemed that everything and everyone he loved, he lost and so he
his heart behind a big fleshy body, so it could never be broken again.


But just because he was done loving didn't mean he was done fighting. He teamed up with the Guardians of the Galaxy and set off
on some classic Thor adventures he got in shape, putting in the hard yards, turning pains into games and never skipping leg day.


He went from dead body to God, one beneath his God,
but there was still a sad but just trying to get out.


Because all of the boards that Thor had worn over the years
couldn't hide the pain that he was feeling on the inside.


So he gave up the search for love.


Accepting that he was
only good for one thing.


Waiting in quiet contemplation
for someone to say.


So we need your
help to win this battle.


Gore.


We need your help to
win this battle. Let's go.


Come on.


Sorry. OK.


People die.


You're gonna break.


I am good.


Well, well, look who it is.
How we doing, guys? Horrible.


You said this planet would be relaxing holiday, I
said it was going to be like a relaxing holiday.


Skip through Sunday.


God of Thunder.


Ping your card. You have finally joined
out. Well, they say better late than normal.


It's very nice. As you know, we used to live in a peaceful asks. Now gods will put it in. Now I'm
sacred. Temple has been left unguarded and hoping to control it. Stop. It is our most sacred shrine in.


Not for long.


Bring your card.


Tell them what happened here today,
China thought.


Ragtag, Mötley Crüe, misfit Desperados found time that bobble heads down names
in history. The Olds maybe update stuff, but I'll tell you this for free.


And.


Go to settings.


Well done, everybody collectively take
credit for doctors. We worked as a team.


Use our hearts and our minds to
treat the enemy with minimal loss.


Or a classic Ford mentor.


Book, yeah.


Read it.


Your your doctor, Jane Foster and.


Hi. Hi.


And the answer is.


Yeah,
it's you ever see an event horizon?


No.


Interstellar know that maybe explains everything really clearly.
Alright, the Einstein Rosen Bridge need space so that employees be.


Coexist in space.


Just really understand why.


Watch his movies.


OK.


Jesus.


So how's that going?
It's going amazing.


View.


Anyone else besides me?


When people find out, they
started acting weird. They're just.


Different.


Anyway.


Stage four. I have
like how many stages?


For that we know about.


Somewhere else, you gotta be right
now. It's more important than chemo.


No.


You're trying to get
back to the letter.


The hand through ideas
I'm trying. OK time out.


I know you think you have work is something you have to
do, otherwise you're letting down all civilization but.


You're not getting with the universe is actually
trying to tell you. So let me translate.


Down.


Beautified this thing.


Client.


That's why I my way it does
not have to be full alone in a lab.


Baby, it's time to play the space Viking hard with smaller card. Yes, it is. There's no
power. There's a bar. It's all. It's blonde and it's gorgeous. It is a handsome card.


See.


I will figure this out.


Results start coming back the same.


Chemo.


So sorry.


Or if you just want to call me.


Small. Likely because
you're working.


Look at this place.


Beautiful photo.


Home from here to take. Yes, planets
as God as God is not a planet.


It is. It is you and now it is time
for me to pass on to the spirit realm.


I will take my place.


In the great banqueting Hall of Valhalla,
the resting place of the gods, 01 more thing.


You have a sister.


And so now I turn into Godly
Stardust and say farewell hook.


I see.


Have disappeared.


So.


Brother.


An ominous portal
has appeared behind.


No, I returned.


Just take my claim is the
rightful heir to the throne.


Stopping.


Join your ribs.


Yeah.

John.


You can almost feel the power of these magnificent and immovable stones. OK, let's
head back to the village where we can drink some real Asgardian. Me. Come on.


God of the sun.


We thank you. Appreciate your help. War forever. Without the
protection of our goals. But you know, peace shall reign.


In return for your service,
please accept these gifts.


This tradition, protectors of
our world still with breaking news.


They are wonderful.


Junior card. Thank you so much. Listen, number

the ship. This is Glenda. We're married.


Relationships that I shouldn't be doing that. Yeah, you can't
get married on every single plan that we land on. I am group.


Finally.


Distress calls.


God butcher.


All of these gods
murdered champions.


Waste the horror.


Who could have done
something like this?


Go back.


Play that one.


So where are you? We need you.


My friend is in danger. We must go.


My friends, maybe we should split up so many people
to save. I mean, look at all of his distress.


You'll be OK.


Commitment to each other. Beautiful thing

But this should be feeling
is better than feeling empty.


My hope for you is that one
day you will find something.


To make you feel this.


I have loved.


It didn't work out. Another diagonal, deathly dumpy with a handwritten letter.
I don't know which is worse, but it's my actually everyone at arms length.


Touchdown. I knew this would
happen. You must go. I'll find safe.


You answered the other calls. The Galaxy needs
its guardians. Cool. Yeah. We were just leaving.


I know it hurts.


This way you have to trust me.


Why don't you take this ship it as a parting farewell
gift. You're giving me my shift? Yes, she's yours.


Then you make as many memories with others. I have just temperamental blast will
serve you well. It's hypothetical. Starship. Thank you. Goodbye, old friend.

into Valhalla, you have to die in the battle.


You survived.


Sure.

What happened is.


I've been hunting a little bit. I followed

Let me tell you the
legend of Thor and Jane.


He was a God of Thunder
and she a woman of science.


And although they were
very different worlds.


Somehow it just made sense.


Together they embark on journey.


Open.


Four to change the
way of the warrior.


And trying to throw
away of the people.


It is time passed their love
and deeper and deeper.


Drivers should be on there.


I need you to promise
me love always protects.


I love you too, buddy.


Love that deep is a way
of becoming magical.


Store cities trends towards
the future and all that might hold.


Ponder life with Jane. The
more he feared losing their life.


And although Jane didn't want to admit
it, she was scared of loss as well.


And so they build walls between
them. Forgot busy saving humanity.


Jane got busy doing the same.


Real busy.


And eventually the space between them grew
and grew until it became two white to be.


Something had to give.


I have to go through this data.


Clean all this up.


Play.


Then one night it didn't give.


Jane wrote a note.


And so with that note.


And the legend suddenly became the.


Or so they thought.


Yoga.

1 EXT. CARRIER DECK - DAWN 1 
FIGHTER JETS roll on the silhouetted deck as FLIGHT CREWS  work their technical ballet. Men and women devoted to detail  and duty, preparing their warriors for the arena. All the  while, MUSIC builds over OPENING TITLES as jets LAUNCH into  the sky, afterburners blazing, roaring like thunder... 
A3 EXT. CARRIER ELEVATOR - DAWN A3 
AN F-18 silhouetted against the morning sky, rising to the  main deck. A HELMET edges into frame, bearing red white and  blue stripes along with the name: MAVERICK. 
BOOM UP TO REVEAL the man holding the helmet, his back to us,  his head turned slightly. Something troubles him. Deeply.  
MAVERICK  
Talk to me, Goose... 
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.) 
Captain Mitchell. 
And as the pilot turns we MATCH CUT TO: 
A12 INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY A12 
PETE “MAVERICK” MITCHELL opens his eyes from a deep sleep. He  sits up, takes a deep breath, taking in the humble trailer he  calls home. For those of us who know Maverick from long ago,  we’re left to wonder how he ended up here. 
He stands, moves to the kitchenette to start the coffee  machine and, along with, his day. 
12 INT. HANGAR HOME - DUSK 12 
CLOSE ON the door of Mav’s trailer as he exits, holding a  plate with his breakfast and a cup of joe. Pull back with him  TO REVEAL: 
The Airstream occupies a space one could only describe as the  ultimate bachelor pad - motorcycles, a vintage car, a  workbench covered with memories of a life dedicated to flight  and, the centerpiece: A World War Two-era P-51 MUSTANG. 
If we suspected for a moment that Maverick had ended up on  his ass, we were sorely mistaken. 
TIME CUT: As Maverick eats his breakfast at a small table  across from an empty chair. 
(CONTINUED)
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 2.
12 CONTINUED: 12 
Maverick finishes his breakfast, stands, pats the P-51 with  affection as he passes her on his way to the workbench.  
REVEAL: CLOSE SHOTS of Mav’s surroundings (as he dresses in  b.g.): TROPHIES and AIRSPEED RECORDS, PHOTOS of a younger  Maverick, with ICEMAN, at Ice’s wedding, with GOOSE, CAROLE  and their young son BRADLEY. Mav with that same boy as a  TEEN. 
He opens a cabinet lined with jackets. He pulls one out,  wrapped in plastic, saved for special occasions, it seems. He  rips the plastic off revealing patch laden leather that’s  been around a long, long time. 
Mav passes a calendar, the date marked in red: 
MACH 9 TODAY 
He walks past a COLLECTION OF MOTORCYCLES, a beaten up old  Pepsi machine, stops at one bike under a tarp. Revealing a  familiar ‘86 KAWASAKI NINJA. 
CLOSE ON: Aviators and a set of keys by a helmet.  
He takes the keys and sunglasses, leaves the helmet... 
13 EXT. HANGAR - DESERT ROAD 13 
VROOOM. Maverick screams away from the hangar, spiraling  dust, taking his machine to the limit. 
14 EXT. CHINA LAKE TEST FACILITY - CALIFORNIA - DUSK 14 
A maximum security military facility. At a gatehouse  checkpoint, two ARMED UNIFORMS see him coming, open the gate,  wave him through without stopping. They watch him go. 
15 INT. TEST HANGAR - DUSK 15 
A prototype high-hypersonic jet, THE DARKSTAR, dominates the  hangar. It is unlike any machine we’ve ever seen before -  itching to scream across the heavens. All it needs is a  pilot. Mav strides in, ready to ride it. He stops, sees: 
Several ENGINEERS (JACK, SIMON & MATTHEW) and TECHS,  strangely motionless. Something is amiss. All sense of  momentum stops. An amiable, salty Warrant Officer, BERNIE  “HONDO” COLEMAN (35), grimaces. 
MAVERICK 
Hey. What is it? 
(CONTINUED) 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 3.

MATTHEW (SENIOR) 
It’s over Mav. Three years of our  
lives, down the drain. 
HONDO 
We’ve been ordered to stand down.  
They’re scrapping her. 
Says who? 
MAVERICK 
Hondo looks to SIMON, the meek engineer who balks. 
HONDO 
Well go on. 
JACK (JADED) 
(to Maverick) 
His girlfriend works at the  
Pentagon 
SIMON (MEEK) 
She swore me to secrecy 
JACK (JADED) 
Just tell us. 
HONDO 
They say we fell short. The  
contract threshold is Mach Ten. 
MAVERICK 
Mach ten. That’s Mach ten two  
months from now. Today’s test point  
is Mach Nine. 
HONDO 
Well, that’s not good enough for  
someone at the Pentagon. 
Maverick focuses on Simon. 
Who? 
MAVERICK 
JACK (JADED) 
Just say who it is. 
HONDO 
Spit it out Simon. 
Go.

SIMON (MEEK) 
Admiral Cain. 
MATTHEW (SENIOR) 
So it really is over. 
HONDO 
Of course. The Drone Ranger. He  
wants our budget for his unmanned  
program... 
MAVERICK 
Well he’s not gonna get it. Not  
today. 
SIMON (MEEK) 
Mav, Cain’s coming down now. He’s  
on his way to shut us down  
personally. 
MAVERICK 
He’s not here yet. 
(re: plane) 
They want Mach ten, let’s give it  
to them. Get her ready to run up at  
eighteen-thirty. 
SIMON (MEEK) 
The test wasn’t ‘til nineteen  
hundred. 
MAVERICK 
Well, that was before the weather  
changed. 
The team looks out at the perfectly calm, clear sky. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
Gotta get out early if we want to  
beat this storm.  
HONDO 
That’s... blue sky up there, Mav. 
MAVERICK 
Yeah, but dark blue. Ominous.  
JACK (JADED) 
(catching on) 
Ah. Yeah. Downright menacing. 
Scary.

Matthew gives Simon a shoulder tap. 
SIMON (MEEK) (CONT’D) 
Oh... OOOOOH. 
16 INT. SUIT-UP ROOM - TEST FACILITY - DUSK 16 State of the art. Maverick runs a treadmill. He wears a HIGH TECH OXYGEN MASK and heart monitor. Deep, steady breathing.  
HONDO 
Don’t do this, Mav. 
(Mav keeps running) 
Mav, for God’s sake, you don’t need  
to do this. She hasn’t passed mach  
eight point five. She’s months away  
from ten. There’s no way this ends  
well. 
But he doesn’t. He just keeps running. 
A17 TIME CUT: Mav finishes dressing in a pressure suit. A17 
HONDO (CONT’D) 
Hey, you know, Mike called. He’s  
out in Reno with all those  
billionaires racing their P-51s.  
He’s making money hand over fist  
fixing warbirds, test flying ‘em,  
too. He needs guys who know their  
stuff. We’d be rolling in it. 
But Maverick isn’t listening.  
AA17 INT. LONG CORRIDOR - DAY AA17 
DOZENS OF DARKSTAR TEAM MEMBERS - a mix of MEN and WOMEN -  CIVILIANS and MILITARY alike, mill about in a long corridor,  talking quietly, waiting. 
A door opens OS and everyone falls silent. All eyes focus on: 
MAVERICK, clad in his space suit, carrying his oxygen. We  follow him from behind, watching as the team parts to let him  pass. Hondo falls in step with him. 
We move with them in profile.

CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 6.
AA17 CONTINUED: AA17 
HONDO 
Now remember. Contact threshold is  
Mach ten. Not point-one, not point two. Mach Ten. That should keep the  
program alive. 
(off Mav’s nod) 
I don’t like that look, Mav. 
MAVERICK 
Only one I got. 
And off Hondo’s sigh we CUT TO: 
B17 EXT. TEST HANGAR - NIGHT B17 The Darkstar is rolled from the hangar into tarmac position.  
17 EXT. DARKSTAR HANGAR - NIGHT 17 
CLOSE ON: Mav’s gloved hand stroking the nose of the  aircraft. 
WITH A TECH carrying his O2 unit, Mav does a walk-around  inspection of the prototype jet. The engineers look on.  
18 INT. DARKSTAR COCKPIT - NIGHT 18 
Maverick STRAPS IN the pilot’s chair. TECHS attach cables and  hoses, secure Mav to his seat, give his harness a big yank.  He fist bumps both of them before they step down. Hondo  remains. 
HONDO 
Now remember. Contact threshold is  
Mach ten. Not point-one, not point two. Mach Ten. That should keep the  
program alive. 
(off Mav’s nod) 
I don’t like that look, Mav. 
MAVERICK 
Only one I got. 
19 The canopy LOWERS, drowning him out. Mav gives a thumbs-up. 19 Hondo glares. Gives a reluctant thumbs-up back and hops down. 
Maverick takes a deep breath, a moment of apprehension as it  sinks in what he’s about to do. 
Okay.

The guard glances at the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE in the back seat  and waves the sedan through. Just then, a distant rumbling  catches their attention, growing louder, shaking the  foundations of the guardhouse.  
REAR ADMIRAL CHESTER “HAMMER” CAIN, a cold-eyed 2-Star  Admiral emerges from the back of his sedan as: 
DARKSTAR SUDDENLY RIPS OVERHEAD WITH A DEAFENING ROAR. Cain’s  driver recoils, hit by a gale force DUST BLAST.  
Cain himself just closes his steely eyes. 
24 INT. DARKSTAR - NIGHT 24 The ground swiftly recedes behind Mav as he heads skyward... 
25 INT. MISSION CONTROL - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT 25 
Hondo and the crew of Engineers and Techs sit with headsets,  watching satellite feeds, cockpit cameras, telemetry, etc.

Uh Mav, I have Admiral Cain here...  
Uh, how’s that storm-front?

Darkstar ROCKETS into the upper atmosphere, where rapidly  thinning air gives way to the blackness of space.

SIMON (MEEK)

MATTHEW (SENIOR) 
Mach eight point eight. Eight nine... Mach nine. 
They share looks of concern. Everyone is sweating. They are  into the unknown now... Hondo looks at the flight data  monitor, a steady flow now. 
HONDO 
He’s the fastest man alive. 
CAIN 
This changes nothing. You know why  
I’m here.

MAVERICK 
Just a little push. 
And he gently nudges the stick. 
HONDO (OVER RADIO) 
Great work, Mav. Bring it on home. 
Mav stows his final test card, looks to the now-blank board.  He shuts eyes, trusts his feel, and whispers:  
MAVERICK 
Talk to me, Goose... 
And he gently nudges the stick.

36 INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT 36 
Scramjet engine SCREAMING like a banshee, PLASMA ripping off  the nose, casting a purple glow over the cockpit. The speed  gauge keeps rolling and reaches Mach 10. Mav grits his teeth.

The team CHEERS. Hondo notes the data recorder exploding with  new data. A gusher. Cain realizes what this means. The geeky  engineer pumps a fist: 
SIMON (MEEK) 
Put THAT in your Pentagon budget.

Uh... Sir. 
But Hondo stares at his monitor. He knows his friend well. 
HONDO (TO SELF) 
Arright. You made your point, Mav.  
Now bring it home. 
38 INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT 38 The speed gauge needle trembles ever so higher... 
MAVERICK 
That’s it, just a little. 10.1. 
10.1... 10.2... 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
You see? I knew you could do it. 
But now Darkstar JOLTS VIOLENTLY. WARNING LIGHTS pepper the  console, ALARMS buzzing in his ear. He swallows hard: 
BOOM. Maverick is slammed against the canopy. 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 19.
39 INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT 39 All screens go DARK. The stream of flight data vanishes. 
MAVERICK? 
HONDO (INTO RADIO)

44 EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAWN 44 A country highway. Some trucks blow past; a tumbleweed rolls. 
A46 INT. TRUCK STOP - DAWN A46 
A bell jingles. One by one, PATRONS take in a sight at the  door in awe. REVEAL: 
Maverick, dazed, parched, helmet in one hand, stick in the  other. Patrons stare. A WAITRESS at the counter pours water  for a dumbstruck CUSTOMER and his YOUNG SON eating ice cream. 
MAVERICK 
Excuse me, miss? 
Maverick motions towards the ice water she just poured. She  hands it to him. He drinks it. All of it. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
Where am I? 
Earth. 
KID WITH ICE CREAM 
NOISE O.S. Helicopters. The sound of his fate. 
46 EXT. TEST HANGAR - DAY 46 
A Navy “Rescue Hawk” HH-60 helicopter lands. Maverick is  escorted into the waiting embrace of TWO MPs.  
Maverick glances back at the heli as it flies away. He sighs,  walks away with the MPs to face the music. 
B47 INT. LONG CORRIDOR - DAY B47 Mav enters, followed by the MPs. He stops. REVEAL:

CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 20.
B47 CONTINUED: B47 
Hondo and the same Darkstar team members Maverick left behind  are here to greet him. The emotions are mixed; they are proud  of what they’ve all achieved, but unsure of the cost was  worth it. 
He moves on. They part for him, offering muted thanks, some  words of encouragement. Some can’t even look him in the eye. 
It is a solemn moment of farewell. The passing of a legend. As he passes the last of them, he stops and looks back. 
(Note: We stay in the wide so as not to undercut the moment  later in Cain’s office) 
MAVERICK 
Y’all built one helluva a plane. 
Bittersweet smiles from the team. Yes they did. Mavericks  walks on, ready to face the music. Out on his terms. 
47 INT. HANGAR OFFICE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 47 
SILENCE. The SPs flank the door. Cain sits behind a desk,  turns page after page of a file. Mav waits, sweating in his  flight suit, gently thumbing the stick in his hand. 
CAIN 
(looking at file) 
Maverick... 
(sighs) 
Thirty plus years of service...  
combat medals... citations... the  
only man to shoot down three enemy  
aircraft in the last forty years...  
ALT: distinguished...distinguished. 
After a long wait, Cain closes the file, stares. 
CAIN (CONT’D) 
Yet you can’t get a promotion, you  
won’t retire and, despite your best  
efforts, you refuse to die. You  
should be a two-star admiral by  
now. If not a senator. Yet here you  
are... Captain. Why is that? 
MAVERICK 
One of life’s mysteries, sir.  
CAIN 
This isn’t a joke. I asked you a  
question.

MAVERICK 
I’m where I belong... sir. 
CAIN 
Navy doesn’t see it that way. Not  
anymore. 
Cain stands. Stares out the window at the future. 
CAIN (CONT’D) 
These planes you’ve been testing,  
Captain, one day they won’t need  
pilots at all. Pilots that need to  
sleep, eat, take a piss... Pilots  
that can disobey. All you did was  
buy time for those men out there. 
(turns to Maverick) 
The future is coming. And you’re  
not in it. 
Without taking his eyes off Maverick: 
CAIN (CONT’D) 
Escort this man off the base...  
take to him to his quarters... wait  
with him while he packs his gear...  
(turns away) 
I want him on the road to North  
Island within the hour.  
Beat. 
MAVERICK 
North Island... sir? 
CAIN 
Call came in with impeccable  
timing. Right when I was driving  
here to ground your ass once and  
for all. It galls me to say it, but  
for reasons known only to the  
almighty and your guardian angel...  
you’ve been called back to Top Gun. 
Cain turns, sits back at the desk. Even Maverick is confused. 
Sir 
MAVERICK CAIN 
You are dismissed, Captain.

On behalf of the team... 
He plants the DARKSTAR’S STICK on the desk. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
Mach 10 capable, sir. As promised. 
Cain never looks up. Maverick turns to leave, stopping on: 
CAIN 
The end is inevitable, Maverick.  
Your kind is headed for extinction. 
MAVERICK 
Yes, sir... But not today.  
ALT: Maybe so, but not today, Sir. 
And with a sly grin, Maverick is gone. 
49 EXT. POINT LOMA - DAY 49 
AERIAL RIPS over Point Loma revealing the North Island NAS,  as the TOP GUN ANTHEM theme kicks in. 
50 EXT. NAVAL AIR STATION NORTH ISLAND, CORONADO - DAY 50 
Maverick rips down a taxiway as an F-18 Super Hornet takes  off beyond. He watches it soar. Can’t believe he’s back. 
A51 EXT. AIRBASE ENTRANCE A51 Mav rides along an entry drive, stopping to look up at: 
An old F-14 TOMCAT displayed on a museum pedestal like a  relic from a bygone era. 
CLOSE ON: The faded name just under the canopy: 
LT. PETE “MAVERICK” MITCHELL 
Under that are the silhouettes of three planes, all X’d out. Maverick drives on.

52 INT. HALLWAY - DUSK 52 
CLOSE ON: Photos of faces we might recognize: ICEMAN, SLIDER  and, of course, GOOSE. For anyone unfamiliar, it’s obvious  there is story here - Glory and ghosts. We pass a photo of  ICEMAN AND MAVERICK, settle on a prominent photo of: 
A stern-jawed ADMIRAL TOM KAZANSKY aka ICEMAN. “Commander of  the Pacific Fleet”. 
REVEAL: Maverick, staring at the past. 
ADMIRAL’S AIDE (O.S.) 
Captain Mitchell... Captain  
Mitchell. 
Maverick snaps from his thoughts. 
53 INT. OFFICERS’ BOARDROOM - DUSK 53 
A MONITOR with an image that means little to us now but will  come to dominate our thoughts. A HANDSOME, SQUARE-JAWED MAN  (40s) steps in front of it. This is: 
CYCLONE 
At ease. Captain Pete “Maverick”  
Mitchell. Your reputation precedes  
you. 
MAVERICK 
Thank you, sir. 
CYCLONE 
It wasn’t a compliment. Admiral  
Beau Simpson. I’m the Airboss. I  
believe you know Admiral Bates. 
CLOSE ON: ADMIRAL BATES (55). An affable, brilliant two-star,  otherwise known as:  
MAVERICK 
Warlock, Sir. I must admit, I  
wasn’t expecting an invitation  
back. 
WARLOCK 
They’re called orders, Maverick. 
His tone is friendly enough, but the meaning is clear. No one  is exactly excited to see Maverick back.

CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 24.

WARLOCK (CONT’D) 
You two have something in common.  
Cyclone here was first in his class  
back in ‘88. 
MAVERICK 
Actually, sir, I finished second.  
Just want to manage expectations. 
Awkward silence. Cyclone nods to Warlock who takes a remote  and summons images on the monitors on the walls. Warlock  clicks through SURVEILLANCE IMAGES of INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS at  the base of a forbidding valley. 
WARLOCK 
The target is an unsanctioned  
uranium enrichment plant,  
constructed in violation of a  
unilateral NATO treaty. The uranium  
produced there represents a direct  
threat to our allies in the region.  
The Pentagon has tasked us with  
assembling a strike team and taking  
it out before it becomes fully  
operational. 
Maverick steps closer, studying the screens as Warlock points  to corresponding satellite and archival images, along with a  profile of the run: 
WARLOCK (CONT’D) 
The plant sits in a recess at the  
end of this valley. Said valley is  
GPS jammed and defended by an  
extensive radar array, serving a  
limited number of fifth generation  
fighters which, in turn, are backed  
up by a plentiful reserve of  
surplus aircraft; F-16s and even a  
few old F-14s. 
CYCLONE 
Seems we’re not the only ones  
holding on to old relics. 
Maverick lets that go. He has to. 
WARLOCK 
What’s your read, Captain? 
MAVERICK 
Normally, this would be a cake-walk  
for the F-35’s stealth. But the GPS  
jamming negates that.  
(CONTINUED) 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 25.
53 CONTINUED: (2) 53 
The surface-to-air threat  
necessitates a low level, laser guided strike, tailor made for the  
F-18. I figure two precision bombs  
minimum. Makes it four planes,  
flying in pairs. 
(studies topography) 
That’s one helluva steep climb out,  
exposing you to all the surface-to air missiles. Survive that, it’s a  
dogfight all the way home. 
WARLOCK 
All requirements for which you have  
real-world experience. 
MAVERICK 
Not in the same mission, sir. 
Beat. Maverick realizes. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
Somebody’s not coming back from  
this. 
CYCLONE 
Can it be done or not? 
MAVERICK 
How soon until the plant becomes  
operational? 
WARLOCK 
Three weeks. Maybe less. 
Maverick realizes... 
MAVERICK 
Well, it’s a been a while since  
I’ve flown an F-18... And I’m not  
sure who I’d trust to fly the other  
three. 
Beat. 
WARLOCK 
I think you misunderstand, Captain. 
Sir? 
MAVERICK CYCLONE 
We don’t want you to fly it. We  
want you to teach it.

MAVERICK 
Teach... sir... 
Warlock hits a button and TWELVE PILOT I.D. PHOTOS appear: 
CYCLONE 
We’ve recalled twelve Top Gun  
graduates from their squadrons, all  
top of their class. You will narrow  
this pool down to six - the best of  
the best. They will fly the  
mission. 
Maverick’s eyes lock on one face in particular. The stoic  face of BRADLEY “ROOSTER” BRADSHAW.  
CYCLONE (CONT’D) 
Is there a problem, Captain? 
MAVERICK 
You know there is... sir. 
CYCLONE 
(glances at screen) 
Bradley Bradshaw. AKA Rooster. I  
understand you flew with his old  
man... What was his call sign? 
MAVERICK 
Goose. Sir. 
CYCLONE 
Tragic what happened. 
Warlock is uncomfortable with this: 
WARLOCK 
Captain Mitchell was cleared of any  
wrongdoing. Goose’s death was an  
accident.  
CYCLONE 
That how you see it, Captain? 
(points to Bradshaw) 
Is that how Goose’s son sees it? 
Maverick has had about enough of this shit, but soldiers on. 
MAVERICK 
With all due respect, sir. I’m not  
a teacher.

You were a Top Gun instructor

MAVERICK 
Sir, that was thirty years ago. I  
lasted two months. This is not  
where I belong. 
CYCLONE 
Let me be perfectly blunt. You  
weren’t our first choice. You  
weren’t even on the list. But  
someone put your name in the  
SECDEF’s ear. We all know who. 
WARLOCK 
Captain Mitchell has real-world  
experience akin to every segment of  
this operation. 
CYCLONE 
What Captain Mitchell has is a  
friend in the Pacific Fleet. 
(to Maverick) 
You’re here at the request of  
Admiral Kazansky. Iceman is a man I  
deeply admire. He seems to think  
you still have something to offer  
the Navy. What that is, I can’t  
imagine. You don’t have to take the  
job, but I should make it clear:  
This is your last post, Captain.  
You fly for Top Gun or you don’t  
fly for the Navy. Ever again. 
Maverick looks at the picture of Rooster one more time.  
54 EXT. “THE HARD DECK” BAR - DUSK - ESTABLISHING 54 
An old yacht club converted into a ramshackle shrine to wild  nights and Naval history, beneath a big sign (”The Hard  Deck”) and a small one (“Help Wanted”).

CLOSE ON: Mav’s phone buzzes on the bar. The icon photo is  that of ICEMAN, in Admiral’s uniform.  
 ICE: That went well. 
Mav grudgingly responds. 
 M: The kid’s not ready for this mission.  ICE: No one is. That’s why you’re here. 
 M: You could have warned me. 
 ICE: Would you have come? 
Maverick’s thumbs hover, unsure how to reply. Beat. 
 ICE: Sorry I couldn’t be there. 
 M: Where were you?

 ICE: Think it over. 
He sighs, places his phone on the bar. 
VOICE (O.S.) 
Of all the gin joints in all the  
towns in all the world, he walks

Well, you’ll sort it out.

Come on. You’ve been saying that

PENNY 
She reaches over and rings a bell, CLANG-CLANG-CLANG-CLANG.  The entire bar CHEERS. AN AVIATOR slaps him on the back: 
FERG  
Much appreciated, pal. 
MAVERICK 
What I miss? 
Penny points to a “House Rules” sign:  
(reads) 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
Disrespect a lady, the Navy, or put  
your cell phone on my bar...  
PENNY 
You buy a round. 
MAVERICK 
For everyone? 
PENNY 
I’m afraid rules are rules. You’re  
lucky it’s early. 
HANGMAN 
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? 
Maverick follows Hangman’s eyeline to the door. 
The first of the night’s REVELERS enter, occupying tables,  circling the bar, giving the joint a little life. 
Among them are THREE PILOTS: REUBEN “PAYBACK” FLOYD, MICKEY  “FANBOY” GARCIA, and NATASHA “PHOENIX” TRACE.

HANGMAN 
Here I thought we were special,  
Coyote. Turns out the invite went  
to anyone... Keepin’ it tight, I  
see, Phoenix. 
Phoenix smiles, annoyed but patient. As she approaches: 
PHOENIX 
Fellas, this here’s Bagman. 
Hangman. Whatever.  
HANGMAN PHOENIX 
(to Payback and Fanboy) 
You’re looking at the only Naval  
Aviator on active duty with a  
confirmed air-to-air kill. 
Hangman demurs with a bit of false modesty. 
PHOENIX (CONT’D) 
Mind you, the other guy was in a  
museum piece from the Korean War. 
Hangman’s smile fades. Coyote jumps in to defend. 
Cold war. 
COYOTE PAYBACK 
Same century.  
FANBOY 
Not this one. 
Hangman looks at Coyote. “Thanks for nothing.”  
COYOTE

COYOTE (CONT’D) 
When did you come in? 
BOB 
I’ve been here the whole time. 
Beat. The other share a look. Bob would have to be invisible  for no one to have noticed. And that’s exactly what Bob is. 
HANGMAN 
The man’s a stealth pilot.  
Literally. 
BOB 
Weapons Systems Officer, actually. 
HANGMAN 
With no sense of humor. 
Hangman walks away toward the bar as: 
PHOENIX 
What do they call you? 
Bob. 
BOB 
PAYBACK 
No, your call sign. 
...Bob. 
BOB 
Awkward pause. Phoenix studies him. 
PHOENIX 
You’re my new back-seater. Sent  
from Lemoore. 
BOB 
Looks like it.  
Long pause. No telling what Phoenix thinks about this until:  She grabs a pool cue. 
PHOENIX 
Nine ball, Bob. Rack ‘em.

B56 INT. HARD DECK - BAR AREA - NIGHT B56 
Hangman approaches with an empty bottle, gets Penny’s  attention. 
HANGMAN 
I’ll have six more on the old  
timer. 
Maverick sighs, then: 
PHOENIX 
BRADSHAW. Is that you? 
Maverick freezes. Over his shoulder, BRADLEY BRADSHAW, aka  ROOSTER, enter. Phoenix strides over with open arms: 
PHOENIX (CONT’D) 
This is how I find out you’re  
stateside? 
ROOSTER 
I thought I’d surprise you. 
He goes to hug her. She feints a punch to his gut, he  flinches. 
PHOENIX 
Guess I surprised you back. 
ROOSTER 
(recovering) 
It’s good to see you. 
PHOENIX 
Good to see you, too. 
Maverick watches with renewed interest as the pilots settle  around the pool table everyone sizing everyone up. All of  them are good. They all want to know who’s best. 
Penny hands Hangman his beers. 
HANGMAN 
Much obliged, Pops. 
He heads back to the other pilots.  
More people are entering the bar, the night kicking off. Penny sees Maverick watching Rooster.

(off Maverick’s nod) 
Not gonna say hello? 
Mav decides he should. Just as he stands, Rooster turns and  looks at Mav, as if he knew he was there all along. They  stare for a beat, then Rooster turns back to Phoenix. 
Penny sees this entire thing. 
MAVERICK 
How’s about ringing me out before  
the evening rush. 
Maverick hands her his card. Penny heads off with it to close  him out. 
C56 INT. HARD DECK - POOL AREA - DUSK C56 ON THE PILOTS:

He hands Rooster a beer. 
ROOSTER 
You look good, Hangman.  
HANGMAN 
I am good, Rooster. I’m very good. 
Phoenix and Rooster share a glance.  
PAYBACK 
So anybody know what this “special  
detachment’s” all about? 
HANGMAN 
A mission’s a mission. That don’t  
confront me. What I wanna know is  
who’s team leader? And which’a  
y’all have what it takes to follow  
me? 
Hangman winks at Rooster, needling him. 
ROOSTER 
Hangman, the only place you’ll ever  
lead anyone is an early grave.

Hangman looks up from his next shot, stands and walks to  Rooster, face-to-face. 
HANGMAN 
Anyone follows you is just gonna...  
run outta fuel. But then that’s you  
all over, ain’t it... Rooster? Snug  
on your perch, waitin’ for juuuuust 
the right moment. That never comes. 
Cold beat. The song changes. 
HANGMAN (CONT’D) 
I love this song. 
He walks off. Rooster exhales as Phoenix steps up,  
unimpressed by the high-chesting. Rooster never takes his  eyes off of Hangman as: 
PHOENIX 
He hasn’t changed. 
ROOSTER 
No, he sure hasn’t.  
ANGLE ON: Hangman stepping to the jukebox, smiles and makes a  selection. 
JOHNNY CASH’ COCAINE BLUES kicks off. The energy in the room  shifts. It’s Hangman’s party. 
Mav makes note of this, shifts his eyes back to Rooster and  Phoenix, who are slightly annoyed that it’s too loud to talk  now. 
ON THE PILOTS: 
FANBOY 
Check it out. More patches. 
At the door: a second wave of PILOTS enter. More hot shots. 
PAYBACK 
Omaha, Halo, Harvard, Yale... Shit,

And a look darkens Rooster’s face as he realizes... 
D56 INT. HARD DECK - BAR AREA - NIGHT D56 Penny drops Mav’s card on the bar. 
PENNY 
It’s been declined. 
MAVERICK 
You’re kidding me. 
As Maverick sighs, reaches into his pocket: 
CLOSE ON: A hand grabs a power cord and yanks it from the  wall. All of the music in the bar stops. The crowd groans,  catcalls, whistles. 
CLOSE ON: Hands pull up a bench, open the lid of a piano.  
WIDE SHOT of the crowd, all heads turning as someone starts  pounding on the piano. 
At the bar, Maverick turns and sees Rooster at the piano,  playing away, the reaction in the room skeptical. 
In the back, Phoenix smiles, nods to Payback and Fanboy to  follow her. They do, unsure of what’s going on. 
Hangman stands up from his next shot at the pool table, left  alone with Coyote. The party is no longer his. 
CLOSE ON: Rooster banging away on the keys, finishing the  intro. He starts singing. Phoenix joins in, motions for  Fanboy and Payback to do the same.  
It takes a moment, but people in the bar get into it. At the bar, Maverick holds up all the money he’s got.

Penny rings the bell, this time like a five alarm fire.  Everyone cheers. Whatever that sound is, they love it. 
CROWD 
OVERBOAAAAAAAARD. 
A hand grabs Maverick’s shoulder. He turns to see Hangman,  backed by Coyote, Payback and Fanboy. Maverick looks back to  Penny.  
PENNY 
Great to see you, Mav. 
She waves him away. Maverick is dragged back, hoisted bodily  into the air, carried to the door as the crowd chants: 
CROWD 
OVERBOARD. OVERBOARD. 
At the piano, Rooster plays on, his friends singing. His back  to the action, he doesn’t see Maverick being hauled out. 
56 EXT. REAR OF HARD DECK - NIGHT 56 
The “Over-board” CHANT builds. The back door BLOWS OPEN and  Hangman and Payback force Maverick off back steps into the  sand. A raucous CHEER erupts inside.  
HANGMAN 
Thanks for the beers. Come back  
anytime. 
The pilots all laugh and head back in. 
57 INT. HARD DECK - BAR AREA - NIGHT 57 
Hangman high fives Coyote, greets the other pilots. But his  smile fades when the music at the piano changes; the first  strains of Great Balls of Fire. The crowd is into it now.  Rooster has them in his hand.

62 EXT. TOP GUN TARMAC - MORNING 62 
MUSIC kicks in as jets arrive. Sleek F-18 (Echoes) and  doubles (Foxtrots)... Maverick stands in the path of an  arriving vehicle. Hondo steps out. As they walk:

WARLOCK 
Good morning. Take your seats.  
(they do) 
I’m Admiral Bates, NAWDC Commander.  
Welcome to your special training  
detachment. You’re all Top Gun  
graduates, the elite, best of the  
best. That was yesterday. You’ve  
all spent your careers flying close  
air support for troops on the

The enemy’s new fifth generation  
fighter has leveled the playing  
field. Details are few, but you can  
be sure we no longer possess the  
technological advantage. Success,  
now more than ever, comes down to  
the man or woman in the box. 
Hangman winks at Phoenix, who just rolls her eyes. 
WARLOCK (CONT’D) 
This mission requires two F-18 Echo  
solo pilots and two Foxtrot dual seat teams. Half of you will make  
the cut, half will remain in  
reserve... One of you will be named  
Mission Leader.  
Rooster and Hangman share a glance. It’s on. 
WARLOCK (CONT’D) 
Your instructor is a Top Gun  
graduate with real-world experience  
in every mission aspect you will be  
expected to master. His exploits  
are legendary and he is considered  
to be one of the finest pilots this  
program has ever produced. 
CLOSE ON: Cyclone shakes his head. Jesus. 
WARLOCK (CONT’D) 
What he has to teach you may very  
well mean the difference between  
life and death. I give you Captain  
Pete Mitchell, call sign: Maverick. 
CLOSE ON: Rooster, hearing the name, his expression icy.  Phoenix shoots him a concerned glance. She understands the  significance of this moment. Or thinks she does. 
Maverick steps to the podium and the other pilots recognize  him immediately. They all squirm, Hangman especially. 
Maverick looks past Rooster to Hangman and nods as if to say  “that’s right.” He raises a thick bound MANUAL: 
MAVERICK 
Good morning. The F-18 NATOPS. It  
contains everything there is to  
know about your aircraft. What’s

He DROPS his copy of the manual in the trash. The trainees  react. Cyclone glowers, throws a look to Warlock.

Warlock nods. He’ll deal with it. Cyclone walks out. This is  not lost on Maverick or Hondo.

And we’re off. 
MAVERICK 
What the enemy doesn’t know is you.  
Your limits. I intend to find them.  
Test them. Push beyond... Flying  
faster than the speed of sound with  
one split second to make a life or  
death decision requires a level of  
trust, feel, instinct that doesn’t  
exist in any manual.

Where’s he going? 
MAVERICK 
That’s a mistake. Cover your

ALT: That’s a mistake. Never leave  
your wingman, Hangman. 
HANGMAN 
He called you a man, Phoenix. You

Woah. Nice move Phoenix. I like

100 EXT. SKIES/INT. HANGMAN’S F-18/MAVERICK’S F-18 - SORTIE 2 100 
Mav does everything he can to shake Hangman, but nothing is  working. At first it’s exciting, a challenge. But it isn’t  long before Maverick is feeling the heat. 
[INTO THE RIGHT SCISSORS.] 
MAVERICK (TO SELF) 
You’re good. I can’t shake you.  
ALT: Damn this kid’s good. Can’t  
shake him.  
ALT: I can’t shake you, damm you’re  
good, I’ll give you that. 
The physical punishment of evasive maneuvering mounts, taking  it’s toll as the pursuit stretches on. Maverick is giving it  all he’s got. Hangman, on the other hand: 
HANGMAN (TO SELF) 
Got it bad, got it bad, got it  
bad... I’m hot for teacher... 
MAVERICK (TO SELF) 
You’re good. But you gave up your  
wingman.

100 CONTINUED: 100 
And just when we think Maverick has reached his breaking  point, [MAVERICK GOES SUPERSONIC AND CLIMBS. HANGMAN PURSUES.  MAVERICK FLIES DIRECTLY INTO THE SUN.] 
Maverick looks over his shoulder so he can fly into the sun  while keeping an eye on Hangman. 
MAVERICK (TO SELF) (CONT’D) 
And you lost your set of eyes.  
The strain is intense, as is the light. Hangman closes his  eyes, flying blind after Maverick, holding his nerve.  
HANGMAN 
Phoenix, I can’t see him. How close  
am I? 
Phoenix and Bob are masks-off, on the way back to base. [LEVEL FLIGHT] 
PHOENIX (ON RADIO) 
I’m dead, dickhead.  
[LEVEL FLIGHT] 
BOB (ON RADIO) 
See you in the afterlife, Bagman. 
Hangman holds his nerve as long as he can, until: 
HANGMAN 
God DAMMIT. 
[HANGMAN BREAKS RIGHT, LEVELS OUT], opens his eyes, looking  around for Maverick. He hears the tone. 
REVEAL: Maverick is behind him. Hangman punches his canopy,  defeated. [MAV PULLS UP ALONGSIDE, SWEATING, WINDED.] 
MAVERICK 
That’s a kill. 
Copy kill. 
HANGMAN 
[HANGMAN BANKS AWAY HOME]. As Maverick watches him go, he  pulls off his oxygen mask and shakes off the tension. That  was a close one. Too close. 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 57.
101 EXT. TARMAC - DAY 101 
As Phoenix, Bob and Hangman give their two hundred. Hondo  listens on radio.

Another F-18 is targeted.

Another. 
Copy kill. 
HALO 
REMAINING PILOT 
103 EXT. READY ROOM 103 
Too far away to see who is doing the pushups. It doesn’t  matter. One by one they collapse, exhausted. 
MAVERICK (ON RADIO)  
All right. You’ve all shown me some  
real talent. You’ve also proven the  
very best often have the most to  
learn. Two of you have my eye for  
team leader. 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 58.
104 INT. READY ROOM 104 
The class is shattered. Demoralized. Halo, Fritz and Harvard  stagger in, wasted. Hondo follows. 
VOICE (O.S.) 
Hangman. Rooster. Your presence is  
requested. 
They look at one another. Rooster is surprised, but neither  man is happy about the pairing. Off their confused looks: 
105 EXT. SKIES ABOVE DESERT - LATER - SORTIE 4 - DAY 105 Final sortie. Rooster and Hangman head-to-head with Maverick.  
A106 INT./EXT. F18S - INTERCUT - SORTIE 4 A106 
[TWO F-18’s IN LINE ABREAST FORMATION. ROOSTER ON THE LEFT,  HANGMAN ON THE RIGHT.] 
Both men are tense, eyes peeled. There’s a shark in the  water. And they’re lunch. Rooster is looking down. 
HANGMAN 
Nothing on radar. Again. 
ROOSTER 
He’ll be coming low to high. 
Hangman is looking back. 
HANGMAN 
I’m guessing from behind. 
ROOSTER 
Or both. That was some shit you  
pulled on Phoenix. 
HANGMAN 
I just hastened the inevitable.  
Besides, I paid for it, didn’t I? 
ROOSTER 
That’s not the point. Where the  
hell is he? 
MAVERICK (ON RADIO) 
Right here. 
Rooster and Hangman instinctively look back and down. (CONTINUED) 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 59.
A106 CONTINUED: A106 ROOSTER’S POV. He looks down to his right. Nothing. 
He looks down to his left and is shocked to see the tip of  Maverick’s wing. 
B106 EXT. SKIES - DAY - SORTIE 4 B106 
REVEAL: [MAVERICK IS INSIDE THEIR FORMATION, JUST UNDERNEATH  THEM. IN THE NEXT INSTANT, HE ROLLS AND SPLITS THEM FROM  BELOW. hANGMAN ROLLS AWAY RIGHT. MAVERICK ROLLS OVER THE TOP  OF ROOSTER, INVERTED, LOOKING DOWN AT HIM FROM ABOVE.] 
MAVERICK  
You boys need to focus.  
(at Rooster) 
You ready? 
ROOSTER 
Fight’s on. 
[ROOSTER TURNS THE TABLES AND INVERTS. MAVERICK DOES THE  SAME]. Their planes begin falling towards Earth, each trying  to out-spiral one another [IN A LEFT SPIRAL]. 
106 INT. MAVERICK'S F-18/ROOSTER’S F-18 - SORTIE 4 106 The Gs are intense, the world spinning, a test of endurance. 
ROOSTER 
Not this time, Captain. 
MAVERICK  
Show me what you got.  
ALT: Let’s see what you’ve got. 
But Rooster has no shot. And neither does Maverick. As they  continue to fall. 
A107 INT. HANGMAN'S F-18 - SORTIE 4 A107 
He chases them, unable to make a shot at the two tangling  airplanes. [FROM 5000 FT IN LEFT TURN, LOOKING LEFT & DOWN.] 
HANGMAN

A108 INT. ROOSTER AND MAV’S F18S INTERCUT - SORTIE 4 A108 
The verbal altimeter is calling out the altitude as they  plummet. 
MAVERICK 
What are you gonna do Rooster?  
What’s your move? 
ROOSTER 
What does it matter? You’re gonna  
wash me out anyhow.  
ALT: You gonna wash me out? 
MAVERICK 
Washing out is entirely up to you.  
ROOSTER 
That wasn’t always the case,  
though, was it, Sir? 
MAVERICK 
What’s past is past, Rooster. Focus  
on the enemy up here. 
ROOSTER 
You are the enemy. 
They strain as they plummet and spiral.  
MAVERICK 
Well, the enemy’s about to run you  
into the ground.  
MAVERICK’S POV - the Earth is coming up fast. 
B108 INT. READY ROOM - SORTIE 4 B108 Close on Phoenix, shocked at how personal this fight is.

109 EXT. SKIES - DAY - SORTIE 4 109 [THE SPIRAL CONTINUES], the ground coming up fast.  
110 INT. READY ROOM - SORTIE 4 110 Everyone hears the altimeter dropping. 
111 INT. ROOSTER'S F-18 - SORTIE 4 111 Both men look at their altimeters dropping rapidly. 
MAVERICK 
Copy. Continue. Bail out anytime,  
Rooster. 
ROOSTER 
I can go as low as you, sir. And  
that’s saying something. 
The world below them is spinning wildly, coming up fast. 
Finally [ROOSTER AND MAVERICK BOTH HAVE TO PULL OUT, COMING  DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE GROUND], maximum Gs.  
112 EXT. SKIES - SORTIE 4 112 
[MAVERICK BANKS HARD, ROOSTER FALLING IN BEHIND HIM, BACKED  BY HANGMAN]. Mav nods approvingly, sotto:

C’mon Bradley, nose down. Just a  
little lower and you have me. 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 62.

IT. TAKE IT. 
113 INT. ROOSTER’S F-18 - DAY - SORTIE 4 113

ROOSTER 
WE’RE TOO LOW. WE’RE TOO LOW. 
114 INT. MAVERICK'S F-18/EXT. SKIES - SORTIE 4 114 
MAVERICK (TO SELF) 
Sorry, Rooster. 
[MAVERICK LEVELS OUT, STRIKES WITH A COBRA MANEUVER, FORCING  ROOSTER AND HANGMAN TO SPLIT AND OVERSHOOT HIM.] Now Mav’s  instantly in chase position for a shot of his own. 
115 INT. ROOSTER'S F-18 - SORTIE 4 115 Rooster hears the tone. 
MAVERICK 
That’s a kill.  
116 INT. ROOSTER’S F-18 - SORTIE 4 116 Rooster seethes, outwitted, but concedes the fight... 
ROOSTER 
Copy kill.  
117 INT. READY ROOM - SORTIE 4 117 
Everyone exhales, shares a collective look. This is next  level shit, even for them.

HONDO 
Alright. That’s enough man.  
Rooster, that’s enough. 
Hondo pats Rooster on the shoulder. 
HONDO (CONT’D) 
Tomorrow’s another day. 
Rooster sits up, exhausted. Feet appear next to him. He looks  up to see Phoenix above him. 
PHOENIX 
What is going on with you? You  
trying to get kicked out? Breaking  
the hard deck. Insubordination.  
That wasn’t you up there. Talk to  
me. What’s up? 
ROOSTER 
Don’t worry about it. 
PHOENIX 
I’m going on this mission.  
But if you get kicked out, you  
could leave us flying with Hangman.  
So what the hell was that 
ROOSTER 
HE PULLED MY PAPERS. 
What? Who? 
PHOENIX ROOSTER 
Maverick. He pulled my application  
to the Naval academy. He set me  
back four years. 
Phoenix processes. 
PHOENIX 
Why would he do that? 
Rooster does not answer. 
119 INT. READY ROOM 119 Hangman is staring at something on the wall. 
HANGMAN  
Yo, Coyote.

Coyote walks over and follows Hangman’s eyes to a photo from  the CLASS OF ‘86. Young Maverick, with Goose beside him. 
COYOTE 
The man, the legend. There he is... 
But Hangman is looking at something else. He points to Goose. 
HANGMAN 
No, next to him. He look familiar 
to you?  
COYOTE 
(looking closer) 
What have we here? 
Hangman reads the names under the photo: Pete “Maverick”  Mitchell and his RIO “Goose” Bradshaw. 
HANGMAN  
Bradshaw... 
CYCLONE (PRELAP V.O.)  
The hard deck is a parameter set  
for the safety of my pilots, not to  
mention their aircraft, aircraft,  
need I remind you, paid for by the  
American taxpayer. 
120 INT. CYCLONE’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - MORNING 120 
Maverick stands, holding a folder in one hand. Warlock and  Cyclone sit. The mood is grim. 
CYCLONE 
Five thousand feet is not just a  
rule. It is a law. As immutable as  
gravity. 
MAVERICK 
The hard deck will be much lower  
for the mission, sir 
CYCLONE 
It does not change without my  
approval and certainly not in the  
middle of an exercise. And that  
cobra maneuver of yours could have  
killed all three of you. I never  
want to see that shit again.

WARLOCK 
What exactly do you suppose you  
were teaching today, Captain? 
MAVERICK 
That as good as they are, they  
still have something to learn. 
CYCLONE 
You’re talking about the best  
fighter pilots on the planet,  
Captain. 
MAVERICK 
That’s what they’ve been told for  
their entire careers - while  
they’ve been dropping bombs from  
high altitude with little to no  
dogfighting. The parameters of this  
mission call for something they’ve  
never encountered 
CYCLONE 
You have less than three weeks. You  
will teach them how to fly as a  
team and how to strike the target. 
MAVERICK 
And how to come home. 
Ugly pause. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
And how... to come home, sir. 
CYCLONE 
Every mission has its risks. These  
pilots accept that. 
MAVERICK 
I don’t... sir. 
Cyclone shakes this off, collects the papers on front of him. 
CYCLONE 
Every morning from this day  
forward, you will brief us on your  
instructional plans, in writing.  
Nothing will change without my  
expressed approval.  
MAVERICK 
Including the hard deck, sir?

Sir. 
MAVERICK 
Maverick steps forward and places his folder on the desk. 
CYCLONE 
What is this? 
MAVERICK 
It’s a request to lower the hard  
deck, sir. To practice the low level bombing run. Per the mission  
parameters. 
121 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CYCLONE’S OFFICE - DAY 121 Maverick and Warlock exit, walking in silence for a moment. 
WARLOCK 
You could learn a thing or two  
about timing, Captain. 
They walk past Phoenix and Bob. Maverick glances back,  something crossing his mind before he pushes it away. 
124 EXT. HARD DECK - DAY 124 Maverick rides his Ninja, passing the Hard Deck. He pulls a U turn and drives back to the bar. 
125 INT. HARD DECK - BAR AREA - DAY 125 
Maverick strides in, stops short, a yellow Labrador, “T”,  approaches. As he pets it. 
Hey, Mav.

PENNY 
Don’t worry about it. You’ve

PENNY 
One thing you can say about Captain  
Mitchell. He always keeps his

PENNY 
Little rougher than I was  
expecting. 
MAVERICK 
You don’t say.

Sort of like raising the flaps on

MAVERICK 
To reduce drag. 
Exactly. 
PENNY 
MAVERICK 
How do I do that? 
Penny points to a handle by the wheel. 
PENNY 
Pump that handle for me. 
Mav navigates, does as instructed, struggling to stay steady  on the pitching deck. 
PENNY (CONT’D) 
Now pull on the outhaul.

That green line there. No, the  
other one. 
Maverick navigates uneasily towards a line running under the  boom, looks back to Penny. 
PENNY (CONT’D) 
Pull it hard. 
Maverick does as he’s told. The boat begins to stabilize.  
PENNY (CONT’D) 
Arright, now we want to take off.  
What do we need? 
Lift.

Penny points to a winch in the middle of the boat. Maverick  moves it with more certainty, cranks the winch. 
PENNY (CONT’D) 
What are you adjusting now? 
MAVERICK 
Angle of attack. 
PENNY 
Right you are. 
The boat is sailing steady and fast, whitecaps spraying.  Maverick smiles. Not so different than flying. Penny cranks a  winch by the wheel. 
Ready? 
For what? 
PENNY (CONT’D) MAVERICK 
PENNY 
The afterburner. 
And off Penny’s smile... 
JUMP CUT as the spinnaker pole is extended. 
JUMP CUT as Maverick slams the spinnaker bag on the bow. JUMP CUTS as four lines are attached. 
JUMP CUT to Maverick who “jumps” the spinnaker line, using  his entire body to haul the spinnaker up the mast. 
ANGLE ON Penny hauling in the other end of the line through a  cleat to secure it. 
In this way Maverick and Penny work together, sharing a smile  as: 
BOAT TO BOAT ANGLE: the spinnaker deploys, filling with wind  with a dramatic CRACK and pulling the boat along even faster. 
BACK ON THE BOAT, hauling through the water now. Maverick  navigates the deck toward Penny, the sea spraying around him.  He takes a place beside her at the wheel.

126 CONTINUED: (3) 126 
Take her. 
PENNY (CONT’D) 
Maverick eyes the wheel, taking it as Penny steps aside. It  takes some effort to hold her steady. After a beat: 
PENNY (CONT’D) 
Now you’re in the Navy. 
They share a smile and look ahead. 
AB127 EXT. STREETS - DUSK AB127 
Maverick drives Penny on his bike, her arms around his waist.  We cruise with them a while. 
She lays her head on his shoulders, feels the wind in her  hair. 
AC127 EXT. PENNY’S HOUSE - DUSK AC127 They pull up to Penny’s house. Penny climbs off the bike. 
PENNY 
Thanks for helping today. 
MAVERICK 
Not exactly sure I helped. 
Awkward silence. Neither is sure how to say goodnight. Until: 
PENNY 
Don’t give me that look. 
What look? 
MAVERICK 
She turns and heads for the house. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
It’s the only one I got. 
Penny calls back over her shoulder. 
Goodnight. Night. 
PENNY 
MAVERICK 
She turns away without a second thought. As Maverick watches  her go, he exhales, starts his bike. 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 72.
AD127 INT. PENNY'S HOUSE AD127 
Penny enters and closes the door behind her before leaning  her back against it, letting go of her cool demeanor.  
She closes her eyes, listening to the sound of Mav’s bike  riding away, then hangs her head and exhales, not unlike  Maverick. 
AMELIA (O.S.) 
Mom, is that you? 
PENNY 
Yeah.(to herself) 
Yeah, it’s me, all right. 
She shakes her head and exits frame as: 
MAVERICK (PRE-LAP) 
Time... is your greatest enemy. 
A127 INT. TACTICAL AUDITORIUM - DAY A127 
CLOSE ON: The main screen, pulling back from a rapidly  ticking timer, counting backwards toward zero... 
Looming larger on the screen are schematics of: 
MAVERICK 
Phase one of the mission will be a  
low-level ingress, attacking in two plane teams. You’ll fly along this  
narrow canyon to your target. Radar  
guided surface-to-air missiles  
defend the area.  
On screen, a schematic of a radar-guided missile array. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
These SAMs are lethal, but they  
were designed to protect the skies  
above. Not the ground... Not the  
canyon below.  
ROOSTER 
That’s because the enemy knows no  
one is insane enough to navigate  
that low at high speed.  
MAVERICK 
And that’s exactly what I’m gonna  
train you to do. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 73.
A127 CONTINUED: A127 ON HANGMAN who smiles. This is gonna be intense. 
Overhead animation of two planes zig-zagging through a narrow  valley.  
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
Your altitude on the day will be  
one hundred feet... Maximum. 
Reactions from the pilots. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
Exceed this altitude... Radar will  
spot you - And you’re dead. 
As the planes on screen bank, one goes too high... A missile  fires and destroys the high plane. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
Speed on the day...860 knots.  
Minimum. Time to target, two and a  
half minutes. 
More reactions from the pilots. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
(pointing) 
That’s because these Fifth  
generation fighters are waiting at  
an airbase nearby...  
One screen, schematics of the lethal looking next-gen  aircraft. 
Beside this, animation shows a Tomahawk Missile launch from a  destroyer in a carrier group at sea as” 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
Simultaneous to your ingress, a  
carrier-based strike will take out  
this airfield, but if any of these  
planes are airborne before that,  
they’ll anticipate your target and  
immediately move to defend it. In a  
head-to-head with these planes in  
your F18s... you’re dead. 
(more reactions) 
You want to get in, hit your target  
and be gone before these planes  
even have a chance of catching you.  
This makes time your greatest 
adversary. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 74.
A127 CONTINUED: (2) A127 
The canyon, the missiles and the fifth gen planes share the  screen now. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
The faster you navigate this  
canyon, the harder it will be to  
stay under the radar of these enemy  
SAMs. The deeper you are in the  
canyon, the less margin for error  
there will be. The tighter the  
turns, the more intensely the force  
of gravity on your body multiplies. 
Maverick points to various turns on the canyon map. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
You’ve all faced sustained Gs  
before. But this... This will take  
you and your aircraft to the  
breaking point. 
Reactions from the class. Holy shit. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
For today’s exercise, we’ll start  
easy. You’ll be flying a route on  
your nav-system which simulates the  
valley. Maximum ceiling: three  
hundred feet. Time to target: three  
minutes. Good luck. 
127 EXT. MOUNTAINS - “LOW-LEVEL INGRESS TRAINING” - SORTIE 1 127 
ZOOM. POV from the nose of an F-18: ripping a BRUTAL SLALOM  through canyons and valleys at incredible speed... 
128 INT. PHOENIX/BOB’S/COYOTE’S F-18S - DAY 128 
Phoenix/Bob fly behind Coyote, blasting above the rocky  desert terrain. 
Phoenix has one eye on a GPS. A green dot represents their F 18. A blue line represents the route she has to take. Red  lines on either side represent canyon walls. 
To stay on the line, she has to bank hard, pulling  
switchbacks with tremendous Gs. 
In back, Bob has his own GPS, monitoring the clock, making  calculations. They are both sweating. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 75.
128 CONTINUED: 128 
BOB 
Time to target is one minute  
thirty. We’re twenty seconds  
behind. Increase to 900 knots. 
PHOENIX 
We gotta move, Coyote. 
Sweating, Coyote guns it, banking harder to follow the  proposed route. The Gs intensify and the team strains. It’s  grueling. 
129 EXT. TRAINING CANYON - DAY 129 But he can’t make the turn... 
130 INT. COYOTE’S F-18 - DAY 130 Coyote yanks back the throttle and hits the brakes. 
CLOSE ON: The line on Coyote’s’s GPS. He strays too far and  over the red line. An alarm blares. 
COYOTE 
God dammit. 
A131 INT. PHOENIX/BOB’S F-18 - DAY A131 
Phoenix comes around the corner to see Coyote’s jet with its  airbrakes extended. She yanks on the stick sending her jet  into a near vertical climb, breaking the 200 foot ceiling. 
131 INT. TACTICAL AUDITORIUM - DAY - DEBRIEF 131 
Maverick’s with all the trainees, replaying the TRAINING RUN  like a coach breaking down postgame film... 
MAVERICK 
(to Coyote) 
Why are they dead? 
PHOENIX 
We broke the 300 foot ceiling. A  
surface-to-air missile took us out. 
MAVERICK 
(to Coyote) 
No. Why are they dead? 
(CONTINUED) 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 76.
131 CONTINUED: 131 
COYOTE 
I slowed down and gave her no  
warning. It’s my fault. 
Coyote feels the eyes of the class on him. 
MAVERICK 
Was there a reason you didn’t  
communicate with your team? 
Coyote goes to speak. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
One that their family will accept  
at the funeral. 
Coyote feels the heat.  
COYOTE 
None... sir. 
Then he turns on Phoenix. 
MAVERICK 
And why didn’t you anticipate the  
turn? You were briefed on the  
terrain. 
Now Phoenix is the in the hot seat. Rooster stares daggers at  Maverick. Maverick points to Bob. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
Tell it to his family. 
Off Phoenix’s look, Hangman smiles. 
132 EXT. TRAINING CANYONS/INT. F-18S - SORTIE 2 - DAY 132 
Two more F-18s (Payback/Fanboy and Hangman) TWIST along the  imaginary route, dangerously close. High G turns. Sweat. 
PAYBACK 
Hangman ease up. Canyon’s getting  
tighter. 
HANGMAN 
Negative. Increase your speed. 
Payback does so. But Hangman is still pulling away. 
PAYBACK 
You’re going too fast, man. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 77.
132 CONTINUED: 132 Hangman navigates a tight turn.  
HANGMAN 
No harm in being ahead of schedule. 
PAYBACK 
DAMMIT, SLOW DOWN- SHIT.  
Too close to the canyon wall, Payback pulls up, breaking the  ceiling.  
FANBOY 
We’re too high 
An alarm sounds. 
FANBOY (CONT’D) 
Radar has a lock. We’re dead. 
133 INT. TACTICAL AUDITORIUM - DAY - DEBRIEF 133 Payback and Fanboy glare at the back of Hangman’s head. 
MAVERICK 
What happened? 
HANGMAN 
I flew as fast as I could. Kinda  
like my ass depended on it. 
And... 
MAVERICK ROOSTER 
He put his team in danger and his  
wingman is dead. 
HANGMAN 
They couldn’t keep up. 
Rooster and Hangman lock eyes. Off Rooster shaking his head: 
134 EXT. TRAINING CANYONS - SORTIE 3 - DAY 134 
BOOM: Rooster, backed by Harvard and Yale, screams along the  route, cranking and banking. They’re flying with extreme  skill and confidence, a polished machine. But: 
HARVARD 
We’re ten seconds behind and  
dropping. Increase to 920 knots. 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 78.
135 INT. ROOSTER’S F-18/HARVARD-YALE F-18 135 
ROOSTER 
Negative, Harvard. Hold your speed. 
YALE 
Rooster, we’re late. 
ROOSTER 
We’re alive. We’ll make up time in  
the straightaway. 
YALE 
We’re too far behind. We have to go  
now. 
ROOSTER 
Maintain current speed. We can make  
it, WE CAN MAKE IT 
141 INT. TACTICAL AUDITORIUM - DEBRIEF - DAY 141 
MAVERICK 
What did you do wrong? 
Rooster just stares at him. 
MAVERICK (CONT’D) 
Why are you dead? 
Sir. 
PHOENIX 
Maverick looks to her. 
PHOENIX (CONT’D) 
He’s the only one who made it to  
the target.  
MAVERICK 
A minute late. He gave the Enemy  
aircraft time to shoot him down.  
He’s still dead. 
ROOSTER 
You don’t know that. 
HANGMAN 
You’re not. Flying. Fast enough.  
You were team leader up there. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 79.
141 CONTINUED: 141 
COYOTE 
Man, on the day, the canyon will be  
tighter. 
FANBOY 
We’ll be pulling even higher G’s,  
and the missiles will be real. 
PAYBACK 
The ceiling will be one hundred  
feet, time to target, two and half  
minutes. 
HANGMAN 
You don’t have a second to waste. 
But Maverick has never taken his eyes off of Rooster. 
ROOSTER 
We made it to the target. 
MAVERICK 
And superior enemy planes  
intercepted you on your way out. 
ROOSTER 
Then it’s a dog fight 
MAVERICK 
Against fifth generation fighters.  
ROOSTER 
We’d still have a chance. 
In an F18- 
MAVERICK ROOSTER 
It’s not the plane, it’s the pilot 
Exactly. 
MAVERICK 
Maverick regrets saying it in the same instant. Ugly pause.  Rooster simmers. 
ROOSTER 
There’s more than one way to fly  
this mission, sir. 
HANGMAN 
You don’t get it.  
All eyes turn to him.
