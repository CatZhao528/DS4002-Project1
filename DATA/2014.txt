American Sniper By Jason Hall 
Page 1/54
It's a fucking hot box. 
Man, the fucking dirt here 
tastes like dog shit. 
Oh, well, you'd know, wouldn't you? Shut the fuck up. 
Breacher up! 
I got a military-age male... 
...that's on a cell phone, 
watching the convoy. Over. 
If he's reporting troop movement... ...you have a green light. Your call. Over. 
Maybe he's just calling his old lady. Heh. He stepped off. 
Hold on, I got a woman and a kid 200 yards out, moving towards the convoy. 
Her arms aren't swinging. 
She's carrying something. 
She's got a grenade. She got a RKG Russian grenade she just handed to the kid. A woman and a kid? 
You got eyes on this? Can you confirm? Negative. You know the R.O.E. 
Your call. 
They fry you if you're wrong. 
They send your ass to Leavenworth. - You got him. 
- Heh. 
Now get back here. 
You don't ever leave your ri?e in the dirt. Yes, sir. 
It was a hell of a shot, son. 
You got a gift. 
You're gonna make a fine hunter someday. Here in the Book of Acts... 
...several times, 
Paul stands in judgment... 
...for what he believes. 
At times, we all have to do that. I mean, we don't see with his eyes... ...so we don't know the glory of his plan. Our lives unfold before us like 
puzzling reflections in a mirror. - What are you doing? 
Page 2/54
- Shh. Shh. 
But on the day we rise, 
we will see with clarity... 
...and understand the mystery of his ways. Let us pray. 
WAYNE'. 
There are three types of people in this world. Sheep, wolves and Sheepdogs. 
Now, some people prefer to believe 
that evil doesn't exist in the world. And if it ever darkened their doorstep, they wouldn't know how to protect themselves. Those are the sheep. 
And then you got predators. 
They use violence to prey on the weak. They're the wolves. 
Come on, Jeff, punch him. 
And then there are those who've been blessed with the gift of aggression... ...and the overpowering need 
to protect the flock. 
These men are a rare breed... 
...that live to confront the wolf. 
They are the sheepdog. 
Now, we're not raising any sheep 
in this family. 
- I will whup your ass if you turn into a wolf. - Wayne. 
But we protect our own. 
If someone tries to fight you... 
...or tries to bully your little brother, you have my permission to finish it. The guy was picking on Jeff. 
Is that true? 
Yes, sir. Yes, he was. 
Did you finish it? 
Then you know who you are. 
You know your purpose. 
ANNOUNCER". Chris Kyle draws the horse Big Business here this evening. 
I'm doing all right. 
That's good. 
So tonight he needs to beat 
the leading score of 86. 
Page 3/54
The louder you cheer, 
the longer he'll ride! 
Come on! Yeah! 
I don't think- He'll walk it off. Jeff, looks like your brother did it again! All right, ladies and gentlemen, 
Chris Kyle! 
Man, wasn't nobody there, 
and you come outwith a belt buckle. - What are you supposed to with it? - Supposed to get laid with it. 
I'll wear it, 
see if it puts Sarah in the mood. Shit, a strong wind'll put Sarah 
in the mood. 
- Is that what they say? 
- You know what they called her... - ...in high school 
- Don't say it. 
- Sarah Sucks-a-Lotta- 
- What I say?! 
Shit, Chris. 
Goddamn it. 
Oh, buckle bunny, those are two girls. No, he kept looking- He had his eyes on her, and that's why the last time... Wait till you see what this does. Let's see him go! 
Baby, who wants 
to fuck a rodeo sta-? What the fuck?! You said you wasn't coming home 
until tomorrow. 
- I said what? 
- Leave him alone. He didn't do anything! Easy! I didn't know shit, man. 
Come out here! 
Chris, leave him alone! Fucking Chris, leave him alone! Goddamn it! 
- He didn't know, all right?! 
- Oh, he didn't know. 
- What didn't you know? 
- I didn't know. Just give me my hat. He didn't know. 
- Get his hat, babe. 
Page 4/54
Whose rifles did you think those were? Them men's clothes were hers? 
You didn't know, 
you fucking son of bitch? 
What the fuck is wrong with you? You don't have to fucking punch everyone! Put that fucking hat on 
and get the fuck out. 
What the fuck is wrong with you? - Get out. 
- You know what... 
...I don't know 
what you expect from me. 
You just drag me out here and then you run off with your brother every damn weekend. Why do you think I did this, huh? I do this to get attention, 
don't you get that? 
Get your stuff and get out. 
Fine. You know what? Fuck you. Fine. You think you're a cowboy 
because you rodeo. 
You're not a cowboy. 
You're just a lousy ranch hand. 
And you're a shitty fucking lay! Don't say it. 
When's the wedding? 
I understand what you're saying... ...but, you know, 
we get to travel over the whole state. Different city every weekend. 
Broncs and steers. 
I don't know, maybe she's right, though. "She's right"? 
Right about what, Chris? 
She's not right, man. 
We're cowboys, we're living the dream. This is a special report. 
KOPPEL'. Those explosions 
set to go off at the U.S. embassies... ...in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania 
and Nairobi, Kenya... 
...were clearly a part of someone's war against the United States. 
Page 5/54
More than 80 dead... 
...more than 1700 injured 
in two bomb blasts today... 
Hey, Jeff. Jeff. 
...which exploded just minutes 
and 450 miles apart. 
Look at this. 
It is still unclear who our enemy is. Although the embassies were obviously the targets... Look what they did to us. 
...most of the dead and injured 
are not Americans. 
Still, eight Americans, including one child, are dead and five are still missing. - So you're from Texas. 
- Yes, sir. 
- And you're a patriot. 
- Yes, sir. 
And you're pissed off. 
I'm looking to be of service. 
- Do you like to fight? 
- Yes, sir. 
You like to fight. Okay, well, 
I want you to meet the warrior elite. SEALS. 
Yup. Sea, Air and Land. 
Well, I'm not much for the water, sir. No? Well, this ain't for the faint-a-heart. Most men, they wash out, they quit. Well, I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit. This is where the fun stops! 
Take it, girls. 
It's gonna get harder from here on out. That's it. Take it. Take it. 
Only hurts the first time. 
What we got here? You a quitter, boy? - Hooyah, no, Instructor Rolle. 
- Bullshit! Your ass is fleet meat... ...if I ever did see it! 
Don't turn away from me, son. 
You look at me and you take this shit. Hooyah, yes! 
You old as fuck! You join the Navy because you had such a good goddamn time on Noah's ark? 
Page 6/54
How old are you, boy? 
- Hooyah, 30! 
-30?! 
Your fart dust could've fathered half these boys! 
We gonna weed through the quitters. Yeah, we gonna find us 
a goddamn warrior or two today. Dauber, you sure you from Connecticut? I ain't never met no hick 
from Hartford before. 
Hooyah, Instructor Friday. 
Country's countrywide. 
I came here to kill terrorists. Who the fuck told your ass to giggle? Hooyah, no one, Instructor Rolle! - Did I ask you to open up your mouth? Hooyah, no, Instructor Rolle. 
Look at your fat, pasty, giggly ass. Damn, son. 
You a big Dr. Pepper, 
Cheeto-eating motherfucker! 
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about. Biggles! That's your name 
from now on, sunshine. 
And that's your ticket home. 
"D"! What are you still doing in my line trying to make this team? Everybody knows black guys don't swim. It's all right, sir. I'm not black! - No? 
- No, I'm the new black. 
We run slow, we jump low, we swim good and we shop at Gap. 
And I make the white folk proud when I hose down their ladies. I dick them down! 
Chicken! 
There it is. 
That is a quitter. 
You say goodbye, I say good riddance. He quits on you here, 
he gonna quit in the field of battle. When shit gets hairy, he won't step up. 
Page 7/54
Your ass gets shot, he won't pull you out. Six. 
I'm looking for warriors! 
- Seven. 
- Keep counting! 
- Eight! 
- I can't hear you! 
Nine! 
Want me to call your mama? 
Maybe she can come and take your place! This is foreplay! 
I'm about to turn on some Marvin Gaye and get in that ass! 
That's what I'm talking about! 
Squirrel, Squirrel, Squirrel, 
where the fuck are your nuts? 
Oh, they're gone for good, sir. 
They crawled back up inside. 
But they are warm! 
Big talk from a little man! 
Now, you. 
How about you, old man? Huh? 
How you feeling? 
Hooyah! Dangerous. Feeling dangerous. Hooyah! Kyle's feeling dangerous! Move! 
Take seats! 
Yeah! 56 degrees! So fresh, so clean! Here she comes! 
Mother Nature's got something for you! Only a few more hours 
and you're Navy SEALs! 
Grease gun, dive knife by my side TONY". 
These are the tools that'll make a man die These are the tools that'll make a man die I'm the only one who's hit one, so... Boom! 
Oh, yeah! Chris, your turn, man. - You got one more. 
I got one more? All right. 
All right. One more. Here we go. Hey, we want a smaller target 
we'll use your arm, man. 
Page 8/54
Hello. 
Hi. 
How you doing? 
Good. Thank you. 
Can I get you a drink? 
Will a drink make you 
six inches taller and charming? Will it make you not married? 
I'm not ma 
Yeah, I just watched you 
take your ring off, okay? 
Don't be a scumbag. Go home. 
Oh, my God. 
It may have been the leather pants. Oh, yeah? 
What kind of pants does a girl 
have to wear to be left alone? 
Well, maybe corduroy. 
I mean, is that how it is with you guys? You're suddenly single after three beers? Oh, no, after three beers 
all I know is to get a fourth. 
That's great. That's great. 
Real redneck. 
- Oh, I'm not a redneck, I'm from Texas. - Mm. 
What's the difference? 
Well, we ride horses... 
...and they ride their cousins. 
What do you do for work? 
You're obviously military. 
Oh, uh, I polish dolphins. 
They're in captivity. 
What I do is just sort of scrape off the crustaceans 
Do I look stupid to you? 
No, honestly, you look a little sad. Am I tall enough to buy you a drink? Not until you tell me what you do. Okay, how about this. Hey, Greg? Get two shots? 
How about we do a shot for a question. Every time you ask me a question that I answer, do a shot. 
Page 9/54
- Same, vice versa. 
- Game on. 
You can leave the bottle too. 
Okay, shoot. 
All right. Ahem. 
You're obviously military. 
What branch? 
I just finished BUD/S, 
heading to sniper school. 
Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL? Yes, ma'am. 
That's two questions. 
- Shit. 
- Ha, ha. 
Really? 
Oh, I didn't really mean 
you had to do that. Heh. 
Okay. Shit. 
I know all about you guys. 
My sister was engaged to a SEAL. - Oh, was she? 
- Yeah. 
- Mm. 
- Mm-hm. 
Hold on, how you know all about us? What do you mean? 
What I mean is, you're a bunch 
of arrogant, self-centered pricks... ...who think you can lie and cheat and do whatever the fuck you want. I'd never date a SEAL. 
Wait, why would you say I'm self-centered? I'd lay down my life for my country. Why? 
It's the greatest country on Earth. I'd do everything I can to protect it. Look, I'm sorry what happened 
to your sister, but that's not me. It's nice to meet you. 
Where you going? 
Just gonna go home because 
you said you wouldn't date a SEAL, so... I said I'd never marry one. 
Oh. Okay. Well, then, maybe, hello. Page 10/54
Nice to meet you. 
- What's your name? 
- Taya. 
Taya. 
Chris. I'm Chris Kyle. 
Nice to meet you. 
Pleasure. 
I mean, it's pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all. Isn't it, Chris? Well, our BUD/S office commander said that it's three 
0K8)'- 
He said there's three things we gotta 
worry about: 
Well... 
...it sounds like you're under attack. You're pretty. 
You're so beautiful. 
HeY- I got you. 
I'm not going home with you, 
so don't even think about it. 
Feel breath filling every cell in your body. This is our ritual. 
We master our breath, 
we master our mind. 
Pulling the trigger 
will become an unconscious effort. 
You will be aware of it, 
but not directing it. 
And as you exhale, 
find your natural respiratory pause... ...and the space between heartbeats. Hey, this is Taya. [can't get to the phone. - Leave a message. I'll call you back. Hey, it's me again. 
That guy whose shoes you puked on. 
So, yeah, I was thinking maybe 
you didn't get that last message? 
The last message I left 
or the one before that? 
- So I figured that- 
- You figured what? 
Hey. How are you? How you been? 
Page 11/54
Good. 
Good. Wow, what are you up to? 
Not a lot. You? 
No, just excited to talk to you. 
Aim small, miss small. 
If you aim for a shirt button, 
you might miss by two inches. 
If you aim for a shirt, 
you might miss by two feet. 
You better close those groupings, Kyle. Yes, sir. 
Come on. Whoo! 
Not bad. 
- What do we get for that? 
Top shelf. 
I like that one. The brown one. 
- Here you go. 
- Great. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you, sir. Have a good day. Hello. 
Good. That looks good on you. 
So did you always want to be a soldier? Oh. Uh, no, I wanted to be a cowboy, but... I don't know. I did that. 
I thought I was meant for something more. So you started rescuing girls from bars? - I think I rescued that bar from you. - Ha, ha. 
You like country music? 
Only when I'm depressed. 
How about kids. You want kids? 
Yeah, someday. 
My mom says I have a nose 
for picking the wrong men. 
Well, that's a shitty thing to say to a girl. Well, I've proven her right. 
Them wrong picks put you here... 
...made you who you are. 
I like who you are. 
You ever think about what happens when there's a real person on the end of that gun? I don't know. I just hope 
I can do my job when that day comes. Page 12/54
Are we looking at the same target? 
You're spitting dust. 
And don't worry. We can always use 
corpsmen for the guys who can't shoot. Oh, fuck. 
You're trembling. 
I know it. 
- We don't have to do this. 
- No, I want to. I do. 
- Yeah? 
- You just feel real and it scares me. You got your off-eye shut? 
Well, if I close my off-eye 
then I can't see what's out there. 
- There's nothing out there but the target. - Negative, sir. There is something out there. Punch it. 
Will pushups help? 
Give me 50, Kyle. Clear and safe. 
I'm better when it's breathing. 
Oh, my God. Chris. 
- What's wrong? 
- No! 
Here's the tape. 
You see the first plane coming in 
from what looks like the east side. And it goes into the building 
with the flames... 
...and the smoke billowing out 
the other side of the tower. 
It's hard for me to tell exactly which is the north side and which is the south side. It appears it's coming out 
of the north side. 
And then, moments ago, 
these incredible images. 
I believe that's the first one. 
That's the south tower collapsing. 
It almost looks like one of those implosions of buildings that you see... 
...except there is nothing controlled about this. This is devastation. 
You hardly even know me. 
I know enough. 
Page 13/54
You are a package deal, babe. 
What are you so afraid of? 
Nothing. 
Everything, I don't know. 
What if it doesn't work out? 
We're gonna get married 
and then we're gonna start a family. You got it all planned out, don't you? I'm done. 
I love you. 
You're gonna need a ring if you 
wanna talk all tough like that. 
0K8)'- 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
Mr. and Mrs. Chris Kyle! 
- What the hell is on your neck? 
- Hm? 
Your neck. You got, like, 
green paint all over you. 
Would you believe me, babe, 
if I told you... 
...that I had an IV and I was 
all green about two hours ago? 
What? 
It's a package deal, babe. 
Oh, my God. 
Come here, you. 
Cheers to that. 
What's the word, chief? 
Just got the call, boys. 
It's on! 
Hooyah! Ha-ha-ha. 
Shots! 
Yeah! Whoo! 
- Only six weeks, baby. 
- I'm so afraid, baby. 
That's what they say. 
You got nothing to be afraid of. 
It's all part of the plan. 
Your heart is beating out of your chest. That's just because I'm not 
the only one who's going to war, that's all. Welcome to Fallujah. 
The new Wild West of the old Middle East. Page 14/54
AQI put a price on your heads, and now extremists from around the globe... ...are flooding the borders to collect on it. You snipers, you're gonna be paired with a Marine to watch your back... ...and inserted along the main road to do oven/vatch for 1st Marines going door to door. Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs. 
The city has been evacuated. 
Any military-age male 
who is still here... 
...is here to kill you. 
Let's bring these boys in safe 
and get our asses back home. 
Out of my truck! Out, out, out! 
I'd keep that head down, Tex. 
Muj got snipers, too, you know. 
A sniper won't aim for your head. 
Man, they got this one sniper that's been hitting headshots from 500 yards out. They call him Mustafa. 
He's in the Olympics. 
They got sniping in the Olympics now? Hold on, I got a woman and a kid, 
200 yards out, moving towards the convoy. Her arms aren't swinging. 
She's carrying something. 
She's got a grenade. She got a RKG 
Russian grenade she just handed to the kid. You say a woman and a kid? 
You got eyes on this? Can you confirm? Negative. You know the R.O.E. Your call. Man, they fry you if you're wrong. 
They send your ass to Leavenworth. 
Fuck, that was gnarly. 
Fucking evil bitch. 
Nice shooting. Hell of a call. 
Roger. Good looking out, Navy. 
- Fuck, you hear that, man? 
- Get the fuck off me. 
Where is everybody? 
- We're just picking our dicks. 
- We're training those fucking Haji soldiers. Page 15/54
- Hey, why aren't you out there? 
Well, I have the shits. 
What... 
...from reading a comic book? 
It's a fucking graphic novel, man. It's a big difference. 
I heard you were on fucking fire out there. Marc Lee came in, 
said you popped your cherry. 
Is that right? 
There was a kid 
who barely had any hair on his balls. Mother gives him a grenade. 
Sends him out there to kill Marines. Dude, that was evil like I never seen before. Yeah, but, hey, man... 
...you know that kid could've taken out, like, ten fucking Marines, right? 
- Yeah, but I killed him. 
- You did your job. 
That's the end of the story. 
Yeah, it's just not how I envisioned that first one to go down. 
Oh! 
Fuck, man. 
What the hell? 
That was your overvvatch, Einstein. You can thank him later. 
Let's move! 
Keep it going. 
Keep it going. 
Hurry up. 
Contact! Front disperse! 
Cease fire! 
Whoa. 
Eyes on the rooftop. 
Keep your eyes up there. 
Breacher up! 
Man down! Man down! 
We need a corpsman over here now. 
Enemy sniper located. 
Approximate grid: 
Quebec-Romeo-155604. 
Smells like piss in here. 
Page 16/54
Yeah, well... 
You covered our asses out there, 
man. Some ballsy shots. 
Uhn. Fuck. They were clean, right? Hell, yeah, they were. 
Fucking sniper went right up our ass. I already chewed out security detail. Won't happen again. 
It better not happen again. 
There's a hot spot 400 meters out. I'm gonna go write up 
some shooter statements. 
How many did you get? 
I got six 
Well, that's not true. I got eight... ...but they dragged two off. 
You got six? 
- Yeah, why? What's wrong? 
- Nothing. 
You got more 
than the rest of the snipers combined. Yeah, but they got one of us. 
You can't shoot what you can't see. His wife said he was carrying a Koran. Look, I don't know what a Koran looks like... ...but I can tell you what he was carrying. It was pressed metal, shot 7.62s, 
and it looked just like an AK-47. 
So you tell me what he was carrying. Oh, here he comes. 
Ladies and genitals, listen up! 
We have a legend in our midst. 
Round of applause for the legend. 
There we go. We're so proud of you back home on the range, boy. 
Now, it's been said that the legend here... ...can kill 100 men with one blow. 
Or, no, it was- No, fuck, what was it? It was one blow from a single man. He blew 100 men. 
And he's single. 
And so 
Goddamn it! Shit! 
Oh, shit! 
Page 17/54
Damn, man! 
You want a food fight? 
Come on. Shit. 
Only way to shut you up. 
Have you killed anyone yet? 
That is not the way the call home is supposed to go, babe. 
Don't be weird with me. 
Seriously. 
I want you to tell me everything. Well, there's certain things 
you just can't say over the phone. Okay, you knocked me up, right? And I'm sitting here by myself, literally assembling baby cribs... ...and you can't talk to me? 
That's your big plan? 
You guys almost done over there, yet? I can't stop thinking about that little pink number you wore on our honeymoon. Yeah, it's called a nightgown. 
Yeah. 
And three days? 
Three days is not a honeymoon. 
You know, it was a good three days. I miss you real bad. 
I miss you too. 
Hey, you want me to talk dirty to you? Yeah. 
Hold on. Hold on a second. 
But I got a phone in one hand 
and a gun in the other... 
...so I don't know what I'm gonna do. Well, you're gonna have to decide what's more important, baby. 
You're horny preggers. 
Fat and horny. 
- It's fucking disgusting. 
- Ha-ha-ha. 
If you were 300 pounds, I'd still do you. So romantic. 
How's my boy? 
Nobody said it's a boy. 
I can't wait to see 
Page 18/54
the way you're gonna be with him. How do you know? 
I just know. 
I can sense it. 
I hope you're right. 
Baby, I am right. 
Hey, did your dad get ahold of you? No, I haven't checked my e-mails. Shit. 
Okay, you need to hang up 
and call him, all right? 
Why, what's wrong? 
Fuck, I'm so selfish. 
I wasn't even thinking. 
Taya, what's wrong? 
What happened? 
Your little brother deployed. 
What? What happened to jump school? No, he didn't get in. 
You just hang up and call your dad, okay? What do you mean? Deployed? 
Where is he? 
Over there. 
He's headed to Iraq. 
I'm sorry, honey. 
The man with the blade? 
He's a Jordanian militant. 
He's funded by bin Laden. 
He's trained by bin Laden. 
He is loyal to bin Laden. 
His name... 
...is Zarqawi. 
Now this asshole... 
...is right now the crown prince of al-Qaeda in Iraq. 
His mercenary army, AQI? 
They're 5000 strong. 
Now, these guys 
are not your average shit-kickers. These guys are well-trained, 
they are well-paid... 
...and right now, they are waging the largest urban assault since Vietnam. Zarqawi and his lieutenants, 
Page 19/54
these are our top priority. 
Now, there is only one way 
to root these guys out... 
...and that is to go door to door, 
house to house... 
...until we find them or we find someone 
who will give us their whereabouts. 
So we are going to need to clear 
ten structures an hour... 
...which, I know, is a lot. 
It's aggressive. 
We're gonna be loosening things up 
with air support. 
This is the highest priority target 
we have to date. 
I want this asshole dead or captured. 
Do you understand? 
Are there any questions? 
These Marines keep rushing in 
like they're doing... 
- ...they'll have their asses shot off. 
- They're Marines. 
They don't get the training we do. Half 
these guys were civilians six months ago. 
Let's coach them. I'll show them how guys do it. I'll lead the unit on the street. 
No, we can't do that. 
We need you on overwatch. 
Come on. If I'm on the street, Marc 
House to house is 
the deadliest job here, man. 
- You got some sort of savior complex? 
- I want to get the bad guys. 
If I can't see them, I can't shoot them. 
All these guys? They know your name, 
and they feel invincible with you up there. 
- They're not. 
- They are if they think they are. 
Just keep banging on the long gun. 
We'll let these clogs sniff out Zarqawi. 
You said AQI has a sniper 
in the Olympics... 
...but Iraq hasn't qualified a shooter 
in three games.

Well, that's because Mustafa's not Iraqi. He's from Syria. 
Breacher up! 
Hey, once you all gain entry 
I can't see shit... 
...so take it slow 
and move through your target. 
Understood. 
Fire in the hole! 
Man down! 
You better back him down! 
Oh, fuck this. 
I'm gonna go clear houses with Marines. - You coming? 
- Fuck, no, I'm not coming. 
No, man, I like my life. 
I'd actually like to make it home alive. It's not my job 
to go fucking knocking down doors. Those guys picked the wrong fucking job. I'm not doing that shit. 
All right. 
Well, if I don't see you down there... ...you make sure I don't see you again. - Hey. You all mind if I roll with you? - Hey, man. Any SEAL is cool by me. Breacher up! 
You're the one they're calling the Legend. You got 24 confirmed kills. 
Well, who's counting? 
That's fucking badass. 
Yeah, I heard some motherfucker 
in Bravo's catching up, yo. 
I know y'all are meat-eaters, 
but I know a couple things. 
Simple shit I could show you. Maybe keep us above ground. What do you say? Yeah. All right. 
Right on. 
- Hey, what's that mean, bro? 
- Breacher up. 
Come on! Go! 
Moving. 
Get down! Get down 
Page 21/54
on the ground right now! 
Get your fucking ass down! 
- No, no! 
- He no understand! 
Get down! 
Why are you here?! 
You're supposed to be evacuated. Why are you still here? 
I am Sheikh al-Obeidi! 
- Sheikh alla-who?! Who the fuck are you?! - This my home! I stay! 
I don't give a fuck it's your home! This is a war zone, sir! 
- Sir, please! 
Get that kid down! 
Come on! Let's go! Move it! 
- Found these bitches in the back closet. - You are welcome here. You are my guest! - How many more do you have here?! - But tell the soldiers to come in. This Haji just wants us 
all in here so he can blow us up. - If he see American, he know we speak. Who? 
- Please. 
- Who says talking of us'? 
- Please come in. 
- Who knows we're talking?! 
Who?! 
He come. He 
He very bad. Please. 
- Target secure? 
Target's secure. 
Bring them in. Get your head down on the ground. Hands behind your back. - Now! Move now! 
- Please, please. 
You gonna talk, we'll talk to you. Bring him in the other room. 
If he talks to U.S. soldiers, 
they will come and make examples of them. He? Who's he? Who's he? 
The man who comes they call 
"The Butcher." He's the despaired one. Page 22/54
Son of Shaytan, son of Devil. 
Oh, he's like an enforcer? 
- Yes, enforcer. 
- Number one soldier Zarqawi. 
Zarqawi? Yeah, we'd like to know 
where Zarqawi is. 
Do you know where he is? 
You tell us where he is right now. How can we get him? 
You have information for us 
about Zarqawi, tell us right now. Find The Butcher, you find Zarqawi. He reports to him. 
Okay, well, how do we find him? 
All right, look at me when I'm talking to you. Where do we find him? 
We must understand the risk to them, but he will ask for money. 
He need $100,000. 
You need $100,000? 
I have no proof this guy exists. 
Fatima! 
Hello. 
- This is the proof. 
- Look, I wanna help you out. I do. But I need something. I need 
phone numbers, address, names. 
You have to give me something. 
Sir! First platoon's pinned down. Move out! 
Sheikh, look at me when I'm talking to you. Hey! Look at me! 
I need something. 
I can help you out, sheikh. 
You give me a name, 
and we will take care of it. 
I can promise you that. 
We will give you safety. Tell me right now! - Emile Anafanoos? 
- Amir Khalaf Fanus. 
This is given name of The Butcher. We believe that The Butcher's 
Zarqawi's number two man. 
This is your guy right here. 
Page 23/54
But you don't know his real name. Otherwise, you'd have written it up there. We got several aliases. 
Now, if "Fanus" is legit... 
...we'll go see the sheikh. 
He's asking for 100,000. 
Figures. 
But if he delivers The Butcher, 
he's gonna get it. 
This is Agent Snead, DIA. 
I need a name check 
on an "Amir Khalaf Fanus." 
Yeah, I'll wait. 
If we're gonna go back out there, Team 3 can pull security. 
Won't happen. Head-shed will want contractors if we're humping money. Yeah, I'm here. What do you got? 
All right. Okay. 
Let's go see the sheikh. 
Road kill. 
You know The Butcher 
is Zarqawi's enforcer? 
They say his weapon of choice 
is a fucking drill. 
Went to seminary school 
before I joined the Navy. 
Was close to being a preacher. 
And why didn't you? 
I love to gamble, man. 
I love those dice. 
That's my kind of preacher. 
It's like that now, huh? 
Haven't you heard? I'm the Legend. Hey, babe. 
You were right. The doctor says it's a boy. What? 
It's a boy! 
"'8 a boy?! 
- Hell, yeah, man. Congratulations! - Ha-ha-ha. 
Chris?! 
Down! Grab the money! Get to the truck! Let's go! Let's go! Grab the bag! 
Page 24/54
Grab the bag! 
Chris. 
Go! Get the fuck out of here. 
We'll come back for them. 
Baby? 
I heard one shot. 
Check. Came in at an angle. 
Be 300 or more yards out. 
Oh, my God. 
- You got a bead on him? 
- I got Tango in the window. 
Oh, shit. 
I got eyes on The Butcher. He's got the sheikh's kid on the avenue. Requesting QRF. 
We're being pinned down by sniper fire on approach of high value target. Grid 04536236. Over. 
I'm gonna pop a smoke. I'm gonna secure this building. I'm going to the roof. HOld up! 
Hold. Hold it. 
Go! 
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
Come on, you fucking son of a bitch! Fuck you! 
GRONSKY. 
Jesus Christ, what a fucking mess. You are one dumb son of a bitch, you know that? 
What the hell were you thinking?! You completely failed 
to secure the battlefield. 
I'm shutting this whole thing down pending an inquiry. Get back to base! Hey, we gotta set up a squad 
and pursue him. 
Nope, they're shutting us down. What do you mean? 
Can't leave the wire till 
they figure this shit out. 
Well, he can't just leave us like that. Hey! 
I go home in three weeks! 
Page 25/54
Man, that's gonna be a long three weeks. Hey. 
Hey, baby. 
I thought you were dead. 
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought you were dead. 
I'm not. I'm right here. 
- You all right? 
- Yeah. 
You're the most beautiful thing 
I've ever seen. 
I have an alien growing inside me. And there's a strange man in my bedroom. It's our bedroom. 
Your hands feel different. 
Oh, no. They're my hands. 
- Why am I so fucking nervous? 
- Well, I am too. 
- No, you're not. 
- Yes, I am. 
- You're lying. 
- I swear. 
How do I know some alien in there is not gonna come out and grab me... ...in the middle of the night? 
I'm gonna have to... 
...choke him out. 
It's gonna be okay. 
- Promise? 
- Yeah, of course. 
Why're you so good with me? 
Hey, babe. 
It might be nice to get out. 
You listening to me'? 
- Chris. 
- Huh? 
What do you wanna do today, hon? I thought we could just relax here. Okay, we do that. 
Let's relax. 
What are you doing? 
Putting my foot on you. 
Well, you know that's the way to my heart. I'm coming over. 
Page 26/54
And that looks great. 
Oh, look. 
Look. He's touching his nose. 
- How are you feeling? 
- I'm all right. I just want him out. - I'm tired. 
- It's gonna be any day now. 
I hope so. 
- How about you? How're you feeling? - I'm feeling good. Thank you, ma'am. I imagine it's hard to decompress. Not really. No. 
This is the first time we've left the house. I'm happy to be home. Yeah. 
Here. Slip this on for me, would you? Uh, I think if you wanna check anything out, you may wanna check out these knees. Are you a smoker? 
- No, ma'am. 
- You drink? 
- Only when I'm thirsty. 
It's 170/110. 
Jesus Christ, Chris. 
Is that high? 
Not if you've just had 14 cups of coffee. But for someone who is sitting down, yes. Oh, I appreciate you taking a look at that. I'll look into it. Thank you. 
Will you look into it? 
Yeah. 
You sabotaged me back there. 
What am I supposed to do? You're not talking. You act like it's all okay. - It is okay. I'm fine. 
- You're not fine, Chris, all right? Your blood pressure is, 
like, fucking 170/110. 
Babe, I'm driving down the freeway. It's sunny. It's 72 degrees. I'm fine. There's a war going on. There's people dying. No one's even talking about that. It's like it's not even happening. We're all on our cell phones... 
...living our simple, simplistic lives. Page 27/54
It's not even on the news. 
No one cares. There's a war going on, I'm headed to the mall. 
I'm not supposed to be here. 
It's happening- 
- What's wrong? You okay? 
- It's happening. 
Shit. Okay. I'm gonna go back. 
- You're fucking crazy! You know that? - It's okay. Hey! Shh. Baby, baby. Oh, my God. Baby. 
You look beautiful. 
It's fucking happening. 
Oh, my baby. 
Hey 
Look at your mama. 
- Hi. 
- Hey, pal. 
- Hey. 
- Hey, Dab)'- 
Hey, little guy. 
Hey, baby. 
Hey, little guy. 
Look what we did. Look what we did. Look what we made. Look what we made. The baby's crying. 
I thought you were gonna get him. No, don't bother turning it off. I already watched it. 
Had to make sure you didn't have an Iraqi girlfriend sending you sexy videos. That's a sniper recording his kills. Mustafa. 
He sells that shit on the street. Those are American soldiers. 
That day that we were on the phone, was that him? 
Was it? 
Chris, just talk about it. You're not protecting me by not talking about it. No, I don't want you 
getting that in your head. 
- My imagination is so much worse. - Oh, no, it's not. They're savages. 
Page 28/54
- Chris. 
- Babe, they're fucking savages. It's not about them. 
It's about us. 
What? 
You have to make it back to us. 
Okay? 
Welcome home, chief. 
Colonel Jones is waiting. 
How was the flight? 
- Longer than Christmas. 
- I bet. 
Hey. Can you wait a second? 
All right. Hurry up. 
Hey, grunt! 
Chris? 
Hey, brother! 
- Hi. 
- Ha-ha-ha. 
You all right? You in one piece? I heard you been kicking ass out here. All the guys, that's what they've been saying. That's what they say? 
How you doing? You okay? 
- Shoot, it's good to see you. 
- You're my hero, bro. 
Okay? You always have been. 
Let's go, Kyle! Colonel's waiting. The Legend, huh? 
What happened? You all right? 
Man, I'm gonna miss my ride. 
Hey, what happened? 
I'm just tired, man. 
I'm going home. 
I'm proud of you. 
Dad is too. Dad's proud of you. 
- Fuck this place. 
- Huh? 
What'd you say? 
Fuck this place. 
Chief, we gotta move. Let's go! 
JONES'. 
You made chief. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. 
Page 29/54
Gronski's gone. A lot of top brass are. Running off a new play book now. 
I've studied insurgencies 
for the last decade. 
I know every stone thrown 
since before the first century. 
These wars are won and lost 
in the minds of our enemy. 
Yes, sir. 
That you? 
That's a Crusader cross. Yes, sir. Yeah. 
You're now the most wanted man in Iraq. There's 180,000 on your head. 
Congrats. 
Well, don't tell my wife. 
She might take that number right now. Understand you wanna put together a direct action squad to hunt The Butcher. Yes, sir. 
We got some intel 
indicating his area of operations. I want you to put the fear of God 
into these savages... 
...and find his ass. 
Yes, sir. 
All right, let's go get this motherfucker. - Gonna be a pop quiz before we leave. - Small words next time, Big Legend. - What'd you say? 
- Small words next time 
I'll tell you those stories if you want them. One hell of a PowerPoint, man. 
- Oh, thanks, Biggles. 
Always gotta say something, motherfucker. That Bible of yours, is that bulletproof? What, the one I put in here? 
Yeah. I just never saw you open it. I assumed... 
God, country, family, right? 
You got a God? 
I got a God? You getting weird on me? Growing up in Oregon, we had this 
electric fence around our property. Page 30/54
Us kids would grab onto it 
and see who could hold on the longest. War feels kind of like that. 
Puts lightning in your bones and makes it hard to hold onto anything else. 
Hey, man, you need to sit this one out? I just wanna believe 
in what we're doing here. 
Oh, there's evil here. We've seen it. Yeah. There's evil everywhere. 
Oh, you want these motherfuckers 
to come to San Diego or New York? 
We're protecting more than just this dirt. All right. 
Let's go kill this fucker. 
Bingo. 
It's the building right here. 
Any apartment on the east side 
faces the restaurant. 
In front of me, sir. Go, go, go. 
Clear. 
Other door. 
Get down on the ground. 
Get down on the ground now. 
- Put your hands behind your back. - Okay. 
Target secure. 
I got the window, Chris. 
- Set security, boys. 
Get set up. 
Corner. 
Let's move them in the other room. Y'all ask if he knows him? 
You recognize this guy? 
He says he does not. 
How about you, son? 
You recognize this face? 
You sure? 
All right, well, you make sure you tell them they're not gonna go anywhere until we do. Hey, you keep eyes on that window. Make sure you take pictures 
of anybody coming and going. 
What do we got? 
Page 31/54
Sixteen military-age males have gone in. Sixteen? 
Yeah, they serve more customers 
than a fucking McDonald's. 
Here, check this out. 
Is he still in there? 
I clocked one point of entry. 
He's in there, but it's not gonna be an easy breach. 
Oh, I don't know about that, man. 
Probably see the Legend and just let him right in, you know, big-time celebrity. Ask him to sign their burka. 
- Appear at their child's birthday parties. - Ha-ha-ha. 
Hey, what is your problem? 
I didn't promote myself. 
Yeah, no shit, motherfucker. 
I did that for you. 
You would've never made chief if I had nicknamed you the fucking Myth or some shit. He invites you to join him 
for Eid al-Adha supper. 
He says, on this day, 
everyone has a seat at my table. 
Oh, that's very generous of him. 
That was, like, close, man. 
Have some. Pretty good. 
That's very nice. 
Take a cucumber. 
Take cucumber 
and put it in a tub with vinegar. 
Yeah. 
Stick in cayenne pepper, add a lemon in it... ...and let it soak overnight. 
It's that, just add vodka. 
That's the idea. You wanna get in on it? Let's do it. I'm a ground-floor investor. All right. 
Biggles, you never cooked 
a day in your life. 
Dude, that was the real question. 
That was super real. 
All these random people getting behind us. Page 32/54
Get my father to fall in behind me. Holy shit. 
Squirrel? You want some olives? No, I don't do olives, man. 
Somebody will get on that lamb head? No, no. 
Come on, man. Get some brains! I gotta wash my hands. 
- It's good. 
It's good? 
Hey, man. 
This is good, man. 
Go check that out, Biggles. 
- Stay right here! 
Wait. 
What the fuck?! 
Biggles, help me out here. 
See that, muj? Huh? 
You see that? 
- What the fuck's going on? 
- Bring the Terp in. 
Oh, shit. 
All right. Now you tell him that he's gonna be sent off to detention... ...and the Iraqi courts can decide what to do with him. 
Or he can help us get inside 
that restaurant downstairs. 
You tell him. Say it's his choice. That's it. 
All clear. 
Good, good. Moving. 
Assault team set. 
Green-side security set. 
Package is moving. 
Fifteen meters out. 
Ten meters. 
Five meters. 
He's knocking. 
Hold. 
They're vetting him. 
Lights out, muj. 
Execute. Execute. 
Frag out! Frag out! 
Page 33/54
Aah! 
Anything coming out the back? 
Negative. No movement. 
Oh, shit. 
- "D", take him down. 
Got him. 
Get him down. 
Oh, shit! 
We found a tunnel. Watch your back. Keep your eyes open. 
Contact front! 
Contact! Fall back! 
White-side, all security. White-side. Butcher's on the move. 
Repeat: 
I'm in pursuit. 
Butcher's down. Moving your position. I offered him detention. 
It was his choice. 
Picked the wrong side. 
It's all there is to it. Fog of war. Yo, Chris! 
Fuck them, man. Let's go. 
Shit's getting hairy. 
Armed insurgents are moving this way. We need to make tracks. 
Good job here, chief. 
Want another one or are you good? - Look. What is this? 
You get what it gives you. 
That's how this thing works. 
You don't get that one, 
if that's the one you want. 
I like that. 
That's good. That's strong. 
Chris, your truck's ready. 
- You can move that all you want. Your truck's ready. Impossible. Give me your credit card. 
Okay. Interesting. 
I gave it to you? 
Right. 
- Pick it up off the floor. 
Page 34/54
- See if Chris Kyle's on file? 
Off the floor. 
Make sure you get all of them up. Well, you got one back here. 
Excuse me, sir? 
Uh... 
Are you Chief Chris Kyle? 
Yes, sir. 
My name is Mads. Um... 
We met in Fallujah. You saved my life. I did? 
Yes, sir. 
We were stuck in a house 
until you came in with the 1st Marines. You carried me out. 
Oh, wow. Well, the Marines saved our ass plenty of times. 
- How are you? All right? You holding up? - Great. Yeah. 
I'm just grateful to be alive. 
It hasn't been... 
- It hasn't been easy. 
Oh. 
Well, you know. 
- A lot of guys lost more than just a leg. - Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 
Did you lose some friends? 
Well, that too. 
But I'm talking about the guys that lived. You know, that made it back, 
but they're just not back, you know? - They can't seem to get right. 
- Yeah. 
Mm-hm. 
Why don't you come down to the VA sometime. The guys would love it. They all know who the Legend is. - Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. - Hey, buddy. 
Can I tell you something? 
Your dad? He's a hero. 
That's right. 
He saved my life... 
...and he helped me get back 
Page 35/54
to my little girl. 
So thank you for lending him to us. Okay. 
I wouldn't be here without him. 
My family thanks you for your service. Okay, thank you. All right. 
- Take care of yourself. 
- It's great to see you again. 
- Come down to the VA sometime. 
- Okay. Yeah. 
Grab your little lizard up there. 
- Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
- Have a good day. 
- You have a good day. 
Goodbye. 
All right, let's go meet your sister, bubba. Hey. Some help here? My daughter's crying. That's my daughter over there. 
I think she's crying. Tend to her, please? Excuse me. 
Hey! 
Hey, where you going? 
Hey! 
Hey, would you tend to my daughter, please? 
Hey! 
Hey! Tend to my daughter, please! 
Right now! 
I'm making memories by myself. 
I have no one to share them with. 
Yeah, well, we got our whole lives for that. When does that start? 
Even when you're here, you're not here. I see you. 
I feel you. 
But you're not here. 
I hate the Teams for it. 
I do. 
You're my husband. 
You're the father of my children, but they're the ones that pull you back. Yeah, but, you see, 
they can't wait and we can. 
Page 36/54
If you think this war isn't changing you, you're wrong. 
You can only circle the flame so long. It's true. 
Cadillac 31 actual, we're tailing The Butcher's courier currently on Maryland Street. Over. Hey! Got the ring. 
From where? From here? 
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. 
It's so much cheaper here. 
Dude, you bought it from savages? How do you know it's not a blood diamond? What the fuck do you care, man? 
You've spilled so much blood over here. You're the Legend. 
It's not for a rock. 
Oh, what the fuck ever, man. 
That's just hypocritical. 
Hey, ease up on that. 
Don't get too close. 
Hey, did you tell her 
where you bought it from? 
Fuck no. I'm gonna tell her 
I got that shit from Zales. 
Hey, you still with us, cookie? 
Just a half block back, baby. 
We are wet and ready, Big Giggles. 
You know, "D"... 
...I predict in 20 years, 
we're gonna have a reunion... 
...you'll be married to a dude. 
As long as you can cook and clean. 
Now, there they are. 
Oh, shit. 
Mustafa's got his peepers out. 
This motherfucker 
is Keyser fucking 862e, bro. 
Next time you get a clear shot, 
you try not to miss him, all right? 
Well, I would've gotten him in the alleyway if I didn't have to save your ass. 
So you gonna be my best man? 
Just me? Or is it gonna be 
everybody else too? 
Page 37/54
There's only gonna be one best man, dude. 
Vehicle 1 taking fire. 
- Come on, give me a shot. 
All right. 
- Uhn! 
Biggles, move. 
Clear. 
One on me. 
We got them. 
Vehicle is secure. Two EKA. 
Set security, Chris. 
Nope. 
Rooftop's secure. 
Ahem. Aren't you worried 
that she's gonna take that thing to Zales... ...find out how much you spent? 
Well, no, I wasn't. 
Set security. 
- Now I'm a little worried about it. - You should be. 
What do you mean, 
she can trace the diamond to Zales? I don't think that's gonna 
You okay, buddy? You're all right. Got a man down. Biggles is down. 
Northwest corner. 
Rooftop. 
Hang in there, bud. 
I need a corpsman right now! 
Okay, bubba. We're gonna pick you up. I'm gonna take you downstairs. 
I can walk. 
There we go. 
Let's get him in the Humvee. 
Taking off. 
I got him. I got him. 
Get in. Hang in there, Biggles. 
Fuck. 
Hang in there, Biggles. 
Hang in, Biggles. 
- It's okay. 
- Shit, I'm sorry, man. 
For what? 
Page 38/54
What are you sorry for? 
It's my fault we went on that roof. Am I gonna die? 
Fuck no, Biggles. 
You're a fucking frogman. 
Frogmen don't fucking die. 
Gonna put some sand in this fucking cut, get you a fucking canteen of water. You're gonna be fucking fine. 
Hang in there. 
Hey, Chris. You make sure 
she gets that ring, all right? 
Sure will. 
Let's increase suction. 
The retractor, please. 
More blood. 
How long before we get film? 
We need another unit of blood. 
Got that. 
Saline, now. 
More suction. 
Hold your hand right here. 
Type and cross. 
Get it up. I need those numbers now. Did you see where it came from? It was more than 1000 meters out. Only one enemy sniper 
could've made that shot. 
Will he make it? 
Took a round off the feed tray cover of his 48. 
Doesn't look good. 
That's the first SEAL hit, sir. Fuck! 
Shi'a cab driver we source is saying there's a stronghold seven doors down. Marine units covered your exfil are still engaged there. 
I can understand if you want 
to stand down and regroup. 
It's up to you.

Lex talionis. 
Eye for an eye.

We're going back out.

Marc's gone, bro. 
I got One Sierra down. 
I need a CASEVAC immediately. 
We gotta fucking move him.

"Glory is something some men chase... ...and others find themselves 
stumbling upon... 
...not expecting to find it. 
Either way, it is a noble gesture that one... ...finds bestowed upon them. 
My question is 
when does glory fade away... 
...and become the wrongful crusade? Or an unjustified means... 
...by which consumes one completely? I've...

...and I've seen...

Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago. Did he say any of that to you? 
Chris, I wanna know 
what you thought of his letter. 
An AQI informant had called in a tip... ...and Biggles had just been shot. 
We were operating out of emotion, 
and we just walked right into an ambush. But that's not what killed him. 
That letter did. That letter killed Marc. I mean, he just let go, 
and he paid the price for it. 
Sign in here? 
Hey, buddy. 
- Hey, Chris? 
- Yeah. 
- Where you at? 
- I'm right here. Right here. 
- Oh, shit. You're blind as a bat. - Yeah, it fucking blows. 
- They say they're gonna fix my face, though. - Oh, thank God. 
About time. Your face needs some fixing. It's too soon, man. 
It's too soon? 
Way too soon. 
Hey, I heard you proposed. 
- Yeah. 
- Well, good for you. 
Page 41/54
You didn't tell her 
you bought that diamond- 
- You told her you bought it at Zales, right? - No. 
- You didn't? 
- No. 
No, got a new one. 
It's a smaller one. 
Her dad helped me out with it. 
Oh, nice. 
- Oh, good. 
- Mm-hm. 
She wouldn't leave me, bro. 
I told her to go, and she wouldn't leave. She's getting a raw fucking deal. 
Why would you say that? 
Don't say that. She's got you. 
All two inches of you. 
Two inches. 
Yeah, you know, I'm glad 
this happened to me and not you. 
Ain't no way you could've handled it. Yeah, you're probably right. 
So they say you're the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history. 
Oh, is that right? 
That's what I heard. 
Them bad guys ended up in Sadr City. You're not going back. 
We are. We'll wall them in 
and hunt them down. 
- Come on. You don't have to do that. - We have to do that. 
You're my brother... 
...and they're gonna fucking pay 
for what they did to you. 
Hooyah, Legend. 
Fucking hooyah. 
Something happens to me... 
...you'd be all right. 
You'd find someone else. 
Do you wanna die? 
Is that what it is? 
No. 
Page 42/54
Then just tell me. 
Tell me why you do it. 
- Oh, come on. 
- I wanna understand. 
Babe, I do it for you. 
I do it to protect you. 
- No, you don't. 
- Yes, I do. 
I'm here. Your family is here. 
Your children have no father. 
- Yeah, well, I have to serve my country. - Such fucking bullshit! 
No, it's not. 
You don't know when to quit. 
You did your part. We've sacrificed enough. You let somebody else go. 
Let somebody else go? 
- Babe, I couldn't live with myself if I did. - Yeah, well, you find a way. 
You have to. 
Okay, I need you to be human again. I need you here. 
Baby, I need you here. 
If you leave again... 
...I don't think we'll be here 
when you get back. 
Come here. 
Hey, Chris. 
Oh, man. 
We've been shot off position 
three nights in a row, man. 
Fallujah was bad. Ramadi was worse. This shit is fucking biblical, Chris. Is there any other Punishers here? Squirrel cycled out. 
And Dauber was coming back, 
but his wife knocked him up. 
And if I bring home another rug, my wife'll murder my motherfucking ass, Chris. - Teams and shit, right? 
- Teams and shit. 
Man, that Biggles news hit hard, man. I went to see him in the hospital 
before I left. 
Page 43/54
Motherfucker can't see shit. 
Biggles is gone, Chris. 
He was in surgery yesterday... 
...and he died on that table. 
Hey, this is Taya. 
I can't get to the phone, 
so please leave a message. 
It's me... 
...just calling to hear your voice. I'm missing you GUYS 
Been thinking about some things you said. Tell the kids I love them. 
I love you too. 
Don't pick it up. 
Don't you fucking pick it up. 
Son of a bitch. 
Fucking drop it. 
Drop it, you little cocksucker. 
All right, listen up. 
The head-shed believe 
this T-wall here will help... 
...win the war by trapping 
the remaining AQI behind it. 
Problem is the engineers 
building the thing are getting picked off... - ...by a sniper from deep behind the wall. - How deep? 
Roughly 1000 meters. 
- Is it Mustafa? 
- Mu-who? 
I don't know, dude. 
Sniper who killed 
our fucking friend, Biggles. 
He can be whoever the fuck you need him to be. We just need him dead. 
We'll shuttle you six blocks north into enemy territory which will put you... ...right under the sniper's nose 
when he takes his shot. 
In the middle of a fucking sandstorm? Bring your fucking goggles, Bambi. We need to shut this shooter down. Understood? Gear up. 
Yes, sir. 
Page 44/54
- Yes, sir. 
- Yes, sir. 
Clear. 
We're maneuver. You're base. 
Go. 
Go! 
Clear. 
Moving. 
Go! GO! 
All clear. 
Set security. 
The streets are crawling. 
Hold your fire. 
Enter the fucking sandman. 
Stay down! 
Sniper! 
Shit! 
Shot came from the east! 
We set up in the wrong fucking direction. Doesn't matter. Hold your fire. We got uglies right below us. 
I got something 1900 yards out. Fuck, he can't even see that far out. Hold your fire. You'll expose us all. He's right, Legend. No bueno. 
Correction. It's 2100 yards out. That's more than a mile. 
Impossible shot, Chris. 
It's him. 
This is Task Unit Bruiser. I got eyes on target. Initiate QRF. Over. 
Copy that. ET on 
Quick Reaction Force is 2O minutes out. He has eyes on our guys. 
Can you confirm it's him? 
It's him. 
Oh, it's him. 
It's your call, Chris. 
Quick Reaction Force is 2O minutes out. You'll stand the fuck down! If you got it, take it, man. 
Aim small, miss small. 
Do it for Biggles. 
You just fucked us, Legend. 
Page 45/54
Tango down. 
We need QRF ASAP! 
Mission accomplished. 
He had eyes on our guys. 
And I took him out. 
Yeah. And now we're fucked 
like a football bat! 
Biggles would be proud. 
You did it, Chris. 
Echo 7 Kilo, be advised you have 
enemy approaching all directions of your pos. White-side! Goddamn it, Legend. Fuck! Yeah, let's go. Come on. 
All right, I see two ways up on the roof. Now, we wanna lock both staircases. Conserve ammo. 
Get some, motherfuckers. 
Echo 7 Kilo, you have 
Tango-heavy gun on your green-side. RANGER". 
We're taking effective fire white-side! Effective fire, white-side! 
Oh... Whew. 
I'm down to two mags. We gotta move! Don't stop fucking shooting, man! 
QRF's stuck three blocks out. 
I'm out! 
-3 o'clock. Loading last mag. 
SOLDER". We're pushing air. 
RANGER". Only got one mag left! 
GUNNER'. 
I'm black! I'm black! 
Anybody got a mag?! 
D". We can't hold them any longer! We gotta move! 
Those guys are sitting ducks. 
- I don't wanna get dragged in the street. - That's it. Do it. 
Call it in. 
This is Rio 2 Bravo 
requesting ordnance drop. 
Grid number 04837959. 
That target location is your position. - I know my fucking position. 
Page 46/54
- They're right on top of us. Just drop it! - Viper 34, move to final attack heading. Viper 34. Roger. 
Thirty seconds out. 
Hello? 
Baby? 
Chris?! 
Baby, I ca- Baby, I can't hear you. Hello? 
I'm ready. 
I'm ready to come home. 
What? 
I have the building in sight. 
What's happening? 
I'm ready to come home, baby. 
Chris? 
Pretty bad air up here. 
I can't hold this much longer. 
Tell the pilot "turn it loose." 
Viper 34. Fire away. 
Target missed. 
Shit. 
We need to exfil now! 
Let's go! Let's move! 
We gotta move! 
Echo 7 Kilo, 
green-side is clear for exit. 
I got the out. Green-side pole on my go! Down the roof! 
Let's go! 
Last man! 
Get to the trucks! 
Go! Go! Go! 
Come on! Inside! 
That's one! 
Get in now! Gotta go! 
Come on! We gotta go! Now! 
Shit! Let me on! 
Come on. Let me on. 
- Where's Chris? 
What? 
He was just behind me. 
Where is Chris, man? 
Open the fucking door! 
Page 47/54
Stop the goddamn rig! 
Chris, come on! 
Come on, you squid! 
We can't leave you! Come on, Chris! Grab my hand! 
Grab his hand, "D"! Come on! 
Pull him in now! 
We gotta go! Now! 
Come on, Legend! Get in here! 
Come on, Chris! Pull! 
Yeah? 
Hey, it's me. 
I just got this weird message that you were on a plane or something? Yeah. Yeah, I got out early. 
You did? 
So, what, are you in Germany, or-? Where? 
No, I'm here. 
I'm stateside. 
You're home? 
What are you doing? 
I guess I just needed a minute. 
Chris, the kids are dying to see you. It's been nine months. What-? 
I'm coming home. 
Are you all right? 
Yeah, I'm good. 
Babe, come home. Okay? 
You know, we miss you. 
0K8)'- 
Hey, Chris? 
Babe. 
Hon, I'm going outside. 
- Get it! 
Higher. 
Look at you. 
I can see your face again, babe. 
- Looks good. 
- Well, good. 
Looks different. 
So the game's this Saturday. 
You know, he's the tallest kid on the team. Doctor said he could be 6'4". 
Page 48/54
- Isn't that insane? 
- Mm. 
Can't wait for you to see him play. I go crazy when the other kids jump on him. I need you there as, like, 
a leveler, you know what I mean? 
Hey, maybe you could even coach, 
you know? 
'Kenna's gonna lose that tooth. 
I'm so worried she's gonna swallow it, like, in her sleep or something. 
And she said she'd let you pull it, but only you. Would you do that? 
Chris! 
You know, I got a very interesting phone call. It's from your wife. 
She told me about the barbecue. 
Yeah, that was unfortunate. Yeah. Things seem like they got 
a little out of hand. Are you worried? No, sir. 
So you're not worried about what 
happened, or what might happen? 
No, sir, I'm not worried about that. Let me ask you a question, Chris. How much time did you spend in-country? Uh, well, four tours, so... 
That's like, what, 1000 days? 
Yeah, sounds about right. 
Would you be surprised if I told you that the Navy has credited you... - ...with over 160 kills? 
- Mm. 
Do you ever think... 
...that you might have seen things or done things over there that you wish you hadn't? Oh, that's not me. No. 
What's not you? 
I was just protecting my guys. 
They were trying to kill our soldiers... ...and I'm willing to meet my Creator and answer for every shot that I took. The thing... 
...that haunts me are all the guys Page 49/54
that I couldn't save. 
You know, I'm willing and able 
to be there but I'm not. I'm here. I quit. So you wish you could've 
saved more guys? 
Yes, sir. 
You know, you can walk down any hall in this hospital. 
We got plenty of soldiers need saving. Mm-hm. 
Wanna take a walk? 
Sure. 
All right. 
I wanna show you something. 
I still smoke, but can't be too mad at it because it kind of saved my right hand. How so? 
When I got blown up, I had both of my hands on the bottom of the steering wheel. And right before the explosion went off, I took my hand off... 
...grabbed a cigarette, 
stuck it in my mouth. 
When I went to go light it, 
the explosion happened. 
And it took the whole bottom of the steering wheel and my left hand off. And I was lucky that I had this. I mean, it still fucked up my right hand, but... 
Yeah. 
- I still got it. 
And you still smoke? 
Yeah, I still smoke. 
Miss. Three inches to the right. Come on, Wynn. 
You can do better than that. 
Bring this to the right. 
Make sure you keep both eyes open. Let that trigger surprise you. 
We're not shooting bad guys, 
we're shooting paper. 
How about the Legend stops 
trying to fuck up my shot? 
Page 50/54
How about you hit one? 
- Hit! 
There you go. 
Bull's-eye, boy. 
Damn, if that don't feel like 
I got my balls back. 
Why you spending 
all this time with us, man? 
I know you got a family. 
I heard you had a boot collection before the war? 
I saw we were about the same size. Seriously, man. 
Why do you do it? 
Well, we take care of each other, right? Let's see if you can't hit two in a row. Come on, man. You got this. 
- Hit! 
- Nice. 
- Hit! 
- Whoo! 
Goddamn. 
Who's the legend now? 
That's a title you don't want. 
Trust me. 
Yo, will you hop down? 
I'll give them to you. 
- You got one more? 
- Yeah. 
- All right, take them inside. 
- All right. 
Come here. Tsk, tsk, tsk. 
It's not a bad life out here, is it? Got a smile on his face. 
Looks cheery to me. 
Just doing his thing. 
Wave goodbye to him. 
Oh! Fuck, who is that?! 
Oh, babe, is that you? 
Yep-a-doo-dew.! 
Baby, I fucking hurt myself. Shit. - What? 
- No, I'm all right. I'm all right! I'm all right. Fuck. 
Page 51/54
- Baby, I'm sorry. 
- It's okay. 
What happened? 
Don't you-! Ooh! 
You know that it's a heck of thing to stop a beating heart. 
Yeah. 
That's why we're gonna do it together for your first time. 
All right. 
Now remember, you gotta be calm... ...confident... 
...and you never hesitate. 
All right. 
- You got it, bubba? 
- I got it. 
- You feel good? 
- Yeah. 
- Shh. 
- Shh. 
Hands in the air, little lady. - No way. 
- Hands in the air. 
Now, you drop them drawers. 
But you drop them nice and easy. Oh, baby, look at you. 
Look at you. 
Look at you. 
Can I tell you something, Chris? - Tell it to the judge. 
- Stop it. 
No, I am so proud of you, 
and I don't tell you enough. 
I'm so proud of you. 
You're such a great father. 
And I am so happy 
that I've got my husband back. And I also know how hard you fought to get here. 
You're worth fighting for. 
Now tell me one other thing. 
- Did you pleat those jeans? 
- Hm? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Page 52/54
I believe they're right down the middle. - Oh, you're just a regular, old cowboy again. - Mm-hm. That's right. And- 
- Why don't you really drop them drawers. - I'm not wearing any drawers, baby. I got four minutes. 
Ha-ha-ha. Is that all it takes? 
No, it takes two minutes. 
But then I want two minutes to look at you. Aren't you going to the range? 
Who are you taking out? 
This Marine. 
His mama kept asking me. 
She parks cars at the elementary school, and she said, "Can you help out my son?" And I just thought today's the only day I can really do it, so... 
It'll be just a bit of the afternoon. I'll be back. 
Yes! Ha-ha-ha. 
Make sure you keep them drawers 
What's up? 
- Dad, you wanna play "Skylanders"? - No, I can't play right now. 
I'll do it when I get back, boy. 
See you're on Level 8, and that 
doesn't work. I gotta be on Level 4. I wanna win. You gotta let me win. 
No way! 
McKENNA: 
- Poke the what? 
- Poke the bear! 
- Poke the what?! 
Poke the bear! 
- No! You're supposed to roar, like, grr! - Like what? 
- Grr! 
- Like a beast, right? Like what? 
Ooh. All right, bubba. 
- Y'all look after our women, okay? - Yeah. 
Okay. It's a big responsibility. 
You up for it? 
Page 53/54
All right. See you later, baby. - I love you. 
- Love you back. 
How are you? You good? 
- Good. 
We're gonna go about a two-hour drive... ...shoot some guns, maybe have 
a little conversation along the way. All right. Let's go. 
Thank you.

Get up! Get up! 
The winner, by total annihilation... Yama! 
Who is next? 
Who has the guts to step into 
the ring with little yama? 
Yama! 
Can I try? 
I have a robot. I built it myself. Beat it, kid. 
House rules. You gotta pay to play. Is this enough? 
What's your name, little boy? 
Hiro. Hiro hamada. 
Prepare your bot, zero. 
Two bots enter, 
one bot leaves. 
Fighters ready? 
Fight! 
That was my first fight. 
I... can I try again? 
No one likes a sore loser, little boy. Go home. 
I've got more money. 
Fighters ready? 
Fight! 
Mega-bot, destroy. 
What? 
-No more little yama. 
-But, wha... 
This is not possible! 
Hey, I'm as surprised as you are. Beginner's luck. 
Do you want to go again, yama? -No one hustles yama! 
-Whoa. Hey... 
Teach him a lesson. 
Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this. -Hiro! Get on! 
-Tadashi! 
Good timing! 
Oh, mama! 
-Are you okay? 
Page 2/38
-Yeah. 
-Are you hurt? 
-No. 
Then what were you thinking, 
knucklehead? 
You graduated high school 
when you were 13, 
and this is what you're doing? There they are! 
Hey! 
Hold on! 
Yes! 
Get back here. 
Bot fighting is illegal. 
You're going to get yourself arrested. Bot fighting is not illegal. 
Betting on bot fighting, 
that's... that's illegal. 
But so lucrative! 
I'm on a roll, big brother! 
And there is no stopping me! 
Oh, no. 
Hi, aunt cass. 
Are you guys okay? 
Tell me you're okay. 
-We're fine. 
-We're okay. 
Oh, good. 
Then what were you 
two knuckleheads thinking? 
For 10 years, 
I have done the best I could 
to raise you. 
Have I been perfect? No. 
Do I know anything about children? No. Should I have picked up a book on parenting? 
Probably! 
Where was I going with this? 
I had a point. 
-Sorry. 
-We love you, aunt cass. 
Well, I love you, too! 
I had to close up early 
Page 3/38
because of you two felons. 
On beat poetry night. 
Stress eating. Because of you. Come on, mochi. 
This is really good! 
You better make this up to aunt cass before she eats everything in the cafe. For sure. 
And I hope you learned 
your lesson, bonehead. 
Absolutely. 
You're going bot fighting, aren't you? There's a fight across town. 
If I book, I can still make it. When are you gonna 
start doing something 
with that big brain of yours? 
What? Go to college like you? 
So people can tell me stuff 
I already know? 
Unbelievable. 
What would mom and dad say? 
I don't know. 
They're gone. 
They died when I was three, remember? Hey! 
-I'll take you. 
-Really? 
I can't stop you from going, 
but I'm not going 
to let you go on your own. 
Sweet. 
What are we doing at your nerd school? Bot-fight's that way! 
Gotta grab something. 
Is this gonna take long? 
Relax, you big baby. 
We'll be in and out. 
Anyway, you've never seen my lab. Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab! Heads up! 
Electro-mag suspension? 
Hey! 
-Who are you? 
Page 4/38
-I'm... 
Go go, this is my brother Hiro. Welcome to the nerd lab. 
Yeah. 
I've never seen electro-mag 
suspension on a bike before. 
Zero resistance, faster bike. 
But, not fast enough... 
...yet. 
Do not move. Behind the line, please. Hey, wasabi. This is my brother Hiro. Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed. Catch. 
Wow. 
-Laser-induced plasma? 
-Oh, yeah. 
With a little magnetic confinement for ultra-precision. 
Wow. How do you find anything 
in this mess? 
I have a system. 
There's a place for everything, and everything in its place. 
-Need this! 
-You can't do that! 
This is anarchy! Society has rules! Excuse me! 
Coming through! 
Tadashi! 
Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro! I've heard so much about you! 
Perfect timing. Perfect timing. That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide. 400 pounds of it! 
Come here, come here, come here. You're going to love this. 
A dash of perchloric acid, 
a smidge of cobalt, 
a hint of hydrogen peroxide, 
super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and... Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh? It's so pink. 
Here's the best part. 
I know, right? 
Page 5/38
Chemical metal embrittlement. 
Not bad, honey lemon. 
"Honey lemon"? "Go go"? "Wasabi"? I spill wasabi on my shirt 
one time, people. 
One time! 
Fred is the one who comes up 
with the nicknames. 
Who's Fred? 
This guy, right here! 
Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit. This is not my real face and body. The name's Fred. 
School mascot by day, but by night... I am also a school mascot. 
So, what's your major? 
No, no, no, I'm not a student. But I am a major science enthusiast. I've been trying to get 
honey to develop a formula, 
that can turn me into 
a fire-breathing lizard at will. But she says that's "not science." It's really not. 
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray I asked wasabi for 
isn't "science" either. 
-Is it? 
-Nope. 
Well, then, what about 
"invisible sandwich"? 
-Hiro. 
-Imagine eating a sandwich, 
but everybody just thinks you're crazy. Just stop. 
-Laser eyes? 
-What? 
-Tingly fingers? 
-Never gonna happen. 
Hey, what about a growth serum? So, what have you been working on? I'll show you. 
Duct tape? 
I hate to break it to you, bro. Page 6/38
Already been invented. 
Hey! 
Dude! 
Ow! 
This is what I've been working on. Hello. I am baymax. 
Your personal healthcare companion. I was alerted to the need 
for medical attention 
when you said, "ow." 
A robotic nurse. 
On a scale of 1 to 10, 
how would you rate your pain? 
Physical or emotional? 
I will scan you now. 
Scan complete. 
You have a slight epidermal 
abrasion on your forearm. 
I suggest an anti-bacterial spray. What's in the spray, specifically? The primary ingredient is bacitracin. That's a bummer. 
I'm actually allergic to that. You are not allergic to bacitracin. You do have a mild allergy to 
peanuts. 
Not bad. 
You've done some serious 
coding on this thing, huh? 
Programed him with 
over 10,000 medical procedures. This chip is what 
makes baymax, baymax. 
Vinyl? 
Yeah, going for a non-threatening, huggable kind of thing. 
Looks like a walking marshmallow. -No offense. 
-I am a robot. 
I cannot be offended. 
-Hyperspectral cameras? 
-Yep. 
-Titanium skeleton? 
-Carbon fiber. 
Page 7/38
Right. Even lighter. 
Killer actuators. 
Where did you get those? 
Machined them right here, in-house. -Really? 
-Yup. 
He can lift 1,000 pounds. 
Shut up. 
You have been a good boy. 
Have a lollipop. 
Nice. 
I cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care. Well then, I'm satisfied with my care. He's going to help a lot of people. Hey, what kind of battery does it use? Lithium ion. 
You know, supercapacitors 
would charge way faster. 
Burning the midnight oil, Mr. hamada? Hey, Professor. 
Actually, I was just finishing up. You must be Hiro. 
Bot-fighter, right? 
When my daughter was younger, 
that's all she wanted to do. 
May I? 
Sure. 
Magnetic-bearing servos. 
Pretty sick, huh? 
Wanna see how I put 'em together? Hey, genius! 
He invented them. 
You're Robert Callaghan? 
Like, as in, 
the Callaghan-catmull spline, 
and Callaghan's "laws of robotics?" That's right. 
Ever think about applying here? Your age wouldn't be an issue. I don't know. 
He's pretty serious about 
his career in bot-fighting. 
Well, kind of serious. 
Page 8/38
I can see why. 
With your bot, winning must come easy. Yeah, I guess. 
Well, if you like things easy, 
then my program isn't for you. 
We push the boundaries 
of robotics here. 
My students go on to shape the future. Nice to meet you, Hiro. 
Good luck with the bot-fights. 
We gotta hurry if you 
want to catch that bot-fight. 
I have to go here. 
If I don't go to this nerd school, I'm gonna lose my mind. 
How do I get in? 
Every year, the school has 
a student showcase. 
You come up with something 
that blows Callaghan away, you're in. But, it's gotta be great. 
Trust me. 
It will be. 
Nothing! 
No ideas! Useless, empty brain! Wow. Washed up at 14. 
So sad. 
I got nothing! I'm done. 
I'm never getting in. 
Hey, I'm not giving up on you. 
What are you doing? 
Shake things up. 
Use that big brain of yours 
to think your way out. 
-What? 
-Look for a new angle. 
Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today. How are you feeling? 
You're talking to an ex-bot fighter. Takes a lot more than this to rattle me. Yep, he's nervous. 
You have nothing to fear, little fellow. -He's so tense. 
-No, I'm not. 
Page 9/38
Relax, Hiro. 
Your tech is amazing. Tell him, go go. -Stop whining. Woman up. 
-I'm fine! 
What do you need, little man? 
Deodorant? Breath mint? 
Fresh pair of underpants? 
Underpants? You need serious help. Hey, I come prepared. 
I haven't done laundry in six months. One pair lasts me four days. 
I go front, I go back, I go inside-out. Then I go front and back. 
Wow. That is both 
disgusting and awesome. 
Don't encourage him. 
It's called "recycling." 
Next presenter, Hiro hamada. 
Oh, yeah. This is it. 
I guess I'm up. 
Okay, photo, photo! 
Everybody say, "Hiro." 
-Hiro! 
-Yeah! 
We love you, Hiro. Good luck! 
-Don't mess it up. 
-Break a leg, little man. 
Science, yeah! 
All right, bro. This is it. 
Come on. Don't leave me hanging. What's going on? 
I really want to go here. 
Hey. 
You got this. 
Hi. 
My name is Hiro... 
Sorry. 
My name is Hiro hamada, 
and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool. 
I hope you like it. 
This is a microbot. 
Breathe. 
It doesn't look like much, 
Page 10/38
but when it links up 
with the rest of its pals... 
...things get a little more interesting. The microbots are controlled 
with this neural transmitter. 
I think what I want them to do... They do it. 
The applications for this tech 
are limitless. 
Construction. 
What used to take teams 
of people working by hand 
for months or years, 
can now be accomplished 
by one person. 
And that's just the beginning. 
How about transportation? 
Microbots can move 
anything anywhere, 
with ease. 
If you can think it, 
the microbots can do it. 
The only limit is your imagination. Microbots! 
That's my nephew! 
Yes! 
My family! I love my family! 
Nailed it! 
-You did it! 
-Not bad! 
Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude! They loved you. That was amazing! Yes. 
With some development, 
your tech could be revolutionary. Alistair krei! 
May I? 
Extraordinary. 
I want your microbots at krei tech. Shut up. 
Mr. krei is right. 
Your microbots are 
an inspired piece of tech. 
You can continue to develop them, Page 11/38
or you can sell them to a man 
who's only guided 
by his own self-interest. 
Robert, I know how you feel about me, but it shouldn't affect... 
This is your decision, Hiro. 
But you should know 
Mr. krei has cut corners 
and ignored sound science 
to get where he is. 
That's just not true. 
I wouldn't trust krei tech 
with your microbots, 
or anything else. 
Hiro, I'm offering you more money than any 14-year-old could imagine. I appreciate the offer, Mr. krei, but they're not for sale. 
I thought you were smarter than that. Robert. 
Mr. krei. 
That's my brother's. 
That's right. 
I look forward to seeing you in class. Unbelievable! 
That's what I'm talking about. All right, geniuses, 
let's feed those hungry brains. Back to the caf! 
Dinner is on me! 
Yes! Nothing is better than free food! -Aunt cass? 
-Unless it's moldy. 
We'll... we'll catch up, okay? Sure. I'm so proud of you. 
Both of you. 
Thanks, aunt cass. 
I know what you're going to say. "I should be proud of myself," 
"because I'm finally using my gift for something important." 
No, no. I was just gonna tell you your fly was down for the whole show. Ha-ha-hilarious. 
Page 12/38
What? 
Welcome to nerd school, nerd. 
Hey, I, um... 
I wouldn't be here 
if it wasn't for you. So, 
you know, 
thanks for not giving up on me. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah. I'm okay. 
But Professor Callaghan is still in there. Tadashi, no! 
Callaghan's in there. 
Someone has to help. 
Tadashi! 
Tadashi! 
Here. Have some tea. 
Hey, sweetie. 
Hey, aunt cass. 
Mrs. matsuda's in the caf. 
She's wearing something 
super inappropriate for an 80-year-old. That always cracks you up. 
You should come down. 
Maybe later. 
The university called again. 
It's been a few weeks 
since classes started. 
But they said it's not too late to register. Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it. Hey, Hiro. 
We just wanted to check in, 
and see how you're doing. 
We wish you were here, buddy. 
Hiro, if I could have only 
one superpower right now, 
it would be the ability 
to crawl through this camera, 
and give you a big hug. 
Ow! 
Hello. I am baymax, 
your personal healthcare companion. Hey, baymax. 
I didn't know you were still active. I heard a sound of distress. 
Page 13/38
What seems to be the trouble? 
I just stubbed my toe a little. I'm fine. 
On a scale of 1 to 10, 
how would you rate your pain? 
A zero. I'm okay, really. 
Thanks. You can shrink now. 
Does it hurt when I touch it? 
That's okay. No touching. 
I'm fine... 
Ow. 
You have fallen. 
You think? 
-On a scale of 1 to... 
-Ow! 
On a scale... 
On a sca... 
On a scale of 1 to 10... 
On a scale of 1 to 10, 
how would you rate your pain? 
Zero. 
-It is all right to cry. 
-No. No, no, no, no. 
Crying is a natural response to pain. I'm not crying. 
-I will scan you for injuries. -Don't scan me. 
-Scan complete. 
-Unbelievable. 
You have sustained no injuries. However, your hormone 
and neurotransmitter levels 
indicate that you are 
experiencing mood swings 
common in adolescence. 
Diagnosis, puberty. 
What? 
Okay. Time to shrink now. 
You should expect an increase 
in body hair, 
especially on your face, 
chest, armpits, and... 
Thank you! That's enough. 
You may also experience 
Page 14/38
strange and powerful new urges. Okay! Let's get you 
back in your luggage. 
I cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care. Fine. I'm satisfied with my... My microbot? 
This doesn't make any sense. 
Puberty can often be a confusing time for a young adolescent 
flowering into manhood. 
No. The thing is attracted 
to the other microbots, 
but that's impossible. 
They were destroyed in the fire. Dumb thing's broken. 
Your tiny robot 
is trying to go somewhere. 
Oh, yeah? 
Why don't you find out 
where it's trying to go? 
Would that stabilize 
your pubescent mood swings? 
Absolutely. 
Baymax? 
Baymax? 
Baymax? 
What? 
-Hiro? 
-Hey, aunt cass! 
Wow. You're up and... 
Yeah! I figured it was time. 
Are you registering for school? Yes. 
I thought about what you said. Really inspired me. 
Oh, honey, that's so great. 
Okay, 
special dinner tonight. 
I'll whip up some chicken wings. You know, with the hot sauce 
that makes our faces numb. 
-Okay, sounds good. 
-Great! 
Page 15/38
Last hug. 
Baymax! 
-Baymax! 
-Hey! 
Watch it! 
Baymax! 
Baymax! 
Are you crazy? What are you doing? I have found where 
your tiny robot wants to go. 
I told you, it's broken. 
It's not trying to go... 
Locked. 
There is a window. 
Please exercise caution. 
A fall from this height 
could lead to bodily harm. 
Oh, no. 
Excuse me while I let out some air. Are you done? 
Yes. 
It will take me a moment to re-inflate. Fine, just keep it down. 
My microbots? 
Someone's making more. 
Hiro? 
You gave me a heart attack! 
My hands are equipped 
with defibrillators. Clear. 
Stop, stop, stop! It's just an expression. Oh, no. 
Run! 
Oh, come on! 
I am not fast. 
Yeah, no kidding! 
Go! Go! Come on. 
Kick it down! 
Then punch it! 
Go! Go! 
Oh, come on! Go, go, go! 
Move it! 
Come on! 
No, no. 
Come on! The window! 
Page 16/38
Suck it in! 
Baymax! 
Hiro? 
Come on, let's get out of here. Go! Hurry! 
All right, let me get this straight. A man in a kabuki mask attacked you, with an army of miniature flying robots. "Microbots." 
-Microbots. 
-Yeah. 
He was controlling them telepathically with a neurocranial transmitter. So, Mr. kabuki was using esp 
to attack you and balloon man. 
Did you file a report 
when your flying robots were stolen? No. I thought they were all destroyed. Look, I know it sounds crazy, 
but baymax was there, too. 
-Tell him. 
-Yes, officer. 
He's telling the truth. 
What the... what's wrong with you? Low battery. 
Try to keep it together. 
I'm healthcare, 
your personal baymax companion. Kid, how about we call your parents -and get them down here? 
-What? 
Write your name and number down on this piece of paper, and we can... I've gotta get you home 
to your charging station. 
Can you walk? 
I will scan you now. Scan complete. Healthcare. 
Okay. 
If my aunt asks, 
we were at school all day. Got it? We jumped out a window. 
No! Quiet! 
We jumped out a window. 
Page 17/38
You can't say things like that 
around aunt cass. 
Hiro? 
You home, sweetie? 
That's right. 
I thought I heard you. Hi. 
Hey, aunt cass. 
Look at my little college man. 
I can't wait to hear all about it! And wings are almost ready. 
Whee! 
Will you be quiet? 
Yeah, wings! Whee! 
All right, get ready to have 
your face melted. 
We are gonna feel 
these things tomorrow. 
You know what I'm saying? 
Okay. 
Sit down. Tell me everything. 
The thing is that, 
since I registered so late, 
I've got a lot of school stuff 
to catch up on. 
What was that? 
Mochi. 
That darn cat. 
At least take a plate for the road, okay? -Don't work too... 
-Thanks for understanding. 
Hairy baby. Hairy baby. 
All right, come on. 
I'm healthcare, 
your personal baymax companion. One foot in front of the other. This doesn't make any sense. 
Tadashi. 
What? 
Tadashi. 
Tadashi's gone. 
When will he return? 
He's dead, baymax. 
Tadashi was in excellent health. With a proper diet and exercise, 
Page 18/38
he should have lived a long life. Yeah, he should have. 
But there was a fire and... 
Now, he's gone. 
-Tadashi is here. 
-No. 
People keep saying 
he's not really gone. 
As long as we remember him. 
It still hurts. 
I see no evidence of physical injury. It's a different kind of hurt. 
You are my patient. 
I would like to help. 
You can't fix this one, buddy. 
What are you doing? 
I am downloading 
a database on personal loss. 
Database downloaded. 
Treatments include contact 
with friends and loved ones. 
I am contacting them now. 
No, no, no! I... don't do that. 
Your friends have been contacted. Unbelievable. 
Now, what are you doing? 
Other treatments include 
compassion and physical reassurance. I'm okay. Really. 
You will be all right. There, there. Thanks, baymax. 
I am sorry about the fire. 
It's okay. It was an accident. 
Unless... 
Unless it wasn't. 
At the showcase, 
that guy in the mask 
stole my microbots. And... 
And then set the fire to cover his tracks. He's responsible for tadashi. 
We gotta catch that guy. 
It's alive! 
It's alive, it's alive! It's alive! If we're gonna catch that guy, 
Page 19/38
you need some upgrades. 
Will apprehending the man in the mask improve your emotional state? 
Absolutely. 
Let's work on your moves. 
Now, let's take care of this. 
I have some concerns. 
This armor may undermine 
my non-threatening, huggable design. That's kind of the idea, buddy. You look sick. 
I cannot be sick. I am a robot. It's just an expression. 
Data transfer complete. 
I fail to see how karate makes me a better healthcare companion. You want to keep me healthy, 
don't you? 
Punch this. 
Yes! Hammerfist! 
Side kick! 
Knifehand! 
Back kick! 
Gummy bears! 
Yes! 
Yeah! Fist bump! 
"Fist bump" is not in 
my fighting database. 
No, this isn't a fighting thing. It's what people do sometimes 
when they're excited or pumped up. Hey, now you're getting it. 
I will add "fist bump" 
to my care-giving matrix. 
All right. Let's go get that guy. Come on! 
Get him, baymax! 
We're too late. 
Your tiny robot 
is trying to go somewhere. 
Come on. 
Always wait one hour after eating before swimming. 
Hey! 
Page 20/38
Come on! 
Your heart rate has 
increased dramatic... 
Okay, baymax, 
time to use those upgrades. 
-Hiro? 
-No, no, no! 
Get out of here! Go! 
Dude, what are you doing out here? Nothing! Just out for a walk. 
Helps my pubescent mood swings. Is that baymax? 
Yeah, but you really... 
Why is he wearing 
carbon fiber underpants? 
I also know karate. 
You guys need to go. 
No, don't push us away, Hiro. 
We're here for you. 
That's why baymax contacted us. Those who suffer a loss, 
require support 
from friends and loved ones. 
Okay, but I... 
Who would like 
to share their feelings first? I'll go. Okay. 
My name is Fred, and it has 
been 30 days since my last... 
Holy mother of megazon! 
Am I the only one seeing this? Oh, my gosh! Oh, no! 
Go! 
Baymax, get him! 
No, no, no, no, no! What are you doing? I'm saving your life. 
Baymax can handle that guy! 
Oh, no. 
Wasabi! 
Goodbye! 
Hiro. Explanation. Now. 
He stole my microbots. 
He started the fire. 
I don't know who he is! 
Page 21/38
Baymax, palm-heel strike! 
Hard left! 
That mask, the black suit... 
We're under attack 
from a super villain, people! 
I mean, how cool is that? 
I mean, it's scary, obviously. But how cool! 
Why are we stopped? 
The light's red! 
There are no red lights in a car chase! Why is he trying to kill us? 
Why are you trying to kill us? It's classic villain. 
We've seen too much! 
Let's not jump to conclusions. We don't know he's trying to kill us. Car! 
He's trying to kill us! 
Did you just put your blinker on? You have to indicate your turn! It's the law! 
That's it. 
Stop the car! 
Baymax and I can take this guy! Seatbelts save lives. 
Buckle up, every time. 
What are you doing? 
What are you doing? 
What are you doing? 
What are you doing? 
-Did we lose him? 
-Look out! 
Baymax, hold on! 
-We're not gonna make it! 
-We're gonna make it! 
-We're not gonna make it! 
-We're gonna make it! 
-We're not gonna make it! 
-We're gonna make it! 
We made it! Yes! 
I told you we'd make it! 
Your injuries require my attention. And your body temperatures are low. 
Page 22/38
We should get out of here. 
I know a place. 
Where are we? 
Fred. 
Where are you going? 
Welcome to mi casa. 
That's French for "front door." 
It's really not. 
Listen, nitwit. 
A lunatic in a mask just tried to kill us. I'm not in the mood for any... 
Welcome home, master Frederick. 
Heathcliff, my man! 
Come on in, guys. We'll be safe in here. Gimme some. 
Freddie, 
this is your house? 
I thought you lived under a bridge. Well, technically, 
it belongs to my parents. 
They're on a vacay on the family island. You know, we should 
totally go some time. Frolic. 
You gotta be kidding me. 
If I wasn't just attacked 
by a guy in a kabuki mask, 
I think this would be 
the weirdest thing I've seen today. My brain hates my eyes for seeing this. Your body temperature is still low. Yeah. 
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow. It's so nice. 
Oh, yeah, that's toasty. 
Good robot. 
Does this symbol 
mean anything to you guys? 
-Yes! It's a bird! 
-No! 
The guy in the mask was carrying something with this symbol on it. Apprehending the man in the mask will improve Hiro's emotional state. Apprehend him? 
Page 23/38
We don't even know who he is. 
I have a theory. 
"Dr. slaughter, md"? 
Actually, millionaire weapons designer, Malcolm chazzletick. 
"The annihilator"? 
Behind the mask, 
industrialist reid axworthy. 
"Baron Von destruct"? 
Just get to the point! 
Don't you guys get it? 
The man in the mask who attacked us is none other than... 
Voil! 
Alistair krei. 
-What? 
-Think about it. 
Krei wanted your microbots, 
and you said no. 
But rules don't apply to a man like krei. There's no way. 
The guy is too high profile. 
Then who was that guy in the mask? I don't know. 
We don't know anything about him. His blood type is ab-negative. 
Cholesterol levels are... 
Baymax, you scanned him? 
I am programed to assess 
everyone's healthcare needs. 
Yes! 
I can use the data 
from your scan to find him. 
You'd have to scan 
everyone in San fransokyo. 
That might take, I don't know, forever. No, no, no, no. I... 
I just have to look for another angle. Got it! 
I'll scan the whole city at the same time. I just have to upgrade baymax's sensor. Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy, I need to upgrade all of you. 
Upgrade who, now? 
Page 24/38
Those who suffer a loss require support from friends and loved ones. 
Okay, I like where this is heading! We can't go against that guy! 
We're nerds! 
Hiro, we want to help, 
but we're just us. 
No. 
You can be way more. 
Tadashi hamada was our best friend. We're in. 
Can you feel it? 
You guys, do you feel this? 
Our origin story begins. 
We're gonna be superheroes! 
Arms up. 
The neurotransmitter 
must be in his mask. 
We get the mask, 
and he can't control the bots. Game over. 
They say 
"we are what we are" 
but we don't have to be 
I'm bad behavior 
but I do it in the best way 
I'll be the watcher 
of the eternal flame 
I'll be the guard dog 
of all your fever dreams 
I am the sand in the bottom 
half of the hourglass 
'cause we could be immortals 
immortals 
just not for long 
for long 
live with me forever now 
pull the blackout curtains down just not for long 
for long 
we could be immortals 
immortals 
immortals 
immortals 
Page 25/38
sometimes the only payoff 
for having any faith 
is when it's tested again 
and again 
every day 
I'm still comparing your past 
to my future 
'cause we could be immortals 
immortals 
just not for long 
for long 
super jump! 
Super jump! 
And live with me forever now 
pull the blackout curtains down -I breathe fire. 
-Just not for long 
for long 
we could be immortals 
immortals 
immortals 
immortals 
immortals 
immortals 
immortals 
immortals 
immortals 
I love it! 
Not bad. 
Anybody else's suit riding up on them? Hey, guys! 
Check this out. 
I'd like to introduce, 
baymax 2.0. 
He's glorious. 
Hello. 
Hold up. Focus. 
Show 'em what you got, buddy. 
The fist, show them the fist. 
No, not that. 
The thing, the other thing. 
Rocket fist make Freddie so happy! That's just one of his new upgrades! Baymax, wings. 
Page 26/38
No way! 
Thrusters. 
I fail to see how flying 
makes me a better 
healthcare companion. 
I fail to see how you fail to see that it's awesome! 
Full thrust. 
Steady, big guy. 
Look, let's just take this slow. Up, up, up, up, up! 
Thrust, thrust, thrust! 
Too much thrust! Too much thrust! Too much thrust! 
No, no, no, no! 
Back on! Back on! 
On! On! On! 
Zoom... 
Go up! Up, up, up! 
Up! 
Oh, man! 
Maybe... 
Maybe enough flying for today. What do you say? 
Your neurotransmitter levels 
are rising steadily. 
Which means what? 
The treatment is working. 
Oh, no! 
No, no, no, no, no! 
Whoa, baymax! 
Yes! 
Yeah! 
Yes! 
Wow! 
That was... 
That was... 
Sick. 
It is just an expression. 
That's... that's right, buddy. I am never taking the bus again. Your emotional state has improved. I can deactivate if you say 
you are satisfied with your care. Page 27/38
What? 
No, I don't want you to deactivate. We still have to find that guy. So, fire up that super-sensor. 
Functionality improved. 
1000% increase in range. 
I have found a match... 
...on that island. 
-Killer view. 
-Yeah. If I... 
If I wasn't terrified of heights, I'd probably love this. 
But I'm terrified of heights, 
so I don't love it. 
There. Baymax, take us in. 
Awesome! 
Our first landing together as a team. Guys, come on. 
"Quarantine"? 
Do you people know 
what "quarantine" means? 
"Quarantine." Enforced isolation to prevent contamination 
that could lead to disease, 
or, in some cases, death. 
There's a skull face on this one. A skull face! 
Be ready. 
He could be anywhere. 
Fire! 
Spitting fire! Spitting fire! 
That was a bird. 
Well, at least we know our gear works. Six intrepid friends 
led by Fred 
their leader, Fred 
Fred's angels 
Fred's angels 
harnessing the power of the sun with the ancient amulet 
they found in the attic 
the amulet is green 
it's probably an emerald 
Fred, I will laser-hand you in the face. Page 28/38
Guys. 
Any sign of him, baymax? 
This structure is 
interfering with my sensor. 
Perfect. The robot's broken. 
Guys, you might want to see this. What do you think it is, genius? I'm not sure. But look. 
Hiro. 
Krei. 
That's right. 
We were asked to do the impossible. That's what we did. 
We've reinvented 
the very concept of transportation. Friends, I present 
project silent sparrow. 
General, may I? 
Magic hat! 
Teleportation. 
The transport of matter 
instantaneously through space. 
Not science fiction anymore. 
Now, we didn't spend billions 
of tax dollars 
to teleport hats. 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
you're here to witness history. 
Ready to go for a ride, Abigail? We've invited all these people. 
Might as well give 'em a show. 
T-minus 30 seconds to launch. 
-29... 28... 
-This is argo. 
-Capsule's in position. 
-27... 
Sir, we've picked up a slight irregularity in the magnetic containment field. Mr. krei, is there a problem? 
No. No problem. 
It's well within the parameters. Let's move forward. 
3... 2... 1... 
Cabin pressure is go. 
Page 29/38
Pod engaged. 
Field breach! Abort! 
We've lost all contact with the pod. Oh, no. 
-It's breaking up! 
-The pilot is gone. 
Portal two is down. 
The magnetic 
containment field's down! 
Krei, shut it down now! 
I want this island sealed off! The government shut down 
krei's experiment. 
And he's using your microbots 
to steal his machine back. 
Krei is the guy in the mask. 
Oh, no. 
Baymax, get us out of here. 
Go for the transmitter. 
Behind his mask. 
Baymax! 
All right, what's the plan? 
It's Fred time. 
Super jump! 
Gravity crush! 
Falling hard. 
Seriously, what is the plan? 
-Get the mask. 
-Right behind you. 
For real, what is the plan? 
Hey! 
Hey! 
You want to dance, masked man? 'Cause you'll be dancing with these. Hand over the mask, 
or you'll get a taste of this! And a little bit of that! 
Hey! I did all right. 
Is that all you got? 
You got that, too? 
It's back into the fire! 
It's over, krei. 
Pro... Professor Callaghan? 
The explosion... 
Page 30/38
You died. 
No. I had your microbots. 
But, tadashi. 
You just let him die. 
Give me the mask, Hiro. 
He went in there to save you! 
That was his mistake! 
Baymax, destroy. 
My programing prevents me 
from injuring a human being. 
Not anymore. 
Hiro, this is not what... 
Do it, baymax! Destroy him! 
No! Stop, baymax! 
No, stop! He's getting away! 
Baymax! 
My healthcare protocol 
has been violated. 
I regret any distress I may have caused. How could you do that? I had him! What you just did, 
we never signed up for. 
We said we'd catch the guy. 
That's it. 
I never should have let you help me! Baymax, find Callaghan. 
My enhanced scanner 
has been damaged. 
Wings. 
Hiro, this isn't part of the plan. Fly! 
Hiro! 
Your blood pressure is elevated. You appear to be distressed. 
I'm fine! 
There. Is it working? 
-My sensor is operational. 
-Good. 
Then let's get... 
What? 
Are you going to remove 
my healthcare chip? 
Yes. Open! 
My purpose is to heal 
Page 31/38
the sick and injured. 
Baymax, open your access port. 
Do you want me to terminate 
Professor Callaghan? 
Just open! 
Will terminating Professor Callaghan improve your emotional state? 
Yes! No! I don't know! 
Open your access! 
-Is this what tadashi wanted? 
-It doesn't matter! 
Tadashi programed me to aid and... Tadashi's gone! 
Tadashi's gone. 
Tadashi is here. 
No. He's not here. 
Tadashi is here. 
This is tadashi hamada. 
And this is the first test 
of my robotics project. 
Hello, I am baymax. 
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! The seventh test of my robotics project. Hello, I... 
What? What? 
Wait, wait, wait, stop! 
Stop scan! Stop... 
Tadashi hamada again, 
and this is the 33rd test 
of my robotics project. 
I'm not giving up on you. 
You don't understand this yet, 
but people need you. 
So, let's get back to work. 
This is tadashi hamada, 
and this is the 84th test. 
What do you say, big guy? 
Hello, I am baymax, 
your personal healthcare companion. It works. 
It works! 
This is amazing! You... you work! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it. I knew it. Oh, you work. 
Page 32/38
I can't believe it! I can't... Okay. All right, big moment, here. Scan me. 
Your neurotransmitter 
levels are elevated. 
This indicates that you are happy. I am. I really am. 
Oh, man. Wait till my brother sees you. You're gonna help 
so many people, buddy. 
So many. 
That's all for now. 
I am satisfied with my care. 
Thank you, baymax. 
I'm so sorry. 
I guess I'm not like my brother. Hiro. 
Guys, I... I... 
We're going to catch Callaghan, and, this time, we'll do it right. But maybe don't leave your team stranded on a spooky island next time. -Oh, man. 
-Nah, it's cool. 
Heathcliff picked us up 
in the family chopper. 
Hiro, we found something 
you should see. 
You almost got us all killed! 
Krei! You did this! 
You knew it wasn't ready! 
Callaghan? He was there? 
He was such a good man. 
What happened? 
I don't know. 
But the answer's here somewhere. Wait, wait! Stop. 
There he is. 
With the pilot. 
Hang on. 
We've invited all these people... The pilot was Callaghan's daughter. Callaghan blames krei. 
This is a revenge story. 
Page 33/38
So, what are we waiting for? 
It's all set up. 
This beautiful new campus 
is the culmination of a lifelong dream. But none of this 
would've been possible 
without a few bumps in the road. Those setbacks made us stronger, and set us on the path 
to a bright future. 
What is that? 
-What? 
-Setback? 
Was my daughter a "setback"? 
Callaghan! But you... 
Your daughter, that... 
That was an accident. 
No! You knew it was unsafe. 
My daughter is gone 
because of your arrogance. 
What are you doing? 
You took everything from me when you sent Abigail into that machine. Now I'm taking everything from you. No! 
No! No! You can't! 
You're going to watch 
everything you've built disappear. Then, it's your turn. 
Professor Callaghan! 
Let him go! 
Is this what Abigail would've wanted? Abigail is gone! 
This won't change anything. 
Trust me, I know. 
Listen to the kid, Callaghan. 
Please, let me go. 
I'll give you anything you want! I want my daughter back! 
Go for the mask! 
Baymax! 
Leaping into action! 
Oh, no! 
Getting a little tight. 
Page 34/38
-No! 
-He's too strong! 
-There's no way out! 
-You can't beat him! 
Help! I can't beat him. 
Hiro! 
-Hiro? Hiro? 
-Help! 
-That's it! 
-Hiro. 
-I know how to beat him. 
-Hiro. 
Listen up! 
Use those big brains of yours 
and think your way 
around the problem. 
Look for a new angle. 
My arms! They can't go any further! Wait a second, it's a suit. 
Hello, sign. 
Care to go for a little spin? 
Double spin! 
Behind-the-back spin! 
Yeah! 
Yeah! 
Baymax! 
Hiro. 
I love that robot! 
Okay, new plan. Forget the mask. Take out the bots. 
They'll get sucked up into the portal. Now that is a plan! 
Honey, Fred, 
can you give us some cover? 
Like you have to ask. 
Let's do this, Freddie! 
Smokescreen! 
Ready and 
dive! 
Whoa, the gravity's getting 
a little weird here, guys! 
Wait. 
Let's use this! 
These are green blades of fury! Page 35/38
Woman up! 
Double sign-spin. 
Now my signs are on fire! 
Now that's a chemical reaction! Back kick. Knifehand. Roundhouse. Hammerfist. 
This ends now! 
Looks like you're out of microbots. What? 
Baymax! 
No! 
Our programing prevents us 
from injuring a human being. 
But we'll take that. 
It's still on! We have to shut it down! We can't! 
The containment field is failing. The portal is gonna tear itself apart! We need to get out of here, now! Baymax! 
My sensor is detecting signs of life. -What? 
-Coming from there. 
The life signs are female. 
She appears to be in hyper-sleep. Callaghan's daughter. She's still alive. Abigail. 
Let's go get her. 
The portal is destabilizing. 
You'll never make it. 
She's alive in there. 
Someone has to help. 
What do you say, buddy? 
Flying makes me 
a better healthcare companion. 
Careful! There's krei 
tech debris everywhere. 
Look out! 
I have located the patient. 
Hurry! 
Come on, buddy, let's get her home. I'll guide you out of here. Let's go! Veer right! 
Okay, to the left. 
Page 36/38
Hard right! 
Up and over. 
Okay, level off. Easy. 
Nice flying! 
Almost there! 
Baymax! 
Baymax! 
My thrusters are inoperable. 
Just grab hold. 
There is still a way 
I can get you both to safety. 
I cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care. No, no, no, no. Wait. What about you? -You are my patient. 
-Baymax. 
Your health is my only concern. Stop! I'm gonna figure out... 
Are you satisfied with your care? No. There's gotta be another way. I'm not gonna leave you here. 
I'll think of something. 
There is no time. 
Are you satisfied with your care? Please! No... 
I can't lose you, too. 
Hiro, 
I will always be with you. 
I'm satisfied with my care. 
Hiro! 
Yeah! They made it! 
Baymax? 
Miss, can you hear me? 
What is your name? 
Abigail Callaghan. 
Okay, Abigail, you are gonna be fine. We're taking you to the hospital. Move it! 
Get in there. 
A massive cleanup continues today at the headquarters 
of krei tech industries. 
Reports are still flooding in about a group of unidentified individuals, 
Page 37/38
who prevented what could have been a major catastrophe. 
The whole city 
of San fransokyo is asking, 
"who are these heroes? 
And where are they now?" 
-Hey. 
-Hi. 
It's so exciting. 
Hey, sweetie! 
Okay. 
Last hug. 
Bye! 
-And just then I was like... 
-Get out of here. 
Ow? 
I am baymax, 
your personal healthcare companion. Hello, Hiro. 
We didn't set out to be superheroes, but sometimes life doesn't go 
the way you planned. 
The good thing is, my brother 
wanted to help a lot of people, 
and that's what we're gonna do. 
Who are we? 
Dad, I just wish I could share 
my accomplishments with you. 
You mean so much to me, and honestly, I've always felt a distance 
what with you being 
on the family island all the time, and I just wish you could see how... Fred. 
Son. 
Dad? 
I wear 'em front, I wear 'em back. I go inside out, then I go front and back. Dad! 
We have a lot to talk about.

On your left. 
On your left. 
On my left. Got it. 
Don't say it. Don't you say it. - On your left. 
- Come on! 
Need a medic? 
I need a new set of lungs. 
Dude, you just ran, like, 
13 miles in 30 minutes. 
I guess I got a late start. 
Really? You should 
be ashamed of yourself. 
You should take another lap. 
Did you just take it? 
I assume you just took it. 
What unit you with? 
58th Pararescue. 
But now I'm working down at the VA. - Sam Wilson. 
- Steve Rogers. 
I kind of put that together. 
Must have freaked you out, coming home after the whole defrosting thing. It takes some getting used to. It's good to meet you, Sam. 
It's your bed, right? 
What's that? 
Your bed, it's too soft. 
When I was over there, 
I'd sleep on the ground, 
use rock for pillows, 
like a caveman. 
Now I'm home, lying in my bed, and it's like... 
Lying on a marshmallow. 
Feel like I'm gonna sink 
right to the floor. 
How long? 
Two tours. 
You must miss the 
good old days, huh? 
Well, things aren't so bad. 
Food's a lot better. 
Page 2/48
We used to boil everything. 
No polio is good. 
Internet, so helpful. 
I've been reading that a lot, 
trying to catch up. 
Marvin Gaye, 1972, 
Trouble Man soundtrack. 
Everything you missed 
jammed into one album. 
I'll put it on the list. 
All right, Sam, duty calls. 
Thanks for the run. 
If that's what you 
want to call running. 
That's how it is? 
- That's how it is. 
- Okay. 
Any time you want to stop by the VA, make me look awesome 
in front of the girl at the 
front desk, just let me know. 
- I'll keep it in mind. 
- Yeah. 
Hey, fellas. 
Either one of you 
know where the Smithsonian is? I'm here to pick up a fossil. 
That's hilarious. 
- How you doing? 
- Hey. 
Can't run everywhere. 
No, you can't. 
Target is a mobile 
satellite launch platform, 
the Lemurian Star. 
They were sending up their last payload when pirates took them, 93 minutes ago. 
- Any demands? 
- Billion and a half. 
- Why so steep? 
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s. So it's not off-course. 
It's trespassing. 
Page 3/48
I'm sure they have a good reason. You know, I'm getting a little 
tired of being Fury's janitor. 
Relax. It's not that complicated. How many pirates? 
25. Top mercs led by this guy. 
Georges Batroc. 
Ex-DGSE, Action Division. 
He's at the top of 
Interpol's Red Notice. 
Before the French demobilized 
him, he had 36 kill missions. 
This guy's got a rep 
for maximum casualties. 
Hostages? 
Mostly techs. One officer. 
Jasper Sitwell. 
They're in the galley. 
What's Sitwell doing 
on a launch ship? 
All right, I'm gonna 
sweep the deck and find Batroc. Nat, you kill the engines 
and wait for instructions. 
Rumlow, you sweep aft, 
find the hostages, 
get them to the life-pods, 
get them out. Let's move. 
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap. Gear up. 
Secure channel seven. 
Seven secure. 
Did you do anything fun 
Saturday night? 
Well, all the guys 
from my barbershop quartet are dead, so, no, not really. 
Coming up on the drop zone, Cap. You know, if you ask Kristen out, from Statistics, she'd probably say yes. That's why I don't ask. 
Too shy, or too scared? 
Too busy! 
Was he wearing a parachute? 
Page 4/48
No. 
No, he wasn't. 
Hey! 
Thanks. 
Yeah. You seemed pretty 
helpless without me. 
What about the nurse that 
lives across the hall from you? She seems kind of nice. 
Secure the engine room, 
then find me a date. 
I'm multi-tasking. 
You want a bullet in your head? Okay. 
Hey, sailor. 
Hey! 
Targets acquired. 
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position. 
Natasha, what's your status? 
Status, Natasha. 
Hang on! 
Engine room secure. 
On my mark. 
Three... 
Two... One. 
I told you, S.H.I.E.L.D. 
doesn't negotiate. 
Hostages en route to extraction. Romanoff missed 
the rendezvous point, Cap. 
Hostiles are still in play. 
Natasha, Batroc's on the move. Circle back to Rumlow 
and protect the hostages. 
Natasha. 
Well, this is awkward. 
What are you doing? 
Backing up the hard drive. 
It's a good habit to get into. Rumlow needed your help. 
What the hell are you doing here? You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel. Whatever I can get my hands on. Our mission is to rescue hostages. 
Page 5/48
No, that's your mission, 
and you've done it beautifully. You just jeopardized 
this whole operation. 
I think that's overstating things. Okay. 
That one's on me. 
You're damn right. 
You just can't stop yourself 
from lying, can you? 
I didn't lie. 
Agent Romanoff 
had a different mission than yours. Which you didn't feel 
obliged to share. 
I'm not obliged to do anything. Those hostages could 
have died, Nick. 
I sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didn't happen. Soldiers trust each other. 
That's what makes it an army. 
Not a bunch of guys 
running around shooting guns. 
Last time I trusted someone, 
I lost an eye. 
Look, I didn't want you doing 
anything you weren't comfortable with. Agent Romanoff is comfortable 
with everything. 
I can't lead a mission 
when the people I'm leading 
have missions of their own. 
It's called compartmentalization. Nobody spills the secrets, 
because nobody knows them all. Except you. 
You're wrong about me. 
I do share. 
I'm nice like that. 
- Insight bay. 
- Captain Rogers does not have clearance for Project Insight. Director override. 
Page 6/48
Fury, Nicholas J. 
Confirmed. 
You know, they used to play music. Yeah. 
My grandfather operated one 
of these things for 40 years. 
Granddad worked in a nice building. Got good tips. 
He'd walk home every night, 
a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag. He'd say, "Hi." 
People would say, "Hi" back. 
Time went on, 
the neighborhood got rougher. 
He'd say, "Hi." 
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'." Granddad got to gripping that 
lunch bag a little tighter. 
Did he ever get mugged? 
Every week some punk would say, "What's in the bag?" 
What would he do? 
He'd show them. 
Bunch of crumpled ones, 
and a loaded .22 Magnum. 
Yeah, Granddad loved people. 
But he didn't trust them very much. Yeah, I know. 
They're a little bit 
bigger than a .22. 
This is Project Insight. 
Three next-generation helicarriers synced to a network 
of targeting satellites. 
Launched from the Lemurian Star. Once we get them in the air, 
they never need to come down. 
Continuous sub-orbital flight, 
courtesy of our new repulsor engines. Stark? 
He had a few suggestions 
once he got an up-close look 
at our old turbines. 
These new long-range precision guns Page 7/48
can eliminate 1,000 
hostiles a minute. 
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA before he steps outside his spider hole. We're gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen. Thought the punishment 
usually came after the crime. 
We can't afford to wait that long. Who's "we"? 
After New York, I convinced 
the World Security Council 
we needed a quantum surge 
in threat analysis. 
For once, we're way 
ahead of the curve. 
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection. 
You know, I read those SSR files. "Greatest Generation"? 
You guys did some nasty stuff. 
Yeah, we compromised. 
Sometimes in ways that 
made us not sleep so well. 
But we did it 
so that people could be free. 
This isn't freedom. This is fear. S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be. And it's getting damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap. Don't hold your breath. 
Welcome to the Smithsonian. 
Visitor information booths are 
available on the second level. 
A symbol to the nation. 
A hero to the world. 
The story of Captain America 
is one of honor, bravery and sacrifice. Denied enlistment 
due to poor health, 
Steven Rogers was chosen 
for a program 
unique in the annals 
Page 8/48
of American warfare. 
One that would transform him 
into the world's first Super-Soldier. In this rare footage, 
everyone's favorite war hero, 
Captain America... 
Battle tested, 
Captain America 
and his Howling Commandos 
quickly earned their stripes. 
Their mission: 
taking down HYDRA, 
the Nazi rogue science division. Best friends since childhood, 
Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers were inseparable 
on both schoolyard and battlefield. Barnes is the only Howling 
Commando to give his life 
in service of his country. 
That was a difficult winter. 
A blizzard had trapped half 
our battalion behind the German line. Steve, Captain Rogers, 
he fought his way 
through a HYDRA blockade 
that had pinned our allies 
down for months. 
He saved over 1,000 men. 
Including the man who would... Who would become my husband, 
as it turned out. 
Even after he died, 
Steve was still changing my life. You should be 
proud of yourself, Peggy. 
I have lived a life. 
My only regret is that 
you didn't get to live yours. 
What is it? 
For as long as I can remember, I just wanted to do what was right. I guess I'm not quite sure 
Page 9/48
what that is anymore. 
And I thought I could throw 
myself back in and follow orders. Serve. 
It's just not the same. 
You're always so dramatic. 
Look, you saved the world. 
We rather mucked it up. 
You didn't. 
Knowing that you helped found 
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay. Hey. 
The world has changed, 
and none of us can go back. 
All we can do is our best. 
And sometimes the best that 
we can do is to start over. 
Steve. 
Yeah? 
You're alive. 
You came back. 
Yeah, but... 
It's been so long. 
So long. 
Well, I couldn't 
leave my best girl. 
Not when she owes me a dance. 
Secure office. 
Open Lemurian Star's

Fury, Nicholas J. 
Override denied. AH files sealed. On whose authority? 
Fury, Nicholas J. 
World Security Council. 
Confirmed. 
If Nick Fury thinks 
he can get his costumed thugs 
and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to 
mop up his mess, he's sadly mistaken. Page 10/48
This failure is unacceptable. 
Considering this attack took place one mile from my country's 
sovereign waters, 
it's a bit more than that. 
I move for immediate hearing. 
We don't need hearings, 
we need action. 
It's this Council's duty 
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D. 
A breach like this 
raises serious questions. 
Like how the hell 
did a French pirate 
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel in broad daylight? 
For the record, Councilman, 
he's Algerian. 
I can draw a map if it'd help. I appreciate your wit, 
Secretary Pierce. 
But this Council takes things like international piracy fairly seriously. Really? I don't. 
I don't care about one boat, 
I care about the fleet. 
If this Council is going 
to fall to rancor 
every time someone pushes us 
on the playing field, 
maybe we need someone 
to oversee US. 
Mr. Secretary, nobody 
is suggesting... 
Excuse me. 
More trouble, Mr. Secretary? 
Depends on your definition. 
I work 40 floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit? 
A nuclear war would do it, too. You busy in there? 
Nothing some earmarks can't fix. I'm here to ask a favor. 
I want you to call for a vote. Page 11/48
Project Insight has to be delayed. Nick, that's not a favor, 
that's a sub-committee hearing. Along one. 
It could be nothing. 
It probably is nothing. 
I just need time 
to make sure it's nothing. 
But if it's something? 
Then we'll both be damn glad 
those helicarriers aren't in the air. Fine. 
But you got to get Iron Man 
to stop by my niece's birthday party. Thank you, sir. 
And not just a flyby. 
He's got to mingle. 
The thing is, 
I think it's getting worse. 
A cop pulled me over last week. He thought I was drunk. 
I swerved to miss a plastic bag. I thought it was an IED. 
Some stuff you leave there. 
Other stuff you bring back. 
It's our job to figure 
out how to carry it. 
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase, or in a little man-purse? 
It's up to you. 
- I'll see you next week. 
- Definitely. 
Look who it is, the running man. Caught the last few minutes. 
It's pretty intense. 
Yeah, brother, 
we all got the same problems. 
Guilt, 
regret. 
You lose someone? 
My wingman, Riley. 
Flying a night mission. 
Standard PJ rescue op. 
Nothing we hadn't done 
Page 12/48
1,000 times before. 
Until an RPG knocked Riley's 
dumb ass out of the sky. 
Nothing I could do. 
It's like I was up 
there just to watch. 
- I'm sorry. 
- After that, 
I had a really hard time finding a reason for being over there, you know? But you're happy now, 
back in the world? 
The number of people giving me 
orders is down to about zero. 
So, hell yeah. 
Are you thinking about getting out? No. 
I don't know. 
To be honest, I don't know 
what I would do with myself if I did. Ultimate fighting? 
Just a great idea off 
the top of my head. 
Seriously, you could do 
whatever you want to do. 
What makes you happy? 
I don't know.

blocks, directly ahead. 
Warning. Approaching intersection. Get me off the grid! 
Calculating route 
to secure location. 
So sweet. That is so nice. 
Hi. 
I got to go, though. 
Okay. Bye. 
My aunt, she's kind 
of an insomniac. 
Yeah. 
Hey, if you want... 
If you want, 
you're welcome to use my machine. Page 14/48
Might be cheaper 
than the one in the basement. 
Yeah? What's it cost? 
A cup of coffee? 
Thank you, but 
I already have a 
load in downstairs, 
and you really don't want 
my scrubs in your machine. 
I just finished a rotation 
in the infectious disease ward, so... Well, I'll keep my distance. 
Hopefully, not too far. 
And I think you left 
your stereo on. 
Right. Thank you. 
Yeah. 
I don't remember giving you a key. You really think I'd need one? My wife kicked me out. 
I didn't know you were married. A lot of things you 
don't know about me. 
I know, Nick. That's the problem. I'm sorry to have to do this, 
but I had no place else to crash. Who else knows about your wife? Just... 
My friends. 
Is that what we are? 
That's up to you. 
Don't trust anyone. 
Captain Rogers? 
Captain, 
I'm Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D. 
Special Service. 
Kate? 
I'm assigned to protect you. 
On whose order? 
His. 
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive. I need EMTs. 
Do we have a 20 on the shooter? Tell him I'm in pursuit. 
Page 15/48
Is he gonna make it? 
I don't know. 
Tell me about the shooter. 
He's fast. Strong. 
Had a metal arm. 
Ballistics? 
Three slugs, no rifling. 
Completely untraceable. 
Soviet-made. 
Yeah. 
He's in V-tach. 
- Crash cart coming in. 
- Nurse, help me with the drape. - BP's dropping. 
- Defibrillator! 
I want you to charge him at 100. Don't do this to me, Nick. 
Stand back. 
Three, two, 
one. Clear. 
- Pulse? 
- No pulse. 
Okay, 200, please. 
Stand back! 
Three, two, one. Clear! 
Get me epinephrine! 
Pulse? 
Negative. 
Don't do this to me, Nick. 
Don't do this to me. 
What's the time? 
1: 
Time of death, 1:03 a.m. 
I need to take him. 
Natasha. 
Natasha! 
Why was Fury in your apartment? I don't know. 
Cap, they want you 
back at S.H.I.E.L.D. 
Yeah, give me a second. 
They want you now. 
Okay. 
Page 16/48
You're a terrible liar. 
S.T.R.I.K.E. team, 
escort Captain Rogers 
back to S.H.I.E.L.D. 
immediately for questioning. 
I told him. 
- Let's go. 
- Yeah. 
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out. 
Captain Rogers. 
Neighbor. 
Captain. 
I'm Alexander Pierce. 
Sir, it's an honor. 
The honor's mine, Captain. 
My father served in the 101st. 
Come on in. 
That photo was taken 
five years after Nick and I met, when I was at State Department 
in Bogota. 
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, 
but the rebels took hostages. 
Nick was Deputy Chief 
of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there, and he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building 
through the sewers. 
I said, "No, we'll negotiate." 
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order. 
They stormed the basement, 
and what do they find? 
They find it empty. 
Nick had ignored my direct order, and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil, and saved the lives of 
a dozen political officers, 
including my daughter. 
So you gave him a promotion. 
I've never had any 
cause to regret it. 
Page 17/48
Captain, why was Nick 
in your apartment last night? 
I don't know. 
Did you know it was bugged? 
I did, because Nick told me. 
Did he tell you 
he was the one who bugged it? 
I want you to see something. 
Who hired you, Batroc? 
Is that live? 
Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers. Are you saying he's a suspect? Assassination isn't Batroc's line. No, no. It's more 
complicated than that. 
Batroc was hired anonymously 
to attack the Lemurian Star. 
And he was contacted by email 
and paid by wire transfer, 
and then the money was run 
through 17 fictitious accounts. The last one going to 
a holding company 
that was registered 
to a Jacob Veech. 
Am I supposed to know who that is? Not likely. Veech 
died six years ago. 
His last address was 
1435 Elmhurst Drive. 
When I first met Nick, 
his mother lived at 1437. 
Are you saying 
Fury hired the pirates? Why? 
The prevailing theory 
was that the hijacking was 
a cover for the acquisition 
and sale of classified 
intelligence. 
The sale went sour 
and that led to Nick's death. 
If you really knew Nick Fury, 
you'd know that's not true. 
Page 18/48
Why do you think we're talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to, 
but because Nick asked me to, 
because we were both realists. We knew that, despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, to build a really better world sometimes means having 
to tear the old one down. 
And that makes enemies. 
Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts 
to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today 
makes me really, really angry. Captain, you were the last 
one to see Nick alive. 
I don't think that's an accident. And I don't think you do, either. So, I'm gonna ask again. 
Why was he there? 
He told me not to trust anyone. I wonder if that included him. I'm sorry. 
Those were his last words. 
Excuse me. 
Captain, 
somebody murdered my friend 
and I'm gonna find out why. 
Anyone gets in my way, 
they're gonna regret it. 
Anyone. 
Understood. 
Operations Control. 
Confirmed. 
Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E. 
personnel on site. 
- Understood. 
- Yes, sir. 
- Forensics. 
- Confirmed. 
Page 19/48
Cap. 
Rumlow. 
Evidence Response found some fibers on the roof they want us to see. You want me to get 
the tac team ready? 
No, let's wait and see 
what it is first. 
Right. 
What's the status so far? 
- Administrations level. 
- Confirmed. 
Excuse me. 
I'm sorry about 
what happened with Fury. 
It's messed up, what 
happened to him. 
Thank you. 
Records. 
Confirmed. 
Before we get started, 
does anyone want to get out? 
Mobilize S.T.R.I.K.E. 
units, 25th floor. 
Whoa, big guy.- 
I just want you to know, Cap, 
this isn't personal! 
It kind of feels personal. 
Drop the shield 
and put your hands in the air! Give it up, Rogers! 
Get that door open! 
You have nowhere to go! 
Are you kidding me? 
He's headed for the garage. 
Lock down the bridge. 
Stand down, Captain Rogers. 
Stand down. 
Repeat, stand down. 
Eyes here. 
Whatever your op is, bury it. 
This is Level One. 
Contact DOT. 
All traffic lights in 
Page 20/48
the district go red. 
Shut all runways at BWI, 
IAD and Reagan. 
All security cameras in the city go through this monitor right here. Scan all open sources, 
phones, computers, 
PDAs. Whatever. 
If someone tweets about this 
guy, I want to know about it. 
With all due respect, 
if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting 
a manhunt for Captain America 
we deserve to know why. 
Because he lied to us. 
Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury. He refused to share it. 
As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive 
from S.H.I.E.L.D. 
- Where is it? 
- Safe. 
- Do better. 
- Where did you get it? 
Why would I tell you? 
Fury gave it to you. Why? 
- What's on it? 
- I don't know. 
Stop lying 
I only act like 
I know everything, Rogers. 
I bet you knew Fury hired 
the pirates, didn't you? 
Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you. I'm not gonna ask you again. 
I know who killed Fury. 
Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists. 
The ones that do 
call him the Winter Soldier. 
He's credited with over 
two dozen assassinations 
Page 21/48
in the last 50 years. 
So he's a ghost story. 
Five years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran. Somebody shot out 
my tires near Odessa. 
We lost control, 
went straight over a cliff. 
I pulled us out. 
But the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer 
so he shot him 
straight through me. 
Soviet slug. 
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis. 
Yeah, I bet you look terrible 
in them now. 
Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried. 
Like you said, he's a ghost story. Well, let's find out 
what the ghost wants. 
Nick Fury was murdered 
in cold blood. 
To any reasonable person, 
that would make him a martyr, 
not a traitor. 
You know what makes him a traitor? Hiring a mercenary 
to hijack his own ship. 
Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this Council 
into delaying Project Insight. A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations. 
At best, he lied to you. 
At worst... 
Are you calling for my resignation? I've got a pen and 
paper right here. 
That discussion can be tabled 
for a later time. 
But you do want to 
have a discussion? 
Page 22/48
We've already had 
it, Mr. Secretary. 
This Council moves to 
immediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time. 
First rule of going on the run is don't run, walk. 
If I run in these shoes, 
they're gonna fall off. 
The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up S.H.I.E.L.D. will know 
exactly where we are. 
How much time will we have? 
About nine minutes from 
now. 
Fury was right about that ship. Somebody's trying 
to hide something. 
This drive is protected 
by some sort of AI. 
It keeps rewriting itself 
to counter my commands. 
Can you override it? 
The person who developed this 
is slightly smarter than me. 
Slightly. 
I'm gonna try running a tracer. This is a program 
that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed 
to track hostile malware, 
so if we can't read the file, 
maybe we can find out 
where it came from. 
Can I help you guys with anything? No. My fianc was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations. Right. We're getting married. 
Congratulations. Where are 
you guys thinking about going? New Jersey. 
I have the exact same glasses. Wow, you two are practically twins. 
Page 23/48
Yeah, I wish. 
Specimen. 
If you guys need anything, 
I've been Aaron. 
Thank you. 
- You said nine minutes. Come on. - Relax. 
Got it. 
You know it? 
I used to. Let's go. 
Standard tac team. 
Two behind, two across, 
and two coming straight at us. 
If they make us, I'll engage, 
you hit the south escalator to the metro. Shut up and put your arm around me. Laugh at something I said. 
- What? 
- Do it. 
Negative at the source. 
Give me a floor rundown. 
Negative on three. 
Negative on two. 
Snake the upper levels. 
Work down to me. 
- Kiss me. 
- What? 
Public displays of affection 
make people very uncomfortable. Yes, they do. 
You still uncomfortable? 
It's not exactly the 
word I would use. 
Where did Captain America 
learn how to steal a car? 
Nazi Germany. 
And we're borrowing. 
Take your feet off the dash. 
All right, I have a question for you, which you do not have to answer. I feel like, if you 
don't answer it though, 
- you're kind of answering it, you know. - What? 
Page 24/48
Was that your first 
kiss since 1945? 
- That bad, huh? 
- I didn't say that. 
Well, it kind of sounds like 
that's what you're saying. 
No, I didn't. 
I just wondered 
how much practice you've had. 
- You don't need practice. 
- Everybody needs practice. 
It was not my first 
kiss since 1945. 
I'm 95, I'm not dead. 
Nobody special, though? 
Believe it or not, 
it's kind of hard 
to find someone with 
shared life experience. 
Well, that's all right. 
You just make something up. 
- What, like you? 
- I don't know. 
The truth is a matter 
of circumstance. 
It's not all things to all people, all the time. 
Neither am I. 
That's a tough way to live. 
It's a good way not to die, though. You know, it's kind of hard 
to trust someone, 
when you don't know 
who that someone really is. 
Yeah. 
Who do you want me to be? 
How about a friend? 
Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers. This is it. 
The file came from 
these coordinates. 
So did I. 
This camp is where I was trained. Page 25/48
Change much? 
A little. 
Pick up the pace, ladies! 
Let's go! Let's go! 
Double time! 
Come on, Rogers, move it! 
Come on, fall in! 
Rogers! 
I said fall in! 
This is a dead end. 
Zero heat signatures, 
zero waves, not even radio. 
Whoever wrote the file must 
have used a router to throw people off. What is it? 
Army regulations 
forbid storing munitions 
within 500 yards of the barracks. This building is in 
the wrong place. 
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 
Maybe where it started. 
And there's Stark's father. 
Howard. 
Who's the girl? 
If you're already working 
in a secret office, 
why do you need to 
hide the elevator? 
This can't be the data point. 
This technology is ancient. 
Y-E-S spells yes. 
Shall we play a game? 
- It's from a movie that was really... - I know, I saw it. 
Rogers, Steven, 
born 1918. 
Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna, 
born 1984. 
It's some kind of recording. 
I am not a recording, Fraulein. I may not be the man I was 
when the Captain took 
me prisoner in 1945. 
Page 26/48
But I am. 
You know this thing? 
You know this thing? 
Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull. 
He's been dead for years. 
First correction, I am Swiss. 
Second, look around you. 
I have never been more alive. 
In 1972, I received a 
terminal diagnosis. 
Science could not save my body. My mind, however, 
that was worth saving, 
on 200,000 feet of databanks. 
You are standing in my brain. 
- How did you get here? 
- Invited. 
It was Operation Paperclip 
after World War II. 
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited German 
scientists with strategic value. They thought I could 
help their cause. 
I also helped my own. 
HYDRA died With the Red Skull. Cut off one head, 
two more shall take its place. Prove it. 
Accessing archive. 
HYDRA was founded on 
the belief that humanity 
could not be trusted 
with its own freedom. 
What we did not realize was 
that if you try 
to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. 
Humanity needed to surrender 
its freedom willingly. 
After the war, 
S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded, 
and I was recruited. 
The new HYDRA grew. 
Page 27/48
A beautiful parasite 
inside S.H.I.E.L.D. 
For 70 years, 
HYDRA has been secretly 
feeding crisis, reaping war, 
and when history did not cooperate, history was changed. 
That's impossible. S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you. 
Accidents will happen. 
HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom 
to gain its security. 
Once a purification process 
is complete, 
HYDRA'S new world order will arise. We won, Captain. 
Your death amounts to 
the same as your life. 
A zero sum. 
As I was saying... 
What's on this drive? 
Project Insight requires insight. So, I wrote an algorithm. 
What kind of algorithm? 
What does it do? 
The answer to your question 
is fascinating. 
Unfortunately, you shall 
be too dead to hear it. 
Steve, we got a bogey. 
Short range ballistic. 
- 30 seconds tops. 
- Who fired it? 
S.H.I.E.L.D. 
I am afraid 
I have been stalling, Captain. Admit it. 
It's better this way. 
We are, both of us, 
out of time. 
Call in the asset. 
I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce. 
Page 28/48
You need anything before I leave? No... It's fine, Renata, 
you can go home. 
Okay. Night-night. 
Good night. 
Want some milk? 
The timetable has moved. 
Our window is limited. 
Two targets, Level Six. 
They already cost me Zola. 
I want confirmed death in 10 hours. Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I... 
I forgot my 
phone. 
Renata, I wish you 
would have knocked. 
Hey, man. 
I'm sorry about this. 
We need a place to lay low. 
Everyone we know is 
trying to kill us. 
Not everyone. 
- You okay? 
- Yeah. 
What's going on? 
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D. I thought I was going straight. But I guess I just traded in 
the KGB for HYDRA. 
I thought I knew whose 
lies I was telling, 
but I guess I can't tell 
the difference anymore. 
There's a chance you might be 
in the wrong business. 
I owe you. 
It's okay. 
If it was the other way around, and it was down to me 
to save your life, 
now you be honest with me, 
would you trust me to do it? 
I would now. 
And I'm always honest. 
Page 29/48
Well, you seem pretty chipper 
for someone who just found out 
they died for nothing. 
Well, guess I just like to 
know who I'm fighting. 
I made breakfast. 
If you guys eat that sort of thing. So, the question is, 
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch a domestic missile strike? 
Pierce. 
Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world. But he's not working alone. 
Zola's algorithm 
was on the Lemurian Star. 
So was Jasper Sitwell. 
So, the real question is, 
how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap 
a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight? The answer is, you don't. 
- What's this? 
- Call it a rsum. 
Is this Bakhmala? 
The Khalid Khandil mission, 
that was you? 
You didn't say he was a Pararescue. - Is this Riley? 
- Yeah. 
I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs. 
What did you use? A stealth chute? No. 
These. 
I thought you said 
you were a pilot. 
I never said pilot. 
I can't ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason. 
Dude, Captain America 
needs my help. 
There's no better 
reason to get back in. 
Page 30/48
Where can we get our hands on 
one of these things? 
The last one is at Fort Meade. Behind three guarded gates 
and a 12-inch steel wall. 
Shouldn't be a problem. 
Listen, I got to fly home tonight because I got some 
constituency problem 
and I got to press the flesh. 
Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator? 
No, not really. 
Twenty-three, kind of hot. 
Real hot, you know? 
Wants to be a reporter, I think. I don't know. 
Who listens at that point? 
Doesn't sound like 
much of a problem to me. 
Really? Because she's 
killing my back. 
But this isn't the place 
to talk about it. 
This is a nice pin. 
- Thank you. 
- Come here. 
Hail HYDRA. 
- See, it's right there... 
- Yeah, I just saw that. 
- Should I get it checked? 
- I think you should. 
I need a minute. 
Bring the car around. 
Yes, sir? 
Agent Sitwell, how was lunch? 
I hear the crab cakes here 
are delicious. 
Who is this? 
The good-looking guy in the 
sunglasses, your 10 o' clock. 
Your other 10 o'clock. 
There you go. 
What do you want? 
Page 31/48
You're gonna go around 
the corner to your right. 
There's a gray car two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride. And why would I do that? 
Because that tie looks 
really expensive, 
and I'd hate to mess it up. 
Tell me about Zola's algorithm. Never heard of it. 
What were you doing 
on the Lemurian Star? 
I was throwing up. I get seasick. Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof? Because it's really not 
your style, Rogers. 
You're right. 
It's not. 
It's hers. 
Wait. What about that girl 
from Accounting, Laura... 
Lillian. Lip piercing, right? 
Yeah, she's cute. 
Yeah. I'm not ready for that. 
Zola's algorithm is a program 
for choosing 
- insight's targets. 
- What targets? 
You! 
A TV anchor in Cairo, 
the Under Secretary of Defense, a high school Valedictorian 
in Iowa City, 
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, 
anyone who's a threat 
to HYDRA. 
Now, or in the future. 
In the future? How could it know? How could it not? 
The 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it. Your bank records, 
medical histories, voting patterns, Page 32/48
emails, phone calls, 
your damn SAT scores! 
Zola's algorithm 
evaluates people's past 
to predict their future. 
And what then? 
Oh, my God. Pierce 
is gonna kill me. 
What then? 
Then the Insight helicarriers 
scratch people off the list. 
A few million at a time. 
HYDRA doesn't like leaks. 
Then why don't you try 
sticking a cork in it? 
Insight's launching in 16 hours. We're cutting it a 
little bit close here. 
I know. We'll use him 
to bypass the DNA scans 
and access the 
helicarriers directly. 
What? Are you crazy? 
That is a terrible, terrible idea. Shit! 
Hang on! 
Go! I got this! 
Taking fire above 
and below expressway. 
Civilians threatened. 
Repeat, civilians threatened. 
I make an LZ, 2300 block 
of Virginia Avenue. 
Rendezvous, two minutes. 
Get out of the way! 
Stay out of the way! 
Bucky? 
Who the hell is Bucky? 
Drop the shield, Cap! 
Get on your knees! 
Get on your knees! 
Get down, get down! 
Get on your knees! 
Down! 
Page 33/48
Don't move. 
Put the gun down. 
Not here. Not here! 
It was him. 
He looked right at me 
like he didn't even know me. 
How is that even possible? 
It was, like, 70 years ago. 
Zola. 
Bucky's whole unit 
was captured in '43. 
Zola experimented on him. 
Whatever he did 
helped Bucky survive the fall. They must have found him and... None of that's your fault, Steve. Even when I had 
nothing, I had Bucky. 
We need to get a doctor here. 
If we don't put 
pressure on that wound, 
she's gonna bleed out 
here in the truck. 
That thing was squeezing my brain. Who is this guy? 
Three holes. Start digging. 
GSW. She's lost at least a pint. Maybe two. 
- Let me take her. 
- She'll want to see him first. About damn time. 
Lacerated spinal column, 
cracked sternum, 
shattered collarbone, 
perforated liver, 
and one hell of a headache. 
Don't forget your collapsed lung. Let's not forget that. 
Otherwise, I'm good. 
They cut you open. 
Your heart stopped. 
Tetrodotoxin B. 
Slows the pulse to 
one beat a minute. 
Page 34/48
Banner developed it for stress. Didn't work so great for him, 
but we found a use for it. 
Why all the secrecy? 
Why not just tell us? 
Any attempt on the Director's 
life had to look successful. 
Can't kill you if 
you're already dead. 
Besides, 
I wasn't sure who to trust. 
Sergeant Barnes. 
Bucky, no! 
The procedure has already started. You are to be the 
new fist of HYDRA. 
Put him on ice. 
Sir. 
He's unstable. 
Erratic. 
Mission report. 
Mission report now. 
The man on the bridge. 
Who was he? 
You met him earlier this week 
on another assignment. 
I knew him. 
Your work has been 
a gift to mankind. 
You shaped the century. 
And I need you to do 
it one more time. 
Society's at a tipping point 
between order and chaos. 
And tomorrow morning, 
we're gonna give it a push. 
But, if you don't do your part, I can't do mine. 
And HYDRA can't give the world the freedom it deserves. 
But I knew him. 
Prep him. 
He's been out of cryo 
freeze too long. 
Page 35/48
Then wipe him and start over. 
This man declined 
the Nobel Peace Prize. 
He said peace wasn't 
an achievement, 
it was a responsibility. 
See, it's stuff like this 
that gives me trust issues. 
We have to stop the launch. 
I don't think the Council's 
accepting my calls anymore. 
What's that? 
Once the helicarriers 
reach 3,000 feet, 
they'll triangulate with Insight satellites, becoming fully weaponized. 
We need to breach those carriers 
and replace their targeting 
blades with our own. 
One or two won't cut it. 
We need to link all three 
carriers for this to work, 
because if even one of those 
ships remains operational, 
a whole lot of people 
are gonna die. 
We have to assume everyone aboard 
those carriers is HYDRA. 
We have to get past them, 
insert these server blades. 
And maybe, just maybe 
we can salvage what's left... 
We're not salvaging anything. 
We're not just 
taking down the carriers, Nick. 
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D. 
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing 
to do with this. 
You gave me this mission. 
This is how it ends. 
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised. 
You said so yourself. 
HYDRA grew right under your nose 
and nobody noticed. 
Page 36/48
Why do you think we're meeting in this cave? I noticed. 
How many paid the price 
before you did? 
Look, I didn't know about Barnes. Even if you had, 
would you have told me? 
Or would you have 
compartmentalized that, too? 
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA, 
it all goes. 
He's right. 
Don't look at me. 
I do what he does, just slower. Well... 
It looks like you're giving 
the orders now, Captain. 
We looked for you, after. 
My folks wanted to give you 
a ride to the cemetery. 
I know, I'm sorry. 
I just kind of wanted to be alone. How was it? 
It was okay. 
She's next to Dad. 
I was gonna ask... 
I know what you're gonna say, Buck. I just... 
We can put the 
couch cushions on the floor 
like when we were kids. 
It'll be fun. All you got 
to do is shine my shoes, 
maybe take out the trash. 
Come on. 
Thank you, Buck, 
but I can get by on my own. 
The thing is, you don't have to. I'm with you to the 
end of the line, pal. 
He's gonna be there, you know. I know. 
Look, whoever he used to be 
and the guy he is now, 
Page 37/48
I don't think he's 
the kind you save. 
He's the kind you stop. 
I don't know if I can do that. Well, he might not 
give you a choice. 
He doesn't know you. 
He will. 
Gear up. It's time. 
You gonna wear that? 
No. If you're gonna fight a war, you got to wear a uniform. 
Oh, man. 
I am so fired. 
We are in final launch sequence. We are go on guidance. 
AH personnel to launch stations. And how was your flight? 
Lovely. 
The ride from the airport, less so. Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't 
control everything. 
Including Captain America. 
This facility is 
biometrically controlled. 
And these will give you 
unrestricted access. 
I've been parking 
there for two months. 
- But it's his spot. 
- So where's he been? 
I think Afghanistan. 
Negative DT Six. The 
pattern is full. 
Well, he could've said something. Must be the dish. 
I'll check it out. 
Triskelion command request 
we clear the area for launch. 
Excuse us. 
I know the road 
hasn't exactly been smooth, 
and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way. 
Page 38/48
Finally, we're here. 
And the world should be grateful. Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, this is Steve Rogers. 
You've heard a lot about me 
over the last few days. 
Some of you were even ordered 
to hunt me down. 
But I think it's time 
you know the truth. 
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not 
what we thought it was. 
It's been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. 
I don't know how many more, 
but I know they're in the building. They could be standing 
right next to you. 
They almost have what they want. Absolute control. 
They shot Nick Fury. 
And it won't end there. 
If you launch those 
helicarriers today, 
HYDRA will be able to kill 
anyone that stands in their way. Unless we stop them. 
I know I'm asking a lot. 
But the price of freedom is high. It always has been. 
And it's a price I'm 
willing to pay. 
And if I'm the only 
one, then so be it. 
But I'm willing to bet I'm not. Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head? You smug son of a bitch. 
Arrest him. 
I guess I've got the floor. 
Preempt the launch sequence. 
Send those ships up now. 
Page 39/48
Is there a problem? 
Is there a problem? 
I'm sorry, sir. 
I'm not gonna launch those ships. Captain's orders. 
Move away from your station. 
Like he said... 
Hold it right there. 
Put the gun down! 
Captain's orders. 
You picked the wrong side, Agent. Depends on where you're standing. Close the bay door! 
Close the bay door now! 
Close the bay door! 
They're initiating launch. 
Hey, Cap, how do we know 
the good guys from the bad guys? If they're shooting 
at you, they're bad. 
Hey, Cap, 
I found those bad guys 
you were talking about. 
You okay? 
I'm not dead yet. 
Let me ask you a question. 
What if Pakistan marched 
into Mumbai tomorrow 
and you knew that they were 
going to drag your daughters 
into a soccer stadium 
for execution, 
and you could just stop it, 
with a flick of the switch. 
Wouldn't you? 
Wouldn't you all? 
Not if it was your switch. 
I'm sorry. 
Did I step on your moment? 
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet. Falcon, status? 
Engaging 
All right, Cap. I'm in. 
Oh, shit. 
Page 40/48
Eight minutes, Cap. 
Working on it. 
What are you doing? 
She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets 
onto the Internet. 
- Including HYDRA'S. 
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s. 
If you do this, 
none of your past is 
gonna remain hidden. 
Are you sure you're ready 
for the world to see you 
as you really are? 
Are you? 
Alpha lock. 
Falcon, where are you now? 
I had to take a detour. 
Oh, yeah! 
I'm in. 
Bravo lock. 
Two down, one to go. 
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble. We're the only air support 
Captain Rogers has got. 
Disabling the encryption 
is an executive order. 
It takes two Alpha Level members. Don't worry. Company's coming. Did you get my flowers? 
- I'm glad you're here, Nick. 
- Really? 
Because I thought 
you had me killed. 
You know how the game works. 
So why make me head 
of S.H.I.E.L.D.? 
Because you were the best, 
and the most ruthless person 
I ever met. 
I did what I did to protect people. Our enemies are your enemies, Nick. Disorder. War. 
It's just a matter of time 
Page 41/48
before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMF' fries Chicago. 
Diplomacy? 
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid. And you know where 
I learned that. Bogota. 
You didn't ask. 
You just did what had to be done. I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people 
by sacrificing 20 million. 
It's the next step, Nick. 
If you have the courage to take it. No. I have the courage not to. Retinal scanner active. 
You don't think we've wiped 
your clearance from the system? I know you erased my password. Probably deleted my retinal scan. But if you want to stay ahead 
of me, Mr. Secretary, 
you need to keep both eyes open. Alpha level confirmed. 
Encryption code accepted. 
Safeguards removed. 
Charlie carrier is 45 
degrees off the port bow. 
Six minutes. 
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride. 
Roger. Let me know 
when you're ready. 
I just did! 
You know, you're a lot heavier than you look. 
I had a big breakfast. 
Steve! 
Cap! Cap, come in. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm here. 
I'm still on the helicarrier. 
- Where are you? 
- I'm grounded. 
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap. 
Don't worry. I got it. 
Emergency evacuation alert. 
Page 42/48
All personnel, proceed to 
designated safety zones. 
All S.H.I.E.L.D. agents 
regroup at Rally Point Delta. 
Sir, the Council's been breached. - Repeat, Dispatch. 
- Black Widow's up there. 
Headed up. 
- Falcon? 
- Yeah. 
Rumlow's headed for the Council. I'm on it. 
People are gonna die, Buck. 
I can't let that happen. 
Please don't make me do this. 
Done. 
And it's trending. 
Unless you want a two-inch 
hole in your sternum, 
I'd put that gun down. 
That was armed the moment 
you pinned it on. 
Drop it! 
Drop it! 
I'm on 41, headed toward 
the southwest stairwell. 
This is gonna hurt. 
There are no prisoners with HYDRA. Just order. 
And order only comes through pain. - You ready for yours? 
- Man, shut the hell up. 
Lieutenant, how much longer? 
65 seconds to satellite link. 
Targeting grid engaged. 
Lowering weapons array now. 
One minute. 
30 seconds, Cap. 
Stand by. 
Charlie... 
We've reached 3,000 feet. 
Sat link coming online now. 
Deploy algorithm. 
Algorithm deployed. 
Page 43/48
We are go to target. 
Target saturation reached. 
All targets assigned. 
Fire when ready. 
Firing in... 
Three, 
two... 
One. 
Charlie lock. 
Where are the targets? 
Where are the targets? 
Okay, Cap, get out of there. 
Fire now. 
- But, Steve... 
- Do it! 
Do it now! 
What a waste. 
So, you still on the fence 
about Rogers' chances? 
Time to go, Councilwoman. This way. Come on. 
You're going to fly me out of here. You know, there was a time 
I would've taken a bullet for you. You already did. 
You will again, when it's useful. Romanoff. 
Natasha. 
Natasha! Come on! 
Those really do sting. 
Hail HYDRA. 
You're out of your depth, kid. 
Son of a bitch! 
Please tell me you got 
that chopper in the air! 
Sam, where are you? 
41st floor! Northwest corner! 
We're on it! Stay where you are! Not an option! 
41st floor! 41st! 
It's not like they put the floor numbers on the outside of the building. Hill! Where's Steve? 
You got a location on Rogers? 
Page 44/48
You know me. 
No, I don't! 
Bucky. 
You've known me your whole life. Your name is James Buchanan Barnes. Shut up! 
I'm not gonna fight you. 
You're my friend. 
You're my mission. 
You're my mission! 
Then finish it. 
Because I'm with you 
to the end of the line. 
On your left. 
Do you solemnly swear to tell 
the truth, the whole truth, 
and nothing but the truth? 
I do. 
Why haven't we yet heard 
from Captain Rogers? 
I don't know what there is 
left for him to say. 
I think the wreck in 
the middle of the Potomac 
made his point fairly eloquently. Well, he could explain how 
this country is expected to maintain its national security 
now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus. HYDRA was selling you lies, 
not intelligence. 
Many of which you seemed to have had a personal hand in telling. 
Agent, you should know 
that there are some 
on this committee 
who feel, given your 
service record, 
both for this country 
and against it, 
that you belong in a penitentiary. Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill. You're not going to 
Page 45/48
put me in a prison. 
You're not going to put any of us in a prison. You know why? 
Do enlighten us. 
Because you need us. 
Yes, the world is a 
vulnerable place, 
and yes, we help make it that way. But we're also the ones 
best qualified to defend it. 
So, if you want to 
arrest me, arrest me. 
You'll know where to find me. 
So, you've experienced 
this sort of thing before. 
You get used to it. 
We've been data 
mining HYDRA'S files. 
Looks like a lot of rats 
didn't go down with the ship. 
I'm headed to Europe tonight. 
Wanted to ask if you'd come. 
There's something I 
got to do first. 
How about you, Wilson? 
Could use a man with your abilities. I'm more of a soldier than a spy. All right, then. 
Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me, right here. 
You should be honored. 
That's about as close as he gets to saying thank you. 
Not going with him? 
No. 
- Not staying here. 
- Nah. 
I blew all my covers. 
I got to go figure out a new one. That might take a while. 
I'm counting on it. 
That thing you asked for, 
I called in a few favors from Kiev. Will you do me a favor? 
Page 46/48
Call that nurse. 
She's not a nurse. 
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. - What was her name again? 
- Sharon. 
She's nice. 
Be careful, Steve. 
You might not want to 
pull on that thread. 
You're going after him. 
You don't have to come with me. I know. 
When do we start? 
It's over. Fury has released 
everything to the public. 
Everything he knows about. 
Herr Strucker, if they get 
word of our work here, 
if they find out we serve HYDRA... HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D. 
Two sides of a coin 
that's no longer currency. 
What we have 
is worth more than 
any of them ever knew. 
We've only scratched 
the surface and already, 
there are other facilities doing HYDRA'S good work around the world. We'll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends, 
and keep them off our scent. 
What about the volunteers? 
The dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts won't 
be able to find them. 
And the survivors? 
The twins. 
Sooner or later, they 
will meet the twins. 
It's not a world of spies anymore. Not even a world of heroes. 
This is the age of 
miracles, Doctor. 
Page 47/48
There's nothing more horrifying than a miracle.

GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY

EARTH 1998
Young Peter Quill sits in the hallway listening to his walkman.
GRANPA
Peter
Your momma wants to speak with you.
Come on, Pete. Take these fool things off.
PETER‟S DYING MOM
Why have you been fighting with the other boys again, baby?
Peter?
YOUNG PETER QUILL
They killed a little frog that ain‟t done nothing.
Smushed it with a stick.
PETER‟S DYING MOM
You‟re so like your daddy. You even look like him. And he was an angel. Composed out of pure
light.
GRANPA
Mer? You got a present there for Peter, don‟t you?
PETER‟S DYING MOM
Of course. There.
GRANPA
I‟ve got you covered, Pete.
PETER‟S DYING MOM
You open it up when I‟m gone, okay? Your grandpa is gonna take such good care of you. At least
until your daddy comes back to get you. Take my hand. Peter.
GRANPA
Pete, come on.
PETER‟S DYING MOM
Take my hand.
(Peter‟s mom dies)
YOUNG PETER QUILL
Mom? No! No! No! No! Mom! No.
GRANPA
Come with me.
YOUNG PETER QUILL
No! No!

GRANPA
You‟ve got to stay here. Please.

26 YEARS LATER
MORAG
ABADONED PLANET
KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Drop it.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey...
KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Drop it now!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey, cool man. No problem. No problem at all.
KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
How do you know about this?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I don‟t even know what that is. I‟m just a junker man. I was just checking stuff out.
KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
You don‟t look like a junker. You‟re wearing Ravager garb.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
This is just an outfit, man. Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me.
KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
What is your name?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
My name is Peter Quill, okay? Dude chill out.
KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Move!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Why?
KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Ronan may have questions for you.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey you know what? There‟s another name you might know me by. Star-Lord.

A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF SLANG TERMS USED IN “GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY” MOVIE (pychanketapang.blogspot.com) 49

KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Who?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw. Guys?
KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Move!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Forget this.
(Start a fight. Peter runaway and entered into his ship)
BEREET
Peter? What happened?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey... I...
BEREET
Bereet.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Bereet! Look, I‟m gonna be totally honest with you. I forget you‟re here.
“Scattered riots broke out across the Kree Empire today protesting the recent peace treaty signed by
the Kree Emperor and Xandar‟s Nova Prime”
BEREET
Peter, you have call.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No, wait, don‟t!
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Quill?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey, Yondu.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
I‟m here on Morag. Ain‟t no Orb, ain‟t no you.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, I was in the neighborhood. I thought I‟d save you the hassle.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Well, where are you at now, boy?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I feel really bad about this, but I‟m not gonna tell you that.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
I slaved putting this deal together.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Slave? Making a few calls is “slaved”? I mean, really? And how you‟re gonna rip me off!
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
We do not do that to each other. We‟re Ravagers. We got a code.

A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF SLANG TERMS USED IN “GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY” MOVIE (pychanketapang.blogspot.com) 50

PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, and that code is “steal from everybody”
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
When I picked you up on Terra...
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
“Picked me up”
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
...these boys of mine wanted to eat you.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah?
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
They ain‟t never tasted any Terran before. I stopped them. You‟re alive because of me! I will find
you, I will...
(Peter hung up the phone line with Yondu)
(In Yondu‟s Ship)
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Put a bounty on him! Forty K. But I want him back alive.
FORTY K
Yeah, Cap.
YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Alive?
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
That‟s what I said.
YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
I told you when you picked that kid up, you should have delivered him like we was hired to do! He
was cargo! You have always been soft on him.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
You‟re the only one I‟m being soft on! Now, don‟t you worry about Mr. Quill. As soon as we get him
back here, I‟m gonna kill him myself. What we do need to worry about, is who else out there wants
that Orb!

THE DARK ASTER
KREE WARSHIP
RONAN (Lee Pace)
They call me “terrorist”, “radical”, “zealot”, because I obey the ancient laws of my people, the Kree,
and punish those who do not. Because I do not forgive your people for talking the life of my father,
and his father, and his father before him. A thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten!
XANDARIANs
You can‟t do this! Our government signed a peace treaty.
RONAN (Lee Pace)
My government knows no shame. You Xandarians and your culture are a disease.
XANDARIANs
You will never rule Xandar.

A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF SLANG TERMS USED IN “GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY” MOVIE (pychanketapang.blogspot.com) 51

RONAN (Lee Pace)
No. I will cure it!
(Ronan hit the man's head until his blood streaming down)
NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Ronan, Korath has returned.
KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Master, he is a thief, an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord. But we have discovered he has an
agreement to retrieve the Orb for an intermediary known as The Broker.
RONAN (Lee Pace)
I promised Thanos I would retrieve the Orb for him. Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.
Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the Orb.
NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
It will be my honor.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
It will be your doom. If this happens again, you‟ll be facing our father without his prize.
NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
I‟m a daughter of Thanos. Just like you.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
But I know Xandar.
NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Ronan has already decreed that I...
RONAN (Lee Pace)
Do not speak for me. You will not fail.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Have I ever?

XANDAR
CAPITAL OF THE NOVA EMPIRE
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Xandarians. What a bunch of losers. All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid, to
nothing at all. Pathetic. Look at this guy! Can you believe they call us criminals, when he‟s assaulting
us with that haircut?
(Looking toward a little children)
What is this thing? Look how it thinks it‟s cool. It‟s not cool to get help! Walk by yourself, you little
gargoyle.
(Looking towards an oldman and a girl)
Look at Mr. Smiles over here. Where‟s your wife, old man? What a class-A pervert. Hahaha... Right,
Groot? Groot?
(Groot were having drinking on the fountain water)
Don‟t drink fountain water, you idiot. That‟s disgusting!
(Groot shook his head)
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it! Why are you lying?
(tet..tet..tet..)
Looks like we got one. Okay, homie, how bad does someone wanna find you?
(Wanted: Peter Quill)
40,000 units? Groot we‟re gonna be rich.

-------(In Broker‟s place)
THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
Mr. Quill.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Broker. The Orb. As commissioned.
THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
Where‟s Yondu?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Wanted to be here. Sends his love. And fold me to tell you, that you got the best eyebrows in this
business. What is it?
THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
It‟s my policy never to discuss my clients, or their needs.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you.
THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
An occupational hazard, I‟m sure, in your line of work.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Some machine-headed freak, working for a dude named Ronan.
THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
Ronan? I‟m sorry, Mr. Quill. I truly am. But I want no part of this transaction if Ronan is involved.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Who‟s Ronan?
THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty, who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture, is
wiped from existence!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Come on.
THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
He‟s someone whose bad side I‟d rather not be on.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What? What about my bad side?
THE BROKER (Christopher Fairbank)
Farewell, Mr. Quill.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey, we had a deal, bro!
(Broker pushes out Peter from his workplace and closed the door from the inside, in the outside Peter
met with Gamora)
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
What happened?

A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF SLANG TERMS USED IN “GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY” MOVIE (pychanketapang.blogspot.com) 53

PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
This guy just backed out of a deal on me. If there‟s one this I hate. It‟s a man without integrity. Peter
Quill. People call me Star-Lord.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
You have the bearing of a man of honor.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, you know, I wouldn‟t say that. People say it about me, all the time, but it‟s not something I
would ever say about myself.
(Gamora stole the Orb from Peter and kick him, and then they are start fighting)
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
This wasn‟t the plan. (Gamora want to stab Peter and Rocket came to attack Gamora)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag! No! Not her, him! Learn genders, man. Bitting? That‟s not
fair! (Peter ran away and bring the Orb)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Take it easy!
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Fool. You should have learned.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I don‟t learn. One of my issues.
(Groot closed Peter‟s head using a bag)
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What the...
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quit smiling, you idiot. You‟re supposed to be a professional. You gotta be kidding me.
(Gamora comeback again)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Hey! (Gamora pushing Rocket then have a fight with Groot)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I live for the simple things. Like how much this gonna hurt. Yeah. Writhe, little man. It‟ll grow back,
you the ast idiot. (Groot kicked his hand that broken)
Quit whining. (Suddenly they uplifted)

PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Star-Lord.
Sorry. “Lord”.
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
I picked this guy up awhile back for petty thief. He‟s got a code name
Yeah. Stay out of the way.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Come on, man. It‟s a... It‟s an outlaw name.
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
Just relax, pal. It‟s cool to have a code name. It‟s not that weird.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Fascists.
(They are arrested)
-------NOVA HEADQUARTERS
XANDAR’S ARMED FORCES
NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Ronan is destroying Xandarian out posts throughout the galaxy. I should think that would call for
some slight response on the part of the Kree.
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime. What more do you want?
NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
At least a statement from the Kree Empire saying that they condemn his actions. He is slaughtering
children. Families.
That is you business. Now, I have other matters to attend. (turn off the phone)
NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Prick.
DENARIAN SAAL (Peter Serafinowics)
Well, some good news. It look like we‟ve apprehended one of Ronan‟s compatriots.
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
Gamora. Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon. The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan,
Thanos. Recently, Thanos lend her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan, which leads us to believe that
Thanos and Ronan working together.
Subject 89P13. Call itself “Rocket”. The result of illegal genetic and cybernetic experiments on a
lower life form.
What the hell?
They call it “Groot”. A humanoid plant that‟s been traveling recently as 89P13‟s personal
houseplantlmuscle.
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra. Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers, led
by Yondu Udonta.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I‟m sorry. I didn‟t know how this machine worked.
DENARIAN SAAL (Peter Serafinowics)
What a bunch of a-holes. Transport all four to the Kyln.

THE KYLN
HIGH SECURITY PRISON
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws, but these ones here, they‟re corrupt and cruel.
But, hey, that‟s not my problem. I ain‟t gonna be here long. I‟ve escape 22 prisons. This one‟s no
different. You‟re lucky the broad showed up, because otherwise, me and Groot would be collecting
that bounty right now, and you‟d be getting drawn and quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I‟ve had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years. I ain‟t about to be brought down by a tree and a
talking raccoon.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Hold. What‟s a raccoon.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
“What‟s a raccoon?” It‟s what you are, stupid.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Ain‟t no thing like me, except me.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
So, this Orb has a real shiny blue suitcase, Ark of the covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe. What is
it?
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
So what? What‟s the Orb?
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I have no words for an honorless thief.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac. Yeah, I know who you are.
Anyone who‟s anyone knows who you are.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, we know who you are. Who is she?
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, you said that.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I wasn‟t retrieving the Orb for Ronan. I was betraying him. I had an agreement to sell it to a third
party.
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.

PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, that‟s just as fascinating as the first 89 times you told me that. What is wrong with Giving Tree,
here?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Well, he don‟t know talking good like me and you. So his vocabulistics is limited to “I” and “am” and
“Groot”. Exclusively in that order.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I tell you what, that‟s gonna wear real thin, a real fast.
(Peter saw a guard fiddling with his walkman)
Hey. Put that away. Hey! Listen to me, you big blue bastard. Take those headphones off. That‟s mine.
Those belong to impound. That tape and that player is mine!
(Peter electrocuted by the prison guard)
Hooked on a feeling, Blue Swede, 1973. That song belongs to me!

- You first! You first!
- Murderer! Coming for you first, Gamora!
- You‟re dead!
- You‟re scum! You‟re scum!
(Gamora is thrown with a variety of objects by other prisoners)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
It‟s like I said, she‟s got a rep. a lot of prisoners here have lost their families to Ronan and his goons.
She‟ll last a day, tops.
THE PRISONERS
- Murderer!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
The guards will protect her, right?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
They‟re here to stop us from getting out. They don‟t care what we do to each other inside.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Whatever nightmares the future holds, are dreams compared to what‟s behind me.
THE PRISONERS
Check out the new meat. I‟m gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly, and go to town... (Groot poked
The Prisoner‟s nose and lifted him)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Let‟s make something clear. This one here is our booty! You wanna get to him, you go through us!
Or, more accurately, we go through you.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I‟m with them.
THE PRISONERS
I hate you.
OTHER PRISONERS
- No cell‟s gonna protect you for long.
- You‟re dead!

- Dead!
(Gamora being captured by the other prisoners)
THE PRISON‟S GUARD
Take her down to the showers. It‟ll be easier to clean up the blood down there.
(Peter wake up)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill, where you going? Quill. Quill!
THE PRISONER
Gamora, consider this a death sentence for your crimes against the galaxy.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
You dare? You know who I am, yes?
THE PRISONER
You‟re Drax. The destroyer.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
And you know why they call me this.
THE PRISONER
You slayed dozens of Ronan‟s minions.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette, and my daughter, Camaria. He slaughtered them where they stood.
And he laughed!
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Her life is not yours to take. He killed my family. I shall kill one of his in return.
THE PRISONER
Of course, Drax. Here, I...
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill! What are you doing?
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I‟m no family to Ronan or Thanos. I‟m your only hope at stopping him.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Crap.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
You know, if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose, I don‟t think this is the best way to go about it.

A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF SLANG TERMS USED IN “GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY” MOVIE (pychanketapang.blogspot.com) 58

DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, I mean, she‟s hardly the first woman to try and do that to me. Look, this is from a smoking-hot
Rajak girl. Stabbed me with a fork. Didn‟t like me skipping out on her at sunrise. I got, right here, a
Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax. She caught me with this skinny little A‟askavariian who worked
in Nova Records. I was trying to get information. You never see an A‟askavariian?. They have
tentacles, and needles for teeth. If you think I‟m seriously interested in that, then... you don‟t care. But
there‟s the point. She betrayed Ronan. He‟s coming back for her. And when he does that‟s when
you...
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Why would I put my finger on his throat?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What? No, it‟s a symbol. This is a symbol for you slicing his throat.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I would not slice his throat. I would cut his head clean off.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It‟s a general expression for you killing somebody. You‟ve heard this. You‟ve seen this, right? (finger
in the neck) you know what that is.
THE PRISONER
Yeah.. Yeah.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Everyone knows.
THE PRISONER
No. No. (when Drax look at him)
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What I‟m saying is, you want to keep her alive. Don‟t do his work for him.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I like your knife. I‟m keeping it.
THE PRISONER
That was my favorite knife.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Listen! I could care less whether you live or whether you die.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Then why stop the big guy?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Simple you know where to sell my Orb.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
How are gonna sell it when we and it are still here?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
My friend Rocket, here, has escaped 22 prisons.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
We‟re getting out. And then we‟re headed straight to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.

A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF SLANG TERMS USED IN “GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY” MOVIE (pychanketapang.blogspot.com) 59

PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb?
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Four billion units.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
What?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Holy shit.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
That Orb is my opportunity to get away from Thanos and Ronan. If you free us, I‟ll lead you to the
buyer directly and I‟ll split the profit between the three of us.
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Four of us. A sleep for the danger, awake for the money, as per frickin‟ usual.
-------You have been betrayed, Ronan.
RONAN (Lee Pace)
We know only that she has been captured. Gamora may yet recover the Orb.
No! Our sources within the Kyln say Gamora has her own plans for the Orb. Look, your partnership
with Thanos is at risk. Thanos requires your presence. Now!
-------SANCTUARY
DOMAIN OF THANOS
RONAN (Lee Pace)
With all due respect, Thanos, your daughter made this mess, and yet you summon me.
THANOS‟S SUBORDINATE
I would lower my voice, Accuser.
RONAN (Lee Pace)
First, she lost a battle with some primitive.
THANOS‟S SUBORDINATE
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.
RONAN (Lee Pace)
Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.
THANOS‟S SUBORDINATE
You are the one here with nothing to show for it.
RONAN (Lee Pace)
Your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time!
THANOS‟S SUBORDINATE
Lower your tone! I may be your... (Ronan kill him)

A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF SLANG TERMS USED IN “GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY” MOVIE (pychanketapang.blogspot.com) 60

RONAN (Lee Pace)
I only ask that you take this matter seriously.
THANOS
The only matter I do not take seriously, boy, is you. Your politics bore me. Your demeanor is that of a
pouty child. And, apparently, you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora. I shall honor our
agreement, Kree, if you bring mr the Orb. But return to me again empty-handed, and I will bathe the
starways in your blood.
NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair. This is one fight you won‟t win. Let‟s head to the Kyln.
-------(In the prison)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
If we‟re gonna get out of here, we‟re gonna need to get into that watchtower. And to do that, I‟m
gonna need a few things. The guards wear security bands to control their ins and outs. I need one.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Leave it to me.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That dude, there. I need his prosthetic leg.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
His leg?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Yeah. God knows I don‟t need the rest of him. Look at him, he‟s useless.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
All right.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
And finally, on the wall back there is a black panel. Blinky yellow light. Do you see it?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
There‟s a quarnyx battery behind it. Purplish box, green wires. To get into that watchtower, I
definitely need it.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
How are we supposed to do that?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Well, supposably these bald-bodies find you attractive. So maybe you can work out some sort of
trade.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
You must be joking.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
No, I really hear they find you attractive.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Look, it‟s 20 feet up in the air, and it‟s in the middle of the most heavily-guarded part of the prison.
It‟s impossible to get up there without being seen.

A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF SLANG TERMS USED IN “GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY” MOVIE (pychanketapang.blogspot.com) 61

ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I got one plan, and that plan requires a frickin‟ quarnyx battery, so figure it out! Can I get back to it?
Thanks. Now, this is important. Once the battery is removed, everything is gonna slam into
emergency mode. Once we have it, we gotta move quickly, so you definitely need to get that last. Or
we could just get it first and improvise.
(Groot already removed the battery)
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I‟ll get the armband.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Leg.
Prisoner, drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell, or we will open fire.
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
Fire!
All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
You idiot! (climb Groot‟s body) How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?
The animal is in control. Fire on my command!
(After defeat the prison guard, Drax take the guard‟s weapon, and then throw it to Rocket)
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Creepy little beast!
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Oh, yeah.
-------You need what? (asking to Peter)
-------GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I‟ll need this.
Good luck. It‟s internally wired.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I‟ll figure something out.

A‟askavariian!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It was one time, man.
-------(They are arrive in the watchtower)
THE GUARD OF WATCHTOWER
We need all available guards in full combat gear...
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Why is this one here?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
We promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss. I always keep my promises,
when they‟re to muscle-bound whack-jobs who will kill me if I don‟t.
Here you go. (giving the leg to Rocket)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Oh I was just kidding about that leg. I just need these two things.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
No, I thought it‟d be funny. Was it funny? Wait, what did he look like hopping around?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Hahaha (laughing)
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
How are we going to leave?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, he‟s got a plan. Right? Or is that another thing you made up?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I have a plan! I have a plan!
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, I‟ll have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It‟s just a metaphor, dude.

A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF SLANG TERMS USED IN “GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY” MOVIE (pychanketapang.blogspot.com) 63

ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
His people are completely literal. Metaphors are gonna go over his head.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I‟m gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.

PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Those are some big guns.
THE PRISON‟S GUARD
(Preparing the shoot target to the watchtower) On my command! Number one!
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Rodent, we are ready for your plan.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Hold on! Number two!
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I recognize this animal. We‟d roast them over a flame pit as children. Their flesh was quite delicious.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Not helping!
THE PRISON‟S GUARD
Number three!
All fire on my command! Three! Two! One!

GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
He turned off the artificial gravity, everywhere but in here.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I told you I had a plan.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
That was a pretty good plan.
-------PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship. It‟s the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
The crumpled my pants up into a ball. That‟s rude! They folded yours.

That bastard didn‟t put it back.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Put what back?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Here. Get them to the ship. I will be right back.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
How are you gonna possibly...
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Just keep the Milano close by. Go. Go!
-------My neck!
-------ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Well. How‟s he gonna get to us?
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
He declined to share that information with me.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Well, screw this, then! I ain‟t waiting around for some homie with a death wish. You got the Orb,
right?
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Yes. (Checking the knapsack, but there is no Orb in there)
-------ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
If we don‟t leave now, we will be blown to bits.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
No! we‟re not leaving without the Orb.

Behold.
This one shows spirit. He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan companion, what were
you retrieving?
You‟re an imbecile.

Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing? You can‟t take apart my ship without asking me! See, what is

A bomb?

ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Yup.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
And you leave it lying around?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I was gonna put it in a box.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What‟s a box gonna do?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
How about this one?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No! Hey! Leave it alone. Shut up.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Hey!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What is that?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That‟s for if things get really hardcore. Or if you wanna blow up moons.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
No one‟s blowing up moons.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
So, listen I‟m gonna need your buyer‟s coordinates.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
We‟re heading in the right direction. For now.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
If we‟re gonna work together, you might try trusting me a little bit.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
And how much do you trust me?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I‟d trust you a lot more if you told me what this was. Because I‟m guessing it‟s some kind of weapon.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I don‟t know what it is.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
If it‟s a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Put it down, you fool. You‟ll destroy us all.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Or just you, murderess.

PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey! Nobody is killing anybody on my ship! We‟re stuck together until we get the money.

I have no interest in money.

Great.
That means more money for the three of us.
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
For the four of us. Partners.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
We have an agreement, but I would never be partners with the likes of you. I‟ll tell the buyer we‟re on
our way. And Quill, your ship is filthy.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
She has no idea. If I had a black light, the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.

You got issues, Quill.

Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in to mine the organic matter within the skull.
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid. All rare resources, highly valued in black markets across the galaxy.
It‟s dangerous and illegal work, suitable only for outlaws.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws. Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.

Yeah, you should.

GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
My father didn‟t stress diplomacy.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Thanos?
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
He‟s not my father. When Thanos took my home world, he killed my parents in front of me. He
tortured me, turned me into a weapon. When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for
Ronan, I couldn‟t stand by and... Why would you risk your life for this? (menunjuk kea rah tape milik

Who put the sticks up their butts?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What? No, that‟s just a...
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
That is cruel.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It‟s just a phrase people use.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
The melody is pleasant! No! (Peter want to kiss Gamora and Gamora become angry then put a knife
in Peter‟s neck)
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What the hell?
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
I know who you are, Peter Quill! And I am not same starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your... Your
pelvic sorcery!

PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
This is not what is happening here.
No.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Stop it!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What are you doing?
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That is true!
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
He has no respect!
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That is also true!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hold on! Hold on!
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy! You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Rocket, you‟re drunk. All right? No one‟s laughing at you.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
He thinks I‟m some stupid thing! He does! Well. I didn‟t ask to get made! I didn‟t ask to be torn
apart, and put back together, over and over, and turned into some.. Some little monster!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Rocket, no one‟s calling you a monster.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
He called me “vermin”! She called me “rodent”! Let‟s see if you can laugh after five or six good shots
to your frickin‟ face!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No, no, no, no! Four billion units! Rocket! Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one more lousy night
and you‟re rich.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Fine. But I can‟t promise, when all this is over I‟m not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
See? That‟s exactly why none of you have any friends! Five seconds after you meet somebody, you‟re
already trying to kill them!
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
We have travelled, halfway across the quadrant. And Ronan is no closer to being dead.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Drax!
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Let him go. We don‟t need him.

-------CATARINA
Milady Gamora. I‟m here to fetch you for my master.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Okay, this isn‟t creepy at all.
CATARINA
We house the galaxy‟s largest collection of fauna, relics, and species of all manners. I present to you.
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.
TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Oh, my dear Gamora. How wonderful to meet in the flesh.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Let‟s bypass the formalities, Tivan. We have what we discussed.
TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
What is that this there?
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I never thought I‟d meet a Groot.
TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Sir... (to Groot)
You must allow me to pay you now so that I may own your carcass. At the moment of your death, of
course.
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Why, so he could turn you into a frickin‟ chair?
TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
That‟s your pet?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
His what?
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Tivan. We have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.
TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Very well, then. Let us see what you brought.
-------RADIO MAN
Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of cotati seeds. No, cases. Last time, you sent me...
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
You shall send a message for me.

TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Oh, my new friends. Before creation itself, there were six singularities. Then the universe exploded
into existence, and the remnants of these systems were forged into concentrated ingots. Infinity
Stones. These stones, it seems, can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary strength. Observe.
These carriers can use the Stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
There‟s a little pee coming out of me right now.
TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Once, for a moment... a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves, but even they were
quickly destroyed by it.
(The Ord is opened) Beautiful. Beyond compare.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Blah blah blah. We‟re all very fascinated, whitey. But we‟d like to get paid.
TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
How would you like to get paid?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
What do you think fancy man? Units!
TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
Very well, then.
(Carina approach the kernel of the Orb) Carina. Stand back.
CARINA
I will no longer be your slave!
TANELEER TIVAN, THE COLLECTOR (Benicio Del Toro)
No!
(Carina hold the kernel of the Orb and Tivan‟s place be burst)
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What the f...
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
How could I think Tivan could contain whatever was within the Orb?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
What do you still have it for?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
What are we gonna do, leave it in there?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I can‟t believe you had that in your purse!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It‟s not a purse, it‟s a knapsack!
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps. There‟s a chance they can contain it.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Are you kidding me? We‟re wanted by the Nova Corps. Just give it to Ronan.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
So he can destroy the galaxy?

A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS OF SLANG TERMS USED IN “GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY” MOVIE (pychanketapang.blogspot.com) 73

ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
What are you, some saint all of a sudden? What has the galaxy ever done for you? Why would you
wanna save it?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Because I‟m one of the idiots who lives in it!
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow the Stone to fall into Ronan‟s hands. We have to go back to your
ship, and deliver it to Nova.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Right, right, okay. I think you‟re right. Or we could give it to somebody who‟s not going to arrest us,
who‟s really nice for a whole lot of money. I think it‟s a really good balance between both of your
points of view.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
You‟re despicable. Dishonorable. Faithless!
Oh no. (Gamora see if Ronan and his army are coming)
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
At last! I shall meet my foe and destroy him.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
You called Ronan?
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Quill! Don‟t you move, boy! Don‟t you move! Get out of my way!
(Ronan come out from his ship)
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Ronan the Accuser!
RONAN (Lee Pace)
You are the one who transmitted the message?
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
You killed my wife. You killed my daughter!
-------ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I told you, you can‟t fit. Now, wait here. I‟ll be back. (to Groot)
-------NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
It is Gamora. She is escaping with the Orb.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
No.

The stone is in the furthest pod.
Bring it down!

-------PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
How? We‟ve got no weaponry on these things.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
These pods are industrial grade. They‟re nearly indestructible.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Not against necroblasts, they‟re not.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
That‟s not what I‟m saying.
-------PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Let me borrow your ride.
-------(Drax still fight with Ronan)
RONAN (Lee Pace)
I don‟t recall killing your family. I doubt I‟ll remember killing you, either.
-------GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Quill, I‟m trapped. I can‟t make it to the Milano. I have to head out.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Wait! These things aren‟t meant to go out there.
NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
You are a disappointment, sister. Of all our siblings, I hate you least.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Nebula, please... If Ronan gets this stone he‟ll kill us all.
NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Not all. You will already be dead. (Nebula shoot Gamora‟s pod until shattered)

NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Ronan, it is done. (Nebula cone to pick up Ronan)
-------(Peter look at Gamora)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill, come on. Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes, but there‟s nothing we
can do for her. These pods aren‟t meant to be out here. In second, we‟re gonna be in the same boat.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Damn it. (Peter preparing to get out from the pod)

ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill! Quill, what are you doing?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Just outside Knowhere. If you‟re there, come get me. I‟m all yours.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Quill, don‟t be ridiculous. Get back into your pod! You can‟t fit two people in there. You‟re gonna
die. You‟ll die in seconds! Quill.
(Peter save Gamora after get in touch with Yondu)
-------(In Yondu‟s ship)
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Quill? What happened?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I saw you out there. I don‟t know what came over me. But I couldn‟t let you die. I found something
inside of myself. Something... incredibly heroic. I mean, not to brag, but, objectively..
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Where‟s the Orb?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
It‟s.. well, they got the Orb.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
What?
YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Welcome home, Peter.
-------(Groot save Drax then Rocket is coming)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Blasted idiot. They‟re all idiots! Quill just got himself captured. None of this ever would have
happened if you didn‟t try to single-handedly take on a frickin‟ army!
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
You‟re right. I was a fool. All the anger, all the rage, was just to cover my loss.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Oh boohoo. “My wife and child are dead” I don‟t care if it‟s mean! Everybody‟s got dead people. It‟s
no excuse to get everybody else dead along the way!
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone. The only chance we got is to get to the other side of the
universe as fast as we can and maybe, just maybe, we‟ll be able to live full lives before that whackjob ever gets there.
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.

I know there‟re the only friends that we ever had, but there‟s an army of Ravagers around them. And
there‟s only two of us!

Three.

You‟re making me beat... up grass! (while beat up grass)
-------(In the Ronan‟s ship)
RONAN (Lee Pace)
The Orb is in my possession, as I promised.
THANOS
Bring it to me.
RONAN (Lee Pace)
Yes, that was our agreement. Bring you the Orb, and you will destroy Xandar for me. However, now
that I know it contains an Infinity Stone, I wonder what use I have for you.
THANOS
Boy, I would reconsider your current course.
KORATH (Djimon Hounsou)
Master! You cannot! Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.
RONAN (Lee Pace)
Not anymore. (memegang batu Orb) You call me “boy”! I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice on
Xandar, and burn it to its core! Then, Thanos, I am coming for you.
NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
After Xandar, you are going to kill my father?
RONAN (Lee Pace)
You dare to oppose me?
NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
You see what he was turned me into. If you kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets.

saved your life!

PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Oh will you shut up about that? God! Twenty years, you been throwing that in my face, like it‟s some
great thing, not eating me. Normal people don‟t even thing about eating someone else!
Much less that person having to be grateful for it! You abducted me, man. You stole me from my
home and from my family.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
You don‟t give a damn about your Terra! You‟re scared because you‟re soft in here. Here, right here!
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Yondu. Listen to me. Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
I know what he‟s got, girl.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Then you know we must get it back! He‟s gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.
We have to warn them. Billions of people will perish.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Is that what she‟s been filling your head with, boy? Sentiment? Eating away your brain like maggots!
That‟s it.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
No!
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Sorry. Boy. But a captain‟s gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him.
YOUNDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Captain‟s gotta teach stuff!
ALL YOUNDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Yes.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
If you kill me now, you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
The Stone? I hope you got something better than that. Because ain‟t nobody stealing from Ronan.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
We got a ringer.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Is that right?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
She knows everything there is to know about Ronan. His ships, his army.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
He‟s vulnerable.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Hey, what do you say, Yondu? Me and you, talking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Hahaha... Let him go! You always did have a scrote, boy! That‟s why I kept you on as a young‟un.

Captain, the shot was non-damaging.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Attention, idiots. The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer. It‟s a weapon of my
own design.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
What the hell?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
If you don‟t hand over our companions now, he‟s gonna tear your ship a new one. A very big new
one!
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
I ain‟t buyin‟ it.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
I‟m giving you to the count of five. 5, 4, 3..
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No. wait, hold on! Rocket, it‟s me, for God sakes! We figured it out! We‟re fine!
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Oh hey, Quill. What‟s going on?
-------(In Yondu‟s ship)
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
You call that “figured it out”? we‟re gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
You want to talk about senseless? How about trying to save us by blowing us up?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
We were only gonna blow you up if they didn‟t turn you over!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
And how on earth were they gonna turn us over when you only gave them a count of five?
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
We didn‟t have time to work out the minutiae of the plan. This is what we get for acting altruistically.
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
They are ungrateful.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
What‟s important now is we get the Ravangers‟ army to help us save Xandar.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
So we can give the Stone to Yondu who‟s just gonna sell to somebody even worse?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
We‟ll figure that part out later.

GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
We have to stop Ronan.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
How?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I have a plan.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
You‟ve got a plan?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yes.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
First of all, you‟re copying me from when I said I had a plan.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No, I‟m not. People say that all the time. It‟s not that unique of a thing to say.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Secondly, I don‟t even believe you have a plan.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I have part of a plan!
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
What percentage of a plan do you have?
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
You don‟t get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I just saved Quill.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
We‟ve already established that you destroying the ship that I‟m on is not saving me.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
When did we establish it?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Like three seconds ago!
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I wasn‟t listening. I was thinking of something else.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
She‟s right. You don‟t get an opinion. What percentage?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I don‟t know. Twelve percent.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Twelve percent? Hahaha
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
That‟s a fake laugh.

ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
It‟s real!
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Totally fake.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That is the most real, authentic, hysterical laugh of my entire life because that is not a plan.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
It‟s barely a concept.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
You‟re taking their side?
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
So what, it‟s better than 11%? What the hell does that have to do with anything?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Thank you, Groot. Thank you. See? Groot‟s the only one of you has a clue. Guys. Come on. Yondu is
gonna be here in two seconds. He expects to hear this big plan of ours. I need your help. I look around
at us. You know what I see? Losers. I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff. And we have. Man, we
have. All of us. Our home, our families, normal lives. And, usually, life takes more that it gives. But
not today. Today, it‟s given us something. It has given us a chance.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
To do what?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
To give a shit. For once. Not to run away. I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch as Ronan
wipes out billions of innocent lives.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
But, Quill, stopping Ronan, it‟s impossible. You‟re asking us to die.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, I guess I am.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Quill. I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies. I will be grateful to die among my
friends.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
You are an honorable man, Quill. I will fight beside you. And in the end, I will see my wife and
daughter again.
GROOT (Vin Diesel)
I am Groot.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Huh.. what the hell. I don‟t got that long a life span, anyway. Now I‟m standing. Y‟all happy? We‟re
all standing up now. bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.

PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
All Ronan‟s got to do is touch the Stone to the planet‟s surface and zap. All plants, animals, Nova
Corps.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Everything will die.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
So Ronan does not make the surface.
-------PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole in the Dark Aster‟s Starboard hull. Then, our craft and
Yondu‟s will enter.
YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Won‟t there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.
-------GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Once they know we‟re on board, Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on
desk. Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
We‟ll make it to the flight desk, and I‟ll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone. Use these devices to contain it. If you touch it, it will
kill you.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I‟ll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us. Hopefully, they‟ll believe we‟re there to help.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
There‟s one more thing we need to complete the plan. That guy‟s eye.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
No! No, we don‟t. no, we don‟t need that guy‟s eye.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
No, seriously, I need it! It‟s important to me.

something called an Infinity Stone and he‟s headed toward Xandar.
NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Oh God.
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
It‟s a trick.
DENARIAN SAAL (Peter Serafinowics)
He‟s a criminal.
NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Did he say why we should believe him?
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
He said his crew just escaped from prison so he‟d have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to
help. He says that he‟s an “a-hole”. But he‟s not, and quoting him, here, “100% a dick”.
NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Do you believe him?
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
I don‟t know that I believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma‟am.

I mean, do you believe that he is here to help?

I want you all to know that I am grateful to your acceptance after my blunders. It is pleasing to once

PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah, sorta.
Oh no.
(Ronan's men came again to fight them and Groot finished them all by lengthening his hand)
-------RONAN (Lee Pace)
Xandar! You stand accused. You wretched peace treaty will not save you now. It is the tinder on

Hold on, Saal, just... (Saal crushed and die because being wedged by Ronan‟s ship)
Quill, you gotta hurry. The city‟s been evacuated, but we‟re getting our asses kicked down here.

Nebula! Sister, help us fight Ronan. You know he‟s crazy.
NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
I know you‟re both crazy.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
No!
(Nebula choose to cut her hand that stuck rather than be rescued by Gamora. She fell on a ship)
What the?
NEBULA (Karen Gillan)
Get out!

You did it!

Behold! Your guardians of the galaxy. What fruit have they wrought? Only that my father and his

your paltry gods!. Your salvation it at hand.

time, to Rocket who secretly making weapons to shoot Ronan)

YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Well, well, well. Quite the light show. Ain‟t this sweet. But you got some business to attend to before
all the nookie-nookie starts.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Peter, you can‟t. Peter.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu. I don‟t know who you‟re selling this to, but the only way the
universe can survive is if you give it to the Nova Corps.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
I may be as pretty as an angel, but I sure as hell ain‟t one. Hand it over, son.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yondu. Do not open that Orb. You know that, right? You‟ve seen what it does to people.
-------(In Yondu‟s ship)
YONDU‟S SUBORDINATE
Yeah, Quill turned out okay. It‟s probably good we didn‟t deliver him to his dad like we was hired to
do.
YONDU UDONTA (Michael Rooker)
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.
-------PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
He is gonna pissed when he realizes I switched out the Orb on him.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
He was gonna kill you, Peter.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I know. But he was about the only family I had.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
No. He wasn‟t.
-------PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Why would you even know this?
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
When we arrested you, we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system, so we had it checked out.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
I‟m not Terran?
NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
You are half Terran. Your mother was of Earth. Your father, well, he‟s something very ancient we‟ve
never seen here before.
GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
That could be why you were able to hold the Stone for as long as you did.

NOVA PRIME (Glenn Close)
Your friend have arrived. On behalf of the Nova Corps, we‟d like to express our profound gratitude
for your help in saving Xandar. If you will follow Denarian Dey, he has something to show you.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Thank you, Nova Prime.
-------GAMORA (Zoe Saldana)
Your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them.
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
Yes. Of course, Ronan was only a puppet. It‟s really Thanos I need to kill.
-------CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible. We salvaged as much as we could.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Wow I... Thank you.
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
I have a family. They‟re alive because of you. Your criminal records have also been expunged.
However, I have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
Question. What if I see something that I want to take, and it belongs to someone else?
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
You will be arrested.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
It‟s still illegal.
ROCKET (Bradley Cooper)
That doesn‟t follow. No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand? What are you laughing at? Why? I
can‟t have a discussion with this gentleman?
DRAX (Dave Bautista)
What if someone does something irksome and I decide to remove his spine?
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
That‟s... That‟s actually murder. It‟s one of the worst crimes of all. So... also illegal.
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
They‟ll be fine, Dey. I‟m gonna keep an eye on „em.
CORPSMAN DEY (John C. Reilly)
You?
PETER QUILL (Chris Pratt)
Yeah. Me.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 By Peter Craig 
Page 1/40
1 
Start simple. 
Start with what you know is true. 
My name is Katniss Everdeen. 
My home is District 12. 
I was in the Hunger Games. I escaped. Peeta... Peeta was left behind. 
Miss Everdeen? 
You can't be in here. 
I had a nightmare. 
Just five more minutes. 
You need to sleep. 
We can help you sleep. 
Just five more minutes. 
No. 
No, please, don't. 
It's just five more... 
Don't touch me! Don't! 
No! No! Get off of me! 
Finnick. 
I wanted to go back 
for Peeta and Johanna, 
but I... 
I couldn't move. 
They have Annie, too. They took her. She's... 
She's in the Capitol. 
I wish she was dead. 
I wish they were all dead 
and we were, too. 
Miss Everdeen. 
Colonel Boggs, 
District 13's head of security. 
I know you've been discharged, but President Coin's requested to meet with you first. Is there any news? 
I'm just here to escort you. 
We were always told 
there was nothing left of 13. 
Capitol bombed the surface to rubble. But we're military, 
so we learned to survive down here. Preparing, training. 
The war never stopped for us. 
Page 2/40
There she is. Our Girl on Fire. 
Madam President, 
may I present you with The Mockingjay. What an honour it is to meet you. You're a courageous young woman. I know how disorienting this must be. And I can't imagine what it's like to live through the atrocities of those Games. Katniss, President Alma Coin. 
Please know how welcome you are. I hope you'll find some comfort with us. We've known loss in 13, too. 
This is history. 
Right here at this table. 
I apologize. I wish you had 
more time to recover, but unfortunately, we don't have that luxury. 
Please, have a seat. 
Are you aware of what's happened? When you fired your arrow 
at the force field 
you electrified the nation. 
There have been riots and uprisings and strikes in seven districts. 
We believe that if we 
keep this energy going 
we can unify the districts 
against the Capitol. 
But if we don't, if we let it dissipate, we could be waiting another 
75 years for this opportunity. 
- Everyone in 13 is ready for this. - What about Peeta? Is he alive? I don't know. And I wish that I did. But there's no way for me to contact my operatives inside the Capitol. The Capitol has always suppressed communication between the districts. But I know their system very well. I managed to break through. 
All we need now is the perfect message. Katniss, here's what we need to do. We need to show them that 
The Mockingjay's alive and well 
Page 3/40
and willing to stand up 
and join this fight. 
'Cause we need every district 
to stand up to this Capitol. 
The way you did. 
So we're gonna shoot 
a series of propaganda clips, 
propos, I like to call them, 
on The Mockingjay. 
Spreads the word 
that we're gonna stoke 
the fire of this rebellion. 
The fire that The Mockingjay started. You left him there. 
- You left Peeta in that arena to die. - Katniss, there are so many... 
Peeta was the one 
who was supposed to live. 
Miss Everdeen. 
This revolution is about everyone. It's about all of us. 
And we need a voice. 
Then you should've saved Peeta. 
Maybe you should have 
rescued the boy instead. 
Oh, no. 
No, listen to me. 
No one else can do this but her. 
This is not the girl you described. Obviously, we need to make it personal. Remind her who the real enemy is. She knows who the enemy is. 
That's not the issue. 
Unless she's forgotten. 
There's explaining and there's showing. Let her see what the Capitol did to 12. She can't handle it. 
The Games destroyed her. 
This is the only choice you have. People don't always show up the way you want them to, Madam President. But that anger, that anger-driven defiance, that's what we want. 
And we can redirect it. 
Page 4/40
We need to unite these people out there that have been doing nothing but killing each other in an arena for years. We have to have a lightning rod. They'll follow her. 
She's the face of the revolution. Let her see it. Let her go home. Send her. 
I can't believe 
you're going through with this. You can say "no." 
I need to see it for myself. 
This way. 
13 swept everything, top to bottom so you'd be safe. 
You sure you don't 
want me to go with you? 
Yeah. I'm sure. 
We'll have our eyes on you from above. Figures. 
Hey! 
Come on. 
Don't you wanna see Prim? 
There you go. You're breakin' my heart. Egeria! 
We need to fix these lines. 
I won't say "rebels." 
These are senseless acts of defiance. And I won't legitimize them. 
We'll call them "criminals." 
"Radicals." 
Otherwise we're breaking my oldest rule. Never let them see you bleed. 
Citizens, 
tonight I address all of Panem as one. Since the Dark Days, 
Panem has had an 
unprecedented era of peace. 
It is a peace built upon cooperation. And a respect for law and order. In the past weeks, 
you have heard of sporadic violence following the actions of a few 
radicals in the Quarter Quell. 
Page 5/40
Those who choose this destructive path, your actions are based 
on a misunderstanding 
of how we have survived. Together. It is a contract. 
Each district supplies the Capitol. Like blood to a heart. 
In return, the Capitol provides order and security. 
To refuse work 
is to put the entire system in danger. The Capitol is the beating 
heart of Panem. 
Nothing can survive without a heart. The criminals that kneel before you use symbols for the purpose of sedition. Which is why all images 
of The Mockingjay 
are now forbidden. 
Possessing them will be 
considered treason. 
Punishable by death. 
Justice shall be served swiftly. Order shall be restored. 
To those who ignore 
the warnings of history, 
prepare to pay the ultimate price. It's okay. 
We're okay. 
We're all here now. 
Buttercup! 
I smuggled him in. 
I got Dad. 
And I got some of your herbs 
from the kitchen. 
They have strict rules. 
I don't know what they'll do 
if they find him here. 
You should try to eat something. Hello. Good evening. 
And a big welcome to all in Panem. I'm Caesar Flickerman. And whoever you are, whatever it is you're doing, if you're working, put down your work. If 
Page 6/40
you're having dinner, stop having dinner. Because you are going to want 
to witness this tonight. 
There has been rampant speculation about what really happened in the Quarter Quell. And here to shed a little light on the subject for us is a very special guest. Please welcome Mr. Peeta Mellark. Peeta, a lot of people 
feel as though they are in the dark. Yeah, I know how they feel. 
Now, so set the stage for us. 
Talk us through what really happened on that final and controversial night. Well, first off, you have to understand that when you're in the Games 
- you only get one wish. It's very costly. - You're alive. 
- It costs your life. 
- I think it costs more than your life. How do you mean? 
What's more than your life? 
I mean to murder innocent people, that costs everything that you are. Yes. 
So you hold on to that one wish. And that night my wish 
was to save Katniss. 
Yes. 
I should've just run off with her earlier in the day like she'd wanted. But you didn't. Why? 
Were you caught up in Beetee's plan? No, I was caught up 
trying to play allies. 
And then they separated us and... that's when I lost her. 
And then the lightning hit... 
and the whole force field 
around the arena just blew out. 
Yes, but, Peeta, 
Katniss is the one who blew it out. - No. 
- You saw the footage. 
Page 7/40
No, she didn't know what she was doing. Neither of us knew there was a 
bigger plan going on. We had no idea. - You had no idea? 
- No. 
All right. Well, Peeta, there are many who find this suspicious to say the least. It seems as though 
she was part of a rebel plan. 
Do you think it was part of her plan to be almost killed by Johanna? 
Or part of the plan to be 
paralysed by lightning? 
No, we were not part of any rebel plan. We had no idea what was going on. All right. I believe you, 
Peeta Mellark. Thank you. 
Yeah. 
And I was going to ask you 
to speak about the unrest 
- but I think you might be too upset. - No, I can. 
- Are you sure? 
- Yeah, absolutely. 
- Thank you. 
- Yeah. 
I want everyone who's watching to stop and to think about 
what a civil war could mean. 
We almost went extinct once before. And now our numbers are even fewer. - He's one of them. 
- Is this really what we wanna do? - He's a traitor. 
- Kill ourselves off? 
- Killing is not the answer. 
- I can't believe he's doing this. Everyone needs to lay down 
their weapons immediately. 
- Traitor! 
- He's not one of us! 
This is treason! 
Are you calling for a ceasefire? Yeah. I am. 
Page 8/40
- You're a puppet! 
- Hang him! 
I want everyone to stop 
the senseless violence. 
- This is not the path to change. - Traitor! 
It's not the path to justice. 
There can't be a ceasefire. 
Not after everything Snow's done. He could have done 
a lot of damage tonight. 
Most districts, people are still too afraid to join. They need the courage. 
Why do you think he said that? 
I don't know. Maybe he was forced. He didn't look that bad. 
Maybe he made some kind 
of deal to protect you. 
He's still playing the game. 
No! No! No! 
I'm sorry. It's just a nightmare. That's okay. I get 'em, too. 
Peeta, 
will you stay with me? 
Yeah. 
Always. 
Hey. 
Can't sleep? 
Tell me what's happening. 
I'm good at keeping secrets. 
Even from Mum. 
No one hates the Capitol more than me. And I wanna help. 
But I just keep thinking, 
even if we win this war, 
what happens to Peeta? 
I know he's not safe there, 
but he's definitely not safe here. I don't think you know 
how important you are to them. 
If you want something, 
you just have to ask. 
You could demand almost anything. They'd have to agree to it. 
Page 9/40
I should wake you up 
more often, Little Duck. 
Get some sleep now. 
You, too. 
Thank you for agreeing to meet with me. I've decided I'll be your Mockingjay. But I have some conditions. 
Peeta and the other Tributes, 
Johanna Mason and Annie Cresta, will be rescued 
at the earliest opportunity. 
If and when Peeta is liberated, he will receive a full and unconditional pardon. No punishment will be inflicted. And the same goes for the other Tributes. No. 
It's not their fault 
you abandoned them in the arena. They're doing and saying 
whatever they can to survive. 
Individuals don't make demands in 13. There will be a tribunal. 
And a fair judgement. 
Thank you. 
The Victors will be granted immunity. And you will announce that 
in front of the entire population of 13. You will hold yourself 
and your government responsible or you will find another Mockingjay. That's it. That's her. Right there. Isn't that who I promised you? 
She wears the costume. 
Gunfire in the background. 
A hint of smoke. 
Our Mockingjay. 
Madam President, we're losing ground, because the people are losing heart. This is worth the risk. 
She's worth the risk. 
Pardons, tribunals. Power of the people. It can all be the bedrock 
of the new Panem, but, 
in wartime I think even the noblest of Page 10/40
causes can be bent a little bit. Right? Do you have any other conditions? My sister gets to keep her cat. Go away. 
Is it visiting hours again? 
Miss Trinket, 
you see this door. 
It opens. From the inside. 
I've told you, these are the standard living quarters. Same as everyone. You're not a prisoner. 
You're free to join the rest of 13. Not looking like this. 
Thank you very much. 
We have a bigger issue 
than wardrobe, Miss Trinket. 
Katniss has agreed to be The Mockingjay. - That poor thing. 
- And your Girl on Fire is burnt out. I need you to join this team now. - I need someone she trusts. 
- What about Haymitch? 
He's drying out in some 
facility a mile down. 
Aiding rebels is not really my forte. Miss Trinket, your days 
in the Capitol are over, 
no matter what happens here. 
If you wanna play 
a prisoner of war, fine. 
Stay here and rot. I'll find someone else to be The Mockingjay's escort. Who? 
Anyone can be replaced. 
Not your Mockingjay. 
There isn't a soul in this dungeon who knows the first thing about Katniss. You honestly believe one of these cave dwellers is going to take my place? No. 
Good afternoon. 
Thank you for interrupting 
your schedules. 
They have already been 
Page 11/40
adjusted to compensate... 
I hardly ever see children around here. Please, check in with your unit... 
A lot of them were lost in 
an epidemic a few years ago. 
- I have an announcement for the citizens of 13. - Coin lost her family, too. 
Daughter and a husband. 
And our welcome guests from 12. 
Katniss Everdeen has consented 
to be the face of our cause 
to help unite the districts 
against the Capitol. 
In exchange, I have promised 
several concessions. 
First, we'll assess all opportunities for the extraction of the Victors 
held hostage in the Capitol. 
Peeta Mellark, 
Johanna Mason... 
- Finnick, I made the deal for Annie, too. - And Annie Cresta. 
Once freed, they will be granted 
full pardon for any and all crimes 
committed against the rebel cause. 
Good. 
That's good, Katniss. 
If Katniss Everdeen 
fails to fulfil her duties 
the deal will be off. 
Thank you for your attention. 
Please, resume your daily schedules. 
- Madam President. 
- Effie Trinket. 
Welcome to 13. 
Madam President, 
may I say you are so very... 
concise. 
You believe that 
there's more to be said? 
- May I speak freely? 
- You don't appear to do anything else. I'm only talking about salesmanship. 
The thing with revolutions, 
Page 12/40
they're a tender flame. 
They need to be nurtured with 
a little kindling and warmth. 
- Bit of oxygen. 
- Oxygen. 
One sure way to put it out 
is to smother it. 
Or to use up all the air in the room. Excuse me. 
You know what could use 
a revolution? That hair. 
Effie? 
- What are you doing here? 
- I'm a political refugee. 
- Plutarch rescued you? 
- Rescued, yes, that's what he calls it. You and I were both in the dark. Now I'm condemned 
to this life of jumpsuits. 
It is wonderful to see you again. Can you believe this place? 
I miss coffee. 
I never knew anyplace 
could be so strict. I mean, 
I thought at least 
in the higher ranks there'd be some... side action. I miss my wigs. 
Luckily, I remembered that this was all the rage when I was coming up. You know, everything old 
can be made new again. 
Like democracy. 
Which brings me to this. 
Cinna. 
He's dead, isn't he? 
Yes, dear. 
He made Plutarch promise 
not to show you this 
until you'd decided to be 
The Mockingjay on your own. 
He knew the risks. As we all do. He believed in this revolution. He believed in you. 
They're beautiful. 
Page 13/40
They have it. 
They have the Mockingjay outfit. 
There's not much of a prep team 
here in 13 but we will make you 
the best-dressed rebel in history. Okay. 
Bring up the lights. 
Cinna's final touch. 
Everyone's either gonna wanna 
kiss you, kill you, or be you. 
Perfect. 
Absolutely perfect. 
Okay. Let's bring up the setting. Little wind. 
Okay, Katniss, we're gonna 
start you down on one knee. 
And as you rise up, you're gonna hold your flag in the air and deliver your line. And remember you've just stormed 
the outskirts of the Capitol 
arm-in-arm with your 
brothers and sisters. 
Okay. 
Whenever you're ready. 
People of Panem, 
we fight, we dare, we... 
Does she know the line? 
- I know it. I got it. I'm sorry. - Okay, All right. 
- Let's do it again. 
- She's warming up. 
All right. With energy. Go. 
People of Panem, we fight! 
We dare to end this hunger for justice! You've just been in battle! 
I'm sorry. Excuse my outburst. 
You've just been in battle. 
Let's try it again. 
Whenever you're ready. 
People of Panem, we fight! 
We dare to end this hunger for justice. And that, my friends, 
is how a revolution dies. 
Hello, Katniss. 
Page 14/40
This how you greet an old friend? Maybe I don't recognize you sober. I guess it looks as bad as it feels. People of Panem, we fight! 
We dare! We end this hunger for justice! Madam President, 
indulge me for a moment, if you would. Let's everybody think of one incident where Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you. Not where you were jealous of her hairstyle or her dress went up in flames 
or she made a halfway 
decent shot with an arrow. 
And not where Peeta made you like her. No, I'd like you all to think of one moment where she made you feel something real. When she volunteered 
for her sister at the Reaping. 
Excellent example. 
Okay. 
I hope that wasn't important. 
Okay. "Volunteer for sister." 
Good. What else? 
When she sang that song for little Rue. Oh, yeah. 
Who didn't get choked up at that? You know, I like you better, Effie, without all that make up. 
Well, I like you better sober. 
When she chose Rue as an ally, as well. - Yes. 
- Now, what do all these have in common? No one told her what to do. 
Unscripted, yes. So maybe we 
should just leave her alone. 
And wash her face. 
She's still a girl. 
You made her look 35. 
The opportunities for spontaneity are obviously lacking below ground. So what you're suggesting 
is we toss her into combat? 
I can't sanction putting 
an untrained civilian 
Page 15/40
in battle just for effect. 
This is not the Capitol. 
That is exactly what I'm suggesting. Put her in the field. 
- No, we can't protect her. 
- It has to come from her. 
That's what people respond to. 
You want a symbol for the revolution? She cannot be coached into it. 
Trust me, I know. 
Maybe there's someplace 
that's less dangerous. 
District 8. They reported heavy bombing last week. There are no military targets left. - We can't guarantee her safety. 
- You'll never be able to guarantee my safety. - I wanna go. 
- And if you're killed? 
Make sure you get it on camera. 
I've made you some surprises. 
Maybe you wanna try one out. 
If you're gonna be a part of Katniss' propo team, you may as well look the part. And this one is for you. 
Plutarch wanted you to have a weapon for the sake of the propos but... 
I couldn't just make you 
a fashion accessory. 
It's beautiful. 
And look here. 
Regular. Incendiary. Explosive arrows. All colour-coded. 
And tell Finnick 
I've got a trident for him 
when he's ready. 
Might just cheer him... Cheer him up. Let's not fire the red ones in here. You had all of this and you just left the districts to fend for themselves? It's not that simple, Katniss. 
We barely survived. 
We weren't in any kind of shape 
to launch a counter-attack. 
Yeah, we could've bombed the Capitol Page 16/40
but they would've retaliated 
with at least twice the firepower. Then what? 
There would've been nobody 
left to claim victory. 
Sounds like exactly what Peeta said and then you all called him a traitor. This way, soldier. 
You are camera-ready. 
Doesn't your comrade look handsome? Let's go. 
Come back safe. 
Quick introductions, Katniss. 
These people have come a long way to support the cause. This is Cressida. In my opinion one of the best 
up-and-coming directors in the Capitol. - Until I up and left. Hey. 
- Hey. 
Let's see what you can do. Be careful. - This is my assistant, Messalla. - It's an honour to meet you. 
- And your cameramen over there, Castor. - Hello. 
And Pollux. 
Let's get locked in. 
You're all from the Capitol? 
Plutarch got you out? 
Don't expect much chitchat from him. He's an Avox. 
Capitol cut his tongue out years ago. And, no, it wasn't any sort of rescue, if that's what you mean. 
We all fled on our own. For this. For you. 
This has gotta be fast. In and out. Move out. 
You're alive then. We weren't sure. Katniss, Commander Paylor, District 8. Katniss has been recovering, 
but she insisted on coming out 
- and seein' some of your wounded. - Well, we've got plenty of those. We have a mass grave 
Page 17/40
a few blocks west, but, 
I can't spare the manpower 
to move them yet. 
Hospital's past that curtain. 
Any hope you can give them, 
it's worth it. 
The Capitol's done everything 
they can to break us. 
Aren't you worried about having all your wounded in one place? I think it's better 
than leaving them to die. 
- That's not what I meant. 
- Well, that's my only other option. If you can come up with another, I'm all ears. 
It's right through here. 
Don't film me in there. 
I can't help them. 
Just let them see your face. 
Excuse me. 
- Yeah. 
- You all right? 
It's okay. Here, it's okay. 
I've got you. I've got you. 
It's all right. 
Katniss Everdeen? 
What are you doing here? 
I came to see you. 
What about the baby? 
- I lost it. 
- Are you fighting, Katniss? 
You here to fight with us? 
I am. 
I will. 
Tighter. 
Tighter, tighter. 
Sir, some cameras 
were damaged in the bombings, 
but we confirmed it's her. 
Zoom in. 
She was visiting a makeshift hospital. We're not sure if she's still there. We can scramble hovercraft 
Page 18/40
from the border of 11. 
We may be able to target her. 
Kill the wounded. 
Sir... 
You wrote that speech yourself, Egeria. Any association with 
the Mockingjay symbol 
is forbidden. 
Everyone inside that hospital 
has committed treason. 
Show them what it costs 
to be friends with Katniss Everdeen. Your mom's gonna be proud of you 
when she sees the footage. 
- Will this play in the districts? - It'll be tattooed on their eyes. - There's a problem. 
- What kinda problem? 
Incoming bombers from the north. 
- We need to find cover now. 
- There's a bunker in there. 
Straight ahead and down the stairs. Katniss! 
Katniss! 
Everdeen! 
Everdeen! 
Gale, back away from the wall! 
You okay? 
Move! 
- They're going after something to the south. - That's towards the hospital. 
They're circling back around. Come on! That's the hospital. 
They're targeting the hospital. 
Help them! 
Help them! Get them out! 
Katniss? 
Katniss, can you tell everyone 
what you're seeing right now? 
Katniss, what do you wanna say? 
I want the rebels 
to know that I'm alive. 
That I'm in District 8 
where the Capitol just bombed a hospital Page 19/40
filled with unarmed men, 
women and children. 
And there will be no survivors. If you think for one second that the Capitol will ever treat us fairly you are lying to yourselves. 
Because we know who they are 
and what they do. 
This is what they do! 
And we must fight back. 
I have a message for President Snow. You can torture us and bomb us 
and burn our districts to the ground. But do you see that? 
Fire is catching. 
And if we burn, you burn with us! We know who they are and what they do. This is what they do! 
And we must fight back. 
You can torture us and bomb us 
and burn our districts to the ground. Plutarch's faith in you 
wasn't misplaced. 
- But do you see that? 
- Thank you. 
- Fire is catching. 
- Come up with me for the beginning. And if we burn, you burn with us! There is no progress without compromise. No victory without sacrifice. 
But I stand here with The Mockingjay to announce that our moment has arrived. Beetee has increased 
our use of the airwaves tenfold. We will broadcast this message 
to all the districts tonight. 
The Mockingjay's words inspiring everyone to join the rebellion. Together, we will become 
an alliance to be reckoned with. Hoorah! Hoorah! Hoorah! 
You don't like hearing 
a fight song at a funeral? 
The more people on our side, 
Page 20/40
the closer we are to Peeta and Annie. Yeah. 
By order of President Snow daily production quotas have been increased. 
All work shifts will be extended 
by an extra two hours. 
Failure to meet these quotas 
will not be tolerated. 
By order of President Snow daily 
production quotas have been increased. If we burn, you burn with us! 
Yeah! 
Yeah! 
- I got good news. 
- What? 
Coin agreed to let us hunt above ground. He's not even afraid of us. 
It's 'cause they've 
never been hunted before. 
It's almost not fair. 
They want us back. 
- They asked us to head for Command. - All right. I gotta drop these off. She was arguably 
our favourite Tribute. 
And I think that's what 
we all find most astonishing, 
is that this girl was 
adored in the Capitol. 
And I think for you, Peeta, 
it must be particularly painful. 
I wish I could give 
this rose to you, Katniss. 
He's changed so much already. 
What are they doing to him? 
A sweet gesture for a girl 
who has inspired such violence. 
You must love her very much 
to be able to forgive her. 
- He's shaking. 
- I don't think that I could. 
Unless, of course, Peeta, 
you think that perhaps she's being forced into saying things that 
Page 21/40
she doesn't even understand. 
Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what I think. - Even his voice is different. 
- I think they're using her to whip up the rebels. I doubt she even knows what's happening. And what's really at stake. 
Now, Peeta, I doubt that the rebels 
will ever let her see this. 
But if they do, 
what would you say to her? 
To Katniss Everdeen, the once sweet Katniss Everdeen. What would you say to her? 
I would... I would tell her 
to think for herself. 
Yes. 
Don't be a fool, Katniss. 
I know you never wanted the rebellion. The things that you did in the Games 
were never intended to start all of this. The rebels have made you 
into something that you're not. 
Something that could destroy all of us. So if you have any power or any say 
in what they do or how they use you, 
please, please, urge them to stop 
this war before it's too late. 
And ask yourself, can you trust 
the people you're working with? 
- Do you know what they really want? 
- We need to respond. 
Thank you, Peeta Mellark, for these 
revelations about the real Mockingjay. - Did you see what he looks like? 
- I saw a coward. 
- You don't have any idea what he's going through. - I don't care. 
I would never say what he just said. 
Not if they tortured me. 
Not with a gun to my head. 
That is the same Peeta that 
defended you at the whipping post. 
No, it's not. 
Now he's only defending himself. 
Coin's called a meeting. 
Page 22/40
We need to respond. 
When did "we" become you and Coin? Everyone has a choice. 
How can he sit there in the Capitol and defend the people who destroyed his home and murdered his family? 
He doesn't know. 
How could he? Nobody's seen 
what the Capitol did to 12. 
I have to show them. 
So I wanna start with you 
in front of the Justice Building, okay? Bang. First shot. 
Katniss, tell us what happened here. We were all standin' right here 
watchin' the Games 
when you fired that arrow. 
The screens just went dark. 
Nobody had any idea what happened. Peacekeepers forced us 
back into our homes. 
For maybe an hour, 
the town was just dead quiet. 
Little past 9: 
we heard their trucks pullin' out. All of them. Every single Peacekeeper. And I knew what that meant. 
Me and a couple of guys from the mines, we started pulling people from their houses and tried to get 'em to the fence line but a lotta people were scared of the forest. So they headed up onto the road. 
Make a break for it that way. 
Stay with Gale. 
915 of us made it to the fence. 
Then we watched as... 
bombers circled back towards the road. They firebombed them as they ran away. 915 outta 10,000. 
I should've grabbed people. 
I should've dragged 'em with me. 
- Some of the kids I could've carried. - You saved so many people, Gale. 
Page 23/40
Without you, there would be no District 12. Not even the memory of it. 
This is where you kissed me. 
I didn't think you remembered that. I'd have to be dead to forget that. Maybe not even then. 
I knew you'd do that. 
How? I didn't. 
'Cause I'm in pain. 
That's the only way 
that I can get your attention. 
Don't worry, Katniss. It'll pass. Hey. 
Yeah, that's a Mockingjay. 
Well, now they'll never shut up. 
You want me to sing? 
Are you, are you. 
Coming to the tree. 
They strung up a man. 
They say who murdered three. 
Strange things did happen here 
No stranger would it be. 
If we met at midnight. 
In the hanging tree. 
Are you, are you. 
Coming to the tree. 
Where the dead man called out 
for his love to flee. 
Strange things did happen here 
No stranger would it be. 
If we met at midnight. 
In the hanging tree. 
Are you, are you. 
Coming to the tree. 
Where I told you to run. 
So we'd both be free. 
Strange things did happen here 
No stranger would it be. 
If we met at midnight. 
In the hanging tree. 
That line was originally 
"necklace of rope." 
I had it changed to "necklace of hope." Wow. You are a true wordsmith. 
Page 24/40
Little on the nose, but, 
of course, so is war. 
- Every district's seeing this? - Yes. But not the Capitol. 
I designed this signal 
defence system for them. 
But I can't find my way through it. Guess I did my job too well. 
At the time, I was just thinking of the science of it all. 
We'll get through it. 
Moves and countermoves. 
Katniss, you're wanted in Command. Tonight, we've received reports of derailed trains, 
of granaries on fire, 
and of a savage attack on the 
hydroelectric dam in District 5. What have they done to you? 
I'm begging for restraint and decency. We interrupt your regularly 
scheduled horse manure 
to bring you... 
- That's it. That's our footage. - Beetee's in. 
- Katniss? 
- He sees it. He sees our propo. - Katniss, are you there? 
- Peeta. 
Katniss? 
Peeta, please continue. 
You were telling us about 
these savage attacks. 
Yeah. 
The attack on the dam 
was a callous 
and inhuman act of destruction... Think about it. 
How will this end? What will be left? No one can survive this. 
No one is safe now. 
Not here in the Capitol. 
Not in any of the districts. 
They're coming, Katniss. 
Page 25/40
They're gonna kill everyone. 
And in District 13 
you'll be dead by morning. 
- He's warning us. That was a warning. - Yes, it was. 
We have to get him out 
before they kill him. 
- Is there anything in the air? 
- Nothing on Doppler, ma'am. 
He was in the mansion. 
He could have overheard something. Possibly. 
It's time for an air raid drill. This is a code red alert. Please, remain calm and begin evacuation protocol. - Prim! Prim! 
- Proceed to your nearest stairwell and descend to level 40. 
Blast doors will be 
sealed in six minutes. 
This is a code red alert. Please, remain calm and begin evacuation protocol. Proceed in an orderly fashion to your nearest stairwell and descend to level 40. Madam President, three Capitol 
squadrons just entered our airspace. - How much time do we have? 
- They're a few seconds from range. - Prepare to scramble the fleet. - Copy that. 
Open up short-range air defence. Arm long-range missiles 
for counter-attack. 
This is a code red alert. Please, remain calm and begin evacuation protocol. Proceed in an orderly fashion to your nearest stairwell and descend to level 40. Blast doors... 
This is a code red alert. 
Please, remain calm... 
This is a code red alert. 
Proceed in an orderly fashion... Come on. Come on, hon. 
Continue to the Supply Station 
Page 26/40
and claim one pack 
for each member of your compartment. Please keep all personal items 
within your assigned area. 
Be courteous to your fellow citizens. This is a code red alert. 
All citizens should be 
inside the bunker. 
- Blast doors will close in two minutes. - Mum! 
- Where's Prim? 
- I thought she went to find you. - She must still be on the stairs. - There's no one on the stairs. She went back for the cat. 
This is a code red alert. 
All citizens should be 
inside the bunker. 
Hey, stop! Stop! 
Blast doors will close in one minute. They hit the far edge of the 
Northwest quadrant. Penetrated 40 feet. Missed the living quarters. 
Only minor damage to corridors 2 and 3. - Is there any radiation? 
- None detected. 
Doppler shows a fourth wave approaching. - Blast doors will close in 30 seconds. - Prim! 
- Prim! 
- Katniss! 
- This is a code red alert. 
- Katniss! 
- Blast doors will close in 15 seconds. - Keep moving, keep moving! 
Get down here! 
- Hurry! 
- This is a code red alert. 
- Come on! 
- Blast doors will close in 10 seconds. Nine... 
- Eight... 
- Come on! 
Seven... 
Page 27/40
Six... 
- Five... 
- Hold the doors! 
Four... 
Three... 
- Two... 
- Wait! Hold the doors! 
One. 
You went back for the cat? 
What were you thinking? 
I wasn't gonna leave him behind. I couldn't live with myself. 
Blast doors are now sealed. 
I know, Prim. 
Let's go. 
Damage to the aquifer in the Northwest quadrant. We lost a transport corridor. There's nothing else in the Northwest. Our surface-to-air launchers 
just took a direct hit in sector 3. Because we revealed ourselves. They saw us firing there. 
Stand down. Don't launch the fleet. Another 12 Capitol bombers approaching sector 3 in attack formation. 
Hold fire on their approach. 
What'd they hit? 
Bedrock. But there's debris 
in the ventilation shaft. 
- They're not targeting our fleet. - Or our Special Weaponry. 
They don't know what we have 
or where we have it. 
Can you confirm that everyone's safely in the bunker? 
Already done. 
Conceal all remaining 
anti-aircraft guns. 
Seal launching pads 
and ventilation corridors. 
We are gonna wait this out. 
This is what we're built for. 
They'll seal us in here like a tomb. The Capitol's working off 
Page 28/40
some outdated information. 
- I'd rather not update it for them. - Madam President, I know it's not my place... It's not. You're a welcome guest, 
but you're out of your depth down here. - Reduce oxygen to 14% to conserve it. - Copy that. 
Take a deep breath, Mr. Heavensbee. It's gonna be a long night. 
Prim, talk about something. Anything. They promoted me at the hospital. 
I forgot to tell you. 
They're training me to be a doctor. They'd be stupid not to. 
Hey. 
- Can I sit? 
- Yeah. 
Snow's using Annie to punish you. 
He's taunting us with them. 
I didn't understand until just now 
watching that stupid cat. 
After your first Games, 
I thought the whole romance was an act. We all expected you 
to continue that strategy. 
But it wasn't until 
Peeta's heart stopped 
and he nearly died that... 
I knew I'd misjudged you. 
You love him. 
I'm not saying in what way. 
Maybe you don't even know yourself. But anyone paying attention can see it. How do you live with it? 
I drag myself outta nightmares 
and there's no relief in waking up. But... it's better not to give in to it. Takes 10 times longer to put yourself back together than it does to fall apart. Katniss? Katniss? 
Come with me. 
We took their best shot. Didn't we? Yeah. 
- Your mother and sister okay? 
Page 29/40
- Yeah, they're fine. 
I need you to do something for us. I need you to tell Panem that we survived an attack by the Capitol with no casualties. 
And we remain fully operational. Okay. 
You should know something. 
We had eight extra minutes of civilian evacuation because of Peeta's warning. I won't forget that. 
Thank you. 
So Katniss, it's "13 is alive 
and well and so am I." 
Katniss? 
Katniss. 
Never one to waste it 
in rehearsal, I know. 
Why would they drop these? 
For me. 
Ready to go, Katniss? 
We're gonna do this, 
just like District 8. 
Tell me about the roses. 
Tell Snow 13 is alive and well. He's gonna kill Peeta. 
Let's try again. Can you speak up? We don't have a mic on you. 
"13 is alive and well and so am I." He's gonna kill Peeta. 
- I can't. 
- Katniss? 
- You can do it, Katniss. 
- I can't do this. 
"13 is alive and well and so am I." He's just gonna keep... 
He's never gonna stop. 
- Cressida, we should cut the cameras. - It's okay, Katniss. 
No. He warned me. 
He warned me about this. 
He's doing this because 
I'm The Mockingjay. 
He's punishing Peeta to punish me. Page 30/40
No. 
- No, I can't do this. 
- Katniss. 
- Don't make me do this! 
- Let her go. 
I got... I gotta get out of here. So this is the end? 
I suppose you're just gonna 
hide down here forever? 
I can't be The Mockingjay. 
Not The Mockingjay. Just Katniss. You know, you're the only 
real friend I have down here. 
I don't suppose they gave you 
any kind of medication? 
- You're unbelievable. 
- Okay, but I meant what I said. Look, the reason I'm here 
is to let you know 
they're rescuing Peeta. 
- What? 
- The dam went down in District 5, took out most of the power to the Capitol. Knocked out their signal defence. Beetee's inside their system now, wreaking all kinds of havoc. 
A window is open to us. 
How much longer? I don't know. 
I guess until the Capitol 
can get the power back on. 
And President Coin? 
You know, I can never fully support that woman in light of the... 
prohibition they have 
going on around this place, but... Plutarch got word that Peeta and the others are in the Tribute Centre. And with the power out, 
Coin sees this as an opportunity. She knows that Peeta is the Capitol's weapon. The same way you're ours. And as opposed to having you two pointing at each other, 
she's going to get him. 
Page 31/40
- I have to go help. 
- Hey, hey, whoa, kiddo. Wait. 
Come on. What, are you just gonna jump out of the vent and go storm the Capitol? Besides, it's already under way. Six soldiers went in. Volunteer only. And guess who was 
the first brave soul to sign up. Gale. 
- Okay, Finnick? 
- Yeah. Yeah. 
Go in the centre there. 
Those rocks. 
Castor, to the left. 
Pollux, you're with me. 
So we'll go straight to camera. 
Okay? Finnick? 
Yeah. 
Okay. Take your time. 
Just remember to keep talking 
and don't stop. 
This is Finnick Odair. 
Winner of the 65th Hunger Games. And I'm coming to you 
from District 13, alive and well. We've survived an assault 
from the Capitol. 
But I'm not here 
to give you recent news. 
- Why is Finnick doing a propo? 
- It's a lot more than that. 
- Beetee's commandeered the system. - Now that they're down to generator power there's a more limited range of 
frequencies available to them. 
And I'm filling them 
all up with Finnick. 
Not many will see it, but whoever does will think it's another propo. 
What they don't know is this broadcast is jamming their entire system with noise. Early defence warning, 
internal communications, everything. As long as the broadcast goes through, 
Page 32/40
our team should be able 
to get in and out undetected. 
The truth. 
Not the myths about a life of luxury. Not the lie about glory 
for your homeland. 
You can survive the arena. 
The moment you leave, you're a slave. Mockingjay One, Mockingjay One, you are one minute out from perimeter defence. - Going dark. 
- Stay low in case they're online. President Snow used to sell me. 
Or my body, at least. 
I wasn't the only one. 
If a Victor is considered desirable, the President gives them as a reward or allows people to buy them. 
If you refuse, he kills someone you love. Mockingjay One, you are 20 seconds from perimeter defence. 
Ten seconds. 
Nine... Eight... 
Seven... Six... Five... 
Four... Three... Two... 
One. 
No response from perimeter defence. We're inside Capitol airspace. 
To make themselves feel better, my patrons would make presents of money or jewellery. But I found a much more 
valuable form of payment. 
Secrets. 
Gear up. 
Switching to Night View. 
There. 
Command, we have visual 
on the Tribute Centre. 
Initiating final approach. 
Masks on. 
See, I know all the depravity, 
the deceit and the cruelty 
of the Capitol's pampered elite. But the biggest secrets are about 
Page 33/40
our good President, Coriolanus Snow. Open the door. 
Command, this is Team Leader. 
Prepare to deploy gas. 
We will confirm once inside. 
Such a young man when he rose to power. Such a clever one to keep it. 
How, you may ask, did he do it? One word. 
Poison. 
Get ready to drop. 
He stopped every mutiny 
before it even started. 
Clear. 
Clear. Command, we're inside. 
Heading toward target number one. Cell P45 lower level 2C. 
Gas. 
There are so many mysterious deaths to adversaries. 
Even to allies who were threats. Snow would drink from the same cup, to deflect suspicion. 
But antidotes don't always work, which is why he wears roses 
that reek of perfume. 
Help cover the scent of blood from sores in his mouth that will never heal. Gale. 
But he can't hide the scent of who he really is. He kills without mercy. He rules with deception and fear. His weapon of choice 
is the only thing suited to such a man. Poison. The perfect weapon for a snake. What is this place? 
- Beetee? 
- I'm losing them. 
Powering back up. 
Ma'am, the Capitol air defence system is rebooting. It's coming back online. Must be diverting power 
from another source. 
And filtering transmissions. 
Page 34/40
Another 60 seconds and we'll be cut off. Madam President, should we 
call back the hovercraft? 
Broadcast me. 
If Snow's watching this, maybe he'll let the signal in, if he sees me. Put me on the air so he can see me. - Yes. Yes. 
- Put her on. 
Can we do this? Can we still get in? Yes. For the moment. The line's open. He will only see you. 
Okay, Katniss, go. 
President Snow? 
President Snow. It's Katniss. 
- There's no guarantee he's even watching. - President Snow? 
- I know, but he might be. 
- President Snow, I need to speak with you. Are you there? 
President Snow, it's Katniss. 
Can you hear me? 
I need to speak with you. 
President Snow, it's Katniss. 
President Snow, are you there? 
Can you hear me? 
- President Snow... 
- Miss Everdeen. What an honour. 
I don't imagine you're calling 
to thank me for the roses. 
I never asked for this. 
I never asked to be in the Games. - Boggs? Come in. Boggs? 
- I never asked to be The Mockingjay. Just wanted to save my sister. 
And keep Peeta alive. 
Come in. Boggs? 
Please, just let him go. 
And I will stop being The Mockingjay. I will disappear. You will never 
have to see me ever again. 
Miss Everdeen. 
- Boggs, come in. 
- You couldn't run from this... 
Page 35/40
any more than you could have 
run from the Games. 
- Command, I need a situation report. - Boggs, we're running out of time. Hurry. Let's move. 
Please. 
You've won. 
You've already beaten me. 
Release Peeta. And take me instead. We're long past the opportunity 
for noble sacrifice. 
Then tell me what to do. 
I've always kept my promises, haven't I? You said you didn't want a war. 
And that's just what's happened. I told you what a fragile 
thing peace was. 
And still, like a child, 
you took pleasure in breaking it. I know what you are. 
I know you can't see 
past your narrowest concerns. 
But please, Miss Everdeen. 
I doubt you know 
what honesty is anymore. 
Command, we're at the first target. Preparing to extract Peeta. 
Will confirm when he's in hand. 
Mockingjay One, 
prepare hovercraft for evac. 
You asked me to convince you 
that I was in love with Peeta. 
Haven't I at least done that? 
Miss Everdeen, 
it's the things we love most 
that destroy us. 
I want you to remember 
that I said that. 
Don't you think I know your friends are in the Tribute Centre? 
Cut them off. 
- Boggs, come in. 
- What happened? 
Boggs, come in. Do you read me? 
Page 36/40
- He knows that they're in there. It's a trap. - Katniss, hold it. 
We have to get a hold of them. 
We have to tell them to get out. He knows. There's no signal. 
We can't contact them. 
No. Haymitch, he knew the whole time. He was taunting me. 
- No, Haymitch. They're in there. 
- No, we don't know that. 
Did I lose them both tonight? 
Did I lose them both tonight? 
Did I lose them both tonight? 
Did I lose them? I lost them both. 
No! No! 
There's no news. 
I'm sorry. 
It's the worst torture in the world. Waiting, when you know 
there's nothing you can do. 
Especially for people like us. 
But whatever 
strength, courage, 
madness, 
keeps us going, you find it, 
at times like these. 
You have it, soldier. 
It's what's kept you 
alive all this time. 
And it won't fail you now. 
They're back. 
I don't want that. 
Johanna. 
Finnick! 
Finnick! 
Annie? Annie! Annie! 
You're safe. You're safe. 
Gale! 
Are you okay? 
What? What is it? 
I don't get it. Every gun was back online and on us and we flew right past them. They let us go. 
He's in there. 
Page 37/40
The gas we used on the guards knocked him out, too, but it's wearing off now. You should be there when he wakes up. Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Peeta. 
Peeta! 
Peeta! Get off! Get off of her! Let go! 
No, Katniss. 
No, you're swollen. Don't touch. No, no, no. Calm down. 
Calm down. You're okay. 
Tell her she's awake. 
- Pee... 
- Don't try to talk. 
Peeta's okay. I promise. 
I just had to get him off you. 
It's called hijacking. 
We don't know how long the Capitol's been doing this to Peeta. 
It's fear conditioning. 
Enhanced with tracker jacker venom. You were stung your first Games. Remember? 
The venom puts the subject 
in a dissociative state. 
And they torture him. 
With shocks and beatings, 
and strip down his identity. 
And then all of that suffering 
and fear is redirected. 
Associated with other memories 
or a person. 
They can change his memories of Katniss? To make her seem life-threatening. They turned him into a weapon, Katniss. To kill you. 
But you can reverse it? 
The fear is the most difficult 
thing to overcome. 
We're hardwired to remember fear best. It's new terrain. 
But we've put together a team. 
Page 38/40
I'm optimistic. 
Good evening. 
Yesterday, I authorized a covert rescue mission inside the Capitol. I am pleased to announce 
that the Victors have been liberated! Let this day mark an historic change. With The Mockingjay 
and the Victors beside us, 
we have sent a clear message 
to the Capitol. 
That we will never again 
endure injustice. 
Today, a day on which 
we reunited family, 
friends, and loved ones. 
Let all of Panem come together. Not to battle for the amusement of the Capitol. 
But to join hands in this fight. Let today be the day we promise never to give up, 
never to give in 
until we have made a new Panem, where leaders are elected, 
not imposed upon us. 
And where the districts are free to share the fruits of their labours and not fight one another for scraps! This new Panem is on the horizon. But we must take it for ourselves. The road there leads through 
the sharp mountains 
and deep ravines of District 2. There in the heart of Panem's 
steepest mountain range 
lies the Capitol's principal 
military facility. 
We can conquer this stronghold because we are one people, 
one army, one voice. 
Because today is our new beginning. Today we have freed the Victors. Tomorrow, Panem!

Maleficent By Linda Woolverton 
Page 1/21
1 
Let us tell an old story anew, and we will see how well you know it. Once upon a time, 
there were two kingdoms 
that were the worst of neighbors. So vast was the discord between them that it was said only a great hero or a terrible villain 
might bring them together. 
In one kingdom 
lived folk like you and me, 
with a vain and greedy king 
to rule over them. 
They were forever discontent, 
and envious of the wealth 
and beauty of their neighbors. For in the other kingdom, the Moors, lived every manner of strange 
and wonderful creature. 
And they needed 
neither king nor queen, 
but trusted in one another. 
In a great tree 
on a great cliff in the Moors 
lived one such spirit. 
You might take her for a girl, but she was not just any girl. She was a fairy. 
There you go. 
And her name 
was Maleficent. 
Good morning, Mr. Chanterelle! I love your cap! 
No. No, don't do it! 
You missed me! 
- Good morning. 
- Good morning. 
Lovely work, girls! 
What's all the fuss about? 
The border guards have discov... Why do you get to tell her? 
I want to tell her! 
I want to! 
Page 2/21
There are rules, Flittle. 
I tell this time, you tell next time. No, you told last time, 
so I should tell this time, 
and Thistlewit next time. 
Tell me what? 
Fine! 
Thank you. 
Maleficent, the border guard... The border guards have found 
a human thief at the pool of jewels. I'm sorry. 
She's always in a hurry, 
with her big wings. 
Humans, here. 
I hope there's not another war. I'm not afraid. 
Besides, 
I have never seen a human up close. Come out! 
No. They mean to kill me. 
And besides, they're hideous to look at. That's extremely rude. 
Don't listen to him, Balthazar. You're classically handsome. 
It's not right to steal, 
but we don't kill people for it. Come out. 
Come out this instant! 
Are you fully grown? 
No. 
I believe he's just a boy. 
And you're just a girl. 
I think. 
Who are you? 
I'm called Stefan. 
Who are you? 
I'm Maleficent. 
Yes, right. 
You have to give it back. 
Give what back? 
If I knew you would throw it away, I would have kept it. 
I didn't throw it away. 
Page 3/21
I delivered it home, 
as I'm going to do for you. 
Someday, you know, I'll live there. In the castle. 
Where do you live now? 
In a barn. 
So your parents are farmers, then? My parents are dead. 
Mine, too. 
We'll see each other again. 
You really shouldn't 
come back here, you know. 
It's not safe. 
And if I made that choice, 
if I came back, would you be here? Perhaps. 
- What's wrong? 
- Your ring. 
Iron burns fairies. 
I'm sorry. 
I like your wings. 
Maleficent thought of how 
Stefan cast away his ring, 
he who had so little in the world, so that their hands might touch again, and her heart was moved. 
Thus did the young thief 
who had hoped to steal a jewel... Maleficent! 
...steal something far more precious. Maleficent? 
Maleficent! 
After all these weeks, 
look who came back. 
I thought it worth the risk. 
So, what do you do for fun? 
Stefan and Maleficent became 
the most unlikely of friends. 
And for a time it seemed as if, in them at least, 
the old hatred between men and fairies had been forgotten. 
As it will, friendship slowly 
turned into something else. 
Page 4/21
And on her 16th birthday, 
Stefan gave Maleficent a gift. He told her it was true love's kiss. But it was not to be. 
As the years passed, Stefan's ambition pulled him away from Maleficent, and towards the temptations 
of the human kingdom. 
While Maleficent, 
the strongest of the fairies, 
rose to become 
the protector of the Moors. 
Maleficent often wandered alone and sometimes wondered 
where Stefan might be, 
for she had never understood 
the greed and envy of men. 
But she was to learn. 
For the human king had heard 
of a growing power in the Moors, and he sought to strike it down. Guard, halt! 
Guard, halt! 
There they are, 
the mysterious Moors 
where no one dares to venture 
for fear of the magical creatures that lurk within. 
Well, I say crush them! 
Go no further! 
A king 
does not take orders from a winged elf. You are no king to me. 
- Bring me her head. 
- Battalion! 
Advance! 
Arise and stand with me! 
Hold the line! 
- It's the dark creatures! 
- It's the dark creatures! 
Charge! 
You! 
To the king! 
You will not have the Moors! 
Page 5/21
Not now, nor ever! 
You... 
When I ascended to the throne, I promised the people 
one day we would take 
the Moors and its treasures. 
Each of you 
swore allegiance to me 
and to that cause. 
Your Majesty. 
Defeated in battle. 
Is this to be my legacy? 
I see you waiting for me to die. It won't be long. But what then? I will choose a successor 
to take the throne 
and care for my daughter. 
Who among you 
is worthy? 
Kill the winged creature. 
Avenge me, 
and upon my death 
you will take the crown. 
Maleficent. 
Maleficent! 
So, how is life with the humans? Maleficent, I've come to warn you. They mean to kill you. 
King Henry will stop at nothing. Please, you have to trust me. 
They spoke of many things, 
and the years faded away. 
And she forgave Stefan 
his folly and his ambition, 
and all was as it had been long ago. You thirsty? 
Maleficent? 
What is this? 
I have avenged you, sire. 
She is vanquished? 
You have done well, my son. 
You have done 
what others feared to do. 
You will be rewarded. 
Page 6/21
I shall do my best 
to be a worthy successor, 
Your Majesty. 
I've got you! 
- You wicked bird! 
- lnto a man. 
It's a... 
It's a demon! 
What have you done 
to my beautiful self? 
Would you 
rather I let them beat you to death? I'm not certain. 
Stop complaining. 
I saved your life. 
Forgive me. 
What do I call you? 
Diaval. 
And in return for saving my life, I am your servant. 
Whatever you need. 
Wings. 
I need you to be my wings. 
I present to you the first of his line, His Royal Highness King Stefan. He did this to me so he would be king. Now what, Mistress? 
Her wings! 
It's a girl! 
It's a girl! It's a girl! 
Well? 
Well, I saw nothing. 
But there's been a... 
What? 
Child. 
King Stefan and the Queen 
have had a child. 
There will be a christening. 
They say it's to be a grand celebration. A grand celebration for a baby. How wonderful. 
All manner of folk 
came to the christening, 
even a trio of fairies who sought Page 7/21
to foster peace and goodwill. 
Look, there's the baby! 
I love babies! 
Can you just concentrate, please? I'm not telling you again. 
Greetings, Your Majesty. 
I am Knotgrass 
of the Moorland Fair Folk. 
I'm Flittle, Your Kingship. 
And I'm Thistlewit, Your Royalnesses. They bring gifts for our daughter. These are not just any old gifts, for, you see, we're magic! 
And very good with children. 
Very well. 
Sweet Aurora, I wish for you 
the gift of beauty. 
My wish is that you will never be blue, only happy, all the days of your life. Sweet baby, 
my wish for you is that you find... - Maleficent! 
- Maleficent! 
Well, well. 
What a glittering assemblage, 
King Stefan. 
Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and... How quaint. 
Even the rabble. 
I must say 
I really felt quite distressed 
at not receiving an invitation. You're not welcome here. 
Oh, dear. 
What an awkward situation. 
You're not offended? 
Why, no. 
And to show I bear no ill will, I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child. No! We don't want your gift! 
Stay away from the princess! 
Yes, stay away! 
Listen well, all of you. 
Listen well, all of you. 
Page 8/21
The princess shall indeed 
grow in grace and beauty, 
beloved by all who meet her. 
That's a lovely gift. 
Don't do this. 
But 
before the sun sets 
on her 16th birthday, 
she will prick her finger 
on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a sleep like death, a sleep from which 
she will never awaken. 
Maleficent, please don't do this, I'm begging you. 
I like you begging. 
Do it again. 
I beg you. 
All right. 
The princess can be woken 
from her death sleep, 
but only by 
true love's kiss. 
This curse will last till the end of time! No power on Earth can change it. King Stefan ordered his men 
to seize every spinning wheel 
in the kingdom. 
The wheels were broken and burned, that they might never be used, 
and thrown into the deepest dungeon in the castle. 
Secretly, he entrusted 
the safety of the child 
to the magic of the pixies, 
who would take her to a remote 
hideaway for 16 years and a day. Stefan shut himself behind 
the walls of his castle 
while his soldiers rode far and wide to hunt Maleficent down. 
But she made walls of her own, 
that the Moors might 
never again suffer the touch 
Page 9/21
of any human. 
And she reveled in the sorrow 
that her curse had brought. 
The fairies began their charge 
to raise Aurora in a snug little cottage in the woods. 
No! Is this it? 
Looks dreadful. 
Come on. 
We need a smaller... 
Baby 
Or bigger bodies. 
No, what we need is a proper disguise. What do you mean? 
Well, we have to blend in, don't we? We have to be big enough 
to look after this baby. 
So, gather around, ladies. 
Get ready. One, two, three, grow! That's worked quite well. 
That's very nice. 
Now, there will be no questions asked. We are no longer fairies. 
We are three peasant women 
raising our orphan child in the woods. - Yes. 
- So, no more flying. 
- No flying? 
- No, no, and no magic. 
- No magic? 
- Yes, you heard. 
It's in the middle of nowhere. 
At least no one will find us here. There you are. 
Why are you always hiding? 
Come on. There you go. 
It's so ugly, you could 
almost feel sorry for it. 
I hate you. Beasty. 
The fairies were 
perhaps unequal to their task. 
Why is she crying? 
I think she might be hungry. 
Then feed her! 
Page 10/21
There you are. 
There you go. 
It's going to starve 
with those three looking after it. It tickles. 
- What? 
- You're cheating. 
I saw that! 
- We're starting again. 
- Suit yourself. 
Greedy, bloated goat! 
"Bloated goat." 
Stop doing that. 
I'm not doing anything. 
Well, someone is. 
It's not me. 
You two are having a go at me, and I will not tolerate... 
Stop it! 
Why... 
No! 
This is all your fault! 
Come on. That's funny. 
As the days went on, Stefan darkened, further consumed 
by paranoia and vengeance. 
- Burn it all down! 
- Yes, sir! 
Flame! 
Release! 
Run! 
You failed me. 
The wall cannot be burned. 
It is indestructible. 
Nothing is indestructible! 
Not the wall! Not Maleficent! 
Not even her curse! 
Bring me the iron workers. 
You! 
Look. 
The little beast is about 
to fall off the cliff. 
What? 
Hello. 
Page 11/21
Go away. 
Go. 
Go away. 
I don't like children. 
Up, UP 
Go along. Go, go, go. 
As Maleficent had said, 
Aurora did grow in grace and beauty. Pretty bird. 
Far away from the lofty palace that she remembered not. 
And as the seasons changed 
and the flowers grew, 
so did she. 
Hello. 
That's it. 
There you go. 
She wondered at the world about her, and at what lay beyond 
the fearsome wall of thorns. 
Curious little beasty. 
But she was not the only one 
who wished to get through. 
Look. 
- Is that her? Is that Maleficent? - I don't know. 
Bring them to me. 
No, it's just a silly peasant girl. Steady. 
- It's her! 
- It's her! 
How could you do that to me? 
You said anything I need. 
Yeah, but not a dog. 
It was a wolf, not a dog. 
It's the same thing. 
They're dirty, vicious, 
and they hunt birds. 
Fine. Next time I'll turn you 
into a mealy worm. 
Well, I'll be a mealy worm, gladly. Anything but a filthy, stinking... I wonder. 
I know you're there. 
Page 12/21
Don't be afraid. 
I am not afraid. 
Then come out. 
Then you'll be afraid. 
No, I won't. 
I know who you are. 
Do you? 
You're my Fairy Godmother. 
What? 
Fairy Godmother. 
You've been watching over me 
my whole life. 
I've always known you were close by. How? 
Your shadow. It's been following me ever since I was small. 
Wherever I went, 
your shadow was always with me. I remember you. 
Pretty bird. 
This is Diaval. 
Hello, Aurora. 
I have known you 
since you were a little one. 
It's everything I imagined it would be. It's just so beautiful! 
I've always wanted to come... 
Good night, beasty. 
You mock me. 
I know what you're doing. 
I know exactly what you're doing. Sire? 
Your presence has been 
requested by the Queen. 
Leave me. 
Sire, she is not well. 
The nurses are fearful 
that she won't make it through the night. Can you not see 
we're having a conversation? 
When the curse fails, 
Maleficent will come for me. 
And on that day, I will be ready. They're so beautiful. 
Page 13/21
I revoke the curse. 
Let it be no more. 
I revoke the curse. 
Let it be no more. 
I revoke my curse! 
Let it be no more! 
I revoke my curse! 
Let it be no more! 
Let it be no more! 
This curse will last till the end of time. No power on Earth can change it. Do all the Fair People have wings? Most do. 
Then why don't you? 
All the other fairies fly. 
I had wings once. 
They were stolen from me. 
That's all I wish to say about it. What color were they? 
Were they big? 
So big 
they dragged behind me when I walked. And they were strong. 
They could carry me above the clouds and into the headwinds. 
And they never faltered, not even once. I could trust them. 
She's coming. She's coming. 
Where are your workers? 
In their beds, Majesty. 
Get them back to work without delay. They're exhausted, sire. 
But I'll have them 
back to work at first light. 
I need them back to work now. 
It's the wee hours. 
Aye. 
Aye. 
It is the wee hours. 
So wake them up. 
Sire? 
So wake them up, 
and get them back to work now! 
We're running out of time! Go, now! Page 14/21
Aurora? 
Come here. 
Sit. 
There's something I need to tell you. What is it? 
There is an evil in this world, 
and I cannot keep you from it. 
I'm almost 16, Godmother. 
I can take care of myself. 
I understand. 
- But that's not what I have to tell you. - I have a plan. 
When I'm older, 
I'm going to live here 
in the Moors with you. 
Then we can look after each other. You don't have to wait until you're older. You could live here now. 
Then I Will. 
I'll sleep in a tree 
and eat berries and black nuts 
and all the Fair People 
will be my friends. 
I'll be happy here for the rest of my life. I'm going to tell my aunties tomorrow. Until tomorrow. 
I'm so excited! 
Aunties, I'm almost 16. 
I need a life of my own. 
No. I love you very much, 
but it's time to say goodbye. 
You've been very good to me, 
except the time 
you accidentally fed me spiders. 
Hello. 
I'm sorry to bother you, 
but I'm on my way 
to King Stefan's castle 
and I've become hopelessly lost. 
Can you help me? 
I'm sorry. That was my fault. 
I rushed in too... 
Forgive me. 
It's that way. 
Page 15/21
The castle. 
What's your name? 
It's Philip. 
Hello, Philip. 
What's yours? 
Aurora. 
Hello, Aurora. 
Well, it was nice meeting you. And once again, my apologies 
for being such a clumsy fool. 
You're forgiven. 
That's good. 
I'd best be off, then. 
Good bye. 
Will you be back this way? 
Nothing could stop me. 
Then I'll see you soon. 
Very soon. 
- Goodbye, Philip. 
- Goodbye, for now. 
Stop doing that. 
Well? 
That boy's the answer. 
- No, Diaval. 
- Yes! 
True love's kiss, remember? 
It can break the spell. 
True love's kiss? 
Have you not worked it out yet? I cursed her that way 
because there is no such thing. Well, that might be how you feel, but what about Aurora? 
That boy could be her only chance. It's her fate, anyway. 
Go ahead. 
Turn me into whatever you want. A bird, a worm. 
I don't care anymore. 
I'm so happy we're leaving tomorrow. We are not leaving tomorrow. 
Tomorrow is Aurora's 16th birthday. And Stefan told us to take her back the day after her birthday. 
Page 16/21
No. He said on her birthday. 
No. The day after her birthday. 
- On. 
- After. 
- On. 
- After. 
- On, on, on! 
- After, after, after! 
Stop it! 
What? 
How could you? 
I need to talk to you about something. Yes, sweetie, what is it? 
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I'll be 16 tomorrow. 
Yes. 
I'm leaving home. 
See here, young lady. 
I did not spend 16 years 
in this miserable hovel 
with these two imbeciles... 
So that you could ruin it on the last day. We are taking you back 
to your father with... 
My father? 
You told me my parents were dead. I think you better come and sit down. Fairy Godmother! 
I'm here. 
When were you going to tell me 
that I'm cursed? 
Is it true? 
It is. 
My aunts said it was an evil fairy. I... I can't remember her name. 
They said 
it was... 
Maleficent. 
Is that you? 
Are you Maleficent? 
No! 
Don't touch me. 
You're the evil that's in the world. It's you! 
Page 17/21
Find the boy! 
I need every available man 
on the east wing now. 
There should be no guards at the gate. I want her to walk right in. 
Sorry to disturb, Your Majesty. We found this urchin at the gate. She claims to be the princess. Father. 
It's me, Aurora! 
You look just like your mother. They brought you back a day too soon. I told those three idiots! 
Lock her up in her room. 
Go. 
Prepare the men. Maleficent's coming. It's so good to be small again! Look at my feet! 
I love my tiny little feet! 
Pay attention! We have to find Aurora, or the king will have our heads! Aurora. 
Wait! 
Princess? 
I'm looking for a girl. 
Of course you are. 
I need a horse. 
...into a sleep like death. 
Aurora. 
Come on, Diaval! 
Aurora. 
Faster, Diaval, faster! 
She will prick her finger 
on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a sleep like death. No power on Earth... 
A sleep like death. 
It's done. 
They pulled the guards. 
He's waiting for you in there. If we go inside those walls, 
we'll never come out alive. 
Then don't come. It's not your fight. Thank you very much. 
Page 18/21
"I need you, Diaval. 
I can't do this without you, Diaval." I can hear you. 
Look at her. 
Look at what you've done. 
She's only sleeping. 
She's only sleeping, you say? 
She's only sleeping. 
She's only sleeping forever! 
- What about the kiss? 
- Yes! True love's kiss! 
True love does not exist. 
But it's her only chance, Your Majesty. Mistress. 
What are we going to do? 
We can't give up, can we? 
Come on, girls. 
But we don't even know where to start. True love doesn't just fall 
from trees, you know. 
Pardon me. 
I'm embarrassed to say 
I don't know where I am. 
In King Stefan's castle. 
This is where I'm meant to be. Odd that I can't recall how I got here. Why have you come? 
My father sent me to see the King. Who is your father? 
King John of Ulstead. 
A Prince! 
Aurora. 
He knows her. 
Why is she sleeping? 
She's trapped in an enchantment. Isn't she beautiful? 
The most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Do you want to kiss her? 
Very much. 
Go on, then. 
I wouldn't feel right about it. I barely know her. We've only met once. Haven't you ever heard 
of love at first sight? 
Page 19/21
Kiss her! 
Go on. 
An enchantment, you say? 
Kiss her! 
You didn't do it properly! 
It's supposed to be true love's kiss! I was certain he was the one. 
- What are you doing? 
- We have to keep looking. 
I told you. 
I will not ask your forgiveness because what I have done to you is unforgivable. 
I was so lost 
in hatred and revenge. 
Sweet Aurora, 
you stole what was left of my heart. And now I have lost you forever. I swear, no harm will come to you as long as I live. 
And not a day shall pass 
that I don't miss your smile. 
Hello, Godmother. 
Hello, beasty. 
No truer love. 
She's here, sire. 
Are we going back to the Moors now? If that is what you wish. 
We've got her! 
- Stop! 
- Get back! 
No! 
Into a dragon. 
To the other side. 
Run, Aurora! 
Get back! Hold it steady! 
Pull to the left! Pull! 
Hold the line! 
Look out. Hold your line. 
- Close in. 
- Bring it down! 
Enough! 
How does it feel? 
To be a fairy creature without wings Page 20/21
in a world where you don't belong? Kill her! 
Kill her! 
Shoot! 
Shoot her! 
Take aim! 
It's over. 
Maleficent brought down 
her wall of thorns 
and took off her crown. 
And she invited Aurora to see 
how the Moors had been once, 
long ago, when Maleficent 
was but a child 
and her heart was bright. 
For now, it was again. 
But that was not all. 
There she is. Hurry up. They're waiting. Wait for me! 
We present this crown 
to our little Aurora, 
for whom we have sacrificed 
the best years of our... 
Never mind. 
Our kingdoms have been unified. You have your queen. 
So you see, 
the story is not quite as you were told, and I should know, 
for I was the one 
they called Sleeping Beauty. 
In the end, my kingdom was united not by a hero or a villain, 
as legend had predicted, 
but by one who was 
both hero and villain. 
And her name was Maleficent.

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies 
By Fran Walsh 
Page 1/39
I warned you. 
Did I not warn you what would come of dealing with Dwarves? 
Now they've done it. 
They've woken the dragon! 
They've brought an apocalypse 
upon our heads! 
Come on. Quickly. 
Quickly. 
Faster now... 
...I'm trying to evacuate. 
Careful, man. 
Never mind the books. Get on! 
But, sire, should 
we not try to save the town? 
The town is lost. 
- Save the gold! 
- You heard him. Get a move on. - Da! 
- Come on. 
Pile them up! 
We have no time. We must leave. - Get him up. 
- Come on. 
- Come on. Let's go. 
- I'm fine. I can walk. 
- Fast as you can. 
- We're not leaving. 
Not without our father. 
If you stay here, your sisters will die. Is that what your father would want? Open... 
...this door! 
Do you hear me? 
I can see him! 
Look! 
Down here! Now! 
- Give me your hand. 
- We gotta go. 
Quickly now. Hurry. 
Kili, come on! 
- It's around the corner! 
- Keep on going, man! 
Dragon! 
Page 2/39
Come on, come on! 
Faster! Faster! 
If only we could take... 
...more of these people with us, but they're hardly... 
- Worth it. I quite agree. 
- Help! 
Help! 
Look out! 
Move it! 
Move it! 
Come on! Faster! 
My gold! My gold! 
We're carrying too much. 
We need to dump something. 
Quite right... 
...Alfrid. 
Faster! Faster! 
Poor souls. 
Da. 
Da! 
He hit it! 
- He hit the dragon! He did! 
- No. 
He hit his mark! I saw. 
His arrows cannot pierce its hide. I fear nothing will. 
What are you doing? 
- Come back! Bain! 
- Bain! 
Bain! 
Get back here! 
- Bain! 
- Leave him. 
We cannot go back. 
Bain! 
Dad. 
Bain! What are you doing? 
You were supposed to leave! 
- I came to help you. 
- No! 
Nothing can stop it now. 
This might. 
Bain. 
Page 3/39
You go back. 
You get out of here. Now. 
Dad! 
Bain! 
Stop, stop! Halt! 
Halt! 
Who are you... 
...that would stand... 
...against me? 
Now, that is a pity. 
What will you do now... 
...Bowman? 
You are... 
...forsaken. 
No help will come. 
Now's our chance! Go! 
Go! 
Head for the open water! 
Hmm. 
Is that... 
...your child? 
You cannot... 
...save him from the fire. 
He will... 
...burn! 
Stay still, son. 
Stay still. 
Tell me... 
...wretch... 
...how now shall you challenge me? You have nothing left... 
...but your... 
...death! 
Bain. 
Look at me. 
You look at me. 
Little to your left. 
That's it. 
Bain! Hold on! 
What was that? 
What happened? 
It fell. I saw it. 
It's dead. 
Smaug is dead. 
Page 4/39
By my beard... 
...I think he's right. 
Look there! 
The Ravens of Erebor 
are returning to the Mountain. 
Aye. 
Word will spread. 
Before long... 
...every soul in Middle-earth will know... ...the dragon is dead! 
You are not... 
...alone... 
...Mithrandir. 
Help me! 
Where's my baby? 
Please! 
Somebody help me! 
Help! 
Over there! 
Da! 
Da! 
- Da! 
- Da! 
Aah! Why me? 
Tauriel. 
Kili! 
Come on. 
We're leaving! 
They are your people. You must go. Come with me. 
I know how I feel. I'm not afraid. You make me feel alive. 
I can't. 
Tauriel. 
I don't know what that means. 
I think you do. 
One more! 
Keep it. 
As a promise. 
These are dry. You'll need them. - Thank you. 
- Here. 
Oi! Give me one of them. 
I'll catch my death... 
Page 5/39
...in this cold. 
Find your own! 
You're not in charge, 
Alfrid Lickspittle. 
You are wrong. 
In the absence of the Master... 
...the power cedes to his deputy... ...which in this instance is my good self. Now give me that blanket! 
Master's deputy? 
Don't make me laugh. 
You're a sneak-thief. 
I'll be dead before... 
...I answer to you. 
Maybe that can be arranged. 
I wouldn't go turning on your own, Alfrid. Not now. 
- Da! 
- Come here! 
You're alive. 
It's all right, darling. 
It was Bard! He killed the dragon! I saw it with me own eyes. 
He brought the beast down! 
Shot him dead... 
...with a Black Arrow. 
Thank you, Bard! 
- Good man. 
- Thank you! 
You've saved us all! 
Bless you. 
All hail to the Dragon-Slayer! 
All hail... 
...King Bard! 
I have said it many times. 
This is a man of noble stock. 
- A born leader! 
- Do not call me that. 
I'm not Master... 
...of this town. 
Where is he? 
- Where's the Master? 
- Halfway down the Anduin. 
With all our coin, I don't doubt. Page 6/39
You would know. 
You helped him empty... 
- ...the treasury. 
- No. 
I tried to stop him. 
- Liar! 
- Cheat! 
You're a mongrel! 
I begged. I pleaded. 
Away with him! 
- Tar him! 
- I said, "Master... 
...no! 
Think of the children." 
Hang him! 
"Will nobody think of the children?" Ow! 
To the tree with him! 
- Hang him hard! 
- Take him down! 
Enough! Let him go! 
Let him go! 
Look around you! 
Have you not... 
...had your fill of death? 
Winter is upon us. 
We must look to our own. 
To the sick and the helpless. 
Those who can stand, 
tend to the wounded. 
Those who have strength, follow me. We must salvage what we can. 
What then? What'll we do then? We find shelter. 
Hello! 
Bombur? 
Bifur? 
Anybody? 
Wait! 
Wait! 
- It's Bilbo! 
- He's alive! 
Stop! Stop! 
Stop. 
Page 7/39
You need to leave. 
We all need to leave. 
We only just got here. 
I've tried talking, but he won't listen. - What do you mean, laddie? 
- Thorin! 
Thorin. Thorin. 
He's been down there for days. 
He doesn't sleep. He barely eats. He's not been himself. Not at all. It's this place. Ahem. 
I think a sickness lies on it. 
Sickness? 
What kind of sickness? 
Fili. 
Fili! 
Fili! 
Gold. 
Gold beyond measure. 
Beyond sorrow... 
...and grief. 
Behold... 
...the great... 
...treasure hoard of Thror. 
Welcome... 
...my sister-sons... 
...to the Kingdom... 
...of Erebor. 
Balin! 
Kili! 
Thank Durin, you're alive. 
Bombur! 
You're alive! 
- Any sign of it? 
- Nothing yet. 
Nothing here. 
- Keep searching! 
- That jewel could be anywhere. The Arkenstone is in these halls. - Find it! 
- You heard him. 
- Keep looking. 
- All of you! 
No one rests until... 
Page 8/39
...it is found. 
I am almost tempted... 
...to let you take it. 
If only... 
...to see Oakenshield... 
...suffer. 
Watch it... 
...destroy him. 
Watch it corrupt... 
...his heart... 
...and drive him mad. 
I've got you. 
Take only what you need. 
We have a long march ahead. 
Where will you go? 
There is only one place. 
The Mountain. 
You are a genius, sire. 
We can take refuge inside the Mountain. It might smell a bit of dragon, but the women can clean that up. It'll be safe and warm and dry... ...and full of stores... 
...bedding, clothing... 
...the odd bit of gold. 
What gold is in that Mountain is cursed. We will take only 
what was promised to us. 
Only what we need to rebuild... ...our lives. 
Here. Pull your weight. 
News of the death of Smaug 
will have spread through the lands. Aye. 
Others will now look to the Mountain... ...for its wealth... 
...for its position. 
What is it you know? 
Nothing for certain. 
It's what I fear may come. 
You saw something out there. 
The Orc I pursued out of Lake-town, I know who he is. 
Bolg, spawn of Azog the Defiler. Page 9/39
A Warg pack was waiting for him 
on the outskirts of Esgaroth. 
They fled into the North. 
These Orcs were different 
from the others. 
They bore a mark 
I have not seen for a long time. 
The mark of Gundabad. 
Gundabad? 
An Orc stronghold... 
...in the far North of the Misty Mountains. You may tell my father... 
...if there is no place for Tauriel, there is no place for me. 
Legolas. 
It is your king's command. 
I ride North. Will you come with me? To where? 
To Gundabad. 
I come for Mithrandir... 
...and I will leave with him. 
If you try to stop me... 
...I will destroy you. 
Nine... 
...for mortal Men doomed to die. 
I am not alone. 
Are you in need of assistance, my lady? You should've stayed... 
...dead. 
Mithrandir... 
...come back. 
He is here. 
Yes. 
The darkness has returned. 
Go on! 
Gandalf! 
Gandalf! 
Climb on! 
He is weak. 
He cannot remain here. 
It is draining his life. 
Go! 
Quickly! 
Come with me, my lady. 
Page 10/39
Go! 
You have no... 
...power here... 
...servant of Morgoth. 
You... 
...are nameless. 
Faceless. 
Formless. 
Go back to the void... 
...from whence you came! 
The spirit of Sauron endured. 
And has been banished. 
He will flee into the East. 
Gondor... 
...should be warned. 
They must set a watch 
on the walls of Mordor. 
No. 
Look after the Lady Galadriel. She has spent much of her power. Her strength is failing. 
Take her to Lothlrien. 
My Lord Saruman. 
He must be hunted down... 
...and destroyed once and for all. Without the Ring of Power... 
...Sauron can never again 
hold dominion over Middle-earth. Go now. 
Leave Sauron to me. 
- I need that horse. 
- What? 
- Gandalf, where are you going? - To warn Erebor. 
They have no idea what is coming. I saw them... 
...with my own eyes, 
rank upon rank of Moria Orcs. 
You must summon our friends, 
bird and beast. 
The battle for the Mountain 
is about to begin. 
Wait. 
Take this. 
Page 11/39
If what you say is true, 
then you'll need it more than I. Thank you. 
A word of warning, eh? 
It can be a bit dicky sometimes. You just have to twiddle with the top. I expect you'll manage. 
It is here in these halls. 
I know it. 
We have searched and searched. 
Not well enough. 
Thorin, we all would see 
the stone returned. 
And yet, it is still not found! Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here? The Arkenstone... 
...is the birthright of our people. It is The King's Jewel. 
Am I not the king? 
Know this: 
If anyone should find it... 
...and withhold it from me... 
...I will be avenged. 
Dragon-sickness. 
I've seen it before. 
That look. 
The terrible need. 
It is a fierce and jealous love, Bilbo. It sent his grandfather mad. 
Balin, if Thorin... 
...had the Arkenstone... 
...or if... 
...it was found... 
...would it help? 
That stone crowns all. 
It is the summit of this great wealth... ...bestowing power... 
...upon he who bears it. 
Would it stay his madness? 
No, laddie. 
I fear it would make him worse. Perhaps it is best... 
...it remains lost. 
Page 12/39
What is that? 
In your hand. 
It's nothing. 
Show me. 
It... 
I picked it up in Beorn's garden. You've carried it all this way? 
I'm gonna plant it in my garden. 
In Bag End. 
It's a poor prize to 
take back to the Shire. 
One day, it'll grow. 
And every time I look at it, I'll remember. Remember everything that happened, the good, the bad... 
...and how lucky I am that I made it home. Thorin, I... 
Thorin. 
Survivors from Lake-town... 
...they're streaming into Dale. 
There's hundreds of them. 
Call everyone to the gate. 
To the gate! 
Now! 
Come on. 
- Keep moving. 
- Sire! 
Sire! 
Up here! 
Look, sire! The braziers are lit. So... 
...the Company of Thorin Oakenshield survived. 
Survived? 
There's a bunch of Dwarves 
with all that gold? 
I shouldn't worry, Alfrid. 
There's gold enough 
in that Mountain for all. 
Make camp here tonight! 
Find what shelter you can. 
Get some fires going. 
- Come on, hurry along now. 
- Alfrid. 
Page 13/39
You'll take... 
...the night watch. 
Up it goes! 
That's it. 
I want this fortress made safe by sunup. This Mountain was hard-won. 
I will not see it taken again. 
The people of Lake-town have nothing. They came to us in need. 
They have lost everything. 
Do not tell me what they have lost. I know well enough their hardship. Those who have lived through dragon fire... ...should rejoice. 
They have much... 
...to be grateful for. 
More stone. 
Bring more stone to the gate! 
That's it. 
- These children are starving. 
- We need food. 
- We won't last three days. 
- Bard... 
- ...we don't have enough. 
- Do what you can, Percy. 
It'll be all right. Don't worry. 
We need more water. 
The children, the wounded 
and the women come first. 
Here you are. 
Good morning, Alfrid. 
What news from the night watch? 
All quiet, sire. Not much to report. Nothing gets past me. 
Except an army of Elves, it would seem. My Lord Thranduil, we did not look... - ...to see you here. 
- I heard you needed aid. 
Here you go. 
Pass it back. 
Another one. 
You have saved us. 
I do not know how to thank you. 
Your gratitude is misplaced. 
Page 14/39
I did not come on your behalf. 
I came to reclaim something of mine. There are gems in the Mountain 
that I, too, desire. 
White gems of pure starlight. 
The White Gems of Lasgalen. 
I know an Elf Lord who will pay 
a pretty price for these. 
Wait! Please wait! 
You would go to war 
over a handful of gems? 
The heirlooms of my people 
are not lightly forsaken. 
We are allies in this. 
My people... 
...also have a claim 
upon the riches in that Mountain. Let me... 
...speak with Thorin. 
You would try to reason with the Dwarf? To avoid war? 
Yes. 
Not a bad night's work. 
Come on. 
Hail, Thorin, son of Thrain. 
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope. Why do you come to the gates... 
...of the King under the Mountain armed for war? 
Why does the King under the Mountain fence himself in... 
...like a robber in his hold? 
Perhaps it is because 
I am expecting to be robbed. 
My lord... 
...we have not come to rob you... ...but to seek fair settlement. 
Will you not speak with me? 
I am listening. 
On behalf of the people of Lake-town... ...I ask that you honor your pledge. A share of the treasure... 
...so that they might rebuild their lives. I will not treat with any man... 
Page 15/39
...while an armed host lies before my door. That armed host will attack this Mountain if we do not come to terms. 
And your threats do not sway me. 
What of your conscience? 
Does it not tell you our cause is just? My people offered you help. 
And in return, you brought upon them only ruin and death. 
When did Lake-town come to our aid but for the promise of rich reward? A bargain was struck! 
A bargain? 
What choice did we have 
but to barter our birthright... 
...for blankets and food? 
To ransom... 
...our future in exchange 
for our freedom? 
You call that a fair trade? 
Tell me... 
...Bard the Dragon-Slayer... 
...why should I honor such terms? Because you gave us your word. 
Does that mean nothing? 
Be gone! 
Ere our arrows... 
...fly! 
What are you doing? 
You cannot go to war. 
- This does not concern you. 
- Excuse me... 
...but in case you haven't noticed, there is an army of Elves out there. Not to mention several hundred 
angry fishermen. 
We are, in fact, outnumbered. 
Not for much longer. 
What does that mean? 
It means, Master Baggins... 
...you should never underestimate Dwarves. We have reclaimed Erebor. 
Now... 
...we defend it. 
Page 16/39
He will give us nothing. 
Such a pity. 
Still... 
- ...you tried. 
- I do not understand. 
Why? 
Why would he risk war? 
It is fruitless to reason with them. They understand... 
...only one thing. 
We attack at dawn. 
Are you with us? 
Aye. 
Master Baggins, come here. 
You're going to need this. 
Put it on. 
This vest is made of silver steel. Mithril... 
...it was called by my forebears. No blade can pierce it. 
I look absurd. 
I'm not a warrior, I'm a Hobbit. It is a gift. 
A token of our friendship. 
True friends are hard to come by. I have been blind... 
...but now I begin to see. 
I am betrayed. 
Betrayed? 
The Arkenstone. 
One of them has taken it. 
One of them is false. 
Thorin... 
...the Quest is fulfilled, 
you've won the Mountain. 
Is that not enough? 
- Betrayed by my own kin. 
- Now, uh... 
...you made a promise 
to the people of Lake-town. 
Now, is this treasure... 
...truly worth more than your honor? Our honor, Thorin. I was also there. I gave my word. 
Page 17/39
For that, I am grateful. 
It was nobly done, but the treasure... ...does not belong to the people... ...of Lake-town. 
This gold... 
...is ours. 
And ours alone. 
By my life... 
...I will not part... 
...with a single coin. 
Not... 
...one... 
...piece of it. 
Gundabad. 
What lies beyond? 
An old enemy. 
The ancient kingdom... 
...of Angmar. 
This fortress was once its stronghold. It is where they kept their great armories. Forged their weapons of war. 
A light. I saw movement. 
We wait for the cover of night. 
It is a fell place, Tauriel. 
In another age, our people waged war... ...on those lands. 
My mother died there. 
My father does not speak of it. 
There is no grave. 
No memory. 
Nothing. 
- Unh! 
- Let me through! 
Make way! 
No, no. 
No! Oi! You! 
Pointy hat! 
Yes. 
You. We don't want no tramps, beggars... ...nor vagabonds here. 
We got enough trouble 
without the likes of you. 
Off you go. On your horse. 
Who's in charge here? 
Page 18/39
Who is asking? 
You must set aside 
your petty grievances with the Dwarves. War is coming! 
The cesspits... 
...of Dol Guldur have been... 
...emptied. 
You're all... 
...in mortal danger. 
What are you talking about? 
You know nothing... 
...of Wizards. 
They are like winter thunder 
on a wild wind... 
...rolling in from a distance, 
breaking hard in alarm. 
But sometimes a storm... 
...is just a storm. 
Not this time. 
Armies of Orcs are on the move. These are fighters. 
They have been bred for war. 
Our enemy has summoned his full strength. Why show his hand now? 
Because we forced him. 
We forced him when the Company of Thorin set out to reclaim... 
...their homeland. 
The Dwarves were never meant 
to reach Erebor. 
Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them. His master seeks control of the Mountain. Not just for the treasure within... ...but for where it lies, 
its strategic position. 
This is the gateway... 
...to reclaiming 
the lands of Angmar in the North. If that fell kingdom should rise again... ...Rivendell, Lrien, the Shire... ...even Gondor itself, will fall. These Orc armies you speak of, 
Mithrandir... 
...where are they? 
Page 19/39
These bats are bred for one purpose. For what? 
For war. 
Come on, let's get those blades sharpened. Aye. Blasted Elves. 
- You swing an ax at it? 
- No, brother. 
You should be inside. 
Out of the wind. 
No, I... 
...needed some air. 
Place still stinks of dragon. 
The Elves have been moving... 
- ...their archers into position. - Ah. 
The battle will be over... 
...by tomorrow's eve. 
Though I doubt we will live 
to see it. 
No, these are dark days. 
Dark days indeed. 
Hmm. 
No one could blame a soul 
for wishing themselves elsewhere. Must be nearing midnight. 
Bombur's got the next watch. 
It'll take a bit to wake him. 
Bofur? 
I will see you in the morning. 
Goodbye, Bilbo. 
Since when has my counsel 
counted for so little? 
What do you think I'm trying to do? Save your Dwarvish friends, 
and I admire... 
...your loyalty to them. 
But it does not dissuade me 
from my course. 
You started this, Mithrandir. 
You will forgive me if I finish it. Are the archers in position? 
- Yes, my lord. 
- Give the order. 
If anything moves on that Mountain... Page 20/39
...kill it. 
The Dwarves are out of time. 
Bowman! 
Do you agree? 
Is gold so important to you? 
Would you buy it 
with the blood of Dwarves? 
It won't come to that. 
- This is a fight they cannot win. - That won't stop them. 
You think the Dwarves will surrender? They won't. 
They will fight to the death. 
Bilbo Baggins. 
If I'm not mistaken... 
...this is the Halfling 
who stole the keys... 
...to my dungeons from under... ...the nose of my guards. 
Yes. 
Sorry... 
...about that. 
I came... 
...to give you... 
...this. 
The Heart of the Mountain. 
The King's Jewel. 
And worth a king's ransom. 
How is this... 
...yours to give? 
I took it as my 14th share 
of the treasure. 
Why would you do this? 
You owe us no loyalty. 
I'm not doing it for you. 
I know that Dwarves can be obstinate... ...and pigheaded... 
...and difficult. 
They're suspicious and secretive... ...with the worst manners... 
...imaginable, 
but they are also brave... 
...and kind... 
...and loyal to a fault. 
Page 21/39
I've grown... 
...very fond of them, 
and I would save them if I can. 
Now, Thorin... 
...values this stone above all else. In exchange for its return, 
he will give you... 
...what you are owed. 
There will be no need... 
...for war. 
Rest up tonight. 
- You must leave on the morrow. 
- What? 
- Get as far away from here as possible. - I'm not leaving. 
You picked me as the 14th man. 
I'm not leaving the Company. 
There is no Company. Not anymore. Imagine what Thorin will do 
when he finds out what you've done. I'm not afraid of Thorin. 
Well, you should be. 
Don't underestimate... 
...the evil of gold. 
Gold over which... 
...a serpent has long brooded. 
Dragon-sickness seeps 
into the hearts of all... 
...who come near this Mountain. 
Almost all. Heh. 
You there. 
Find this Hobbit a bed... 
...and fill his belly with hot food. He's earned it. 
Hey. 
Keep an eye on him. 
If he should try... 
...to leave, you tell me. 
Move it! 
Stupid Hobbit. 
Wakey-wakey, Hobbit. Up you get. 
I will put the next one between your eyes. We have come to tell you... 
...payment of your debt has been offered... Page 22/39
...and accepted. 
What payment? 
I gave you nothing. 
You have nothing. 
We have this. 
They have the Arkenstone. 
Thieves! 
How came you by the heirloom 
of our house? 
That stone belongs to the king! And the king may have it... 
...with our goodwill. 
But first he must honor his word. They are taking us for fools. 
This is a ruse. 
A filthy lie. 
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain! It is a trick! 
It's no trick. 
The stone is real. 
I gave it to them. 
You? 
I took it as my 14th share. 
You would steal from me? 
Steal from you? No. 
No, I may be a burglar, 
but I like to think I'm an honest one. I'll let it stand against my claim. Against your claim? 
Your claim. 
You have no claim over me, 
you miserable rat! 
I was going to give it to you. - Many times I wanted to, but... - But what... 
...thief? 
You are changed, Thorin. 
The Dwarf I met... 
...in Bag End would never have 
gone back on his word. 
Would never have doubted... 
...the loyalty of his kin! 
Do not speak to me... 
...of loyalty. 
Page 23/39
Throw him from the rampart! 
Did you not hear me? 
I will do it myself. Curse you! No! 
Cursed be the Wizard... 
- ...that forced you on us! 
- If you don't like my burglar... ...then please... 
...don't damage him. 
Return him to me. 
You're not making a very splendid figure as King under the Mountain... 
...are you, Thorin... 
...son of Thrain? 
Never again will I have dealings with Wizards! 
Go. 
Or Shire rats! 
Are we resolved? 
The return... 
...of the Arkenstone 
for what was promised? 
Why should I... 
...buy back that which is... 
...rightfully mine? 
Keep the stone... 
...sell it. 
Ecthelion of Gondor 
will give you a good price for it. I will kill you! 
By my oath, 
I will kill you all! 
Your oath means nothing. 
I've heard enough. 
Thorin... 
...lay down your arms. 
Open these doors. 
This treasure... 
...will be your death. 
Thorin, we cannot... 
...win this fight. 
Give us your answer. 
Will you have peace... 
...or war? 
Page 24/39
I will have war. 
Ironfoot. 
Hey, Thorin! 
Ironfoot has come! 
Who is that? 
He doesn't look very happy. 
It is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills. Thorin's... 
- ...cousin. 
- Are they alike? 
I've always found Thorin 
the more reasonable of the two. Good morning. 
How are we all? 
I have a wee proposition... 
...if you wouldn't mind giving me a few moments... 
...of your time. 
Would you consider... 
...just sodding off? 
All of you! 
Right now! 
Stand fast. 
Come now, Lord Dain. 
Gandalf the Grey. 
Tell this rabble... 
...to leave, or I'll water... 
...the ground with their blood! 
No need for war... 
...between Dwarves, Men and Elves. A legion of Orcs... 
...march on the Mountain. 
Stand down. 
I will not stand down before any Elf. Not least this faithless Woodland sprite. He wishes nothing but ill upon my people. If he chooses... 
...to stand between me and my kin... ...I'll split his pretty head open! See if he's still smirking then. Dain... 
...wait! 
Let them advance. 
See how far they get. 
Page 25/39
You think I give a dead dog 
for your threats... 
...you pointy-eared... 
...princess? 
You hear that, lads? We're on! Let's give these bastards 
a good hammering! 
Stand your men down. 
I'll deal with Ironfoot and his rabble. Right then. 
Let's get this done. 
Send in the goats. 
Thranduil! 
This is madness! 
How do you like that, 
the old twirley-whirlies? 
Ha, ha, you buggers! 
Were-worms. 
Oh, come on. 
The hordes of hell are upon us! Fight to the death! 
I'm going over the wall. 
Who's coming with me? 
- Aye! 
- Come on, let's go! 
- Stand down. 
- What? 
Are we to do nothing? 
I said, stand down! 
The Elves. 
Will they not fight? 
Charge! 
Yes! 
Uh, Gandalf? 
Is this a good place to stand? Azog. 
He's trying to cut us off. 
All of you! 
Fall back to Dale! 
Now! 
To the city! 
Bilbo! This way! 
Sigrid! 
Tilda! 
Page 26/39
My children! Where are my children? I saw them! 
They were down in the old market! The market? 
Where are they now? 
Tilda! Sigrid! 
Bard! Orcs are storming over the causeway! Get the bowmen to the eastern parapet. Hold them off as long as you can. Archers! This way! 
The Orcs have taken Stone Street! The market's overrun! 
The rest of you... 
...follow me! 
Charge! Onward! 
To the death! 
Da! 
Da! 
- Here! 
- We're down here! 
Bain! 
Sigrid! Get down! 
Listen! 
Gather... 
...the women and children. 
Take them to the Great Hall... 
...and barricade the door. 
You understand? 
You must not come out for any reason. We want to stay with you! 
Show your father some respect. 
You leave it to me... 
...sire. 
You heard him. 
- We make for the Great Hall. 
- Alfrid! 
Women and children only. 
I need every man... 
...fighting. 
See that you return. 
I'll get them to safety, sire. 
Then my sword is yours to command. Get up! 
Look after them. 
Page 27/39
Shift it, granny! 
Make for the Great Hall! 
Out of my way! 
Abandon the cripples! 
You buggers! 
Where's Thorin? 
We need him! Where is he? 
Fall back! 
Since when do we forsake... 
...our own people? 
Thorin... 
...they are dying... 
...out there. 
There are halls beneath halls 
within this Mountain. 
Places we can fortify... 
...shore up, make safe. 
Yes. 
Yes... 
...that is it. 
We must move the gold 
further underground... 
- ...to safety. 
- Did you hear me? 
Dain is surrounded. 
They're being slaughtered, Thorin. Many die in war. 
Life is cheap. 
But a treasure... 
...such as this cannot be counted... ...in lives lost. 
It is worth... 
...all the blood we can spend. 
You sit here in these vast halls... ...with a crown upon your head... ...and yet you are lesser now 
than you have ever been. 
Do not speak to me... 
...as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord... ...as if... 
...I were still... 
...Thorin... 
...Oakenshield. 
- I am your king! 
Page 28/39
- You were always my king. 
You used to know that once. 
You cannot see what you have become. Go. 
Get out. 
Before I kill you. 
You sit here... 
...with a crown upon your head. You are lesser now 
than you have ever been. 
But a treasure such as this 
cannot be counted in lives lost. A sickness lies upon that treasure. The blind ambition of a Mountain King. Am I not the king? 
This gold... 
...is ours. 
And ours alone. 
I will not part... 
...with a single coin. 
He could not see 
beyond his own desire! 
As if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord... ...Thorin Oakenshield. 
A sickness which drove 
your grandfather mad. 
This is Thorin... 
...son of Thrain, son of Thror! I am not my grandfather. 
I am not my grandfather. 
You are the heir to the Throne of Durin. They are dying out there. 
Take back Erebor. 
Dain is surrounded. 
Dying. 
Is surrounded. 
Dying. 
Take back your homeland. 
You are changed, Thorin. 
I am not my grandfather. 
Is this treasure truly worth more than your honor? 
I am not my grandfather. 
This treasure will be your death! Page 29/39
Fall back! 
Fall back... 
...to the Mountain! 
Fall back! 
I will not hide... 
...behind a wall of stone... 
...while others fight our battles for us! It is not in my blood, Thorin. 
No. 
It is not. 
We are sons of Durin. 
And Durin's Folk... 
...do not flee from a fight. 
I have no right to ask this of any of you. But will you follow me... 
...one last time? 
Thorin. 
To the king! 
To the king! 
The Dwarves. 
They're rallying. 
They're rallying to their king. 
Any man who wants to give their last... ...follow me! 
Come on, Bombur. Get up. 
- Nori. 
- Gloin! 
Right behind you, brother. 
I say we stand with our men 
in life and in death. 
- I'm with you. 
- Arm yourselves. 
- Come with us. 
- No, no, no. 
- You leave an old woman be. 
- Don't be afraid. 
I said, get off! 
Alfrid Lickspittle. 
You are a coward. 
"Coward"? 
Not every man's brave enough 
to wear a corset. 
You're not a man. 
You're a weasel. 
Page 30/39
Dain! 
Thorin! 
Hold on! 
I'm coming! 
Hey, cousin! 
What took you so long? 
There's too many of these buggers, Thorin. I hope you've got a plan. 
Aye. 
We're going to take out their leader. Azog? 
I'm gonna kill that piece of filth. Thorin, you cannot do this. 
You're our king. 
That is why I must do it. 
And how do you plan to fight your way single-handed to Ravenhill? 
Halt! 
It's been a while since I've done this. To Ravenhill! 
Hold tight, lads. 
You're all mad bastards. 
I like it. 
May Durin save you all. 
Watch out! 
Eyes front... 
...lads! 
Hold on! 
I'm out! 
Bring it down! 
- Shoot it! 
- Where? 
In his jambags! 
It doesn't have any jambags! 
- Duck! 
- Kili! 
Move it! 
Hang on, lads! I'm coming! 
Bofur, you beauty! 
- Dwalin! 
- Go! 
Come on... 
...you hairy hedgepig! 
Come on! 
Page 31/39
Yeah! 
- Yeah! 
- Yeah! 
Wargs! 
Hold tight, lads. 
There's more coming! 
We're pulling too much weight. We won't make it. 
Cut the tracers. 
Ride them to Ravenhill. 
No, Balin. 
My goat-riding days are over. 
Durin be with you, brother. 
I am too old for this. 
Hyah! 
Onwards! 
Lead on! 
Get up. 
Get away from me. 
I don't take orders... 
...from you. 
People trusted you. 
They listened to you. 
The Master's mantle... 
...was there for the taking... 
...and you threw it all away. 
For what? 
Alfrid... 
...your slip is showing. 
We may yet survive this. 
Gandalf! 
It's Thorin. 
And Fili, Kili... 
...and Dwalin. 
He's taking his best warriors. To do what? 
To cut the head off the snake. Die! 
Gandalf! 
Legolas. 
Legolas Greenleaf. 
There is a second army. 
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs. They are almost upon us. 
Page 32/39
Gundabad. 
This was their plan all along. 
Azog engages our forces, 
then Bolg sweeps in from the North. The North? 
Where is the North... 
- ...exactly? 
- Ravenhill. 
Ravenhill? 
Thorin is up there. 
And Fili and Kili. They're all up there. Where is he? 
It looks empty. 
I think Azog has fled. 
I don't think so. 
Fili... 
...take your brother. 
Scout out the towers. 
Keep low and out of sight. 
If you see something... 
...report back. Do not engage. 
- Do you understand? 
- We have company. 
Goblin mercenaries. 
No more than a hundred. 
We'll take care of them. Go! 
Go! 
Come on! 
Recall your company. 
My lord, dispatch this force... ...to Ravenhill. 
The Dwarves are about... 
...to be overrun. 
Thorin must be warned. 
By all means, warn him. 
I have spent enough Elvish blood in defense... 
...of this accursed land. No more. Thranduil? 
I'll go. 
Don't be ridiculous. 
You'll never make it. 
Why not? 
Because they will see you coming Page 33/39
and kill you. 
No, they won't. 
They won't see me. 
It's out of the question. 
I won't allow it. 
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf. You will not turn away. 
Not this time. 
Get out of my way. 
The Dwarves will be slaughtered. Yes, they will die. 
Today... 
...tomorrow... 
...one year hence, 
a hundred years from now. 
What does it matter? 
They are mortal. 
You think your life is worth more... ...when there is no love in it? There is no love in you. 
What do you know of love? 
Nothing. 
What you feel for that Dwarf... ...is not real. 
You think it is love? 
Are you ready to die for it? 
I will go with you. 
Push! 
By Durin, you've lost your ax. 
No, he's not. 
There you go, cousin. 
You know where you can stick that. Hey. Stay here. 
Search the lower levels. 
I've got this. 
Where is that Orc filth? 
Thorin. 
Bilbo. 
You have to leave here. Now. 
Azog has an army attacking 
from the North. 
This watchtower will be surrounded. - With no way out. 
- We are so close. 
Page 34/39
That Orc scum is in there. 
I say we push on. 
No. That's what he wants. 
He wants to draw us in. 
This is a trap. 
Ah. 
Find Fili and Kili. Call them back. Thorin, are you sure about this? Do it. 
We'll live to fight another day. Oh... 
Go. 
Run! 
Kili! 
Thorin. 
Thorin. No. 
No. 
Kili. 
Kili! 
Kili! 
Tauriel! 
Kili. 
No! 
No! 
Mm. 
Tauriel! 
The Eagles are coming. 
Bilbo. 
Don't move. Don't move. Lie still. Oh. Mm. Mm. 
I'm glad you are here. 
- Shh, shh. 
- Unh. 
I wish to part from you in friendship. No. 
You are not going anywhere. 
You're going to live. 
I would take back... 
...my words and my deeds at the Gate. You did what only a true friend would do. Forgive me. 
I was too blind to see it. 
I am so sorry... 
...that I have led you into such peril. Page 35/39
No, I'm glad to have shared 
in your perils, Thorin. 
Each and every one of them. 
It is far more than any Baggins deserves. Farewell... 
...Master Burglar. 
Go back to your books. 
And your armchair. 
Plant your trees. 
Watch them grow. 
If more people... 
...valued home... 
...above gold... 
...this world would be a merrier place. No. No, no, no. No. 
Thorin. Thorin, don't you dare. Thorin. 
Thorin. Thorin, hold on. 
Hold on, please. 
The Eagles... 
The Eagles... The Eagles are here. Thorin? 
The Ea... 
I cannot go back. 
Where will you go? 
I do not know. 
Go north. 
Find the Dnedain. 
There's a young Ranger amongst them. You should meet him. 
His father, Arathorn, was a good man. His son... 
...might grow to be a great one. What is his name? 
He's known in the Wild as Strider. His true name... 
...you must discover for yourself. Legolas. 
Your mother loved you. 
More than anyone. 
More than life. 
They want to bury him. 
Yes. 
If this is love, I do not want it. Page 36/39
Take it from me. 
Please. 
Why does it hurt so much? 
Because it was real. 
The king is dead. 
Long live the king! 
Long live the king! 
There is to be a great feast tonight. Songs will be sung. Tales will be told. And Thorin Oakenshield... 
...will pass into legend. 
I know that's how you must honor him. But to me, he was never that. 
He was... 
To me... 
...he was... 
I'll slip quietly away. 
Will you tell the others I said goodbye? You can tell them yourself. 
If any of you are ever 
passing Bag End, uh... 
...tea is at 4. 
There's plenty of it. 
You are welcome anytime. 
Uh... 
Don't bother knocking. 
Ah, the borders of the Shire. 
It is here I must leave you. 
That's a shame. 
I quite liked having... 
...a Wizard around. 
Seems they bring good luck. 
You don't really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes... ...were managed by mere luck? 
Magic rings should not be used lightly, Bilbo. 
Don't take me for a fool. 
I know you found one in the Goblin tunnels. And I've kept my eye on you... 
...ever since. 
Well, thank goodness. 
Farewell, Gandalf. 
Farewell. 
Page 37/39
You, uh... 
You needn't worry about that ring. Fell out of my pocket during the battle. I lost it. 
You're a very fine person, Mr. Baggins. And I'm very fond... 
...of you. 
But you're only quite a little fellow... ...in a wide world after all. 
Wait a minute, 
that's my mother's glory box. 
And that's my dining chair. 
Ah... Put that pouf down! 
What is going on? 
Hello... 
...Mr. Bilbo. 
You're not supposed to be here. What do you mean? 
On account of you 
being presumed dead. 
I am not dead. 
Presumed or otherwise. 
I'm not sure that's permitted. 
Mr. Bilbo! 
Twenty-one! Any advance on 21? 
Any advance on 21? 
Ha, ha! Sold to Mrs. Bolger. 
Somewhere for Fatty to put his feet on. Any bids for this? 
This is Shire-made. 
No Dwarvish reproductions here. Stop! 
Stop! 
- There's been a mistake! 
- Who are you? 
Who am I? 
You know who I am... 
...Lobelia Sackville-Baggins. 
This is my home. 
And those are my spoons. 
Thank you very much. 
- This is most irregular. 
- Excuse me. 
It's been more... 
Page 38/39
...than 13 months since the disappearance. If you are in fact... 
...Bilbo Baggins and undeceased... ...can you prove it? 
What? 
Something official with your name... ...on it would suffice. 
All right. Right. 
A contract of employment as a bur... Never mind as what. 
There. My signature. 
Yes, well... Uh... 
Well, it certainly seems to be in order. Yes. 
Seems there can be no doubt. 
Who is this you pledged 
your service to? 
Thorin Oakenshield? 
He... 
He was my friend. 
No, thank you! 
We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers... 
...or distant relations! 
And what about... 
...very old friends? 
Gandalf? 
Bilbo Baggins. 
My dear Gandalf! Ha, ha! 
It's good to see you. 
One hundred and 11 years old. 
Who would believe it? 
Come on, come in! 
Welcome. Welcome.

2- by-2 macaroni flying in. Here's one. Look out, guys, I got a 1-by-1 with an indented stud on one side. - Cheese slopes. Come on, everybody. Roger that, Roger. 
Page 5/60
Look alive, coming at you. 
Can I get a couple LURPs over here? Thanks, Gail. 
Guys, watch me drill this down. Everything is awesome 
Everything is cool 
When you're part of a team 
Everything is awesome 
When we're living our dream 
Have you heard the news? 
Everyone's talkin' 
Life is good 
Because everything's awesome 
Man, I feel so good right now! 
I could sing this song for hours! Everything is awesome 
When we're living our dream 
When you're part of a team! 
Yeah! 
I'm going to the sports bar 
after work tonight. 
Who wants to eat some delicious chicken wings and get crazy? 
Chicken wings? I love chicken wings! Hey, who wants to share a croissant with this guy? 
Croissants? I love croissants. 
Oh, yeah! I sure do love giant sausages. Giant sausages? No way! 
You know what I love to do? 
Is share a meal 
with the special people in my life. Fred, Barry, Gail, me and you? 
Ah! No, wait, guys! 
Wait up! Okay, I'll meet you there. Oh. Where did it go? 
Oh, there you are. 
I think I heard a whoosh. 
Hey, pal, I hate to tell you this... ...but, uh, I don't think 
you're supposed to be here. 
Yeah, the rules specifically state... ...work site closes at 6, 
it's a hard-hat area only. 
Page 6/60
That's not official safety orange. "If you see anything weird, 
report it immediately. " 
Well, I guess I'm gonna... 
...have to report youuu... 
...uuu... 
...uuu... 
...uuu... 
...uuu... 
...uuu... 
...uuu... 
...uuu... 
...uuu... 
Where are you going? Miss! 
I didn't mean to scare you! I'm sor... Ow. Ow! 
Hey! Heh. That's not so bad. 
Yeow! Ooh! Aah! Aah! Ooh! 
Ow. 
Ow. 
Hey. 
What is that? 
Come here. 
What do I do? 
I don't have my instructions. 
Touch the Piece. 
Touch the Piece. Touch the Piece. I feel like maybe I should touch that. It's so... 
...interesting. 
Touch the Piece. 
It's so interesting. 
Touch the Piece. 
Touch the Piece. 
- Touch the Piece. 
- Uh... 
Touch the... 
A Special One with face of yellow Will make the Piece of Resistance found From its hiding refuge underground What's going on down here? 
This MasterBuilder will thwart The Kragle and save the realm 
Come on, Emmet! 
Page 7/60
The Special has arisen. 
It's your turn to be the hero. 
Wake up. 
Ugh. 
Come on, wake up! 
Where are the MasterBuilders? 
How did you find 
the Piece of Resistance? Eh? 
- Where are the others hiding? 
Good morning, apartment? 
- Wake up! 
- Aah! 
How did you find 
the Piece of Resistance? 
The piece of what? 
The Piece of Resistance. 
L... I don't... Where am I? What's happening? "What's happening?" 
Playing dumb, MasterBuilder. 
No. L... "MasterBuilder"? 
- Oh. So you've never heard of the prophecy? - No. 
Or The Special? 
No, no! 
You're a liar! We'll kill you! 
Look, um, 
I watch a lot of cop shows on TV. 
Isn't there supposed to also be...? Isn't there supposed to be a good cop? Oh, yes. But we're not done yet. 
Hi, buddy! I'm your friendly 
neighborhood police officer! 
- Would you like a glass of water? - Yeah. Yeah, actually. 
Too bad. 
Security cameras picked up this. 
Unh! You were found at the construction site convulsing with a strange piece. 
That's disgusting! 
Then why is it permanently stuck 
to your back? 
Get it off me! Get it off me! Aah! It won't come off! It's chasing me! Look, it's not my fault! 
Page 8/60
I have no idea how this thing 
got on my back! 
Of course, buddy. I believe you. Great. Aah! 
I "believe" you too. 
You see the quotations 
I'm making with my claw hands? 
It means I don't believe you! 
Why else would you show up 
with that thing on your back... 
...just three days before 
President Business... 
...is going to use the Kragle 
to end the world? 
President Business is gonna end the world? But he's such a good guy. 
And Octan, they make good stuff. Music, dairy products, coffee, TVshows... ...surveillance systems, 
all history books, voting machines. Wait a minute. 
Come on, you can't be this stupid. This is a misunderstanding. 
I'm just a regular, normal, ordinary guy. I'm late to meet my best friends in the whole world. 
They're probably missing me right now. They're probably out looking around. "Hey, where's Emmet? 
Hey, where's my best friend Emmet?" Hey, you know what? 
Ask all my friends. They'll tell you. Oh, we asked them, all right. 
Boom! 
That guy's not a criminal mastermind. See? 
Yeah. You know, he's kind of 
an average, normal kind of guy. 
Thank you. 
But, you know, he's not, like... ...normal like us. No. 
He's not that special. 
Wait, I'm so confused. 
Who are we talking about? 
Page 9/60
Wait, does he work with us? 
Gail doesn't remember me? 
Look at Randy here. 
He likes sausage. That's something. Gail is perky. That's something. 
And Harry... 
...well... 
- When you say Harry, I go: 
When you say the other guy, I go: Harry's the best! 
- Harry's got personality. 
He's weird! He's weird! 
I know that guy but I know, like, zippy-zap about him. 
We just talked earlier. 
I mean, all he does is say yes... ...to everything everybody else is doing. You know, he's just sort of a "Hmm!" Little bit of a blank slate, I guess. That'll be $42, please. 
We all have something that makes us something and Emmet is... 
...nothing. 
There you go. 
- I told you I was a nobody. 
Oh. 
It's the perfect cover. 
Cover? Cover for what? 
I can't break him. 
Take him to the melting chamber. 
What? Aah! 
You're gonna melt me? Am I gonna die? You'll live. You'll be fine. 
President Business. 
I have him right here, sir. 
Yes, we've told him he'll live 
so he doesn't try to escape, but, um... ...we're lying to him. 
Wait, what did he just say? 
Hold still. 
Wait! There's obviously been a mix-up here. You've got the wrong... 
Ow! Ow, ow, ow! 
That is gonna start hurting... 
Page 10/60
...pretty soon. 
Ow, ow, ow! 
No, no, no! 
Whoa. Who are you? 
It's you? 
Come with me if you wanna not die. 
Hi, everybody! How's the melting goi...? Hey, hey, hey! 
Red alert, red alert. 
I need everyone, repeat: 
Everyone, 
to go after The Special. 
The tunnel's that way. 
Oh, boy! 
Oh, sir, you're brilliant. 
- We'll build a motorcycle out of the alleyway. - Ow. Oh. 
So, uh, didn't catch your name... 
...or anything about what you're, uh, up to. Or what we're doing here. 
It's brilliant, sir, that you pretended to be a useless nobody... 
...but you can drop the act with me. It's cool. 
Oh, the act. 
Whoa. 
Whoa! 
Jump on. Let's go! 
Hey, uh, I... 
Hang on, sir. 
All units... 
...cut him off on Elm, now! 
Or whenever you can. 
10-4, Bad Cop. 
- Watch out! 
- Hold on. 
We need to meet up with Vitruvius... ...and tell him the Piece has been found. Uh-huh. 
They're up on the monorail. 
Release the copper choppers. 
Oh, no! 
Will you please tell me what is happening? I'm rescuing you, sir. 
Page 11/60
You're the one the prophecy spoke of. You're The Special. 
Me? 
You found the Piece of Resistance. And the prophecy states... 
...that you are the most important, most talented... 
...most interesting... 
...and most extraordinary person 
in the universe. 
That's you. Right? 
Uh, yes. That's me. 
Great. You drive. 
What? 
I wanna go home! 
This is not what I meant! 
Oh, no. 
Look out, Special! 
Uh, sorry. Never driven a motorcycle. Sorry! - Wow, he's amazing. 
- Aah! 
That was incredible! 
You're even better 
than the prophecy said you'd be. 
Oh. Really? 
I'm, uh... I'm Wyldstyle. 
- Oh, I'm sorry, what was it? 
- Wyldstyle. 
- "Wyldstyle"? 
Yep. 
- What are you, a DJ? 
No. 
- Oh, that's your name? "Wyldstyle"? - Yeah. 
Like on your birth certificate, 
it says "Wyldstyle. " 
Let's not talk about my name! 
Don't let The Special get away. 
Sir, we've blocked the freeway. 
Hang on, sir! 
What are you doing? 
Let's fly! 
Whoa! 
Head for the secret tunnel. 
Page 12/60
Uh, these are the city limits. 
Let's just head for the tunnel. 
You want me to drive 
into that weird swirly hole? 
Are you insane? 
Don't brake! Go! Don't stop! Go! Now! I can't do this! 
That is against the instructions! Wait, what's your favorite restaurant? Any chain restaurant. 
Favorite TV show? 
Where Are My Pants? 
Favorite song? 
Everything Is Awesome! 
Oh, no! 
Darn, darn, darn, darny-darn! 
Wait. Where are we? 
This is so weir...! Ow! 
You're not The Special! You lied to me! It really kind of depends on... 
You're not even a MasterBuilder, are you? Uh, I mean, I know what a MasterBuilder is. Why don't you tell me what it is? That way I could see if you're right. You've ruined the prophecy. 
Look, I'm sorry, okay? You just... You made being special sound so good. And to think I was going to follow you to the end of the universe. 
You were? 
Here's the thing. 
How do we know for sure 
that I'm not The Special? 
- We just don't know it yet. 
- Quiet. 
Y'all want a giant turkey leg? 
Do you have any idea 
what that does to your colon? 
- Oh, my G-O-S-H. 
Just put the hat on. 
Oh... 
...and this. And this. And this. 
- And this. 
- Aah! 
Page 13/60
And, by the way, I have a boyfriend. Uh, I'm not sure exactly 
why you'd bring that up. 
It's super serious. 
You do not want to mess with him. 
Okay. 
So don't get any ideas. 
I never have any ideas. 
Wait! 
Stick them up. 
Hands where I can see them. 
Hey, uh, listen. You think 
you can explain why I'm dressed like this... ...and what those big words 
in the sky were all about? 
And, like, where we are in time. 
Your home, Bricksburg, 
is one of many realms in the universe. There's also this one... 
...Pirate's Cove, Knight's Club, 
Viking's Landing, Clown Town... 
...a bunch of others 
we don't need to mention. 
Mm-hm. 
Lord Business, 
or as you think you know him... 
...President Business... 
...stole the Kragle, 
the most powerful object in the universe. Blah, blah, blah. 
Proper name. Place name. Backstory stuff. ...Piece of Resistance is The Special. Mm-hm. 
I'm so pretty. I like you. 
But I'm angry with you for some reason. ...tower at the end of the universe... Mm-hm. 
...put the Piece of Resistance 
onto the Kragle... 
...and disarm it forever. 
Great. 
I think I got it... 
...butjust in case... 
...tell me the whole thing again. 
Page 14/60
I wasn't listening. 
Okay. All the people 
of the universe were once free to travel... ...and mingle and build 
whatever they wanted. 
But President Business 
was confused by all the chaos. 
So he erected walls between the worlds... ...and became obsessed 
with order and perfection. 
And he stole the mysterious... 
...secret super weapon called... 
The Kragle! 
- And he hired Bad Cop... 
...to hunt down all the MasterBuilders, who were always changing everything. And those of us who remained... 
...well, we went into hiding. 
Built the tunnels to survive. 
And we search for the Piece of Resistance. The only thing that can stop the Kragle. Kragle. I know that. 
It might have been that cop. 
He said something about the Kragle. President Business 
was going to use the Kragle... 
...to end the world in three days. I can't make any sense of it. 
Taco Tuesday. 
I knew that was suspicious. 
There's no time to lose. 
We must find Vitruvius and get to the Office Tower before it's too late. Okay. 
Heh. How scary can someone's office be? President Business, 
we're trying to locate the fugitive... ...but his face is so generic it matches every other face in our database. Diabolical. 
Okay, have Bad Cop meet me in my office... ...in 23 seconds. Ciao. 
- Will do, sir. 
Coffee sales are through the roof, sir. Page 15/60
Glad to hear it. 
Let's rebuild that roof to be even higher! - The roof team is on it. 
- Ha, ha. 
Sir, can you approve this poster 
for Taco Tuesday? 
Perfect. Whoo! 
- I love everyone in this room. 
We love you, sir! 
Greatjob on the radio station. 
Thank you, sir. 
We love listening to this song 
over and over again. 
Keep it up, guys. 
Honey, where are my... 
...pants? 
Ha-ha-ha! 
Cut! Ha, ha! 
Hilarious. That never gets old. 
It does not. 
Bad Cop is waiting for you 
in your office. 
Wonderful. Fantastic. 
Would you cancel my 2:00? 
This next meeting could run a little bit... ...deadly. 
Activate helmet. 
Light sequence. 
Flame test. 
- Engage dramatic entrance. 
Aah! 
Bad Cop. 
Lord Business. 
I know The Special got away, but... Don't be so serious. 
Where's the other guy? 
- Hey, friend. 
Hey, buddy! 
- I missed you. 
- Aw, did you really? 
Have I ever shown you my relic collection? Nope. I don't think you have. 
Nobody knows where this stuff comes from. This one... 
Page 16/60
...is the Cloak of Ban Da'Id. 
I hear it's super painful to take off. - You wanna try it on? 
- Well, um... 
No, but thank you. 
We've done some great work 
over the years together, Bad Cop... 
...capturing all those MasterBuilders... ...and torturing them and whatnot. 
Thank you, sir. 
Although... 
...you did let the Piece of Resistance go. The one thing that can ruin my plans. The one thing that I asked you to take care of. That's super frustrating. 
It makes me just wanna pick up whoever... ...is standing closest to me... 
...and throw them through this window... ...and out into the infinite abyss 
of nothingness! 
I wanna do it so bad. 
I know you do, sir. Please don't. 
And it's not just you, Bad Cop, 
that keeps messing up my plans. 
People everywhere 
are always messing with my stuff. 
But I have a way to fix that. 
A way to keep things exactly 
the way they are supposed to be. 
Permanently. 
Behold... 
...the most powerful weapon... 
...of all the relics: 
The Kragle! 
As you can see, they're 
loading the Kragle in a big machine upstairs. I call it... 
...the Tentacle Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer. Or TAKOS. 
The "S" is silent. 
So on Taco Tuesday... 
...it's going to spray the Kragle 
over everyone and everything... 
...with a bunch of super-scary nozzles Page 17/60
like this one! 
- I'll show you how it works. 
- Sir, I don't know if this is necessary. Oh, don't worry. I won't test it on you. I'll do it on your parents! 
What? 
- Hi, son. 
- Hi! 
How's it going in the big city? 
Mommy. Daddy. 
What are you doing here? 
Okay, Pa. I just want you to act naturally. - Like you're going about your day. - Gotcha. 
Yeah. Keep your hand up like that. Ma, scoot... 
...two steps in to the right. 
- Pa, whenever I talk to Ma... 
- Uh-huh? 
...you start to move. 
- Sorry, sir. 
Get back to where you were! 
- Here? 
Perfect. 
That's great. You can't do anything better. No reason why you should move. 
Right. 
Now, Ma... 
...hand on his shoulder. And you... Pa, you just moved... 
...and you've just wrecked it! 
- Uh-huh. 
You wrecked it! 
Bad Cop, you see what I'm talking about? All I'm asking for is total perfection. Send in a Micro-manager! 
Commencing micro-management. 
Hold still, you guys. 
And then... 
...I just spray them... 
...with the TAKOS. 
Oh, Pa, hold me. 
Oh, darling, I can't move me legs. - Does that upset you, Bad Cop? 
Page 18/60
- Um... 
Surely you feel bad for your parents, and you wanna help them, don't you? We're okay, son. Just a little stuck, is all. Go ahead... 
...finish the job. 
Of course, sir. 
No, I don't want to. 
- You have to. 
- I don't want to. 
- Would you please be quiet? 
- I can't. 
- You must. Shut it! 
- But they... 
- It's not nice. 
- It's yourjob, man. 
I can't do it. 
- They're innocent. 
- Just as I thought. 
Your Good Cop side's 
making you soft, Bad Cop. 
Robots! 
Bring me the fleece-crested 
Scepter of Q-Teep... 
...and the P-Lish Remover of Na-ll. You've already let The Special 
get away once. 
Sir. 
I'm just gonna make sure 
it doesn't happen again. 
No more Mr. Nice Guy! 
Oh, son! 
On Taco Tuesday, 
I'm going to Kragleize the entire universe... ...so that everyone 
will stop messing with my stuff! 
Are you gonna be with me... 
...or are you gonna be stuck... 
...having a tea party 
with your mom and dad? 
Son? 
Sorry, Dad. 
I have ajob to do. 
All you have to do is blend in 
Page 19/60
and act like you belong here. 
Ah, perfect. 
Well, hi there, I'm a cowboy! 
Bang, bang, bang-bang-bang-bang! 
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Bullet, bullet, gun. Zap, zap, zap, pow. Zap, pow. 
What are they looking at? 
I made a mistake. 
You should just be still. Act like a stool. - Wait! 
- Howdy, guys! 
- Quiet. Nope, stools don't talk. - Come sit on me. 
Okay, shh. 
Let me show you how it's done. 
What a lady! 
Okay, let me just find the wizard... ...and get this over with. 
- Ooh! 
- There he is. 
- Vitruvius. 
- Who? 
I've never heard of that man, 
whom I am not. 
- Who are you? 
- It's me. 
I am a blind man and cannot see. 
- It's Wyldstyle. 
- Oof. 
Are you a DJ? 
- What? Why does everybody...? 
- Oh, wait, wait. 
Are you the student I used to have... ...who was so insecure 
she kept changing her name? 
No, no, no. 
- First Darkstorm, then Geminizzle. - No. Never. 
Then Neversmile, then Freakface, 
then Snazzypants. 
Okay. All right, yes. 
Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds. 
Oh, man. 
You have a very weirdly... 
Page 20/60
...decorated place. 
- Thank you. 
Vitruvius, we have found 
the Piece of Resistance. 
- Is it true? 
Yes, but... 
Wyldstyle. The prophecy states that... ...you are The Special. 
The embodiment of good, 
foiler of evil. 
The most talented, most brilliant... ...most important person in the universe. That would be great... 
...but Emmet is the one... 
...who found the Piece. 
Oh, okay. Emmet! 
The prophecy states that... 
...you are The Special. 
- The most talented... 
- I'm not sure he's The Special. 
Because he's not even 
a MasterBuilder. Watch. 
Emmet, just given what's around you... ...build something simple. 
- Okay. 
Like an awesome race car. 
- Great. 
Go. 
- Do you have the instructions? 
No. You must create the instructions in your mind, my liege. 
Ah. Okay. Race car. 
Um... 
Well, there's a lot of really cool stuff here. Don't see a wheel... 
...or... 
...three more wheels. 
See? He can't do it. 
He will never be a MasterBuilder. 
Of course not. 
Not if you keep telling him he can't. He needs to see that he can. 
What are you doing? 
We are entering your mind... 
Page 21/60
- What? 
...to prove that you have 
the unlocked potential... 
...to be a MasterBuilder. 
Ujjayi breath. 
Whoa, are we inside my brain right now? - It's big. I must be smart. 
Mm-hm. 
I'm not hearing a lot of activity here. I don't think he's ever had 
an original thought. In his life. 
Ha, ha. That's not true. 
For instance, one time I wanted to have... ...a bunch of my friends over to watch TV... Not unlike this TV 
that just showed up magically. 
And not everybody 
can fit on my one couch... 
...and I thought to myself: 
"What if there was such a thing 
as a bunk bed... 
...but as a couch?" 
Introducing the double-decker couch. So everyone could watch TV together and be buddies! 
That is literally the dumbest thing I've ever heard. 
Please, Wyldstyle, let me handle this. That idea is just the worst. 
There must be something around here... ...that proves his potential. 
If The Man Upstairs 
chose him to be The Special... 
...there must be a reason. 
Who's The Man Upstairs? 
- See? 
He doesn't even know about 
The Man Upstairs. 
Does he have, like, super-gross hands... ...that look like they're made 
out of big pink sausages? 
Like eagle talons mixed with squid? Wait. You've seen the...? 
Whoa! 
Page 22/60
That's what I was just thinking about. How did you...? 
I had this weird dream 
when I touched the Piece. 
Well, I mean, I wasn't asleep, 
so it wasn't really a dream. 
Emmet, you had a vision. 
I did? 
MasterBuilders spend years... 
...training themselves 
to clear their minds enough... 
...to have even a fleeting glimpse 
of The Man Upstairs... 
...and yet, your mind is already 
so prodigiously empty... 
...that there is nothing in it 
to clear away in the first place. 
With proper training... 
...you could become a great MasterBuilder. I could? 
The prophecy chose you, Emmet. 
But I can't do any of the stuff... ...that the prophecy 
says I'm supposed to do. 
All you have to do is to believe. 
Then... 
...you will see everything. 
Are you ready, my son? 
Yes, I am. 
I think. 
Then we haven't a moment to lose. 
We must assemble... 
...the MasterBuilders. 
Do you think Zeppelins 
are a bad investment? 
Any of you fellas seen this guy? 
Wait a minute, partner. 
Draw a cowboy hat on him. 
These mechanical birds 
will get our message out. 
They will go to an Internet caf... ...and e-mail the remaining MasterBuilders... ...who will meet us in the secret realm of Cloud Cuckooland. 
Page 23/60
Cuckooland? Wait. 
What happened to that whole training part? Don't worry, Emmet. 
Your training begins now. 
Piano man... 
...open up. 
Your training begins later! 
On three. 
One... 
- Whew. I think we're in the clear. Freeze, turkeys. 
All I want is the Piece of Resistance. We would rather he died than give it to you. I would not rather he died. 
Look, everybody, we can do this 
the easy way, or we can do it... 
Go, run! 
They took the hard way. Fire! 
Fire! 
Vitruvius, which way to Cloud Cuckooland? Head for the big bright thing in the sky. You mean the sun? 
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. 
Let's get out of here. Here, use this. What? Wait, hey... 
- What are you doing? Aah! 
Let's go! 
I don't know what I'm doing. 
Goodbye. 
Boom! 
Oh, dang! 
Aah! I've got pigs! I hate pigs! 
Quit playing around in the mud. 
I could use your help. 
Wyldstyle, we could really use... 
...your help! 
Oink, oink, oink. 
Oink! 
Vitruvius, they're 
gaining on us. Build something! 
Let Emmet try! 
No, let's not let Emmet try! 
I haven't had any training. 
That's okay. 
Page 24/60
We'll start with 
how to become a MasterBuilder. 
Step one: 
Okay, okay. Um... 
Build something! Build something! Aha. Take that! 
Unless your instincts are terrible. No! The wheel! 
I can't control it much longer! Emmet, we need to attach the wheel to something that spins around. Um... 
We need to attach the wheel 
to something that spins around. We need to attach the wheel 
to something that spins around. We need to attach the wheel 
to something that spins around. Something that spins around. 
Spins around. Spins around. 
Oh. 
Emmet, where are you going? 
Oh, this better work. 
Hang tight! 
Dagnabit! 
Well done, Emmet. 
Hey! I did it. 
Wow. You actually did it. 
Train! 
Oh, no. 
Get off my train. 
Run! 
Wyldstyle! 
Owie! 
He's gonna ram us. 
Quick, quick, quick! That piece! Give me that piece. 
Huh? 
Build a ramp! 
What the heck? 
Rest in pieces. 
- Uh... 
- Oh, no. 
Page 25/60
Wait. No, no, no. 
Hey. 
Thanks for saving my life back there. Even if, you know... 
...eventually it turned out to be pointless. Well, for what it's worth... 
...this has been about the greatest 15 minutes of my life. 
What the...? 
Relax, everybody, I'm here. 
Batman! 
- What's up, babe? 
Babe! 
- What? 
- Oh, sorry. Batman, this is Emmet. Emmet, this is my boyfriend, Batman. I'm Batman. 
That's your boyfriend? Aah! 
Batman, huh? Where'd you guys meet? It's actually a funny story, right, Bat? There he is. 
- "Police" to meet you, Bad Cop. 
- Batman! 
The pleasure... 
...is all "spine. " 
Guess what... 
...you big dumb baby. 
Your car is a baby carriage. 
Oh, no, your boyfriend's gone. 
Hey, babe. 
- What? 
Let's hold hands. 
So, uh... 
Hey, guys, I think we're about 
to crash into the sun. 
Yeah, but it's gonna look really cool. Uh, is this Cloud Cuckooland? 
I don't see any clouds. 
- Or cuckoos. 
- No, no, this is... 
...Middle Zealand. 
A wondrous land... 
...full of knights, castles, mutton... ...torture weapons, poverty, 
Page 26/60
leeches, illiteracy... 
...and, um... 
Dragon! 
Yeah, that too. 
Once we arrive at Cloud Cuckooland, we'll raise an army... 
...of MasterBuilders to... 
Anyway, you guys gotta check out 
these new subwoofers I installed. I call them the dogs. Listen to them bark! Can you turn that down a little bit? This is a song I wrote for Wyldstyle. Darkness 
It's about how I'm an orphan. 
No parents 
This is real music, Emmet. 
Batman's a true artist. Dark, brooding. Well, I'm dark and brooding too. 
Guys, look, a rainbow. 
So you're gonna drive up the curved part... Super rich 
...take it all the way to the top... Kind of makes it better 
...and park the car. 
Friends, welcome 
to Cloud Cuckooland. Now... 
I just need to give the secret knock. Okay. 
I'm just gonna come right out. 
I have no idea what's going on... ...or what this place is at all. 
Hi! I am Princess Unikitty... 
...and I welcome you all 
to Cloud Cuckooland. 
There's no signs or anything. 
How does anyone know what not to do? Here in Cloud Cuckooland... 
...there are no rules. 
There's no government... 
...no babysitters... 
...no bedtimes... 
...no frowny faces... 
...no bushy mustaches... 
...and no negativity of any kind. Page 27/60
You just said the word "no" 
like a thousand times. 
And there's also no consistency. I hate this place. 
Any idea is a good idea... 
...except the not happy ones. 
Those you push down deep inside... ...where you'll never, ever, ever... ...ever... 
...find them. 
Your fellow MasterBuilders 
are gathered in the Dog. 
The what? 
Ah! Is that Superman? 
Girl, what are you doing? 
- Hey, Superman! 
- Oh, hey. What's up? 
- Lantern. Green Lantern. 
- Yeah, yeah. 
You wanna sit together at the meeting? Um, I have to go back to Krypton. Didn't Krypton blow up? 
My fellow MasterBuilders, 
including but not limited to... ...Robin Hood, Mermaid Lady... 
...Gandalf... 
...Swamp Creature... 
...1980-something Space Guy... 
- Hello! 
...2002 NBA All-Stars... 
...and Wonder Woman. 
- Unh! 
You have traveled far to be here for a moment of great import. 
We have learned... 
...that Lord Business plans to unleash... ...a fully weaponized Kragle... 
...on Taco Tuesday... 
...to end the world as we know it. Please, calm yourselves. 
Green Ninja... 
...Milhouse... 
...Nice Vampire... 
...Michelangelo, Michelangelo... Page 28/60
...and Cleopatra. 
There is yet one hope. 
The Special has arisen. 
Have the young man step forward. 
As you wish, Dubbledore. 
I'm Gandalf! 
- It's pronounced "Dumbledore. " 
- Dubbadore? 
No, "Dumbledore. " 
Thought you said "Dubbadore. " 
Vitruvius! 
You gotta write that down. 
I'm not gonna remember any of it. 
But here we go. 
The Special will now give 
an eloquent speech. 
Go ahead, man. You got this. 
Okay. 
Hello. I'm Emmet. 
Oh, and this is the Piece of Resistance. Thank you. 
Well, uh, I know that I, for one... 
...am very excited to work with you guys... ...to get into the Octan Tower, 
find the Kragle... 
...and put this thing on the thing. 
And I know it's going to be really hard, but... "Really hard"? 
Wiping ye bum with a hook 
for a hand is really hard. 
This be impossible. 
The last time we tried to storm 
Lord Business' office... 
...we used every plan we could conceive. The result was a massacre 
too terrible to speak of. 
Who are you? 
The name be Metal Beard. 
And I'll tell you me tale of woe. 
Oh, great, here we go again. 
I arrived... 
...at the foot of the Tower... 
...with me hearty MasterBuilder crew... ...only to fnd the Kragle was all 
Page 29/60
the way up on the infnityeth floor... ...guarded by a robot army... 
...and security measures... 
...of every kind... 
...imaginable: 
Lasers... 
...sharks... 
...laser sharks... 
...overbearing assistants... 
...and strange, dangerous relics... ...that entrap... 
...snap... 
...and zap. 
And there be a mysterious room 
called the Think Tank. 
I barely made it out of that... ...room... 
...with just me head! 
And organs. 
Okay. 
I had to replace every part 
of my once-strapping... 
...virile pirate body... 
...with this useless hunk of garbage ye see before ye. 
So if ye think 
it'd be a good idea to return... ...to that forsaken place... 
...Special... 
...what idea have ye that be better... ...than the ideas of 100... 
...of our fallen MasterBuilder brothers? Well, uh... 
Well, technically I'm not exactly a MasterBuilder yet. 
What? 
Please! Everyone! Please! 
Rubbish! 
Yes, it's true. 
I may not be a MasterBuilder. 
I may not have a lot of experience... ...fighting or leading 
or coming up with plans. 
Page 30/60
Or having ideas in general. 
In fact, I'm not all that smart. 
And I'm not what you'd call 
a "creative type. " 
Plus... 
...generally unskilled. 
Also... 
...scared and cowardly. 
I know what you're thinking: 
"He is the least qualified person... ...in the world to lead us. " 
And you are right. 
This is supposed to make us feel better? No, there was about to be a "but. " - You're a butt! 
- Yes. 
You all be on your own! 
I be leaving this lost cause! 
Why are you leaving? 
A house divided against itself 
would be better... 
...than this. 
Abraham Lincoln! 
You bring your space chair right back here! Come on, guys! 
We can still do this. Right? 
You're not even a bit special. 
Well, you were right about him 
being a ding-dong. 
You're a huge disappointment. 
Get him out of here. 
I don't wanna look at him. 
Well, at least it can't get any worse. I was wrong. 
It's the Orb of Tee-ti-list! 
Ruh-roh. It's the bad guys. 
Whoa. How did he...? 
Go! Run! Come on, everyone! 
Protect The Special. 
What's that on his ankle? 
It's a tracking device. 
Take the MasterBuilders prisoner. Oh, he led them right to us. 
Guys, no, no, no. It's not my fault. Page 31/60
You are the worst leader I've ever seen. To the Batmobile! 
Dang it. 
To the invisible jet! 
- Dang it! 
- Every man for himself. 
No, we must protect the Piece. 
Shaq, do you know what time... 
...it is? 
- It's game time. 
Y'all ready for this? 
Oh, no! They were ready for that. It didn't break! 
Because it's Kragled. Machine gum! Fire! 
No! 
Aah! I can't move! 
Don't worry, Superman. 
- I'll get you out of there. 
- No! Don't! 
Aah! Oh, my gosh. My hands are stuck. My legs are stuck as well. 
I super hate you. 
- Ow! You're pulling my torso off. - Babe... 
...help me get him out of here. 
I said "every man for himself. " Hey, you gotta be there for me. 
Fine! 
Fine. Fine. Fine. 
- I need you to have a better attitude. - I have a great... 
...attitude. 
- Ouch. 
The Special's in the northwest quadrant. We've got him cornered. 
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. 
Where'd he go? 
Oh, no! 
They've hit our silly cloud stabilizers! Let's go! 
We need to get Emmet out of here. Can't we build something? 
- Hey! I'm Ben. But you can call me Benny. Page 32/60
I can build a spaceship. Watch. 
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship 
Spaceship, spaceship 
No! You can't. The skies are surrounded. That's okay. I didn't really wanna build... ...a spaceship anyway. That's cool. Where can we go 
where we can't be found? 
Maybe we could go underwater? 
What if we went underwater? 
Great idea, babe! 
Thank you, Batman. 
Your ideas are the best. 
But I just said that. 
- We could build a submarine. 
- A Bat-Submarine, patent pending. With rainbows! 
And dream catchers, in case we take a nap. Like an underwater spaceship! 
But you can't build all of them at once. Ready? Break. 
Okay. 
These are the colors I need: 
Blue razzleberry and sour apple! 
If anybody has black parts, 
I need them, okay? 
I only work in black. 
And sometimes, very, very dark gray. - Use the yellow bricks! 
- Hey, guys, can I help? 
No! It has to be this way! 
No, I need that! 
Where is he? 
Anyone know what this is, 
and do you need it? 
I think we could use wings 
and rocket boosters. 
Ew. Get your retro space stuff 
out of my area. 
You guys, hey, just tell me exactly what to do. And how to do it. 
Emmet, don't worry about 
what the others are doing. 
You must embrace 
Page 33/60
what is special about you! 
There he is! 
All units, attack the sub! 
Emmet, get in here! 
Stop him! Stop him! Don't let him... ...get to the water! 
Dive, dive, dive! Everybody in! 
We're going under! 
Oh, no. 
My home. 
It's gone. 
I feel something inside. 
It's like the opposite of happiness. I must stay positive. 
Ah. Bubble gums. 
Butterflies. 
Cotton candy. 
Gosh, I'm so sorry, Unikitty. 
Do you want to sit down 
and talk about it? 
What the heck is that? 
It's a double-decker couch. 
Which seemed like a good idea 
at the time... 
...but I now realize it's not super helpful. But, you know, it has cup holders. Seats flip up with coolers underneath. You are so disappointing 
on so many levels. 
- Why are my pants cold and wet? 
- Ew. 
Uh... 
Hull breach. 
The walls are crying! 
We're coming apart at the seams! 
This is not how Batman dies. 
Emmet! 
- Hold on, hold on! 
- Wyldstyle! 
Deep breath! Deep breath, everybod...! Micro-managers, 
what's going on down there? 
Scanning submarine wreckage. 
No survivors detected. 
Page 34/60
Scuba cops, 
dredge the entire ocean if you have to. We have got to find that Piece. 
Let's get these prisoners 
back to Lord Business... 
...and give him the good news. 
The Special is no more. 
Hello, everybody! 
Superman. Wonder Woman, 
I had no idea you'd be here. 
Mr. Shaquille O'Neal. 
Greetings, all! 
Welcome to my Think Tank. 
Help us! 
All the MasterBuilders 
you've captured over the years... ...you've brought them here. 
You're a very perceptive person, Superman. They come up with all the instructions for everything in the universe. 
Robots! 
No! No! Grr! 
Can't get much worse than this. 
Uh, hello, neighbor. 
- Oh, no. 
It's Green Lantern. 
Oh, my gosh, we're roommates! 
How crazy is that? 
Does anyone have some Kryptonite that they could give me? 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where is The Special? The Special and the Piece of Resistance are at the bottom of the ocean. 
Wait, are you telling me 
you don't have him? 
Sir, my scuba team is looking 
for his remains as we speak. 
Bad Cop, he could still be alive! The Piece could still be out there. The only remnant of The Special 
was a double-decker couch. 
Wait, hold on. 
A double-decker couch? 
Yes, sir. 
Page 35/60
Really? So it's like a bunk-bed couch? Is that what it's like? 
That's weird. 
If you're sitting in the top middle... ...how are you gonna get down 
without climbing over someone? 
If you're sitting on the bottom 
and you're watching TV... 
...are you gonna have to watch 
through a bunch of dangling legs? 
Who's gonna want to sit on the bottom? It is literally... 
...the most useless idea 
I have ever heard. 
- Well, we're still alive. 
- Yeah! 
Heh. The double-decker couch. 
It wasn't totally pointless after all. It's the one thing that stayed together. I always believed in you, Emmet. 
I don't mean to spoil the party, 
but does anyone else notice... 
...we're stuck in the middle 
of the ocean on this couch? 
I mean, it's not like a big gigantic ship... ...is gonna come out of nowhere 
and save us... 
My gosh! 
Avast, mateys! 
Metal Beard, I thought you said 
we were a lost cause! 
Ye are! 
Did ye not hear me whole story... 
...circumscribing the folly 
of this whole enterprise? 
Well, it's kind of hard not to hear when you're yelling everything. 
So why did you come back? 
This be-doubled land couch. 
I watched Lord Business' forces 
completely overlook it. 
Which means we need more ideas like it! Oh, thank you. 
Ideas so dumb and bad... 
Page 36/60
...that no one would ever think they could possibly be useful. 
Oh. Thank you. 
So, Special, what do we do? 
Uh... 
Well... 
...what's the last thing Lord Business expects MasterBuilders will do? Build a spaceship? 
Kill a chicken? 
Marry a marshmallow. 
Why, this: 
How you gonna keep 'em down on the farm? No! It's follow the instructions. - Don't like that. 
- Sounds weird. 
Now, listen. Wait, listen. 
Guys, you're all so talented 
and imaginative. 
But you can't work together as a team. I'm just a construction worker. But when I had a plan and we were all working together... 
...I mean, we could build a skyscraper. Now, you're MasterBuilders. 
Just imagine what could happen 
if you did that. 
You could save the universe. 
Well said, Emmet. Well said. 
Really? 
She be a fine speech there, laddie. Okay. 
Somebody get me some markers... ...some construction paper... 
...and some glitter glue! 
I call this: 
"Emmet's plan to get 
inside the Tower... 
...put the Piece of Resistance 
on the Kragle... 
...and save the world. " 
I've built a hundred just like them Page 37/60
back in the city. 
If we can just get in, I know where the air ducts and wiring are located. I can get us anywhere. 
How will we get inside? 
In a spaceship. 
- Spaceship! Ha, ha! 
- Great idea. A Bat-Spaceship. 
No, they're expecting us to show up... ...in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship. 
One of those sounds awesome to me. My idea is to build a spaceship... ...that's exactly like all the other Octan delivery spaceships. 
So not the special spaceship that 
I'm building for all of you right now? Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time. 
Ooh, you're really letting the oxygen out of my tank here. 
Yeah, but according 
to your precious instructions... 
...this ship needs a hyperdrive. 
We don't have that part. 
Maybe we could find one! 
What do you think, a spaceship 
is just gonna appear out of the blue? Are you kidding me? 
The same thing! 
- Chewie! 
- Mm! 
We're supposed to be halfway 
to Naboo for a sweet party! 
This hyperdrive keeps malfunctioning... ...taking us to loser systems like this. Captain Solo, we must go. 
You know how perturbed I get 
if we are not punctual. 
The Droid's right. Let's roll. 
Now hold on, Han. 
This might be the right galaxy after all. Because I see a heavenly body. 
Ooh, whoa, I have a boyfriend. 
And it is super serious. Right, babe? Page 38/60
- Of course it's serious. 
- Yeah! 
- Got room forjust one dude? 
- Whoa! Babe! 
If he's a cool dude like you. 
You're trying to bail on us! 
I'm not trying to bail! 
You asked them if you could go 
with them on their party ship! 
That thing is filled with bon vivants. You speak French now? 
Babe, look, if this relationship 
is ever gonna work between us... 
...I need to feel free to party... ...with a bunch of strangers 
whenever I feel like it. 
What? 
Babe! 
I will text you. 
Where'd you get that 
sweet space cape, brother? 
It's party time! 
Babe? 
Wyldstyle, you're such an amazing person. And, you know, 
if Batman can't see that, then he's just... Well, he's just as blind as a guy... ...whose eyes stopped working. 
And I'm gonna tell you something: Batman is the worst person I've ever met. - Need a hyperdrive? 
- No way. 
- Babe! 
- I knew it! I knew that. 
You really had me there! 
Those guys were so lame. 
All they did was play space checkers. Plus, it turns out the hairy one's a dude. And the metal one too. All dudes. But won't they notice 
their hyperdrive is missing? 
Come on, Chewie, hit the hyperdrive. Nah, they'll be fine. 
Page 39/60
Step one: 
All right, we need a red four-piece unit over at the... 
Unikitty... 
...you're supposed to follow 
the instructions, remember? 
Sorry. 
Ugh, this gives me the jeebies. 
What do I even...? I can't...! 
Nice! 
Step two: 
We pilot the ship to the service entrance... ...so we can get past the dangerous... ...but also kind of cool... 
...laser gate. 
Space ID. 
I have a drive-on. 
Who are you here to see? 
I'm here to see Your Butt. 
Is that last name "Butt," 
first name "Your," or is it...? 
Oh, my gosh! 
Pow. Wham. Ka-zap. 
First try! 
Step three: 
We break into Lord Business' office... ...and we'll plunder his collection of relics for disguises. 
Step four: 
Benny and Metal Beard... 
...will sneak their way 
into the master control room. 
Motion sensors triggered in Sector 12. 10-4. 
Uh-oh. 
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Oh! 
Do it. 
Metal Beard, that was awesome! 
First law of the sea... 
...never place your rear end 
Page 40/60
on a pirate's face. 
Once inside, 
they'll use their technical know-how... ...to disable the Kragle shield. 
I am the computer. 
Cool! Talking computer. 
Please disable the shield systems. Of course. 
There are no movies 
in your area with that title. 
Step fve: 
Vitruvius will provide lookout 
and make sure we're not being followed. Okay. 
Step six: 
Batman and Unikitty go into the boardroom... ...to make one last change 
to Lord Business'plan. 
I move that we freeze the universe. Can I get a second on that? 
I second. 
Bruce Wayne, CEO of Wayne Enterprises. Bruce Wayne? Uh, who's that? 
Sounds like a cool guy. 
We'd like to invest in your company. Your weapon to control 
the universe sounds super sweet... ...I must say. 
- It is, indeed, super sweet. 
Cool. What kind of sound system 
does it have? 
Uh, sound system? 
Well, I mean, we have an iPod Shuffle. Wait a second. 
You're telling me you have 
a machine to control the universe... ...and you can't listen to tunes 
in surround sound? 
Embarrassing. 
Well, I mean... 
...we need to get that done. 
I want eight-foot speakers. 
Page 41/60
Great call. 
Yeah, I want speakers that you can hug with your arms and your legs... 
...and just feel the beat. 
Listen up! We need new instructions for a speaker system for the TAKOS. We'll never help. 
Whatever you say, boss. 
Then once the instructions are printed... ...Wyldstyle and I 
will enter the Kragle room... 
...place the thing on the other thing... ...and save the universe. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, I didn't draw that. Is that me exploding? 
Uh, I didn't mention that earlier? When you reunite the Piece 
with the Kragle, it might explode? No! But it might not, right? 
Sure, sure, sure. Let's go with that. Attention, everybody! 
Incoming speaker delivery! 
Ow! 
Who are you two? 
We are transfers from downstairs. - What? 
- Excuse me? 
Your robot voice 
sounds an awful lot like a human voice. Give me a break. 
I've never been a robot before. 
What do you mean? 
You have always been a robot! 
No, no, no, do not listen to her. What are your robot serial numbers? Everything is awesome 
No way. This is my jam. 
This is also my jam. 
Everything is awesome 
Everything is cool 
When you're part of a team 
- Needs great harmonies. 
- I don't want to sing the song. I'm not... Everything is awesome 
Page 42/60
Everything is cool 
When you're part of a team 
Everything is awesome 
When we're living our dream 
Quick, let's go. 
Everything is awesome 
Hmm, I thought you didn't like that song. I don't. 
Mm-hm. 
I know you put on this tough act... ...but I don't think you're as mean as you're trying to seem. 
I'm not mean. What are you talking about? I'm just saying, you were all, 
"He's not The Special, Vitruvius. 
He can't possibly be The Special. 
This guy? Are you kidding me?" 
Anyways, I don't think that's you. 
The real you, anyway. 
Look, Emmet. 
I wanted it to be me, okay? 
I wanted to be The Special. 
And I know that sounds super mature. It's just... 
...ever since I heard the prophecy, I wanted to be the One. 
I was right there in that construction site... ...right on top of it, and then... 
...it turned out to be you. 
That night in the city, 
when you thought I was The Special... ...and you said I was talented 
and important... 
...that was the first time anyone 
had ever really told me that. 
And it made me 
wanna do everything I could... 
...to be the guy you were talking about. Lucy. 
What? 
That was my real name. 
You asked earlier, and it's... 
...Lucy. 
I really like that name. 
Page 43/60
Hey. 
- What are you two losers talking about? - Huh? What? Oh, nothing. 
Thought I'd help you guys. 
Left the weird cat thing to stall. Business, business, business. Numbers. - Is this working? 
Yes. 
Yay! 
There's Bad Cop. 
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes... 
Okay. Wait for my signal. 
Good luck, Emmet. 
Lucy. 
I guess this might be goodbye. 
I don't like goodbyes. 
Let's just call this: 
"See you later, alligator. " 
"See you later, alligator"? 
After a while, crocodile. 
Who's Lucy? 
Batman, when we get inside this room... ...there are gonna be 
audio sensors everywhere. 
We have to be really, really quiet. Don't worry, Dad, I read your dumb instructions. Stop yelling at me. Benny, what's our status with the shield? Oh, yeah, no, it's going great. 
It's just going great, 
if somebody would listen to me! 
Downloading latest episode 
ofWhere Are My Pants? 
Where are you 
getting "pants" from? You know what I want! The pipes are calling... 
Bad Cop. 
Hi, this is Lord Business'assistant. He would like you to come 
to his office immediately. 
Copy that. 
- Thanks. 
- You are welcome, sir. 
Hey, who is that? 
Page 44/60
That's the signal... 
...but the shield is still up. 
We'll wing it. 
That's a bat pun. 
Shh. Benny... 
...disable the shield. 
Disable the shield. 
Now. 
Disable the shield. 
- Searching for Albanian restaurants. - What? 
No! I never once said anything...! I don't understand what you mean. Disable the shield! 
Benny, what's going on? 
Disable the shield! Come on! 
You are undermining me! 
Which phrase 
would you like me to underline? Disable the shield! 
Let me try. 
Be ye disabling of yon shield. Disabling shield. 
What? 
Okay, in three... 
...two... 
...one. 
Let's do this. 
Lucy! 
Lucy! 
No! 
Oh, man. 
Oh, no. 
Uh-oh. 
Sneaking around the corner... 
- Unh! 
- Vitruvius. 
I see you've accidentally 
wandered into my Think Tank. 
And by the way, 
I found a few of your friends. - By which I mean all of them! - Sorry! 
Acceptable work, Bad Cop. 
Page 45/60
Thank you, sir. 
Robots, destroy this old man at once. Did you just call me "old"? 
Yeah. So what? 
Well, Junebug, I really prefer the word... ..."experienced"! 
Aha. 
You see, Emmet? 
A corrupted spirit is no match 
for the purity of imagina... 
- Ha-ha-ha! 
Vitruvius! 
No! 
Vitruvius. 
My sweet Emmet. Come closer. 
You must know something 
about the prophecy. 
I know, I'm doing my best... 
...but I don't... 
The prophecy... 
I made it up. 
What? 
I made it up. It's not true. 
But that means I'm just... 
I'm not The Special? 
You must listen. 
What I'm about to tell you... 
...will change the course of history. No. 
No. 
Hey. 
Not so special anymore, huh? 
Well, guess what. 
No one ever told me I was special. I never got a trophy just for showing up! I'm not some special little snowflake... ...no. 
But as unspecial as I am... 
...you are a thousand-billion times... ...more unspecial than me. 
Robots, bring me the Sword of Exact Zero. Yes, Lord Business. 
It must be weird. 
One minute, you're the most 
Page 46/60
special person in the universe. 
And the next minute, you're nobody. 
Oh, I have a nice spot 
for this in my relic room. 
Uh-oh! My mistake! 
There it goes! 
No! 
Bye-bye forever! 
Well, I guess 
there's only one thing left to do! 
Release the Kragle! 
- Computer! 
- Yes, sir. 
Set the electric shocker to 100 Mississippi. No problem. 
- Then terminate everyone. 
- Already on it. 
Emmet, that should give you enough time... ...to witness the first location to be Kragled. - Your hometown. 
- No! 
Bad Cop, unfortunately, 
I'm gonna have to leave you here to die. What? Sir. 
It's not personal. 
It's just business. 
Lord Business. 
Ciao. 
Beginning zapping termination... 
...in 99 Mississippi... 
...98 Mississippi... 
...97 Mississippi... 
...and so on. 
Attention, everyone. 
This is President Business. 
Hello. 
- Hi, welcome to Taco Tuesday! 
- Whoa. 
Don't worry about this big black... 
...monolith thing that's blocking out the sun. What you need to worry about... 
...is this question that I'm about to ask you: Who wants a taco? 
Yeah! I know! 
Page 47/60
Tacos, tacos! We're going crazy! Yeah. All right, everyone. 
Act normal. 
Perfect. 
Now, everybody say "Freeze!" 
So I guess running around 
and screaming is normal. 
Micro-managers, 
commence micro-management. 
Commencing micro-management. 
What's going on? I can't move! 
Please, please! Won't somebody help us? Emmet, you'll think of something, right? Like you always do. 
Didn't you hear him? 
The prophecy's made-up. 
I'm not The Special. 
And to think for a moment 
I thought I might be. 
Emmet. 
- Who said that? 
I did. 
I am Ghost Vitruvius. 
Woo! 
Emmet, you didn't let me finish earlier. Because I died. 
The reason I made up the prophecy... ...was because I knew that 
whoever found the Piece... 
...could become The Special. 
Because the only thing 
anyone needs to be special... 
...is to believe that you can be. I know that sounds like a cat poster, but it's true. 
Look at what you did 
when you believed you were special. You just need to believe it some more. But how can I just decide 
to believe that I'm special... 
...when I'm not? 
Because the world depends on it. Woo! 
Zapping termination in 35 Mississippi... Page 48/60
What? 
...34 Mississippi... 
...33 Mississippi... 
...32 Mississippi... 
...31 Mississippi... 
...30 Mississippi... 
...29 Mississippi... 
...28 Mississippi, 27 Mississippi... ...26 Mississippi... 
...25 Mississippi... 
...24 Mississippi... 
Emmet! 
What are you...? 
18 Mississippi... 
...17 Mississippi... 
Oh! 
...16 Mississippi... 
- Lucy! 
...15 Mississippi... 
- Wait! What are you...? 
Now it's your turn to be the hero. 13 Mississippi... 
- No! 
...12 Mississippi... 
See you later, alligator. 
Don't! 
No, Emmet! 
- Aah! 
7 Mississippi... 
...6 Mississippi... 
...5 Mississippi... 
...4 Mississippi... 
...3 Mississippi... 
...2 Mississippi... 
...1 Mississippi... 
...0 Missi... Error. 
Termination failure. 
Emmet! 
No. 
He... He saved us. 
Well, what do we do now? 
There's gotta be a bright side... ...here somewhere. 
Does anyone have any ideas? 
Page 49/60
Emmet had ideas. 
Arr, if only there were more people in the world like he. 
Maybe there are. 
Meet me downstairs in 10 seconds. 
Honey, where are my... 
...pant...? 
- Hi! 
Hey, guess what. 
Found your pants. Series is over. Benny... ...send this out to everyone in the universe. 1980-something technology? 
Now you're talking! 
Uh... Ahem. Hey, everybody. 
You don't know me, 
but I'm on TV, so you can trust me. I know things seem kind of bad right now. But there is a way out of this. 
This is Emmet. 
And he was just like all of you. 
A face in the crowd... 
...following the same instructions as you. He was so good at ftting in, 
no one ever saw him. 
And I owe you an apology... 
...because I used to look down 
on people like that. 
"I used to think they were followers... ...with no ideas or vision. " 
Because it turns out Emmet had great ideas. And even though they seemed weird... ...and kind of pointless... 
...they actually came closer... 
...than anyone else to saving the universe. And now we have to fnish what he started... ...by making whatever weird thing 
pops into our heads. 
All of you have the ability 
inside of you to be a groundbreaker. And I mean literally! 
Break the ground! 
Peel up the pieces... 
...tear apart your walls! 
Build things only you could build. Page 50/60
Defend yourselves. 
We need to fght back 
against President Business'... 
...plans to freeze us! 
Today will not be known as Taco Tuesday. It will be known as Freedom Friday! But still on a Tuesday! 
End of the line. 
Bad Cop? 
I hope there's still a Good Cop in me somewhere. 
I'll hold these guys off. 
You go stop them. Yay! 
Great idea, but how will we get there? T- minus one. 
Ten, nine, eight... 
...seven, six... 
- I could, uh... 
...fve, four... 
- I could build a... 
...three, two, one. 
I could build a spaceship! 
You're not gonna say no? 
Build away, whatever your name is. - Whoa! Yay! 
- Ha-ha-ha! 
Okay. Spaceship! Spaceship! 
Spaceship! 
Spaceship! 
Spaceship! 
Spaceship! 
Spaceship! 
Spaceship! 
Spaceship! 
All units, attack that spaceship. Spaceship! 
Where'd he go? 
Spaceship! 
Wyldstyle, look... 
...it's the citizens! 
Tallyho! 
Yee-haw! 
And don't forget us MasterBuilders. What is going on? 
Page 51/60
You stop... 
...building that stuff! 
Just stop it! 
Greatjob! 
This might actually work. 
'Twas your speech 
which roused this hearty crew. If only Emmet were here to see this. He'd say something adorable like... Am I just gonna keep... 
...falling... 
...forever? 
Is this another vision? 
Where am I? 
Is that the Office Tower? 
Bricksburg! 
What was that? 
No, no, no. 
No! 
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship! - Pew! 
What in the world is that? 
It's adorable. 
Uh-oh. 
No. No. Whoa, no, no, no. 
Hey, don't eat me. Don't eat me. Do not eat me. Please. 
Hi, Emmet. 
Uh... 
Hi? 
Is this The Man...? 
The Man Upstairs? 
What happened? 
No, no, no, this is a disaster. Why...? Why...? What? What? 
What? 
Why is the dragon on top 
of the luxury condo development? But I was just playing... 
I know it's hard to understand... ...but this is Dad's stuff, okay? All of this that you see before you... ...is all your father's. 
And everything is thought-out very... Page 52/60
What did you do down here? 
Did you take the top off of the tower? It was an accident. 
You accidentally... 
...expertly... 
...carefully took the entire top off of that tower? 
Yes. 
You know the rules. This isn't a toy. - Um, well, it kind of is. 
- No. 
Actually, it's a highly sophisticated interlocking brick system. 
- But we bought it at the toy store. - We did. 
But the way I'm using it 
makes it an adult thing. 
The box for this one said ages 8 to 14. That's a suggestion. 
They have to put that on there. You can't expect me to be able to resist playing with all this. You have your stuff over near 
the Christmas decorations. 
All those bricks, 
you can build anything you want. Finn, we're gonna play a little game. It's called: 
"Let's Put Everything Back 
the Way You Found It. " 
But, Dad, you don't understand. So I can make things 
the way they're supposed to be. Permanently. 
More Kragles? 
This rebellion ends right now. Commencing... 
...micro-management. 
Oh, no. No! 
Ha, ha! Fire in the hole! 
Wait, what's happening? 
No, wait! No, we're going down! Mayday! 
No! 
Page 53/60
Meow. Meow. 
Hold on, Jeff. We're coming for you! No! 
Stop! 
Oh, no! 
Arr, there be too many Micro-managers! What am I holding here? 
- It's a battleship. 
- No, it's a hodgepodge. That's what it is. What's Batman doing on it? 
What is this, a robot pirate? 
Dang it. 
Stop! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop! You got glue all over 
that construction worker. 
Here. Give that to me. 
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! 
All of those are my friends! No, stop it! Ye were a hearty crew. But it be... It be over. 
No! 
The Piece of Resistance! 
I can still save them! 
Let's get this gunk 
off this construction worker. 
He's notjust a construction worker, Dad. He's the hero. 
Nope, he's not. 
He is a ordinary, regular... 
...generic construction worker... ...and I need to put him back 
where he belongs. 
Now, where is my X-Acto knife? 
I gotta get the Piece of Resistance. If I could get the attention 
of the smaller creature... 
I gotta move. 
Where is that? 
Move! 
All right. 
Move! 
Now, I didn't move... 
Ow. 
Uh, Dad? 
Page 54/60
- Yeah. 
I think I saw the X-Acto over there near Middle Zealand. 
Oh, great. Thank you. 
Welcome. 
It's up to you now, Emmet. 
Believe. 
I know that sounds like a cat poster... ...but it's true. 
Whoa! 
Sorry, street. 
Ho-ho! 
I can see everything. 
Ha, ha! 
What the heck is this? 
I am a MasterBuilder. 
Release every Micro-manager we have! Let's get him, fellas! 
Hey, everyone! 
- Emmet! 
- Emmet! Yay! 
Lucy, I'm going inside that thing. You've got it, Emmet. 
Take that! Ha, ha! 
Good night! Come here! 
We'll help you out, kid. 
Here's how we do it pirate-style! Yes! Emmet! That's it! 
Take him down, boys! 
Emmet! 
Stay positive. 
They're tearing me apart! 
Stay positive. 
Come on! 
Oh, forget it! 
You all need to be more friendly! Emmet, go! 
Go! Now's your... 
...chance! 
She's right! 
- You can do it, me laddie! 
Go on, kid. Get in there! 
Sir, we got an intrud...! 
Lord Business. 
Page 55/60
Back from the dead, Brickowski? 
Well, you're too late! 
Skeletrons, get him! 
Argh! I can't move! 
You see, your friends... 
...oh, they're fnished! 
My world is almost fnished. 
The last thing I need to do is finish... ...you. 
- No, stop! Please! 
If you do one more thing, 
I'm gonna unleash my secret weapon. Your secret weapon? 
Yes, it's called: 
The Power of The Special. 
That sounds dumb. 
All right, here it comes. 
My secret weapon... 
...is this. 
What is that? Is it super small? 
I don't see anything. 
It's my hand. I want you to take it. You want me to take your hand off? 
No, I want you to join me. 
Look at all of these things that people built. You might see a mess... 
Exactly. And a bunch 
of weird, dorky stuff... 
...that ruined my perfectly good stuff! Okay. What I see... 
...are people inspired by each other... ...and by you. 
People taking what you made... 
...and making something new out of it. Finn, did you make all of this? 
The people are trying to stop 
President Business... 
...from using the Kragle. 
What's the Kragle? 
Um, it's in there. 
In here? 
So President Business is the bad guy? Lf... 
If the construction guy... 
Page 56/60
...said something 
to President Business... 
...what would he say? 
You... 
...don't have to be... 
...the bad guy. 
You... 
...are the most talented... 
...most interesting... 
...and most extraordinary person in the universe. 
And you are capable of amazing things... ...because you are The Special. 
And so am I. 
And so is everyone. 
The prophecy is made-up... 
...but it's also true. 
It's about all of us. 
Right now, it's about you. 
And you... 
...still... 
...can change everything. 
Oh, we got a hugger. 
Be careful. 
I have been told it might explode. Phew. 
Emmet, thank you. 
And I just want you to know, 
from the bottom of my heart... 
...from this moment forward... 
...I solemnly promise that I will never... Emmet! 
Hey, everyone! Is everyone okay? Where's Lucy? 
Emmet! 
Lucy! 
We did it. 
Oh. Uh, Emmet, wait. 
Batman, there's something 
I need to say to you. 
No. Wyldstyle... 
I mean... 
...Lucy. 
He's the hero you deserve. 
Page 57/60
Uh... 
- Thanks, Batman. 
I liked Emmet before it was cool. Whoops, I have the antidote for the Kragle. How did that happen? 
Yay! 
- De-Kragler. 
Watch this. 
- Yay! 
- Oh, Mommy, Daddy. 
You're okay! 
- Oh, son! 
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. 
We're okay, son. Ha, ha. 
Guys, time to come up for dinner. It's Taco Tuesday, your favorite. - Okay, honey. We'll be up in a sec. - Yeah, we'll be up in a sec! 
- I gotta tell you something. 
What? 
Now that I'm letting you 
come down here and play... 
...guess who else gets to 
come down here and play? 
- Who? 
- Your sister. 
What? 
Well, things sure have a way 
of working out smoothly. 
Am I right, guys? 
What? 
We're from the Planet Duplon. 
We are here to destroy you. 
Oh, man. 
Yes, this is real music. 
Dark, brooding... 
...important... 
...groundbreaking. 
Check out the lyrics. 
Darkness 
No parents 
Continued darkness 
More darkness. Get it? 
The opposite of light 
Page 58/60
Black hole 
Curtains drawn 
In the basement 
Middle of the night 
Blacked-out windows 
Other places that are dark 
Black suit 
Black coffee 
You get it. That's just the frst verse. Darkness 
No parents 
Super rich 
Kind of makes it better 
Everything is awesome 
Everything is... 
Oh, hey. God, I still can't get that song out of my head. 
It's truly amazing how many LEGO fans there are around the world... 
...who love to create short films using LEGO bricks. 
The filmmakers of The LEGO Movie, Chris and Phil... 
...thought it would be fun to challenge the ReBrick community... 
That's LEGO's official 
social media platform. 
- To come up with an original brick film between 15 and 30 seconds... 
...with the winning entry being featured during The LEGO Movie. How cool is that? Look at all these things that people built. Just to make it a bit more challenging, entries had to incorporate the theme... ...of a LEGO mini figure changing up their environment to fight off a bad guy. Well, the ReBrick community went to work and created some really fun... 
...and really incredible mini movies entirely made out of LEGO bricks. We're giving you the opportunity 
to see some of the top entries... ...along with the winning submissions. So be ready to be blown away

Shit. 
Darcy, you really shouldn't have come. Show me. 
Corporate 
was adamant. We keep running. 
No stopping operations. 
No, no, no. You got to go through. No cameras. 
He's got orders to kill. 
I don't even think 
international laws apply up here. We are geologists first. 
If this thing 
has any historical significance at all, we are shutting down. 
I'm shutting us down. 
He's going to shoot me? Shoot me. Hey, don't kill her. 
This is crazy stuff. 
Crazy shit. 
Well, what do you think? 
I think history is about to change. I'm a nasty woman 
Look who decided 
to show up for work. 
I'm a heartbreaker 
Gonna make you cry 
What, surf report no good 
at South Padre? 
The waves are flat and I got no gas. You know that, Cade. 
Dude. Rude. 
Look at these two junebugs. 
Whoo! My, my! 
Hey, you're paying me on this one, right, Cade? 
Please tell me I'm getting paid. You know, Lucas, a lot of guys are just happy to have a job at all. Yeah, I suppose. 
- You got any cash on you? 
- Yeah. 
All right, good. 
Hey, Lucas Flannery. 
Page 2/70
Place has been 
in the family since '28. 
Granddaddy ran it all his life. Ain't that right, Granddaddy? 
Real soon 
he's going to sign it over to me. The movies nowadays, 
that's the trouble. 
Sequels and remakes, bunch of crap. I love that one. 
He's deaf and senile. 
Heard that. 
Now these just need 
some spit and polish. 
I believe they're digital, possibly IMAX. Yeah, they're not. 
Mister, we'll have a look around if you want to leave us to it, okay? You know, folks used to come 
from miles around 
to see the dancing girls 
with the big cha-chas. 
I swear to God 
I am one diaper change away 
from poisoning his oatmeal. 
Hey, you hang in there, buddy. 
If coming here makes you feel young, then you tell this kid 
to bring you here every day. 
Seven bucks, I keep talking. 
Sold. 
Remember this place 
when we were kids? 
How many girls you think 
you brought here in high school? I only remember one. 
Hey, heads! 
That's why you didn't make 
the varsity team. 
All right. Go long. 
Leave it. 
Mortar shells? 
What the hell happened to you? 
Hey, snakeballs. 
Page 3/70
How much for the truck? 
Truck? 
Two more weeks, girls, 
till no more classes, ever. 
Almost time to get a tan and get wasted! Please, please. 
No financial aid. Great. 
Yes, I know I'm home, thank you. Intruder alert! 
Back away from the premises! 
- Voice recognition. It's me! 
- I am dialing 911. 
Go right ahead. I don't care. 
I'm still calling 911. 
The Battle of Chicago was an event that permanently changed our world. Over 1,300 dead. 
Much of the city has been destroyed. Homeland Security is urging everyone to report suspicious alien activity. A swift act of Congress 
put an end to all joint operations between the military and the Autobots, ending the alliance. 
As this committee knows, 
the Invasion of Chicago 
was a defining day 
for our nation five years ago. 
The day millions of people realized that never again can we allow aliens to fight our battles for us. 
A handful of Autobots 
were given sanctuary 
after joint-combat operations 
were abolished. 
Fewer than a dozen Decepticons 
are still on the run 
thanks to our CIA unit, 
"Cemetery Wind." 
Hurry, let's get it 
to my house, guys. 
As for the alien technology, 
our objective remains 
to keep it in American control. Page 4/70
Hi. My name is Timothy. 
This is my crew. 
We found this alien ball turret in Chicago. 
We just found it in the rubble 
and it's all working... 
Word has it Japan, India, 
the Israelis may have gotten their hands on a couple of ships. 
Apparently the Russians 
are starting a bidding war. 
We're taking $5,000 for it. 
It's got 36 guns, alien shit. 
A new era has begun. 
And the age of the Transformers is over. Hey. 
Hey, I've been waiting for you. You're looking hot today! 
Yeah? 
How about you take your shirt off? You want me to take my shirt off right now? 
What would your dad think of that? - What the hell? 
- Hey, where you going? 
I cannot believe him. 
I cannot believe this. 
What the hell? 
All the way! 
A truck? 
Dad, please tell me 
you didn't spend our money on this. No, don't worry, he didn't. 
He spent my money. 
A hundred and fifty bucks of it. As an advance 
on your regular paycheck. 
- What regular paycheck? 
- Which you will get back. 
- When? 
- Never. We're broke. 
I knew it. 
Sweetheart, could you please not drive a wedge 
Page 5/70
between employer and employee. 
Hold on. I thought we were partners. Look, I came up short, okay? 
I had to buy her a prom dress. 
You want me to deny her a prom dress? You might as well. 
You denied her a prom date. 
No, I offered to take her and chaperone. Nobody wants to go to the dance 
with their dad. It's weird. 
It's not the issue. 
Well, maybe it should be. 
Hey, could you guys 
just get off my case? 
You know what the engine 
on this runs for? 
I can break it down and strip it for parts. And sweetheart, your shorts 
are shrinking by the second, okay? Cold water, air dry, please. 
I think she looks hot. 
What did you say? 
Like a hot teenager. 
It's the "teenager" thing 
that makes it better. Thank you. 
It didn't sound like what it meant. That goes by the circuit boards. 
Put the Zeiss lenses over there. 
Dad, please. You can't keep 
spending money on junk 
just so you can turn it 
into different junk. 
We do not use the "J" word in here. That is a Super Simplex 
theater projector. It's very rare. What about the SmilePilot? 
Or the Exer-Mower that I invented? Simply ahead of their time. 
Yeah, like the alleged Guard-Dawg. You're gonna get him upset. 
Hey, Cade! Cade! 
This thing still work? 
- No! 
- Yes. 
Page 6/70
Yes, and still groundbreaking. Go back there and lay on the recliner and just wait for a cold one. 
Dude, stop breaking stuff. 
Final notice, late notice, past due. Come on, come on. 
Bring Daddy the alcohol. Come on. I mean, what is all this crap 
people send you? 
That's a Discman 
and that's an 8-track tape. 
- Music. 
- Never heard of it. 
Look, I fix that, 
it's 100 bucks. I fix that, it's $250. If I would have been able to fix that before you broke it even more, it would have been 20 bucks. 
This stuff is what's 
gonna put you through college, as long as you land 
one of those scholarships. 
What's the estimated time of arrival, usually? Average? 
Wait. So it just brings 
the beer near you? 
That's the trick? 
- It's got a couple kinks, man. - Yeah. 
Dad, you think maybe some things should never be invented? 
No, I don't. That's backwards thinking. This is a temple of technology. You guys are standing in a holy place. What do you think? 
Why don't you look at all of this? This could be yours. 
What about this land? 
Purple People Eater's back 
and she looks hungry. 
Isn't this incredible? 
- I knew you would like it. 
- Hey, you! 
Hey. 
Page 7/70
I own this house! It's not for sale! Six months late on payments, 
Mr. Yeager. 
And I see you stealing power 
at the pole. 
Hey, that's not your concern. 
- Sir, do you wanna see the property? - Sure. 
I'd be more than happy 
to give you a tour. 
I'll show you three other buyers I got buried out back, 
then I'll crack your head open 
like an egg! 
- Whoa! Whoa! 
- Stay back! He's crazy. 
I told you don't come back here 
anymore. 
I will have my brother come back and beat your ass! 
- Don't you start with me. 
- Why don't you do it yourself? 
And I'll bring the police 
when I come, too! 
- My brother ain't no joke! 
- Who, Jerry? 
You bring his big ass up here, 
he's gonna be huffing and puffing before he can squeeze out of that car! You back out on my grass, 
you're gonna be in big trouble! 
You tell Jerry to come see me. 
I'll give him some pecan pie. 
Hey! 
She smashed through the fence? 
Cade, relax. 
You're going to have an aortic infarction. What is that? 
I think it's a brain heart attack. Yeah, I've had one already. 
So we're stealing power now? 
No, we're borrowing it 
from the neighbors. 
Great. That's awesome. 
Page 8/70
Once I graduate and I'm gone, 
who's gonna take care of you? 
You take care of me? 
Who taught you how to solder a circuit? Or write a program? 
Or French braid your hair? 
Or throw a spiral? Me. That's what I do. Who taught you how to cook 
without ketchup, 
or balance your checkbook? 
Who always has to be the grownup around here? 
All right, you got a point, okay? But that means we're a great team. And I know it's been sucky 
around here lately. 
But we're gonna be fine, sweetie. You just gotta keep believing, okay? I mean, that's what great inventors do. I promise you, one day, 
I'm gonna build something that matters. I believe you, Dad. 
You know, your mom 
would be very proud of you. 
It's going to be okay. 
Spread out! Push right! 
Roll, roll, roll, roll. 
Give me two. Give me two. 
Take the beach, nice and easy. 
All right, hold what you got. 
Release the mini-drones. 
Vipers. 
Eagle in sight. Cleared hot. 
Got a heat sig. Second stack. 
Closest to the bow. 
Predator 0-1. 
Captured target area. 
Set charges. 
Leader, leader, this is Gunfighter 0-1. Eagles moving internal. Second deck. Frogman 83, Frogman 83. 
Breached site on rooftop. 
- Breached site on rooftop. 
- Have Echo Platoon on standby. Page 9/70
Let the helo know 
we're moving external! 
Alpha, take port. 
Bravo, take starboard. 
Shift right. Shift right. 
Cracking steel! 
No! 
Hit him, hit him, hit him! 
Fire. 
Missiles out. Danger close. 
He's running! Move! 
He's on the run! 
He's on the run! 
No! Please! 
Hold your fire. 
Hold! Hold fire! 
Can you not see? I've been injured. Box him in. Box him in. 
Medical Officer Ratchet! I'm a friend! I'm an Autobot! 
Then why are you running? 
Optimus sent this distress message. Calling all Autobots. 
We are under targeted attack. 
Cease all contact with humans. We're all hiding. 
All Autobots are being hunted. We're all in danger. 
I lost a sister in Chicago. 
You'll get no sympathy from me. What's wrong with you humans? 
No! Please. 
Check fire, check fire! 
He's mine now. 
Lockdown. 
Autobots, Decepticons. 
Like little children, always fighting. Making a mess out of the universe. Then I've got to clean it up. 
There is one way you survive. 
Tell me where he's hiding. 
Where is Optimus Prime? 
Never. 
Never is here. 
Page 10/70
I must say, it is remarkable, 
really astounding, 
the success that the CIA has had since you have taken 
operational control, 
and so the President 
has asked me to ask you 
to ask him, 
to invite you both 
over to the White House 
just to powwow, 
where we get maybe 
some more specifics about how 
exactly you're hunting 
the enemy Decepticons left. 
I've had my desk for two years. 
Mr. Attinger has been here for 25. He runs the projects 
where I don't ask for specifics. That's why they're called Black Ops. And why we all sleep better at night. Check. That is great. So, um... 
Any dirt on that? 
How, that's going? 
Outstanding. 
Great. Great. 
I was hoping to hear that. 
The President will be pleased. 
'Cause, I'll tell you right now, I've only been Chief of Staff since Monday, um, but I do know that 
the alien war stuff, these are... These are the only fun meetings. Look, I'm not here 
to entertain the President, 
but you may tell him 
that the war will be over. 
Soon. 
"...be over..." In case he asks, I just like to have an exact quote. "War will be over soon." 
That is great. Such good news. 
And, um, the President would, 
I know, just love... 
Page 11/70
Really, really love to press the flesh... Not flesh, obviously, 
but just maybe get a shot with, um... Is it Lord Prime? Sir Prime? 
We could bop on Air Force One. 
It'd be just a quick bop, 
then we just bop in and bop back. I wouldn't get his hopes up 
on that one. 
Okay. 
He's called Optimus Prime. 
Alien combatant. Here illegally. But aren't they our friends? Why? Because our world 
will never truly be safe 
till all of them are gone. 
Well, I would hope we could do 
a much more ceremonial farewell. Especially since our military 
has worked so closely with them. - Until you. 
- It's not their planet. 
Never was. 
Time we take it back. 
All right, come on. Come on. 
Yes. Yes. 
Yes. 
There you go. 
No, hold it. 
Stop shaking! Why are you shaking? You have the job! 
You forgot to eat dinner! 
You see why I worry? 
Look, sorry, sweetie, I... 
I almost got it working right. 
So, listen, I'm done with homework and set with finals, 
so I was just gonna take a little drive with some friends 
if that was okay with you. 
No boys, I know. Graduate first. Exactly. 
You do know 
no one else has this rule, right? Page 12/70
Rule? Don't make it sound harsh, okay. It's wisdom. 
I don't think we need to be 
driving around in the middle of the night. It's already like quarter to eight. It's almost dark. 
Spud, will you stop it? 
You know where I was 
for my graduation? 
Yes. With me, the mistake. 
The surprise, Tess. 
And the best thing that ever happened. Do we look unhappy? 
No. It's the greatest day of my life. I made your mother a promise 
before she passed. 
Our baby's gonna be at her graduation. That's it. 
High school boys know nothing. 
It's only later they turn into men. So if you were older and wiser, 
I wouldn't exist. 
That's not what I meant. 
You know, this is 
a non-dating household, okay? 
You don't date, I don't date. That's it. Well, maybe you should. 
Tessa, wait. 
Tessa? 
Look. 
I know I've been on you, okay? 
But I have to be. 
Twelve to seventeen 
is the official teenage danger window. It's my job to get you through it. So you can be pissed off all you want. And, yes, you can take a ride 
with your friends. 
Okay. 
Don't work all night. 
And eat. 
Best thing that ever happened, Emily. She's the best thing that ever happened. You'd be proud. 
Page 13/70
No. 
Unbelievable. 
Unbelievable. God! 
Something in here needs to 
make this family some money. 
Come on, you old wreck. 
Judgment Day. 
Where is he? 
I don't know. 
Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Asshole. 
I am dialing 911. 
Tess, I'm basically your uncle. Su casa es mi casa. 
And we're going to lose the casa. Dad! 
Coming! 
Are you working with lasers? 
If so, I'm not coming in. 
You guys have never seen 
a truck like this before. 
Get in here. Lock that door. 
It doesn't have a lock. 
Look! Look at the hole in the radiator. Look at the size of it. 
Something blew a hole in it! 
Yeah, so? 
It's not normal steel. 
The shrapnel in the engine, 
it ripped all the connections apart. And watch. 
And this took some Cade genius. You are gonna love this. 
When I hook this back 
to a working battery... 
Calling all... 
Calling all Autobots. 
Yeah. 
I don't think it's a truck at all. I think we just found a Transformer. Tran... 
- Evacuate! 
- Wait! Guys! 
Dad, are you out of your mind? Page 14/70
You need to get that thing out of here. You don't have to worry. I've been in there working all night. I'm fine. You know what? 
That's not a truck, okay? You're right. It's an alien killing machine. - Dude. It's DOA. 
- Jesus. 
It's been recalled, totaled, done. So, listen, 
there's a number that you call. You're supposed to call the government. It's the American thing to do. - Here we go. 
- You're supposed to call, 
and if it ends up being alien, then you win $25,000. 
You don't win money. 
And if you can capture it live... Like tag it like a wild wildebeest, then you get $100,000. 
- Dad, we're making the call. 
- I heard that. 
I've seen the commercial. They don't say that. That's not a guarantee. You think Greg would lie to me? Look, if that's a Transformer there from the Battle of Chicago, 
I need to know how it works. 
I'm an inventor. 
This could be a game changer for me! If I can apply that technology to my inventions, 
we'd never have to 
worry about money again. 
I've heard that before. 
Twenty-five grand! 
It pays for my college. 
It pays for the house. 
Besides, you used my money 
to buy the truck, right? 
So technically, that's my truck. Don't you think? 
You also signed a contract 
Page 15/70
regarding all research lab I.P. Research lab? It's a barn, dude. You signed it and now you're competing. Any idea of yours is mine. 
Any thought you have, I own it, so basically, I own you. 
I don't think you can own someone. That was, like, a while ago, 
even in Texas. 
All right. Bring the torch over and help me with the pulley arm. I think the shrapnel 
took out its power core. 
And, Tessa, you see this? 
Would an alien killing machine let me do that? 
Look, I'll make the call. 
We'll get the money. 
Just first let me see if I'm right. You want to hide in the house? Go ahead. 
Okay. 
Let's go. Pulley arm. 
I can't believe him! 
What is that? Looks like a missile. It is! Whoa! 
Dad! 
There's a missile in the family room! Holy... 
I'll kill you! 
No! No! 
Dad, there's a missile in... 
I'll kill you! Stay back! 
- No. Don't shoot. Don't shoot! - Call 911! Run! 
- Lucas! 
- Stop! 
Lucas? Don't move, just calm down. Easy, human. 
Stay there. He's not going to hurt us. Weapons systems damaged. 
A missile hit your engine. 
And we took it out of you. 
You're hurt really bad. 
Page 16/70
I'm just trying to help you. 
You're in my home now. 
I'm an engineer. 
My name is Cade Yeager. 
Cade, I am in your debt. 
My name is Optimus Prime. 
My Autobots. 
They're in danger. 
I need to go. I need to go now. How far you think you're gonna get? Tessa, come here. He needs our help. What happened to you? 
An ambush. A trap. Set by humans. I escaped and took this form. 
But you're on our side. 
Why would humans hurt you? 
They were not alone. 
- My Autobots can repair me. 
- Yeah. 
If you can reach 'em. 
What about me? 
I warn you, Mr. Attinger of Earth, an alliance is a contract, and contracts, like humans, 
expire. 
On this planet, we have a saying. "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." I also have a saying. 
"I don't care." 
So what happened in Mexico City? I thought you had him. 
Three direct hits. A mortal wound. Then your men allowed him to escape. You promised me human intelligence. Or is there such a thing? 
You know, you've still never told me. Why do you want him? 
Who are you working for? 
Every galaxy I've traveled, 
all you species are the same. 
You all think 
you're the center of the universe. You have no idea. 
Go to the hardware store 
Page 17/70
and you get the list. 
The whole list. 
What, you're going to try and fix him? He's not a model train set, Cade. No, that's right. He's important. Yeah, but important to who? 
You can't keep an alien 
locked up in your barn. 
What are you gonna do, play with him? - Will you calm down? 
- I'm trying to, 
but I just got hit in the head with a ten-foot cannon! 
If he eats you, I get the GTO. Not a word to anybody. 
Do you hear me? 
Not a single word. 
Nobody. 
I think we have a lock 
on a high-value target. 
Special Operations group is ready. What do you got? 
Sir, Special Ops just got a call from Paris, Texas. 
Hard match on the truck 
seen leaving Mexico City. 
Son of a bitch. Let's go get him. Took a hell of a hit, you know. The missile just missed 
your power source. 
We call it a Spark. 
It contains our life force 
and our memories. 
Yeah, we call it a soul. 
Scramble Cemetery Wind. 
Thank you for your efforts, 
ladies and gentlemen. 
This room is going dark. 
The exit is on your left. 
- I'll take it from here. 
- Okay, let's go. 
I'm with Cemetery Wind. 
We're on the move. 
Repeat, on the move. 
Page 18/70
Cade. 
Why are you willing to help me? I guess maybe because you trust me to. I'm back! 
Took you long enough! 
My head hurts. I had to go to the doctor. I got a welt on my head 
that makes me look 
like a fricking Star Trek character. Whatever. 
Look! Look! 
We're on property. 
Viper 15 overhead. Angels 1. 
Dad! 
Mr. Yeager, my name's James Savoy. I'm a federal agent. 
My men and I are trying to track down an abandoned truck. 
It's a nice spread you got here. Too bad she's for sale. 
Well, thanks. She's not. 
That the truck you mean? 
Afraid not. 
You know, Mr. Yeager, 
we received a call from someone concerned about this truck. 
No. 
That wasn't you? 
Only thing I'm concerned about 
is you being on my property 
without permission. 
You know, we got a rule about people messing with people from Texas. And I don't know what truck 
you're talking about. 
The kind that cost American lives. Search the property! 
What do you mean, 
"Search the property"? 
You don't have a warrant. 
My face is my warrant. 
Wait. But if you guys do find a truck, we get a reward, right? 
Viper 15 holding, point alpha. 
Page 19/70
Charlie team, hold tight. 
Lock it down. 
- Open, open, open. 
- Short wall. Short wall. 
Five in. Five in. 
Intruder alert! 
Back away from the premises. 
- What the hell is that? 
- Just some dumb inventor. 
Clear. 
Clear. 
Clear right. 
Clear. 
360. 720. Heads on a swivel. 
Let's go. There's nothing here. There's no signs. We got nothing. Sir, we have a live armed missile in the trash. 
Live? I carried that to the trash! You told me that was a dud, dude. I could be dead. Right? 
Look. 
Okay, yes, I found a truck, all right. I towed it back for the parts. 
I left it here last night. 
This morning, it's gone. 
When? Where? I don't know. 
I swear to God. 
That's as much as I know about him. "Him." 
He said, "Him." 
He knows who the son of a bitch is. - Mr. Yeager. 
- What? 
Excuse me. 
You just said, "Him." 
- Take them down. 
- What? 
Let me go! 
They don't know about the truck! I know! Just let her go. 
What kind of a man 
betrays his flesh-and-blood 
brethren for alien metal? 
Page 20/70
- Get this guy out of my sight. - Get off! 
Let her go! 
They don't know about the truck. All right! Load up! Search the perimeter! Lucas, you called, didn't you? 
No! 
I don't know any of these scary guys. God! You're manhandling a woman! I'll kick your ass! 
Let her go! 
- Daddy! Let me go! 
- You're not going anywhere. 
- Daddy! "" 
No! You're not taking me anywhere! I'm an American! 
- Easy, sweetheart. 
- Okay, okay, okay. 
All right. Okay. All right. I was wrong. Savoy. Use the girl. 
My God! 
Now, you got ten seconds. 
Where's the truck? 
- You're gonna shoot my little girl? - If I have to. 
Please don't shoot me! Please! 
Look, I don't know. I told you 
everything that I know! He's gone. He left. 
He was in the barn, I swear to God! - Just let her go!- 
Please, please. 
He was in there! Let her go! 
Seven seconds. 
I'm telling you the truth! 
He was in there! 
Dad! 
Tell him to get away 
from my little girl now! 
Dad! 
You touch her and I'll kill you! You got two seconds. 
I need the truth. 
- Please. 
Page 21/70
- Shoot her. 
Here I am! 
Get down! 
Cade! 
They're going to kill you! Get out of here! Push right! Headed to the house! 
Come on. Hurry up! Get in the car! - Let's go! 
- Daddy, get in the car! 
Perimeter, Optimus moving your way! What's happening, baby? 
Who are they? 
It's the truck. They want the truck! "Who are they"? Who are you, 
and who are you calling "baby"? 
I know you heard me. 
- I'm her boyfriend! 
- He's my boyfriend! 
What? You're not her boyfriend! 
His name's Shane and he drives, Dad. What kind of cars are those? 
They're so scary! 
There's another one 
coming up the back! 
You gotta try to lose them 
in the cornfield! 
He's coming up behind us! Go! 
Viper 15, 
running on fumes. RTB. 
They've got us cornered! 
Watch out, 
watch out, watch out! 
Mr. Yeager, this is not 
how I wanted us to meet, okay? 
I'm Shane, and I'm a completely... And I am not talking to you! 
Drive the car! 
Watch out! Watch out! 
Throw 'em some warning shots! 
Man, I don't know how 
I'm driving this good. 
It's like, today 
I've gone to a whole other level. Road, focus! Stop talking! 
Page 22/70
Shane, look out! 
This may be primarily my fault, okay. They said 
they were gonna bring a check! 
I didn't know they were gonna send a death squad! 
Hang on! 
Hey, we got ourselves a winner! Don's got it over here. 
Look out! 
We lost them! 
Good job, stranger from the cornfields! The scary cars are back. 
Lose them at the factory, Shane! I thought you knew 
how to drive this thing! Go! 
I don't think we're gonna get that money. Doesn't seem like it. 
Cade! 
Take 'em upstairs! 
We're losing them on the fifth floor. - Do that thing, Shane! 
- You know it. 
What do you mean? What thing? 
What we're about to do 
is gonna be kind of scary. 
Take out your guns and shoot them! They're shooting at us! 
- Tessa, grab my stick! Grab my stick! - What? 
She's got 
the best hands in the business. Ready, Tess? Pull! 
- No! No! No! 
- No f-ing way! 
Yeah! 
Yeah! 
Tessa, you are so grounded! 
Shit! The rim's cracked. 
Optimus. Come on, move! Move! 
My foot's stuck! Wait, Cade! 
- Lucas! 
- Wait! Wait! 
Lucas! Lucas, above you! 
Page 23/70
Run! 
Come on, get in, let's go! 
I'll bet you wish 
you could see my face right now. Lucas, we just left him? 
He's gone. 
My deepest sympathies 
for the loss of your friend. 
Stay here till I'm sure 
we weren't followed. 
We are all targets now. 
So we're hiding out now? 
That's the plan? 
We're taking orders from a truck? Well, you got a better idea? 
Hey, move away from her, kid. Don't... Keep your hands off her. All right? No. You got your ass kicked 
by a garage inventor from Texas. That goes on your resume. 
Yeah, it goes on all of yours, too! Do I look like I'm in the mood 
for any of your shit today? 
Washington thinks 
we were chasing a Decepticon target, but our story falls apart 
if we don't find this Yeager family first. Yeah, well, what if he goes 
to the cops or the FBI? 
They know to hand him over. 
His world as he knows it is gone. Well, bright side, you guys met. Where is he from? 
I told you, he's a driver from Texas. Texas? 
Where, Dublin, Texas? 
Shamrock, Texas? 
So why does he sound 
like a leprechaun? 
You'd get your ass kicked in Ireland for saying that. 
Well, we're not in Ireland, 
Lucky Charms. We're in Texas. 
And so he drives? 
Page 24/70
What do you mean, he drives? 
Like, for a living? 
Yeah. At least he makes a living. Thank you. 
Look, I race rally cars. 
One driver. 
One navigator. Her. 
By the way, I'm totally legit. 
I just got picked up by Red Bull. And just so you know, 
my life savings 
was in that car back there. 
- This is not happening. 
- It definitely is. 
How old are you? 
Twenty. 
She's a 17-year-old girl. 
So we can work this two ways. 
One, I punch you right in the mouth and you call the police on me. 
Dad. Or two, 
I just call the cops on you 
because this is illegal. She's a minor. We're protected by 
the Romeo and Juliet laws. 
We dated for a little while. 
I was a sophomore, 
and he was a senior. It's fine. 
No, it's not fine. 
We've got a preexisting 
juvenile foundational relationship. - Statute 22.011. 
- What? 
Texas statute? 
- That a real law? 
- Yep. 
Romeo and Juliet? 
- You know how those two ended up? - In love. 
Dead. Do your parents know about this? Is your dad okay with you 
dating a 17-year-old girl? 
He took off when I was five, 
but if I ever bump into him, I'll ask him. Page 25/70
You know, Tessa, 
- I trusted you. 
- To what? 
Never have fun, take a risk, 
be a normal teenager, like you? I am your father, okay? 
And I have been busting my ass to take care of you. 
Is that what you were doing 
when you brought home the truck? All you had to do was report it, and now Lucas is dead. 
And my life is over. Thank you. You've taken real good care of me. Please don't shoot me! 
Please! Dad! 
They were willing to kill her. Then they still are. 
Somebody somewhere gave 
that order. 
I'm going to find some fingerprints. Please! 
No! 
I'm an Autobot! I'm an Autobot! Grab whatever you think 
we can use for supplies. 
Clothes, anything. 
And take that computer. 
Let's go. 
This is not easy. 
You know, 
you don't suck at everything, Dad. What the... 
I knew it. 
You told me he was no one. 
Well, 
this "no one" has our tech. 
"OPTIMUS ON RADIO". 
Calling all Autobots. 
Calling all Autobots. 
- Whoa! My God! 
- My God! 
That was insane! 
It was awesome, 
Page 26/70
but it was insane, right? 
Yeah! Hell, yeah! 
He's back! He's alive! 
Optimus is here! 
At last. There is hope after all. Yeah. 
Mr. Leader of the Free Galaxy is back. I knew you'd make it. I never doubted. We got your warning. 
We've been waiting. 
Hell, yeah. Boom time. 
We got the gang back together. 
Humans have asked us 
to play by their rules. 
Well, the rules have just changed. Human beings, 
bunch of backstabbin' weasels. 
Hound, find your inner compass. Loyalty is but a flower 
in the winds of fear and temptation. What the hell are you saying? 
- It's a haiku. 
- Cut the crap, 
before I drop a grenade 
down your throat. 
Try it, you'll be dead. 
Please pull it. Please do it. 
You know what, 
it'll save us so much time. 
Well, raise your hand 
if you're thoroughly disenchanted with our little pleasant Earth vacation. So, who's the stowaways? 
Whoa, hey, what's with the gun? Stop. Hound, both of you. 
They've risked their lives for mine. We owe them. 
So, there's been no sign of any others? - Nada. 
- We are all that's left. 
They're picking us off, 
one by one. 
We're the pathetic, dirty foursome. And you make five. 
Page 27/70
So that's our best-case scenario? Autobot witness protection? 
Hey, Speed Racer, 
you're welcome to leave anytime. Well, for the record, Superdad, I'm not hiding with you. 
I'm hiding outwith that big guy. Sensei, with your fate unknown, Bumblebee has held command, 
despite his complete 
and total lack of anything 
resembling warrior discipline. He's like a child. 
This child is about to kick your ass. He brings us shame. 
Cage fight. 
Smartass. 
What's the matter with them? 
Am I the lone sage who sees through this puppy-dog eyes act? 
It's beneath you. 
Yes, I've been waiting 
for them all to dispatch each other, so I could take charge 
with no trouble at all. 
Just me reporting to me. 
Well, it sure looks like 
you've been missed. 
Autobots, Lockdown is hunting us and humans are helping. 
We need to know why. 
Well, listen, I don't know why, but I have an idea about who. 
This drone I stole recorded footage of an Autobot raid. 
It's in pieces, 
but watch what happens here. 
That's Leadfoot. 
They rip him apart. 
Savages. 
And later, this truck 
comes to haul him off. 
KSI. Kinetic Solutions. 
Defense, aerospace, 
Page 28/70
government contracts. 
They designed this drone. 
So these government guys 
just hunt you down, 
and then pass you off to this KSI? The company is headquartered 
in Chicago. 
That could be where they were taken. No way to get inside without a battle. Well, what if you had 
some human help? 
- What, are you two partners now? - Sweetie, we're targets now, too. We need to know why 
or we'll never get our lives back. Autobots, 
I have sworn to never kill humans. Big mistake. 
But when I find out who's behind this, he's going to die. 
Hooah! 
There's a full-on 
manhunt out for us, 
so we have some new rules. 
Anyone who has got a badge 
is not our friend. 
We're gonna divide and conquer. You two in charge of stealing food and the essentials. And nothing else. Chicago KSI headquarters 
is like a fortress. 
I'm gonna find a way 
into their top-secret military wing. Find something to blackmail 
this company and the government. We're gonna get our freedom back. Good morning, Mr. Joyce. 
What was that sound? 
That's "the" sound. 
That you asked for. 
No, I asked for boundless. 
Transcendent. 
When you walk through a door 
in this building, 
Page 29/70
it should sound like 
you've stepped into the future. Present. 
Say it. 
Future. 
The past is history. The present is past. "JOSHUA ON PA". The future is now. Why can't I get in touch with you? Don't you realize 
what the Arctic find means? 
You know that story 
we were all told as children 
about a giant asteroid 
that struck the Earth 
millions of years ago 
and wiped out the dinosaurs? 
- Vaguely. 
- We were wrong. 
This metal caused the great extinction. How and why, I can't yet say. 
But carbon dating puts it 
at 65 million years B.C. 
This ore you've got us digging for is a lot more dangerous than you think. And my people... 
Darcy, I think that you've been out in the field for far too long. Why don't we discuss dinosaurs 
over dinner? 
- Ribs? 
- Not a chance. 
You have no idea 
what's been happening here. 
We're about to make the quantum leap. A rare-earth metal. 
Molecularly unstable. 
Industrial uses, none. 
And then the aliens came. 
And we made the connection. 
It's what they're made of. 
It's the Holy Grail. 
"Transformium." 
That's what we're calling it. 
Focus-grouped. Catchy. 
Page 30/70
- Trademarked. 
- Yeah. 
This is the greatest advance 
in modern physics 
since the splitting of the atom. It's programmable matter. 
And now, we've mapped its genome. - I. 
- Now you've mapped its genome. And now we can begin to give it instructions. 
This is extremely good. 
Watch this. 
We can change anything into anything. Sensual, almost. Don't you think? Do you like music? 
The Pill. 
Perhaps something a little more violent? My God. You've done it. 
In aerospace, the military... 
We will own the entire robotics industry. All exploration. 
The oceans. Space. Everything. 
Wembley. What is this? 
The jellyfish commercial 
that you wanted. 
You said they were erotic yet deadly, like women. 
I never said that. 
- Yes, you did. 
- No, I didn't. 
I definitely heard you say it 
'cause you were talking 
about your ex-girlfriend, 
who was sexy, but a bitch. 
Please don't eat on the tour. 
Is that her? 
Hey, I found a whole bunch 
of boxes of clothes. 
So, sweetie, you can get some 
long pants, nice, loose-fitting ones, and lose the short shorts, okay? What'd you guys get? 
It's protein. 
Page 31/70
Look, I said the essentials, okay? It wasn't easy. We almost got caught. You stole mouthwash? 
I like to be fresh 
when I'm making out with your daughter. That's funny. 
Yeah, that's not happening ever. Ever? 
This is our military prototype, Galvatron. I don't understand it. 
This is the fifth iteration. 
Why does he keep turning out like this? It's just some bugs in the final render. I modeled Galvatron 
after Optimus Prime. 
Why does he keep looking 
like Megatron? 
Rendering sequence 
is almost finished. Stand by. 
Simple coding. 
Algorithms! 
Math! 
Why can't we make 
what we want to make, 
the way we want to make it? 
Why? 
And does that look 
like a consumer-friendly face to you? And what about that 
big hole in the chest? 
I think it's bad-ass. I like it. - Love it 
Well, I hate it. 
Here he is. 
That bald-headed Doc Frankenstein. Ma'am, this is not legal. 
This is illegal experimentation. Aliens would never do this to people! Eat you, kill you, maybe, but that's it. This ain't right! 
Nobody puts baby in a box! 
This is worse than waterboarding! This little gentleman 
has been translating for us 
Page 32/70
all the information 
that comes from these two heads. Their history, their science, everything. - Is that Megatron? 
- Precisely. 
Where did you get all this? 
Special government contract. 
Now we know everything 
about Transformers. 
And now at long last 
we can build them ourselves. 
And we can build them better. 
Yeah, that's good, Bee. That'll get us in. A couple times a day, 
these guys are moving 
in vehicle shipments into KSI 
for something called "scanning." Major security all over. 
So our best shot at getting in 
is a back classified research entrance. I'm gonna drive in with Bee 
tomorrow morning. 
Excuse me. 
There's no smooching 
in front of me, okay? 
You're so square. 
Who even says "smooching"? 
I tell you, no respect. 
It's just impossible sometimes. 
Yeah. I went through that 
with Bumblebee. 
Calm down. Calm down. 
You know, at a time like this, 
the idea is to keep cool, not look cool, so why don't you lose the glasses? About a month ago, 
middle of the night, 
I thought I heard noises in my house. Was that you? 
What? Come on. No way. 
Don't lie to me, kid. 
You see that guy with the gun out there? There's so many guys with guns. 
Let's get out of the car and tell him Page 33/70
we're about to break in 
and it's your idea, 
'cause I don't care. 
I'm old, I've already lived long enough. You have a really bad habit 
of having these conversations 
at the wrong time, man. 
You want to come clean 
or you want me to make a mess? 
Sir, can I talk to you 
for a second, please? 
It was me, it was me, 
it was me, it was me. 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
Taking it in for scanning? 
All right. You're good to go. 
I'm literally gonna kill you. 
Scanning in bay three. 
We took old, alien technology 
and made it better in every way. Introducing Stinger. 
KSI. We make the world. 
That is a bad-ass robot. 
He kind of looks like you, Bee. 
Here is the past. And now the future. They're trying to build 
their own versions. 
Well, at least they're picking cooler cars than this. 
You talk to me like that? 
Bee, stop! 
You see what happens 
from being a wiseass? 
Now get out of here. 
Stinger, inspired by Bumblebee, 
but better in every way. 
Son of a... 
No, no! You gotta calm down. 
- He's crazy! 
- Stop! 
Bumblebee! Bee, stop going psycho! OUR FACTORY DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH TRANSFORMIUM FOR PRODUCTION... 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KEEP 
Page 34/70
YOUR PROMISE TO SUPPLY IT. 
My delicate flower, I can't 
understand you when you're angry. Actually, I don't really understand you at all. 
Our entire factory 
is up and running... 
Excuse me one second. Hey! 
Hey, you two! Grease monkeys. 
What the hell is going on here? What's with this vintage crap? We're not scanning collector car junk. What do you think it is 
that we make here? 
We make poetry. We're poets. 
All right? You work for me, 
you get one mistake. One. Understood? - It won't happen again. 
- It certainly won't. 
So let's get this pathetic thing out of here. 
And you, too. 
So sorry. So sorry. 
Let's move on. 
Watch him. 
I'm going to see what I can find. Quietly get out of here. 
I swear. I swear. 
I can't bear it when you're angry. You know how it upsets me. 
Bee, you gotta calm down right now. I'm perfectly calm, dude. 
You gotta breathe, 
or just do whatever it is that you do. I'm calm. I'm calm. 
I'm not even touching it. 
Okay, I'm barely touching it. 
I'm barely touching it. 
My God. 
Turn back into a car right now! Get out of my face, all right? Our design team 
started with the Bumblebee. 
But really, 
Page 35/70
this alien's design was decrepit and, let's face it, antique. 
What the... 
- Don't take it personally, Bee. - Kind of old and ratty. 
You mean ugly. 
- Hell, no! 
- No! No! 
You think you're better than me! Yee-hah! 
What did you touch? 
I told you, homeboy 
Can't touch this 
My office in 15 minutes. 
This is 
dissection room seven. 
Galvatron, 
render postmortem number 12. 
Continued head disfigurement 
at event number 32. 
So what about the deal? Is it done? Did you get the Seed? 
We get it 
when the bounty hunter gets Prime. Meanwhile, 
there has been a complication. 
A what? 
No, no. 
At KSI, we don't use words like that. A civilian harboring the Autobots has hacked into one of your mini-drones. Meaning, they may know 
of your involvement. 
What? 
That was a little bit intense. 
I need more Transformium, and 
I need it now, to build more prototypes. You tell your alien bounty hunter that I have staked my company 
on this deal. 
And I have merely staked my life. Hey, you came to me on this, 
remember? 
You retire from the CIA, 
Page 36/70
you get a seven-figure piece 
of my company, and you and I 
revolutionize national defense together. But, Attinger, buddy, for both our sakes, you need to deliver 
the Seed. 
I'm in. Can you see my camera? 
They're melting Ratchet. 
They slaughtered Ratchet! 
I'm gonna tear them apart! 
Metal. 
Just metal. 
That's what I always thought of them. Well, they're not. 
They're living things, 
with souls like ours. 
Once, I spoke to one. 
And you're working with Transformium? Yeah, that's what I do. I am. 
I'm out there digging for it. 
There's just not much left to find. So that's how badly 
you boys need more? 
Reduced to melting 
evil old Decepticons down. 
No. That's an Autobot there. 
The ones who fought for us. 
- I've got this taken care of from here. - Right. 
Same badge code scanned 
at two separate gates. 
I'm having the classified area 
locked down now. 
Check that guy. 
Hey! 
Stop right there! 
Stop! 
Freeze! 
Up against the wall. 
All right. 
Corporate espionage. 
That's a very serious crime, Mr. Yeager. Wow. 
Look, I want a lawyer. 
Page 37/70
The Justice Department. 
Somebody I can trust. 
I'm just trying to protect my family, okay? 
Not from your company, 
from the government. 
Mr. Yeager, 
who do you think I work for? 
You're trying to protect your family, that's admirable. 
I'm trying to defend the nation from alien war. 
We've had a taste 
of what that looks like, 
and we are not gonna tolerate another. Now... 
There is a version of this conversation where you get to go back to your barn, your daughter 
gets to graduate with honors, 
and life as you know it will go on. You have no idea 
what you're involved with here. Really? 
What's the other version 
of this conversation? 
The one when you send in 
the hired help to murder my little girl? Or you gonna man up 
and do it yourself? 
What's your preference? 
I'm going to ask you this once. Where is Optimus Prime? 
Come on. 
Let's get out of here. 
We're moving. Basement. 
They're here. 
Get out! All of you! 
Science fair's over, meatbags! 
- Destroy the lab! 
- Move, move, move, move! 
Look out! Look out! 
Destroy it all! 
- Danger! Security breach! 
Page 38/70
- Danger... 
Guys! It's me! 
Break me out of this Frankenstein box! Hey! 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Stop! 
That's company property! 
They're not your property! 
They were my friends. 
You ain't talking so much now! 
You got Hound in front of you? 
Go ahead. 
Show us your true colors, 
once and for all. 
Just give me the word, I'll splatter him. Why don't you tell Itchy Fingers here that this is all the spoils of war. Dead metal. 
Innovation. What we do here is science. Because if we don't do it, 
somebody else will. 
Because you cannot stop technology! We're not your technology! 
Let me vaporize his ass. 
I broke the code. 
I own your whole genome. 
The world will know 
what you're doing here. 
The world? The world will approve. We can make you now. 
Don't you get it? 
We don't need you anymore. 
That was cruel. 
Autobots, 
we're done. 
We're done? 
We're not gonna kick a little bit of ass? I've been itching 
to kill something lately. 
This is our chance. 
We have to stop him. 
You have to stop him. 
It's never been tested in the field. Page 39/70
Labs, military bases, 
but not on civilian streets. 
Down there 
a Defense Department contract 
was just attacked in a terrorist attack. This is now a CIA military op. 
You're indemnified. Respond! 
Let's go. 
KSI Chicago, closest live sat, patch it in. Been an unprovoked Autobot attack. Bring up Galvatron. 
Transforming Galvatron. 
Galvatron coming online. 
Bring up Stinger. 
Stinger coming online. 
Let's show these alien terrorists what an upgrade looks like. 
Galvatron and Stinger are moving 
to intercept targets. 
Reapers. 
Five targets in the open. Good picture. Two miles to intercept. 
200 meters. 
Engage-. 
Transform. 
Whoa. 
We are programming this, right? 
Yes. Mostly. 
Systems seem to have malfunctioned. Targeting five bogeys. 
Engaging rockets. 
Missiles away. 
Gotta haul ass, Bee! Come on! 
Stinger is in pursuit. 
Misfire, misfire! Misfire, misfire! System failure. 
Galvatron just fired four rockets. Whoa! They're shooting at us! 
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
- Watch out! What are you doing? 
Argh! 
What was that? 
We need a full medical team now. 
Possible civilian casualties. 
Page 40/70
I mean, you got a lot of people in the crossfire here. I don't like... You're making history here. 
For your country, for the world. Human freedom is at stake. 
Innocent people die all the time. Come on, Optimus! 
Tessa! 
Make him fight. Don't let him go down. Make him fight! 
Come on, come on. 
Come on, come on. 
Tessa! 
Tessa! 
Tessa, run to the field! 
You have no soul! 
That is why I have no fear! 
You die! 
Help me! 
What is that? 
That's my asset. Pull Galvatron back. Do it. 
I got to go get her. 
Tessa! 
Don't go out there! He'll kill you! - She needs my help! 
- She's hidden! 
Optimus! Optimus, get up, get up! I can't. Get out of here. 
I feel sorry for you, Prime. 
Your allegiance to these humans. The trouble with loyalty to a cause is that the cause will always betray you. Who sent you here? 
Where do you think you came from? You think you were born? 
No. You were built. 
And your creators want you back. We all work for someone. 
No, no. 
No. 
It's got her! 
- She's in the car! 
- Tessa! 
Page 41/70
- No! 
- Tessa! 
Dad! 
Tessa, get out! 
Get out! 
Tessa! 
Get out! Tessa! 
Dad, help me! 
- Tessa! 
- Help me, help me! Dad! Dad! 
Dad! 
- Dad! 
- Tessa! Break the glass! 
- Break the glass to get out! 
- I'm trying! 
- Tessa, I can't hold on! 
- Dad! 
Tessa! 
- Help me! 
- Just break it! Break the glass! Tess... 
Cade, warn the Autobots! 
Dad, help me! Don't leave me! 
No! 
Take that human to the trash. 
Mr. Secretary. 
My team is on the way. 
This is a CIA operation. 
This is my asset. 
Tell the military to stand down. Hang on, I have the White House. Agent, hello! 
My goodness. 
Boy, is it a flurry of excitement over here at the White House. 
Everybody is super, super mad. At me. So, I went over my notes 
from our last meeting, 
and I'm not sure 
when you said anything about 
a "giant alien warship 
over Michigan Avenue." 
Tell the President this is not an attack. Remember this ship, Prime? 
Page 42/70
Built for all you Knights, 
you great crusaders, 
to explore the universe. 
Well, I commandeered it. 
It's my personal prison now. 
Optimus? 
Welcome back 
to the Knights' Temenos, Prime. 
You have disgraced it. 
Join your fellow rebels, fugitive scum. It's for the rarest of specimens. The worst of the worst. 
It's taken centuries, 
but I've collected all the Knights but you. The creators want to sweep 
their chessboard clean. 
I'm slave to no one. 
All this species mixing with species. It upsets the cosmic balance. 
The creators, they don't like it. They built you to do what you were told. Why hasn't it taken off yet? 
Come on, Bee, it's descending. 
You got to get on it! 
Savoy, mission accomplished. 
Lockdown has Prime. 
The deal's going down now. 
Picking up the Seed at the recon point. Nest, Talon. 
L.Z. appears clear. 
Much as I've enjoyed the hunt, 
I won't miss your wretched planet. Our deal is done. 
One Prime for one Seed. 
Handle it with care. 
I trust your species is ready. 
Don't worry about our species. 
Farewell, Earth. 
Come on, come on! 
Bee, come on! 
It's a bad idea. 
But I'm all about bad ideas. 
Let's go! 
Well, let's rock. 
Page 43/70
This is crazy. 
Look, you wanna cut and run, 
you better do it now. 
I'm gonna die trying. 
Hey, I'm not here to help you 
get your daughter. 
You're here to help me get my girlfriend. Engage dark-matter drives. Full power. We're behind enemy lines now. 
Lockdown's ship has booby traps. 
Eyes open. 
Beware of his bone grinders, 
brain blinders, flesh peelers, 
chromosomal inverters, 
catatonic sludge, black hole trapdoors, and, of course, radiation. 
We must be quick. 
We have the element of surprise. 
Let's try to use violence as a last resort. Get it! 
I kill you! Kill you! 
I hate those things. 
- That's freaky. 
- He's not alive anymore. 
Well, we looked. 
They're not here. Let's go. 
What? Hey, I'm not going 
anywhere without Tessa. 
I'm unclear. What's in it for me? What's in it for you? 
Easy. Let's use words. 
What's in it for you is I don't kill you. We're getting the boss back. 
And the girl. Copy? 
Okay, okay. 
Very persuasive. Textbook machismo. Well, then. 
We'll need to sabotage something. Better hurry. Because dark-matter drives are preparing to take off. - Wonderful. 
- I give us 10 minutes. 
Is that what that sound is? 
The engines filling up? 
Page 44/70
Are you telling me 
that thing's gonna be... 
This is gonna be flying out of here in 10 minutes? 
Ten minutes? 
Could be nine. Worst case, seven. - Humans, search the cell blocks. - We're wasting time, let's go. - We'll find the center core. 
- Let's move. 
We're gonna stop this nightmare ship. We're never gonna find her 
in this huge ship. 
Like a needle in a haystack. 
Tessa! 
Great. Great. 
That was smooth. 
No, that was really smooth, 
letting everybody know we're here. Now they're gonna be looking for us. Better hurry, Crosshairs, 
before we go into space! 
Here's the little jujube right here. Hello, Mama. 
Who fired the anchors? 
Who's on my ship? 
We have a loose prisoner. 
Hurry up. We got like six minutes. We'll find her. 
Hold up. 
Back up. 
Come on, these things 
are gonna find us. Hurry, hide. Whoa! 
Weapons! 
Come here. Help me. Hurry, hurry. Help me up. 
There are some weird sounds out there. - What is that? 
- I don't know. 
You ready? 
Run. 
All right, we're not going down without a fight. 
Page 45/70
They turn that corner, 
and we're gonna take them. 
You ready 
or you gonna bitch out on me? 
No, I got your back. 
- Are you ready? 
- Absolutely. 
Don't bitch out on me. 
Are you ready? 
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
Whoa, okay! I surrender! 
I surrender! I surrender! 
I'm so sorry! I'm so, so, so sorry! What'd you do? How'd you do that? I have no idea! 
You no-good, chickenshit little rat! Look at that. You see that? 
Whoa! 
You stay here, Lucky Charms! 
Man. I am so gonna patent this shit. Ew! 
Tess! 
Dad! Help me! 
Hey! 
- Tess? 
- Tess! 
Come on, move, move! 
Tessa! 
Shane, I love you! I love you! You saved me! You saved me! 
I know. I know. 
Thank you. Thank you so much. 
- Thank you. You saved me. 
- Yeah, he saved you. Yeah. 
Yeah. 
I think you and Mr. "I Surrender" have a lot to catch up about, sweetie. He saved me, too. 
You should have seen him in there. I mean, our hero. Let's go. Now. - Eyes open. 
- I almost got it. 
Big boy coming through! 
Move, move, move. 
Page 46/70
Whoa! 
This has got to be 
the Supermax. Watch the corners. There's a lot of cages. 
Yeah. 
Creepy critters in here. 
I don't want to know 
what's in the big cage. 
- What's this? 
- Hound, don't do it. 
Aw, you don't look 
very dangerous in there. 
That's festering ugliness. 
I'm hit! I'm down! It's melting! It burns! 
I think it's acid! 
Nuts. It's just shizzle. 
I hope that's not contagious. 
I got to hurt you now. 
You're just too disturbing to live. Take that, bitch! 
You're dead. 
- Hound! 
- He's alive! 
Hold on, boss, we're coming! 
- Optimus, sound off! 
- In here, quick! 
Hang on, we're coming for you! 
The arms of this Knight Ship detach! We can break free! It's a separate ship! Hurry! 
Where's the cockpit? Right or left? - Right! 
- I'm on it, boss. 
Hurry. We have no time. 
Sensei. 
Let's rock! I always wanted 
to fly one of these things. 
I'm there, boss! 
Hey, Yeager Technologies, 
you gonna invent us 
a way out of this one? 
Whoa. My God. 
I am not doing this. 
Page 47/70
- I am not doing that. 
- Yes, we are. 
No, it's good. It's stable. Come on. No way. 
Sweetie, you know why I'm here? I'm here to protect you. 
You've done great at that. 
I want you to trust me right now. We're getting down. Let's go. 
Don't look down, okay? Step. 
See, it's easy. Come on. 
Careful, these cables 
are starting to get thinner here! - Step. Step. There. 
- My God! 
See, don't look down! 
All right? Don't look down. 
We're gonna be at the building in no time! 
You okay, Tess? 
Keep stepping. 
My God! 
My God, Dad! 
All right, sweetie. 
You need to keep moving here, okay? - Come on! 
- I can't. 
I'm freaking out. 
You need to move now! 
I'm not moving! 
I'm going back to the ship! 
Shit! 
You can't go back to the ship, honey! Watch me! 
You are not 18 years old yet 
and you're gonna do what I say! Now let's go! 
We need to go this way, okay. 
Not that way. 
Talk to her, Romeo! Now! 
Come on, for God's sake. 
Do not start with me. 
My God, what is that? 
All right, Tessa. 
Page 48/70
Don't look back. 
Well, don't say that to me. 
Now I want to turn around. 
It's nothing major, sweetie. 
Well, that means it's totally major! I'm gonna have to point this gun in your direction. 
It's gonna feel like it's in 
your direction, but I'm not. 
- You better hurry. 
- Are you trying to kill me? 
I had to bust my ass 
to get up here on this spaceship! - Shoot it! 
- Get down now! 
Tessa, wait! 
I'm coming for you! Tessa! 
- My God! 
- I'm coming! 
Hold on! 
You're the best, Bee! You are the best. You damn right! And don't ever forget it. You see that? Look at me! 
We're off the ship, right? 
Bumblebee! 
Bumblebee! Friendly! 
Enemy ships are coming in hot. 
Get on! Get on! 
Hold your knickers, I'm punching it! They got three ships on them! 
I'm giving it the juice! 
Come on, Bee, take them out! 
Good move, Bee! 
This one's for you, A-holes! 
If you're gonna do something, 
you better do it! 
Come on! 
I'm sick of this crap. You fly. I shoot. Hey, you better let me fire 
this big-ass gun 
- and make this ship go faster! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Listen up! Crash course. Tracer guns. Punch forward to fire, 
Page 49/70
slide back to reload. 
What? 
Punch, hold, slide, repeat. 
Punch, hold, slide, repeat. 
Wait. What're you talking about? - I don't know what he means. 
- Good luck. 
Where are you going? 
To lay some hate. 
- Say it! 
- Okay. 
Punch, hold, slide, repeat. 
Punch, hold, slide, repeat. 
- 60! 
Yeah, I got one! Whoo! 
These alien guns kick ass! 
Come on, he's on us! 
Bee, you gotta move! Duck! 
Bee, fire the gun! 
BUMBLEBEE'. ! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
That was insane! 
Tess, you okay? 
Okay. Sir? 
You better have insurance! 
Insurance? 
It's a freaking spaceship. 
You go get insurance 
on a freaking spaceship. 
Good luck with that, buddy. 
Is this your car? 
Sweetie, hand me my alien gun. Here you go. 
Come here. 
- Trust your dad. 
- Okay. 
Prepare for interstellar launch. We're almost ready to separate. We're almost there. 
- Hurry, he's launching! 
- All over it, chief. 
Lockdown will be in deep space before he realizes I'm gone. 
Page 50/70
I'm a sucky pilot, but 
let's give it a whirl. 
Hell, yeah! 
You CIA guys are really subtle. What a deft hand. 
I'm sure nobody noticed all that. Look. In a few minutes, there are gonna be feds all over this place, and I don't want them 
finding our Holy Grail. 
So we're gonna take all our R&D, we're moving it to our China facility. Yeah. 
I want you to bring me the Seed, but I want you to bring it to me there. Mr. Joshua, I would not describe your product testing as perfected. We have plenty of time 
for improvements in China. 
Sir, Galvatron. He was... 
A fiasco. 
A farrago. An embarrassment. 
And he spoke. How did that happen? Do you know what a flaw is, Wembley? A flaw? 
A flaw is a total failure. 
I did not have control over my prototype, and I want to know why! 
Let's give Bumblebee the good news. We got a ship now. We're leaving. You humans. After all we have done. You don't know 
what you've wrought upon yourselves. What? What is it now? 
What are you talking about? 
I mean, I'm doing stuff 
out of my league here! 
You don't see who's controlling who. Within that manmade prototype I fought, I sensed the presence 
of Megatron. 
What, the Decepticon that 
started the Chicago war? 
How do you think KSI 
Page 51/70
built those bots in the first place? They had a whole mess of 
dead Decepticon heads 
and they were downloading their minds! And I was in charge of autopsy duty. No union, no benefits, no nothing. They hooked me up to Megatron, and that mind 
wasn't as dead as they thought. He fed them the science and specs! All so they could build him 
a brand-new body. 
Then he infected it 
with his evil, nasty chromosomes. They had red, beady eyes. 
They got all in my lovely locks. I can smell it right now. 
Total inside custom job! 
KSI might have named the body 
the snappy name of Galvatron, 
but that's just Megatron reincarnated! You knew this 
and you didn't warn them? 
Little girl, you can go to a pretty dark place when you on death row. He's been playing KSI all this time, all so that he could manipulate them into going after the Seed. 
Wait. The Seed? 
Those nasty soldiers 
that were chasing us. 
I saw them board the ship, 
and they took something 
that they called the Seed. 
Listen. Sixty million years ago, give or take an eon... 
Thousands of planets 
were cyber-formed with Seeds. 
They turned your organic life 
into our elemental metals. 
Our creators destroyed your world to make us. 
And that's what Galvatron 
wants to happen again. 
Page 52/70
He wants to detonate that Seed in the biggest city and kill millions! He's gonna show the world, 
"Baby, I'm back." 
The blast wave will incinerate that city into molten metal. 
He'll have enough 
to build a massive army 
and annihilate your species forever. You dumb, greedy bastards 
just brought extinction to yourself. Not my problem, though. 
I'm free at last. 
Whole thing worked out good for me. I'm walking. 
We got to get the Seed 
before Galvatron does. 
"JOSHUA". The Seed is going to be the salvation of our company. 
We take delivery tonight. 
And next month, we detonate safely in the Mongolian desert. 
And we'll create enough Transformium for a hundred years. 
Dad, I'm tired of running and stealing. Well, a place to sleep. 
Yeah. Just another break-in. 
You know, when I was your age, I liked to get a little wild. 
I liked cars, girls. 
But then there was Tessa. 
And when she was born, 
all I ever wanted out of life 
was for her to be happy 
and healthy and safe. 
Somehow I thought I'd always 
be enough to protect her. 
But I won't be. 
I'll never be. 
So somebody better be. 
Thanks for being here today, 
Lucky Charms. 
Well, thanks for not shooting me when you had the chance. 
Page 53/70
I'll have more. 
Yeah, I can see that. 
We've intercepted 
the encrypted communications. 
Joshua Joyce is headed to his factory in Guangzhou, China. 
Hey, big shot. 
Your company's in serious trouble. You better have a damn good lawyer. Really? 
Well, you better have a great one 'cause you're about to be responsible 
for the annihilation of a city. Now, you listen to me. 
Your tech has been hacked. 
Your prototypes are infected. 
And now Galvatron is after that Seed. Look. I know you have a conscience because you're an inventor, like me. Do not let Galvatron 
anywhere near that Seed. 
I control Galvatron. I created him. Deep down, I know you know. 
Your prototype's been controlling you. How fast can that thing get us 
halfway around the world? 
Very. It's a spaceship. 
If we're traveling, now's the time. All I want is to have our life back. It's your call. Whatever you want. Are we safer on our own, 
or are we safer with them? 
She's a keeper. 
Must take after her mom. 
I can't argue with that, kid. 
Move! We're retrieving the Seed, but then we're done 
defending the humans. 
What, done? 
What do you mean, you're done? 
Means "finished," 
"see ya," "good-bye." 
Hijacked part of my ship? 
How did you let this happen? 
Page 54/70
Shut down dark-matter drive, 
reverse course at light speed, 
and get us back! 
Prime's taken my trophy case. 
And he will feel my wrath! 
Welcome to China. 
Put Galvatron in containment. 
Tell the techs do not activate him. Absolutely, sir. 
I WANT SECURITY ON HIGH ALERT. 
Joyce. 
I cannot tell you 
how enthused I am to deliver this. Top of your alien wish list. 
It's yours. Or rather ours. 
I will need to see my advance. 
Five million shares 
of the company. 
Together, 
we're gonna end human warfare. 
We're about to build 
a fully automated U.S. Army. 
Just think of all the American lives we're gonna save. 
ALL OF THESE CARS ARE KSI'S 
NEWEST CMLIAN PROTOTYPE ROBOTS. So how soon until 
we can start continuous production? You know, why don't we take 
a beat on this for a minute? 
I have some new data 
that I discovered and... 
You're not backing out on me here? No, I'm not backing out. I just... I want the Seed. 
I'm not saying I don't want the Seed. I'm just saying I don't know if I... If I want the Seed right now. 
Good men have died 
trying to get that thing for us. For you. 
I know what you did to get that thing. A lot of illegal, icky shit. 
I can take you down, too, Mr. Black Ops. Page 55/70
Don't you threaten me. 
I started this company when I was a boy, with a dream 
of making the world a better place. Funny. I had the same dream. 
Somewhere along the way, 
you made billions of dollars. 
So why don't you tell me 
what's missing from my dream? 
Why don't you tell me what's missing from my boyhood dream? 
I have served my country for decades of unparalleled prosperity 
and you are my golden parachute. So you are damn well 
jumping out of the plane with me! I am Galvatron! 
- What's going on? 
- Your Galvatron has gone active. What haven't you been telling me? Find Darcy, and bring a car around downstairs. Quietly. 
We got a factory emergency. 
I have to get you out of here. 
- What the hell's going on? 
- Take them outside. 
We had a deal. 
You got what you wanted. 
I got what "it" wanted. 
My brothers, 
today I grant you your freedom. And from now on, 
you are commanded by me. 
Rise up! 
Go find my Seed! 
Detonate the Seed in the largest city. Listen, princess. 
I don't wanna hear, "I told you so," but this is much more dangerous than I think. 
Get in. 
Galvatron's hacked into the others. - What? 
- Joshua. 
Page 56/70
- You have to contain this! 
- Drive, drive! 
Son of a... 
Come on. 
Let's move, let's move, let's move! I know how to lose them in Hong Kong. I know a military garrison there that will help us. 
Threatening a professional CIA killer. Possibly not my finest hour. 
I'd like to have that one back. Killer? I thought they were your friends! No. Not friends. Business. 
They gave me this bomb. 
Bomb? 
Is there a bomb in the bag? 
Yes, there's a bomb in the bag. Shit. 
When you said you were done 
fighting for humans, 
you didn't mean that, did you? 
How many more of my kind 
must be sacrificed 
to atone for your mistakes? 
Well, what do you think 
being human means? 
That's what we do. 
We make mistakes. 
And sometimes out of those mistakes come the most amazing things. 
When I fixed you, it was for a reward. That was it. That was why. For money. And it was me making a mistake. Without it, you wouldn't be here. So even if you got no faith in us, I'm asking you to do what I do. I'm asking you to look at all the junk and see the treasure. 
You gotta have faith, Prime, 
in who we can be. 
I'm seriously pissed 
we're not getting paid for this. Well, at least we get to kill him. They're not getting away if 
Page 57/70
I still got him on satellite. 
Some genius. 
Thinks he can outrun the CIA. 
Joshua? Yes? 
How lethal is that bomb? 
I don't know. Let me check. 
I love this! This is so good. 
Hang on. 
I'm getting a text from 
ll Duce in Hong Kong. 
"Need to know 
the Seed's estimated blast range." Duh. 
I'll do the diversion! 
Get that thing somewhere safe! 
Killers are coming! Guys, we gotta go! GUYS, guys... 
- Shut up! Shut up! 
- All right! I'm sorry! 
All right, go ahead, go ahead! 
Okay, good? No, don't go! Wait! 
Okay, he's in. Okay, okay, okay. 
I need a raise! I want a raise. 
All right, yes! 
I'm sure whatever you want! 
Go, go, go! 
No! 
Death is on our tail! Death is on our tail! Get out of the way, all of you! 
Get out of the way! 
I don't want to die like this. 
Box them in. 
Hurry, hurry! Come, come. 
Okay, yes. I'll follow you anywhere. You're amazing! 
We're going to get you to the roof. Good, good. 
Go! 
LOL. That's funny. 
I can't... This is really happening. A man, me, who is worth 
over 20 billion dollars is now 
being chased by CIA assassins. 
That's the truth. 
Page 58/70
And in the middle 
of a robot uprising. 
And I'm carrying what is, 
in essence, a tactical nuke. 
And the great thing is I... 
The great thing is that I'm... I'm barely feeling any jetlag. - Just stop it! 
- What? 
You need to hide on the roof 
of this building. 
I'll get you a helicopter extraction. Okay. 
I like her. 
I find her very attractive. 
He's definitely around here. 
Come on, come on. 
I got a bike! 
Check in there! 
These are the CIA assassins 
I told you about. 
Whoa! 
- Guys. 
- Let's go. 
Hello. 
Hey! Okay. 
- Pick it up. 
- All right. I'm gonna. 
Wow. 
Wow. Wow, thank you. 
Wow! How did you... 
Police training, prior to my MBA. I love you. 
Get to the roof. 
All right, okay. 
Find my Seed. It's here! 
Those prototypes are after that bomb. No! 
No, no, no, no! 
Who the hell's aboard that? 
Impossible. 
Brothers, it's the Autobots! 
Shoot them down! 
Joshua! 
Page 59/70
Hey, Baldy! 
Hey, it's me! Hey! 
Bring it over now! Let's go. 
Hurry up, run! 
- Hurry! Come on! 
- Let's go! Move it! 
Guys! Come on. Give it to me now! Looks like 
we might have company. 
We're hit! We're hit! 
They live, they talk, we're dead. - Kill them all. 
- Pleasure. 
I count ten below! 
I thought you said 
you had one prototype get infected. Now he's got operational control of my other 50. 
Come on. 
Climb, climb! 
Surround them. 
I may have started the apocalypse, but you brought your family. 
And that's, you know, terrible parenting. I'm about one second away 
from knocking you out, 
taking the bomb, 
and just leaving you here. 
Please, do me a favor. 
Optimus, Autobots, you alive? 
- Come on, bitch! 
- Come on! 
Evac! Evac! 
We're getting flanked! 
We got company below! 
My fat ass is stuck! 
Bee, take the shot! 
- Into the elevator! Get in. 
- Okay. 
Come on. 
Get down, get down! 
Close the door! Close the door! Won't go! It's not closing! 
There's too much weight. 
Page 60/70
- Get back down to Bumblebee! 
- Dad, no! 
Hey! You want me! 
Center elevator. 
Center elevator. 
He's gonna be okay. 
Alien bomb! Alien bomb, 
coming through! 
Clear the way! Clear the... Hi, kids. Coming through, ladies! 
Excuse me! 
Excuse me, ladies! Excuse me! 
My God! 
How do you say, "Get the fuck 
out of the way" in Chinese? 
That's a long way down. 
You've got to be kidding me. 
No! 
Come on. 
Whoa! 
I'm coming for you! 
Never should have hidden that truck. You should have never 
came after my family. 
Tough luck, Yeager. We all have family. Yeah, but I'm gonna live to see mine. Where is my escaped bounty? 
Autobots at this location. 
Prime is close. 
Do whatever you have to do. 
I intend to. 
- Darcy! 
- Joshua! 
We got three more 
coming in from that way! 
Bee, where's Tessa? 
Dad! 
We got a real dilemma here. Okay? I created incredible robots. 
It's all designed 
to kick that fat Transformer's ass. So, really, this is a no-win situation. It's over. 
That was mean. 
Page 61/70
Hey! I'm sorry if you can't handle the cold-hearted truth! 
Optimus, what are my orders 
with these humans? 
Can I squish the bald guy? 
They're in trouble. 
Nah! This isn't our fight! 
I'm done being an underdog. 
Underdogs suck! 
I say they get what they deserve. What's the play, Prime? 
It's time for reinforcements. 
Recognize one of your Knights. 
THE LEGEND EXISTS. 
Come on. 
All right, come on! Come on, let's go! Bee, go! 
Come on, we got to move! 
Let's go, move! 
Where's Tessa? 
Tessa, get over here! Come on. 
Get over here! 
Stay behind me! 
I'm covering you! 
If I stop covering you, it means I'm dead. But that ain't gonna happen. 
Take that! 
I'm a wicked warrior robot! 
Goddamn! 
Come on! We gotta move now! 
Go, go! 
We got hostiles coming down the street! Go! 
Bee! Twelve o'clock! Cover fire! We're surrounded! 
Hustle, hustle, hustle! 
Rocket! 
Go, go, go! 
Get down! 
This is the perfect place to hide. A big glass box! Nobody will ever find us here! That's... 
You've got to be kidding me. 
Legendary warriors, 
Page 62/70
the powers that created us 
now want us all extinguished. 
We must join forces, 
or else forever be their slaves. So today you stand with us... 
or you stand against me. 
We'll let Prime figure this one out. Very wise. 
There's no friggin' way 
I'm staying down here with them. No way. No way. 
Only together can we survive! 
Let me lead you! 
No. 
I was expecting a giant car. 
Come here! 
We're giving you freedom. 
You defend my family, 
or die. 
Autobots, 
we're going to prove who we are and why we're here! 
You just want to die for the guy. That's leadership. 
Or brainwashing, or something. No. That's Optimus Prime. 
Autobots, we charge together! 
Now, roll out! 
We're getting boxed in! 
We're getting flanked everywhere! Help me out here! 
Kill anything that moves! 
Come on, Cade, shoot! 
Come and get some, you little bitch! Incoming! 
I can't believe 
I'm putting my life in your hands. Here. Be my guest. Take the gun. - Go ahead, take it. 
- No, I don't want the gun. 
- Come on, you can lead. 
- No, I don't want the gun. 
Then stay under there and shut up! All right. You're good with the gun. 
Page 63/70
So you keep it. 
Running out of guns and ammo. 
Come and get some! 
You're all gonna die! 
Way to go, baby! 
Good shooting, Cade! 
I'm like a fat ballerina 
who takes scalps and slits throats! Got your fortune cookie! 
Come here, you little punk. 
Pull the pin! I'm dying out here! Here! Take it. Take it! 
Little help! Little help! 
It's live! It's live, it's live. Take it! What do you want me to do with it? - Just throw it! 
- Give, give, give! 
Got some bad news, Cade. 
I'm out of ammo and out of ideas. Faster! Go! 
I'll kill you! 
Charge! 
No, impossible! 
They're ruining everything! 
Take that! 
Get off me. 
- Get up, Hound! 
- I can't go on. 
But you gotta keep fighting! 
Tank's empty, bro. 
There's more of 'em coming. 
If you don't get up 
and fight, we're going to die. Let's go! Attack! 
Optimus is here! 
Bee, jump! 
I hate cheap knockoffs. 
Awesome job! 
- You. 
- Who? 
- You. 
- Step forward. 
Wait. Why? 
Your science will be responsible Page 64/70
for humanity's extinction. 
All right. I know that you're sensitive to this whole bioethical dilemma. Maybe all he wants to hear you say is that some things 
should never be invented. 
Okay. 
We'll lead you out of the city. Get that Seed safely to the hills. Use this car. 
He almost ate me! 
All right, we're good! 
All right, let's go! 
Get out of that seat. 
And you're one lucky dad to have me. Okay, Lucky Charms. You got that. You drive. Let's go. 
What did you do? 
I don't know. 
I don't know, but it's an issue. - Did you press a button? 
- Is it gonna blow up? 
I don't know. 
Your thing is beeping now, 
so you must have hit something. - Is it gonna blow up? 
- I don't know! 
A bomb starts beeping, 
that might signal a problem, you think? I'm just saying 
that it's a steady blinking light, which could be a timer of some kind. Unless it's signaling location. To who? 
We've got to call the central government for help! 
Optimus Prime. 
Come to me. 
DEFENSE MINISTER... 
THERE'S A CRISIS IN HONG KONG! 
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT WILL 
PROTECT HONG KONG AT ALL COSTS. WE HAVE FIGHTER JETS ON THE WAY. There's the bridge. 
Page 65/70
Back it up! Back it up! 
Go, go, go, go! 
Back up! Go back! Go back! 
Move! 
Get out of the way. I can't see! - Shane, drive faster! 
- Okay, just calm down. 
- Shane, watch out! 
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
- Get cover! 
- Back up! Back! Back up! 
Autobots, fall back! 
- Come on, move! Out of my way! - Get out of the way! 
- Look out! 
- Just hit them! Just hit them! It's a big magnet! 
It's sucking up metal and dropping it! - Go faster! Go faster! 
- Move! 
- Get out of the way! 
- It's coming! It's coming! 
It's coming closer! 
Go faster, Shane! 
Watch out, watch out! 
- Watch out! 
- Look out! 
Whoa! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! 
No, now it's circling back towards us! Hard right! Take a hard right! Move it! Get out of the way! 
My God! 
No. No, the magnet. Get out, get out! Come on! Come here! Get out! 
No, no, no! 
No, we're going up. Grab the bomb! Help me grab the bomb! 
I can't get the seat belt off! Pull me down! Catch me! 
I'm going up! I'm going up! 
Get me! Grab me! 
Pull me down! Pull me! 
I can't get the seat belt off! Page 66/70
I can't get the belt off! 
I'm stuck! I'm stuck! 
Hold the bomb! I can't hold on! 
Pull! 
Guys, it's crushing me! 
Car! 
Move! 
Shane! 
- Shane! 
- I'm good! I'm good. 
I'm good. 
Bumblebee! 
Hey, you guys! 
Yee-hah! 
Come on. 
Go find someplace safe. 
I'm proud of you. 
Get cover! 
Cade! 
Autobots, get this bomb over the bridge and out of the city! 
Dad! 
What? Come on. 
I got it! 
I'm getting this bomb out of here! Give me the gun. 
It's you and me now! 
Look, Optimus is out there all alone. What? You can't help him. 
I have to, Tess. He came back for us. Dad, don't leave, please. 
Look, I'll find you, I'll get there, okay? Dad, no, you'll die! 
You gotta stay with Shane. 
You're gonna be okay. 
You promise me 
you're gonna keep her safe, 
rest of her life, until the end of time! Promise me! 
I promise you. 
You're the best thing I ever made, Tess. All right, don't ever forget it, it was always you. 
- I love you. 
Page 67/70
- Please. 
Get in the car, now. 
Dad! 
Prime! 
Stop the car! 
- You better listen. 
- No, you listen. 
I'm not leaving my dad. 
All right, we're gonna 
hold the line, then block the bridge! You see, it takes patience 
to make a man. 
The patience to watch and wait, to protect all of us, quietly, 
for God and country, 
without any recognition at all! Cade! 
There are no good aliens! 
Or bad aliens, Yeager. 
It's just us and them. 
And you chose them. 
Anytime. 
You saved the human 
instead of saving yourself? 
You bring shame upon us all. 
She never listens. Never. 
I gave you an order! 
Get out of here, now! 
Get in. Get in. 
Hey, you! Hey! 
Cade, get out of here! This is my fight! It's my fight, and you're all gonna die! Go! Go! 
Come on! Come on! 
Yeah! Killer robot, my ass! 
Whoo! 
Come on. 
Get away, all of you! 
Come on, Tess. 
Come on, Tess. Come on, Tess. 
Drive! 
You see my face, your life is done! Come on, come on, come on! 
Yeah! 
Page 68/70
Honor to the end. 
You still happy we met? 
Always. 
Hurry! 
Quickly! I'm setting off 
Lockdown's grenade! 
Hold tight! 
We shall meet again, Prime, 
for I am reborn. 
Kind of nice being your hero 
for a change. 
You always were. All my life. 
I love you. 
I love you, too. 
Let's go home to graduation? 
Yeah. 
You're okay, kid. 
Come here, you're all right. 
You're all right. 
We don't have a home, Dad. 
It blew up. 
I might be able to help you with that. Brave warriors... 
you are free! 
I'll ride 
with you anytime, Spike! 
Did you miss me? 
No. 
This Seed belongs to our creators, whoever they are. 
There remains a price on my head. I endanger you all if I stay. 
I shall take it 
where it can never be found. 
Will we ever see you again? 
Cade Yeager, 
I do not know. 
But whenever you look to the stars, think of one of them 
as my soul. 
Defend this family, Autobots, 
as they have you. 
Defend 
all they can be. 
Page 69/70
There are 
mysteries to the universe 
we were never meant to solve. 
But who we are and why we are here are not among them. 
Those answers we carry inside. I am Optimus Prime 
Leave planet Earth alone. 
'Cause I'm coming 
for you.

X-Men: Days of Future Past 
By Simon Kinberg

1 
The future. 
A dark, desolate world. 
A world of war, 
suffering, loss... 
on both sides. 
Mutants and the humans 
who dared to help them. 
Fighting an enemy 
we cannot defeat. 
Are we 
destined down this path? 
Destined to destroy ourselves like so many species before us? 
Or can we evolve fast 
enough to change ourselves? 
Change our fate? 
Is the future truly set? 
They're here! 
Time's up. 
Sentinels! 
Sunspot! 
Let's go. 
Run! 
Go! 
Blink! No! 
Too late, assholes. 
Don't move, 
you mutant scum! 
No! 
Flat on the ground, 
hands behind your head! 
So few of us left. 
Professor? 
I've found them. 
Professor! 
Bobby. 
Hey, Storm. 
Hey, kid. 
Professor, 
you made it. 
Whenever the Sentinels attack, Warpath spots them... 
then I send Bishop 
Page 2/56
back to warn us 
of the attack 
before it happens. 
Blink scouts the next site... 
and then we leave before 
they ever know we were there. 
Because... 
we never were. 
What do you mean 
you were never there? 
She projects Bishop back in time a few days to 
warn the others... 
of the coming attack. 
So she sends 
Bishop back in time? 
No, just his consciousness, 
into his younger self. 
His younger body. 
Wow. 
This might just work, 
Charles. 
What might work? 
The Sentinel program was originally conceived by Doctor Bolivar Trask. In the early '70s, 
he was one of the world's 
leading weapons designers. 
But, covertly, he had begun 
experimenting on mutants... 
using their gifts 
to fuel his own research. 
This is extraordinary. 
There was one mutant who had 
discovered what he was doing. 
A mutant with the ability to 
transform herself into anyone. Mystique. 
I knew her as Raven. 
We met when 
we were children, 
grew up together. 
She was like a sister to me. 
I tried to help her... 
Page 3/56
but only succeeded 
in driving her away. 
She hunted Trask 
across the world. 
And at the Paris 
Peace Accords in 1973, 
after the Vietnam War... 
she found Trask... 
and killed him. 
It was the first 
time she killed. 
It wasn't her last. 
But killing Trask did not have the outcome she expected. 
It only persuaded 
the government 
of the need 
for his program. 
They captured her that day... 
tortured her, 
experimented on her. 
In her DNA, they discovered the secrets to her powers of transformation. It gave them the key 
they needed... 
to create weapons that could 
adapt to any mutant power. 
And in less than 50 years... 
the machines 
that have destroyed... 
so many of our kind 
were created. 
But it all started 
that day in 1973... 
the day she first killed. 
The day she truly became... 
Mystique. 
You want to go back there. 
If I can get to her, 
stop the assassination... 
keep her out of 
their hands... 
then we can stop the Sentinels from ever being born. 
Page 4/56
And end this war 
before it ever begins. 
Uh, I can send someone back 
a couple weeks. 
Maybe a month. 
But you're talking about 
going back decades. 
You have the most 
powerful brain in the world, 
Professor... 
but the mind can only stretch 
so far before it snaps. 
It would rip you apart. 
I'm sorry. 
No one could 
survive that trip. 
What if someone's mind 
has a way of snapping back? 
What if someone can heal as fast as they're ripped apart? 
It's a risk. 
Yeah, I'm getting that. 
Not just for you. 
You do this, 
you change history. 
Well, that's kind of 
the point. 
Some of us could be killed. 
Some of us may 
never be born. 
We have no idea 
how things may change. 
We could keep going. 
Keep fighting. 
Until what? 
You've got a 
decision to make. 
You can keep sending 
Bishop back in time 
over and over again 
to warn you, 
until one day, 
he doesn't make it, 
and you all die. 
Page 5/56
Or you can 
give up this life. 
So that they and everyone 
else who died in this war 
can actually have a future. 
You're asking us 
to sacrifice our lives 
for a future we might not 
even be a part of. 
Yes. 
A second chance. 
A better chance 
for everyone. 
My people need to vote. 
They just did. 
They're in. 
Okay, spread out. 
Take your positions. 
So I wake up 
in my younger body, 
God knows where. 
Then what? 
You'll need to go to 
my house and find me. 
Convince me of all of this. 
Won't you be able to 
just read my mind? 
I didn't have my 
powers in 1973. 
Logan, you're going to have to do for me what I once did for you. Lead me, guide me. 
I was a very 
different man then. 
You'll have to be 
patient with me. 
Patience is my strongest suit. You'll need me as well. 
What? 
After Mystique left Charles, 
she came with me... 
and I set her on 
a dangerous path. 
A darker path. 
Page 6/56
It's going to take the two of us, side by side... 
at a time when we couldn't 
be further apart. 
Great. 
So where do I find you? 
Well, it's complicated. 
Are you sure about this? 
It's not just his power 
that'll be tested. 
I've seen what this 
can do to you. 
I can handle this. 
Trust me. 
I guess I'll see you 
in the next life. 
Basically, your 
body will go to sleep 
while your mind travels 
back in time. 
As long as you're back there, 
past and present will continue to coexist. But once you wake up... 
whatever you've done will take hold and become history. 
And for the rest of us, 
it will be the only history 
that we know. 
It will be like the last 
50 years never happened. 
And this world, 
and this war... 
the only person who will 
remember it is you. 
All right, Logan... 
I need you to 
clear your head 
and to stay 
as calm as possible. 
What? What do you mean? 
If your mind gets rocky, 
it will be harder for me to hold you... and you could start to slip 
between past and future. 
Page 7/56
What if I need to get 
a little rocky? 
Think peaceful thoughts? 
Peaceful thoughts... 
Do you have any good news? 
Well, you don't really age, 
so you'll pretty much look the same. You won't have 
much time in the past. 
The Sentinels will find us. 
They always do. 
And this time, 
we won't be able to run. 
We'll have no escape. 
This is our last chance. 
You really think this will work? I have faith in him. 
It's not him I'm 
worried about, it's us. 
We were young... 
we didn't know any better. 
We will now. 
See you all soon. 
This might sting a little. 
The first time 
Ever I saw your face 
Whoa. 
I thought the sun 
Rose in your eyes 
And the moon and the stars 
Were the gifts you gave 
Holy shit. 
It worked. 
Hey, what's going on? 
Gwen, get dressed. 
Who the hell are you? 
Hey, I don't know 
what's going on. 
You're supposed to be 
guarding the boss's daughter, 
not screwing her. 
Well, I didn't 
sleep with her. 
No? 
Page 8/56
No. 
I mean, yes, I slept 
with her many times. 
Jimmy! 
That wasn't me. 
That was the old me. 
I just got here 
20 seconds ago. 
Really? 
Then what happened 
to your clothes? 
My... Oh. 
Would you believe 
me if I told you 
I was sent here 
from the future? 
Huh? 
Get out of here, 
sweetheart. 
Yeah. 
We're gonna take care of this comedian. No, you're not. 
You're gonna give me the keys to your car and some money for gas... or you're gonna wake 
up in the hospital. 
Trust me, 
I know how these things play out. Oh. Because you're 
from the future? 
No. 
Because of these. 
What the hell? 
God damn it! 
Peaceful thoughts. 
Jimmy! What happened 
to Ramon? 
And why are you 
talking crazy talk? 
Look, uh... 
Gwen. 
Gwen, you're gonna wanna 
lay low for a few days, 
all right? 
Page 9/56
Starting now. 
Come on, out. 
Go. 
Hmm. 
Today, the 18th MP Brigade 
is departing from Saigon, 
marking the last American 
troops to leave Vietnam. 
And effectively ending the war. We are reviewing all of our 
defense expenditures... 
and all the black books 
are being opened. 
We can't support a weapon 
that targets our own citizens. If these mutants, 
as you describe... 
are already living among us... then they are living 
here peacefully. 
We haven't had an incident 
in over 10 years. 
After what happened in Cuba? 
That was never confirmed. 
We have very real 
enemies out there... 
the Russians, the Chinese. 
We are talking about 
a tenth of a tenth... 
of a tenth 
of our population. 
Allow me to read 
something to you. 
Please. 
This was acquired by 
our friends at the CIA. 
It's a dissertation... 
written by a mutant 
at Oxford University. 
And I quote... 
"To Homo Neanderthalensis... 
"his mutant cousin, 
Homo Sapiens..." 
which is us... 
Page 10/56
"was an aberration. 
"The arrival of the mutated 
human species, Homo Sapiens... 
"was followed by the immediate 
extinction of their less evolved kin." Well... 
Now, we are 
the Neanderthal. 
Speak for yourself, 
Dr. Trask. 
You know, 
when you sent our soldiers to Vietnam... without the weapons they 
needed to win the war... 
you underestimated 
your enemy. 
You do that 
with this enemy... 
Mmm... 
and it won't be some border 
skirmish halfway around the world. This time, the war will 
be for our streets... 
our cities, our homes... 
and by the time you see the 
need for my program... 
it will be too late... 
and you will have lost 
two wars in one lifetime. 
We are sorry, 
Dr. Trask... 
but your Sentinel Program... 
it ain't gonna fly. 
Can I help you, Colonel? 
Just here to give our 
boys a proper send-off. 
I'm sorry, sir, 
but we have orders. 
This is a quarantined area. 
Stand aside, soldier. 
That's an order. 
Atten-hut! 
At ease. 
What is all this? 
Page 11/56
Lab reports, 
blood tests. 
It's all getting packed up 
and shipped back. 
Where is it going? 
Same place they are. 
Trask Industries. 
Let's go, gentlemen. 
I'm taking you out 
of this shit show. 
Shipping home? 
Not just yet. 
What are you doing 
with those? 
Something to make the ride 
a little smoother. 
I'm transferring you 
to a private facility... 
where we can run 
a few more tests. 
Your men are not military. 
Private outfit. 
We're authorized 
to remand these men. 
Hmm. 
These troops are going home. 
Well, Colonel, 
I don't believe you have 
jurisdiction in this matter. 
I'm afraid I do, son. 
I'm sorry, who are you? 
The question is, 
Major... 
...who are you? 
Raven! 
That's not my name. 
I had that. 
I know. 
Let's move out. 
Come on, let's go. 
Where's Erik? 
I'm on my own now. 
Let's go! Move it! 
Hold that plane! 
Page 12/56
Wouldn't wanna leave these 
boys in this godforsaken country. Yes, sir. 
You're not coming 
with us, are you? 
My war's not over. 
The enemy is 
still out there. 
The four privates, 
where did they go? 
They were headed 
towards the tarmac. 
Can I help you? 
Uh... Yeah, 
what happened to the school? 
The school's been shut for years. Are you a parent? 
I sure as hell 
hope not. Who are you? 
I'm Hank. Hank McCoy. 
I look after the house now. 
You're Beast? 
Look at you. I guess 
you're a late bloomer. 
I don't know what 
you're talking about, 
but I'm gonna have 
to ask you to leave. 
So where's the Professor? 
There's no professor here. 
You're pretty strong 
for a scrawny kid. 
You sure there's not 
a little Beast in there? 
No, he's not here. 
Come on, Beast. 
Come on, Beastie. 
No. 
Hey! 
I said the school's closed. 
You need to leave. 
Not until I see the Professor. There's no professor here, 
I told you that. 
Page 13/56
Look, kid. 
You and I are gonna be good friends. You just don't know it yet. 
Professor! 
Professor! 
Hank? 
What's going on here? 
Professor? 
Please don't call me that. 
Why? 
You know this guy? 
Yeah, he looks 
slightly familiar. 
Get off the bloody 
chandelier, Hank. 
You can walk. 
You're a perceptive one. 
I thought Erik... 
Which makes it 
slightly perplexing that 
you missed our 
sign on the way in. 
This is private property, 
my friend. 
I'm gonna have to ask him 
to ask you to leave. 
Well. 
I'm afraid 
I can't do that... 
because, uh, 
I was sent here for you. 
Tell whoever it was 
that sent you that I'm busy. 
That's gonna be 
a little tricky... 
because the person 
who sent me was you. 
What? 
About 50 years from now. 
I know. Stay with me. 
Like in the future, 
50 years from now? 
Yeah. 
I sent you from the future? 
Page 14/56
Yeah. 
Piss off. 
If you had your powers, 
you'd know I was telling the truth. How do you know 
I don't have my p... 
Who are you? 
I told you. 
Are you CIA? 
No. 
You've been watching me? 
I know you, Charles. 
We've been friends for years. 
I know your powers 
came when you were 9. 
I know you thought you were 
going crazy when it started... all the voices in your head. 
And it wasn't 
until you were 12... 
that you realized all the voices were in everyone else's head. 
Do you want me to go on? 
I never told anyone that. 
Not yet, no, 
but, you will. 
All right, 
you've piqued my interest. 
What do you want? 
We have to stop Raven. 
I need your help. 
We need your help. 
I think I'd like 
to wake up now. 
What does she 
have to do with this? 
So you're saying... 
they took Raven's 
power, and what? 
They weaponized it? 
Yep. 
She is unique. 
Yeah, she is, Hank. 
In the beginning, 
Page 15/56
the Sentinels were just targeting mutants. Then they began to identify 
the genetics in non-mutants... 
who would eventually have mutant children and grandchildren. 
Many of the humans tried to help us, but it was a slaughter. 
Leaving only the worst 
of humanity in charge. 
I've been in a lot of wars. 
I'd never seen 
anything like this. 
And it all starts with her. 
Let's just say 
for the sake of... 
the sake, that I 
choose to believe you... 
that I choose to help you. 
Raven won't listen to me. 
Her heart and soul 
belong to someone else now. 
I know. 
That's why we're 
gonna need Magneto, too. 
Erik? 
You do know where he is? 
Yeah. 
Could you give me that 
one more time, please? 
You heard me. 
He's where he belongs. 
You're just gonna walk out? 
Ooh, top marks. 
Like I said, you are perceptive. The Professor I know 
would never turn his back... 
on someone who'd 
lost their path. 
Especially someone he loved. 
You know... 
I think I do 
remember you now. 
Yeah. Tall, angry fellow 
with the contentious hair. 
Page 16/56
We came to you a long time ago... seeking your help. 
And I'm gonna say to you 
what you said to us then. 
Fuck off. 
Listen to me, 
you little shit. 
I've come a long way, 
and I've watched a lot of people die. Good people. Friends. 
If you're gonna 
wallow in self-pity... 
and do nothing, then you're 
gonna watch the same thing... 
you understand? 
We all have to 
die sometime. 
Told you there was 
no professor here. 
What the hell happened to him? He lost everything. 
Erik, Raven... 
his legs. 
We built the school, 
the labs, this whole place... 
then, just after 
the first semester... 
the war in Vietnam got worse. 
Many of the teachers... 
and older students 
were drafted. 
It broke him. 
He retreated into himself. 
I wanted to help, 
do something... 
so I designed a serum 
to treat his spine... 
derived from the same formula that helps me control my mutation. 
I take just enough 
to keep myself balanced... 
but he takes too much. 
I tried easing him back... 
but he just couldn't bear 
Page 17/56
the pain, the voices. 
The treatment 
gives him his legs... 
but it's not enough. 
He's... 
He's just lost too much. 
You're not scared of me? 
I always believed I couldn't be the only one in the world. 
Charles Xavier. 
Raven. 
You're hungry and alone. 
Take whatever you want. 
We've got lots of food. 
You don't have to steal. 
In fact... 
you never have to 
steal again. 
And that's a promise. 
I'll help you get her. 
Not for any of your future shite, but for her. 
Fair enough. 
But I'll tell you this. 
You don't know Erik. 
That man is a monster. 
A murderer. 
You think you can 
convince Raven to change? 
To come home? 
That's splendid. 
But what makes you think 
you can change him? 
Because you and Erik sent 
me back here together. 
The room 
they're holding him in 
was built during 
the Second World War... 
when there was 
a shortage of steel. 
So the foundation is pure 
concrete and sand. No metal. 
He's being held... 
Page 18/56
a hundred floors 
beneath the most 
heavily guarded 
building on the planet. 
Why is he in there? 
What, he forgot 
to mention? 
Uh, JFK. 
He killed... 
What else explains a bullet 
miraculously curving through the air? Erik's always had 
a way with guns. 
Are you sure you want 
to carry on with this? 
This is your plan, 
not mine. 
We don't have any 
resources to get us in. 
Or out. 
It's just me and Hank. 
I knew a guy. 
Yeah, he'd be 
a young man now. 
Grew up outside of D.C. 
He could get into anywhere. 
I just don't know how the hell we're gonna find him. 
Is Cerebro 
out of the question? 
If only you guys 
had Internet. 
What's "Internet?" 
We have a phonebook. 
I thought you'd be getting 
ready for your trip, sir. 
I just came to 
grab a couple files. 
Is that a new scarf? 
It's nice. 
Thank you. 
Dr. Trask? 
One second. 
Oh. 
Page 19/56
We added some names 
to the Paris meeting. 
Thank you. 
Is something wrong, sir? 
No. It's nothing. 
Would you mind 
typing up my itinerary? 
I don't wanna miss anything. 
- Here, here, here. 
- Where? 
Just stop here. 
All right, all right. 
Next time I'm driving. 
Don't get used to it. 
What's he done now? 
I will just write you a check for whatever he took. 
We just need to talk to him. 
Peter! The cops 
are here. Again. 
I'm a princess. 
What are you? 
I'm the Wolverine. 
Where's your brother? 
Go upstairs 
and bug your sister. 
But she bugs me! 
What do you guys want? 
I didn't do anything. 
I've been here all day. 
Just relax, Peter. 
We're not cops. 
Of course you're not. 
If you were, 
you wouldn't be 
driving a rental car. 
How did you know 
we've got a rental car? 
I checked your registration when you were walking to the door. 
I also had 
some time to kill 
so I went through 
your rental agreement. 
Page 20/56
Saw you were from out of town. 
Are you FBI? 
No, you're not cops. 
Hey, what's with this gifted youngsters place? That's an old card. 
He's fascinating. 
He's a pain in the arse. 
What, a teleporter? 
No, he's just fast. 
And when I knew him 
he wasn't so... young. 
Young? 
You're just old. 
So you're not afraid 
to show your powers? 
What powers? What 
are you talking about? 
Do you see 
something strange here? 
Nothing anybody would 
believe if you told them. 
So, who are you? 
What do you want? 
We need your help, Peter. 
For what? 
To break into a highly 
secured facility... 
and to get someone out. 
Prison break? 
That's illegal, you know. 
Um... 
Well, only if 
you get caught. 
So, what's in it for me? 
You, you kleptomaniac, 
get to break into the Pentagon. 
How do I know 
I can trust you? 
Because we're 
just like you. 
Show him. 
That's cool, 
but it's disgusting. 
Built in 1943, the Pentagon is the 
Page 21/56
world's largest office building... housing more than 
25,000 military employees... 
stretched over six 
million square feet. 
Where's the bathroom? 
He always needs to pee! 
Yeah, we're getting 
broadcast signal down here. 
What's going on? 
Damn it, call Maintenance, 
get them down here. 
...fought for and captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Japanese Empire. Now, this month-long battle... included some of 
the fiercest fighting 
during World War 
II in the Pacific... 
In three seconds, 
those doors are going to open... and 20 guards will 
be here to shoot us. 
I know. That's what 
I'm waiting for. 
What are you doing? 
I'm holding your neck so 
you don't get whiplash. 
What? 
Whiplash. 
Don't move! 
You're 
good, it'll pass. 
It happens with everyone. 
You must have done 
something pretty serious. 
What did you do, man? 
What did you do? 
What did you do? 
Why'd they have you in there? 
For killing the President. 
Ah. Wow. 
Shit. 
The only thing 
Page 22/56
I'm guilty of 
is fighting for 
people like us. 
You take karate? 
You know karate, man? 
I don't know karate. 
But I know crazy. 
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, this is a Code Red situation. 
We are evacuating 
the entire floor... 
so that my associate and I... 
can, uh, secure the prison. 
Who are you? 
We're special operations, 
CB... 
FB-CID. 
Perhaps you didn't hear me 
when first I spoke... 
but it is imperative 
that you understand... 
we're in a complete 
lockdown situation. 
We have to get you 
to the third floor... 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Were you finished? 
They told me 
you control metal. 
"They"? 
You know, my mom once knew 
a guy who could do that. 
I'm sorry, I'm just not 
very good with violence. 
Charles? 
Good to see you too, 
old friend. 
And walking. 
No thanks to you. 
You're the last person in 
the world I expected to see today. Believe me... 
I wouldn't be here 
if I didn't have to. 
Page 23/56
If we get you out of here, 
we do it my way. 
No killing. 
No helmet. 
I couldn't disobey 
you even if I wanted. 
I'm never getting 
inside of that head again. 
I need your word, Erik. 
Nobody move! 
Hold it right there! 
Charles. 
Don't move. 
Hands up, 
or we will shoot! 
Freeze them, Charles. 
I can't. 
Hands up! 
No! 
If I could save time 
in a bottle 
The first thing 
that I'd like to do 
Is to save every day 
Till eternity passes away 
Just to spend them with you 
If I could make days 
last forever 
If words could make 
wishes come true 
I'd save every day 
Like a treasure and then 
Again, 
I would spend them with you 
But there never seems 
to be enough time 
To do the things 
you want to do 
Once you find them 
I've looked around 
enough to know 
That you're the one I want 
to go through time with 
Thanks, kid. 
Page 24/56
Peter, 
thank you very, very much. 
You take care. 
Hey, I saw your 
flight plan in the cockpit. 
Why are you going to Paris? 
Imagine if they were metal. 
Do me a favor and return it for me. Okay. 
And, Peter? 
Take it slow. 
Where did they 
dig you up? 
You're gonna find 
this hard to believe... 
but, uh, you sent me. 
You and Charles. 
From the future. 
How did you lose them? 
The treatment for my 
spine affects my DNA. 
You sacrificed your powers 
so you could walk? 
I sacrificed my powers 
so that I could sleep. 
What do you know about it? 
I've lost my fair share. 
Ha. 
Dry your eyes, Erik. 
It doesn't justify 
what you've done. 
You have no idea 
what I've done. 
I know that you took the things that mean the most to me. 
Well, maybe you should have 
fought harder for them. 
If you want a fight, 
Erik... 
- Sit down. 
...I will give you a fight! 
Let him come. 
You abandoned me! 
You took her away... 
Page 25/56
and you abandoned me! 
Angel. 
Azazel. 
Emma. 
Banshee. 
Mutant brothers and sisters... 
all dead! 
Countless others... 
experimented on. 
Butchered! 
Erik! 
Where were you, Charles? 
We were supposed 
to protect them! 
Where were you when your 
own people needed you? 
Hiding! You and Hank! 
Pretending to be 
something you're not! 
Erik! 
You abandoned us all. 
So, you were 
always an asshole. 
I take it we're best 
buddies in the future. 
I spent a lot of years 
trying to bring 
you down, bub. 
How does that 
work out for you? 
You're like me. 
You're a survivor. 
Do you wanna pick 
all that shit up? 
General, maybe you should slow down, 
we have a big day tomorrow. 
We're celebrating, captain. It's not every day you win a war, let alone against the American devils. I'm getting another bottle. 
Excuse me. 
I'm pretty sure it was my fault. 
You speak Vietnamese. 
I'm an interpreter. 
I speak many tongues. 
Page 26/56
Let me buy you another drink... unless you're here with someone. I'm alone. 
A bottle of Johnnie Walker please. You're going to the Summit tomorrow? A pretty girl interested in politics... Looks can be deceiving. 
Lady. 
Show me more, baby? 
Clothes off? 
What's the matter, baby? 
You don't think I 
look pretty like this? 
Fancy a game? 
It's been a while. 
I'm not in the mood 
for games, thank you. 
I haven't had 
a real sip in ten years. 
I didn't kill the President. 
The bullet curved, Erik. 
Because I was 
trying to save him. 
They took me out 
before I could. 
Why would you 
try and save him? 
Because he was one of us. 
You must think me 
so foolish. 
We've always said they 
would come after us. 
I never imagined they'd 
use Raven's DNA to do it. 
When did you last see her? 
The day I left for Dallas. 
And how was she? 
Strong. 
Driven. 
Loyal. 
How... How was she? 
She was... 
We were... 
I could see why she 
Page 27/56
meant so much to you. 
You should be proud 
of her, Charles. 
She's out there 
fighting for our cause. 
Your cause. 
The girl I raised was 
not capable of killing. 
You didn't raise her, 
you grew up with her. 
She couldn't stay a little girl forever, that's why she left. 
She left because you 
got inside her head. 
That's not my power. 
She made a choice. 
But now we know where 
that choice leads, don't we? 
She's going to murder Trask, 
they're going 
to capture her... 
and then they're 
going to wipe us out. 
Not if we get 
to her first. 
Not if we change 
history tomorrow. 
I'm sorry, Charles... 
for what happened. 
I truly am. 
It's been a while 
since I've played. 
I'll go easy on you. 
Might finally 
be a fair fight. 
You have the first move. 
The diplomats from 
all around the world 
are arriving here 
today at the Hotel Royal. 
It's an historic day. 
It's the, uh, 
official ending 
of the United States' military 
Page 28/56
involvement in Vietnam. 
There we have the South Vietnamese Foreign Minister... 
with other South 
Vietnamese dignitaries. 
The Summit doesn't begin 
for another hour. 
The hotel has arranged 
a private room 
upstairs for 
your special guests. 
That will be plenty of time. 
Good afternoon, everyone. 
Hello, thank you for coming. 
Congratulations on 
winning this war. 
Now, I know you all 
have hands to shake 
and photos to take downstairs... so I will get 
right to the point. 
There is a new 
enemy out there. 
An enemy that will render 
your arsenals useless... 
your armies powerless... 
and your nations defenseless. 
You will need a new weapon for this war. I call them Sentinels. 
Named after 
the ancient guardians 
that stood at 
the gates of the citadel. 
They have the aeronautic capabilities of a Harrier jet. 
Armed with guns 
that can fire off... 
more than 2,000 rounds per minute of thermoceramic ammunition. 
But size, power, 
speed... 
You could find that 
at Lockheed or Boeing. 
No, what makes the 
Page 29/56
Sentinels so special... 
is the ability to target 
the mutant X-gene. 
A genetic guidance system 
that can lock onto a mark 
a half a mile away. 
It won't trigger unless it has identified the target. 
With this weapon, 
there will be 
no human collateral damage. 
If I turn it on, 
the system couldn't 
even activate in here. 
Unless there's a mutant. 
There has to be 
some kind of mistake. 
My machines don't make mistakes. What are you? 
I assure you... 
No, don't shoot it. 
I assure you, 
I don't know what 
you're talking about. 
Raven! 
Raven? Raven! 
Raven? 
Charles? 
We've come for you, 
Erik and I. 
Together. 
I never thought 
I'd see you again. 
I made you 
a promise a long time ago 
that I would protect you. 
Wolverine! 
I'm going 
to keep you safe. 
I'm going to keep you 
out of their hands. 
Erik? 
Erik? 
What are you doing? 
Page 30/56
Securing our future. 
Forgive me, 
Mystique. 
As long as you're out there, 
we'll never be safe. 
Erik... 
Use your power, 
Charles. Stop him. 
He can't. 
He's slipping back. 
I'm losing him. 
Stryker! 
Someone will finish 
what we've started, Wolverine! One day! 
Restrain him. 
Erik! 
Where am I? 
Huh? 
How the hell 
did I get here? 
What? You came to us. 
Who are you? 
Charles. 
Charles Xavier! 
I don't know you. 
Huh? 
What the hell is that? 
Whoa. Whoa. 
Look, I can deal with this. Just go. Stop Erik! 
Erik, please... 
I'm sorry. 
Erik... 
You're Logan, 
that's Hank McCoy, 
I'm Charles Xavier. 
You spent the last 
couple of days with us. 
You're on acid. 
Somebody gave you 
really bad acid, yeah? 
Just hold on tight, 
we'll get through 
Page 31/56
this together. 
Oh, my God, Kitty. 
She's wounded pretty bad. 
I got him. 
Professor? 
What happened to you? 
I just saw someone 
who's gonna 
bring me a lot 
of pain someday. 
Where's Raven? 
Gone. 
What? 
We have to get 
out of here. 
We want to know if there's 
any sort of connection with... Yesterday, 
the Paris Peace Summit... 
was rocked by the appearance 
of unidentified assailants... 
the likes of which 
the world has never seen. 
Mass hysteria has gripped 
the nation as people ask... 
"Where did they come from? 
Will they be back?" 
And most importantly, 
"Are they friend or foe?" 
That was London correspondent 
Toby Elliot... 
reporting from the 
Paris Peace Summit yesterday. 
Fuck me. 
What the hell are we dealing with here? Off the record. 
Two days ago, this man, 
Erik Lehnsherr... 
escaped from a maximum security prison inside the Pentagon. 
We believe that this woman 
is a former associate 
of Lehnsherr's. 
They were together in Cuba, 
Page 32/56
the day of 
the crisis in '62. 
He was also implicated 
in Kennedy's assassination. 
What about that thing? 
We don't know what 
that thing is, sir. 
Actually, we really don't know what any of them are. 
Yes. Yes, we do. 
They're mutants. 
He has the power 
to control metal. 
Last I checked, 
that's what 
most of your weapons 
were made of. 
And she can transform 
into anyone. 
A general, 
a secret serviceman. 
Even you, 
Mr. President. 
She could walk 
into this office... 
and order a nuclear strike 
if she was in the mood. 
And that's only 
two of them. 
Do we have any countermeasures? Any defense? 
I was waiting for you 
to ask me that question. 
That's an experimental program, sir. Strictly off the books. 
You're telling me these mutants are out in the world... 
and our best defense 
are these giant metal robots? 
Many of the mutants 
look like us. 
My Sentinels can 
tell the difference. 
I have eight prototypes 
Page 33/56
ready to go. 
They're built out of 
a space-age polymer, 
not an ounce 
of metal on them. 
I want to make 
a demonstration. 
I want the world to know 
that we can protect them. 
What do you need to get 
these things operational? 
I already gave that 
number to Congress. 
Unfortunately, 
they elected to shut me down. 
It's going to cost a bit 
more to turn them on. 
- Whatever you need. 
- Oh, and one more thing. 
If we do manage to capture them, I would like her. 
For research purposes, 
of course. 
I don't care who you screw, 
as long as it's not me. 
Terrible thing. 
What is? 
Being born like that. 
Is it? 
Can you imagine... 
Looking in the mirror and seeing that staring back at you? 
Yes, I can. 
Where do you think she comes from? You think she has a family? 
Yes. 
She does. 
If I see so much 
as a screw move, 
I will jam this 
into your throat. 
How did you find me? 
You taught me well. 
It's been a long time 
Page 34/56
since we were this close. 
I missed you. 
You tried to kill me. 
So the rest of us 
could live. 
What do you mean? 
We received a message 
from the future. 
Don't lie to me. 
I never have, 
and I never will. 
Humans use your blood, 
your genes, 
to create a weapon 
that wipes us all out. 
I was only doing 
what I thought 
necessary to secure 
our future. 
So what's to stop me 
from killing you 
right now and 
securing my future? 
Nothing. 
It doesn't matter anymore. 
They have your DNA. 
Your blood was on the street. 
Whose fault was that? 
Mine. 
I've seen their plans. 
They're creating a weapon. 
And now they have what they need to take it further. 
We have to strike now, 
while we still hold the upper hand. I've seen too many 
friends die, Erik. 
I don't want a war. 
I only want the man 
who murdered them. 
This is war. 
What happened to you? 
Did you lose your way 
while I was gone? 
Page 35/56
Are you still Charles' Raven? 
Or are you Mystique? 
Trask is the enemy. 
Killing one man isn't enough. 
It never was for you. 
Goodbye, Erik. 
What happened? 
Come on. 
Can he walk? 
He needs his treatment. 
Hank, I can hear them. 
I know. It's okay. 
Can you make it stop? 
I'll get them. 
Hey, hey. 
Pull yourself together. 
It's not over yet. 
You don't believe that. 
How do you know? 
As these go... 
this comes back. 
They all come back. 
Look. 
I'm still here... 
and she's still out there. 
We need your help, Charles. 
Not like this. 
I need you. 
We can't find Raven. 
Not without your powers. 
I added a little extra 
because you missed a dose. 
Charles. 
Hank, do me a favor. 
Would you help me 
to my study, please? 
Come on, I got you. 
Are you sure about this? 
Absolutely not. 
This creature is extraordinary. Her genes could hold the key 
to mutation itself. 
I need more. 
That's all they were able to 
Page 36/56
scrape off the pavement in Paris. More than blood. 
I need brain tissue... 
spinal fluid, bone marrow. 
Imagine... 
Sentinels that could transform, adapt to any target. 
If I could just get 
my hands on her. 
This girl could leap 
the program forward years... 
decades into the future. 
How old is your 
son now, Major? 
Jason? 
He's coming up on ten now, 
if you can believe it. 
Eight years from fighting age. And how many of 
our sons and brothers 
did we just ship 
home in body bags? 
Maybe fifty, 
fifty-five thousand? 
And how many more 
on the other side? 
Never before... 
in all of human history... 
has there been a cause which 
could unite us as a species. 
Until now. 
You really hate, 
mutants, don't you? 
On the contrary, 
I rather admire them. 
The things they can do. 
I see mutants 
as our salvation. 
A common enemy. 
A common struggle 
against the ultimate enemy. 
Extinction. 
I believe our new friends... 
are going to help us 
Page 37/56
usher in a new era, Bill. 
A new era of genuine... 
and long-lasting peace. 
Attention, attention. 
Transport departure 
in two hours. 
Repeat. Transport 
departure in two hours. 
When was the last time 
you were down here? 
The last time we went 
looking for students. 
A lifetime ago. 
Welcome, Professor. 
Raven's wounded. 
She won't be moving fast. 
These are muscles 
I haven't stretched in a long time. Charles! 
Charles! 
Charles? It's all right. 
I'll go check the generator. 
It's not the 
machinery, is it? 
I can't do this. 
My mind... 
Yes, you can. 
It won't take it. 
You're just a little rusty. 
You don't understand. 
It's not a question of being rusty. I can flip the switches. 
I can turn the knobs. 
But my power comes from here. 
It comes from... 
And it's broken. 
I feel like one 
of my students. 
Helpless. 
It was a mistake 
coming down here. 
It was a mistake freeing Erik. This whole thing has been 
one bloody mistake. 
Page 38/56
I'm sorry, Logan, 
but they sent back the wrong man. You're right. 
I am. 
Actually, it was 
supposed to be you. 
But I was the only one who could physically make the trip. 
And, uh... 
And I don't know 
how long I've got here. 
But I do know that 
a long time ago... 
actually, a long 
time from now... 
I was your most 
helpless student. 
And you unlocked my mind. 
You showed me 
what I was. 
You showed me 
what I could be. 
I don't know how 
to do that for you. 
You're right. 
I don't. 
But I know 
someone who might. 
Hmm. 
Look into my mind. 
You saw what 
I did to Cerebro. 
You don't want me 
inside your head. 
There's no damage 
you can do... 
that hasn't already 
been done. Trust me. 
Come on. 
Hey. 
Hey, Logan. 
Hi, Jean. 
Kill me. 
I love you. 
Page 39/56
You poor, poor man. 
Look past me. 
No, I don't want 
your suffering. 
I don't want your future! 
Look past my future. 
Look for your future. 
That's it. 
That's it. 
That's it. 
Charles. 
Charles. 
So this is what 
becomes of us. 
Erik was right. 
Humanity does this to us. 
Not if we show 
them a better path. 
You still believe? 
Just because someone 
stumbles, loses their way... 
it doesn't mean 
they're lost forever. 
Sometimes we all need 
a little help. 
Oh, I'm not 
the man I was. 
I open my mind... 
and it almost 
overwhelms me. 
You're afraid, 
and Cerebro knows it. 
All those voices... 
so much pain. 
It's not their pain 
you're afraid of. 
It's yours, Charles. 
And as frightening 
as it may be... 
that pain will 
make you stronger. 
If you allow 
yourself to feel it... 
embrace it... 
Page 40/56
it will make you more powerful than you ever imagined. 
It's the greatest 
gift we have... 
to bear their pain 
without breaking. 
And it's born... 
from the most human power. 
Hope. 
Please, Charles... 
we need you to hope again. 
Find what you were looking for? The power's back on. 
Yes. 
Yes, it is. 
She's lost too much blood. 
She can't keep 
going like this. 
We have no 
choice, Bobby. 
We can wake him up. 
No! 
They need more time. 
I had... 
a glimpse into the past. 
If we wake Logan now... 
we may set our fate 
on an even darker course. 
They need more time. 
There is someone else. 
No, no one 
has Kitty's power. 
Someone that could 
take her power, 
take her place. 
She took yours once. 
Rogue. 
I'm sorry, Bobby, 
she must be dead. 
I haven't been able to make 
a connection 
with her for years. 
That's because 
they're keeping her 
Page 41/56
in the one place 
your mind can't reach 
from the outside. 
She's in Cerebro. 
She's in your house, 
Professor. 
They're experimenting on her. 
Trying to tap into her power, 
so they can take ours. 
Take all of ours. 
If you knew this, 
why didn't you go after her? 
We tried. 
It's too heavily guarded. 
I may know a few things 
about that house they don't. 
Kitty, I'm 
going to get help. 
I'm gonna bring back 
somebody to help you. 
Please, just bring 
yourself back. 
Raven, stop. 
Stop running. 
Charles? 
Where are you? 
Back at the house... 
where you should be. 
I need you to come home. 
I know what 
I need to do. 
If you kill Trask... 
you will be creating countless more just like him. 
Then I'll kill them, too. 
Those are Erik's words, 
not yours. 
Oh! 
The girl I grew up with 
wasn't capable of killing. 
She was good... 
fair, full of compassion. 
I have compassion. 
Just not for Trask. 
Page 42/56
He's murdered 
too many of us. 
Shut her down, Charles. 
Get in her head. 
She's not letting me in. 
I'm barely holding on. 
I'm not strong enough yet. 
I know what 
Trask has done... 
but killing him 
will not bring them back. 
It will set you 
on a path... 
from which 
there is no return. 
An endless cycle of killing. 
Us and them, 
until there is nothing left. 
But we can stop it, 
right now, you and I. 
You just have 
to come home. 
I have to? 
You haven't changed 
at all, Charles. 
Like I said... 
I know exactly 
what I have to do. 
You do? 
Then, wherever you go, 
I will find you. 
And, Raven, if you make me, 
I will stop you. 
Good luck, Charles. 
Where is she? 
She's in an airport, 
boarding a plane. 
She could be 
going anywhere. 
Get some 
rest, Charles. 
We'll track her in the 
morning and find out 
exactly where 
Page 43/56
she's going. 
...rockets did land 
outside the base, 
killing five civilians 
and wounding 12 others. 
Yeah? 
You know that those things 
can give you cancer? 
I've done some toxicology 
tests in the lab, and... 
You want something? 
Yeah, I'm... 
I know it's complicated, 
and there's probably 
all kinds of rules 
and reasons for what 
you can and can't say, 
but I was wondering 
if you could tell me 
in the future, 
do I make it? 
No. 
Oh. 
Okay. 
It's okay. Thanks. 
Hey, kid? 
It's just the world 
I came from. 
We're going 
backwards in time. 
Tomorrow, in front 
of the White House, 
the President will 
make his announcement. 
He will be joined by 
Secretary of Defense Laird... 
and has even 
sought the help 
of renowned scientist 
Bolivar Trask... 
his special advisor to 
combat this mutant issue. 
The White House has 
asked all three networks 
Page 44/56
to air the event live, 
as it is a 
matter of importance 
not only to the 
United States, 
but to every citizen 
from around the globe. 
There are no other details 
about the event... 
Raven... 
My God. 
I don't understand. 
What are you doing here? 
I, uh... 
I guess, 
I just realized 
I have nowhere else to go. 
I've gotta wake Charles... 
No, don't. 
Just wait. 
You really shouldn't 
walk on this. 
I've had worse. 
So, you've been living 
here all these years? 
Someone had to 
take care of Charles. 
You know, 
he's missed you. 
He misses who I was. 
I'm not who he wants 
me to be anymore. 
I've missed you. 
So, you're like this 
all the time now. 
Like what? 
This. 
No, not 
all the time. 
I take a shot 
in the morning, 
and I need another 
if I get worked up. 
Worked up? 
Page 45/56
Yeah, yeah, 
when I'm... 
...emotional 
or excited. 
Any animal urges. 
Hmm. 
Usually, I can 
fight them off. 
Well, maybe, 
we shouldn't have to fight off the things that 
come naturally to us. 
Do you remember one of 
the last things you said to me? That I would never be deemed beautiful, looking like this? 
Do you still think that? 
Maybe. You saw 
what happened in Paris. 
You know what 
they think of us. 
What do you think? 
I think you're beautiful. 
What about yourself? 
You should get some rest. 
I'm glad you're home. 
Hank? 
Do you remember the last 
thing I said to you? 
It was, "Mutant and proud." 
The old gas and water pipes 
lead straight to the house. 
The walls are made 
of reinforced steel. 
In other words, a door. 
You're walking 
directly over the hall now. 
I've been on that slab. 
Let me show you 
how it feels. 
Rogue, Rogue, 
come on. Wake up. 
Rogue. 
Come on, Rogue, wake up. 
Page 46/56
Wake up, it's me. 
No. 
Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, 
it's okay. He's with me. 
We're gonna 
get you out of here. 
Erik, Bobby. 
Get out of there! Now! 
Take her! 
Bobby! No! 
Bobby! 
Bobby! 
Professor! 
Get us out of here. 
Bobby. 
I know. 
I'm sorry, Charles. 
Where's Bobby? 
I'm sorry, Kitty. 
Hello, Logan. 
Rogue. 
Raven was here. 
I screwed up. 
Shit. 
We can't track her now. 
She's cut her ties. 
Hey, I saw in the 
news last night 
there's going to be an announcement in Washington this afternoon 
about a new 
protocol for mutants. 
I set the system 
I designed... 
to record any news about 
Paris over all three networks... and PBS. 
All three? Wow. 
Yeah, and PBS. 
Look what I found. 
Tomorrow, in front 
of the White House, 
the President will 
make his announcement. 
Page 47/56
He will be joined by Secretary of Defense Laird... 
and has even sought the help 
of renowned scientist 
Bolivar Trask... 
his special advisor 
to combat this mutant issue. 
The White House has asked... 
Raven doesn't realize... 
that if she kills Trask 
at an event like that... 
with the whole world watching... Then I came a 
long way for nothing. 
And there's more bad news. 
I saw in a report... 
they found traces 
of her blood in Paris. 
For all we know, 
they already have her DNA... 
which is all they'd need. 
To create the 
Sentinels of the future. 
There's a theory 
in quantum physics... 
that time is immutable. 
It's like a river. 
You can throw a pebble into it... and create a ripple, 
but the current always corrects itself. No matter what you do, the river just keeps flowing in the same direction. What are you trying to say? 
What I'm saying is... 
what if the war 
is inevitable? 
What if she's 
meant to kill Trask? 
What if this is just 
simply who she is? 
Just because someone stumbles, loses their way... 
doesn't mean 
they're lost forever. 
Page 48/56
No, I don't believe 
that theory, Hank. 
And I cannot believe 
that is who she is. 
Ready the plane. 
We're going to Washington. 
You all right? 
Getting there. 
Whatever happens today, 
I need you to promise me something. You've looked into my mind 
and seen a lot of bad... 
but you've seen 
the good, too. 
The X-Men. 
Promise me you'll find us. 
Use your power, 
bring us together. 
Guide us. Lead us. 
Storm. Scott. 
Jean. 
Remember those names. 
There are so many of us. 
We will need you, 
Professor. 
I'll do my best. 
Your best is enough. 
Trust me. 
There's 12 carriers 
inbound, 10 miles! 
They've found us. 
Thousands of people 
will be gathered here today. 
They've come from 
all over the world... 
to witness history, 
along with news crews... 
from at least 
50 different countries. 
Thank you. 
Can I see your 
invitations, please? 
Yes, you may. 
These two 
Page 49/56
are with me. 
Go ahead. 
Thank you. 
Logan! 
Please, this way, sir. 
Fourth infantry... 
Took a Bouncing Betty. 
What happened to you? 
Friendly fire. 
The worst kind. 
Yeah. 
I haven't found her yet, 
but she has to be here. 
The President 
of the United States. 
My fellow Americans... 
today we face the gravest 
threat in our history... 
mutants. 
We have prepared 
for this threat. 
In the immortal words 
of Robert Oppenheimer... 
"Behold. 
"The world will never be 
the same again." 
Can I help you? 
No, you can't. 
Here they come. 
This is for you, 
brothers and sisters. 
Raven? 
I have her. 
Let me go, Charles. 
There. You see? 
Secret Serviceman. 
Left of the stage. 
Got him. 
Go. 
What the hell 
are you doing? 
I didn't tell you 
to activate them. 
I didn't. 
Page 50/56
Raven, please, 
listen to me. 
We've been given a second 
chance to define who we are. 
Don't do this. 
Gentlemen, you cannot 
pass this point. 
We can't stop that many. 
No, but we can 
slow them down. 
Erik! 
Ah! 
Storm! 
Go, go, go! 
Watch your head! 
Go, go, go! 
Take us to DEFCON 3. 
Mr. President, 
we are Code Red. 
What's our air 
defense readiness? 
All our air 
defenses are ready one. 
What the hell 
happened out there? 
I will fix it. 
You said that before. 
I wanted to make a statement. 
Now the whole goddamn world 
knows we can't protect them. 
I will fix it. 
You damn well better. 
Charles! 
No, no, no... 
Is everybody okay? 
No! 
Behind you. 
Ah! 
Now! 
Do what you 
were made for. 
Where are you? 
Ah! 
I got this! Go! 
Page 51/56
Oh, dear God, no. 
So much for 
being a survivor. 
One of them is in here. 
No, no, no! 
Don't kill it! 
I need it alive. 
What the hell has happened? 
You built these 
weapons to destroy us. 
Why? 
Because you are 
afraid of our gifts. 
Because we are different. 
Humanity has always feared 
that which is different. 
Well, I am here 
to tell you... 
to tell the world... 
you are right to fear us. 
We are the future. 
We are the ones 
who will inherit this earth. 
And anyone who 
stands in our way... 
will suffer the same fate 
as these men... 
you see before you. 
Today was meant to be 
a display of your power. 
Instead I give you a glimpse... of the devastation my race 
can unleash upon yours. 
Let this be a warning 
to the world. 
And to my mutant 
brothers and sisters out there... I say this. 
No more hiding. 
No more suffering. 
You have lived 
in the shadows... 
in shame and fear for too long. Come out. 
Page 52/56
Join me. 
Fight together in 
a brotherhood of our kind. 
A new tomorrow... 
that starts today. 
All those years wasted... 
fighting each other, 
Charles. 
To have a precious 
few of them back... 
Mr. President, sir. 
Stand down. 
I said, stand down! 
You want to make a statement? 
Kill me. Fine. 
But spare everyone else. 
Very heroic, 
Mr. President... 
but you had no intention... 
of sparing any of us. 
The future of our 
species begins now. 
You used to be 
a better shot. 
Trust me, 
I still am. 
Get out of my head, 
Charles! 
Raven. 
Please, do not make us 
the enemy today. 
Look around you. 
We already are. 
Not all of us. 
All you've done so far... 
is save the lives 
of these men. 
You can show them 
a better path. 
Shut her down, Charles. 
I've been trying to control 
you ever since the day we met... and look where 
that's got us. 
Page 53/56
Everything that happens now... is in your hands. 
I have faith 
in you, Raven. 
He's all 
yours, Charles. 
If you let them have me, 
I'm as good as dead. 
You know that. 
I know. 
Goodbye, old friend. 
Goodbye, Erik. 
Are you sure you 
should let them go? 
Yes. 
I have hope for them. 
There's going to be a time, Hank, when we are all together. 
What about Logan? 
The first time 
Ever I saw your face 
I thought the sun... 
Buckminster Fuller is a great 
example of an architect... 
whose ideas were very similar 
to those of a utopian future. 
Good morning, Logan. 
Late start. 
Have a good lunch. 
Good job. 
Thank you. 
Very good job. 
Storm. 
Jean. 
Hey, Logan. 
Jean. 
Are you okay? 
You're here. 
Where else would I be? 
Whoa. 
Easy, pal. 
Well, some things 
never change. 
It's good to 
Page 54/56
see you, Scott. 
Uh-huh. 
See you 
later, Jean. 
Professor. 
Logan, is everything 
all right? 
Yeah. 
Yeah, I think it is. 
You did it. 
Did what? 
Logan, don't you have 
a class to teach? 
A class to teach? 
History. 
History? 
Actually, I could use 
some help with that. 
Help with what? 
Pretty much 
everything after 1973. 
I think the history 
I know is a little different. 
Welcome back. 
It's good to 
see you, Charles. 
It's good to see everyone. 
Well... 
I had a promise to keep. 
You and I have a lot of 
catching up to do. 
Yeah. 
What's the last thing 
you remember? 
Drowning. 
The past. 
A new... 
and uncertain world. 
A world of 
endless possibilities. 
And infinite outcomes. 
You kidding me? 
Oh, he's alive! 
Countless 
Page 55/56
choices define our fate. 
Each choice, each moment... 
a ripple in the river of time. What do you want us to do with him, Major Stryker? 
Enough ripples... 
and you change the tide. 
I'll take him from here. 
For the future 
is never truly set.
