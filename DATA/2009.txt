(ALVIN LAUGHING)
ALVIN: We're back!
(YOU REALLY GOT ME PLAYING)
(CROWD CLAPPING RHYTHMICALLY)
ALVIN: Let's go!
(FEMALE FANS SHOUTING)
(CHIPMUNKS SINGING
YOU REALLY GOT ME)
(MAN EXCLAIMS)
(SOLOING)
Nuts.
Give me the Black Beauty.
CROWD: (CHANTING)
Alvin! Alvin! Alvin!
Alvin, take it easy out there.
You gotta share the spotlight.
You got it, Dave.
Uh, Dave?
I'm serious, Alvin.
This is a charity benefit.
It's not all about you.
Sorry, Dave, I can't hear you
over the thousands of fans
screaming my name.
(CHANTING CONTINUES)
I'm back, Paris!
(GRUNTS)
Yeah! A little help, boys.
(EXCLAIMING)
Oh! Yeah!
Yeah, man!
(SOLOING)
Alvin, will you please
get down from there?
I can't hear you!
Alvin, I'm not kidding!
What?
Whoa, whoa!
Dave, look out!
Huh?
Alvin!
Dave!
(ALL GASPING)
Dave!
Dave?
This should
help with the pain.
I wanna talk to my boys.
I just gave you a sedative
that will take effect in
about one minute, so...
Well, let them in quickly.
Dave!
Dave, you're alive!
DAVE: Hey, guys! It was an accident, I swear.
Are you okay? I'm really sorry, Dave.
I'll be fine.
I'm just gonna be
stuck here for a while.
And until I get out,
I've made arrangements
for my Aunt Jackie
to come stay with you.
Who's Aunt Jackie?
The one who sends us
those metal buckets of
yummy popcorn for Christmas.
Oh, Popcorn Jackie.
You don't have much time,
monsieur Seville.
Uh, listen,
I want you guys to go home
and live a normal childhood.
(EXHALES)
(GROGGILY) I've even made
arrangements for you
to go to school.
CHIPMUNKS: School?
Yes, school.
Simon,
I'm putting you in charge.
You are?
(SLEEPILY) I'm
counting on you.
Dave, wait a minute.
Why is he in charge?
Whoa. He's counting on me.
Dave, please don't die.
He's just sleeping.
He's had a sedative.
Oh! A sedative.
Excuse me.
I'm here to escort
the Chipmunks home.
We're not leaving Dave.
I'm putting my paw
down on this one.
You come here!
Oops. Whoa!
I got it. I'll fix it.
Nope, made it worse.
Please. Please go.
Oh, this must be it. Uh-oh!
The more stress you put
on monsieur Seville,
the longer it will
take him to recover!
Whoa! Uh-uh!
You are too slow
for me, nurse.
DOCTOR: No! Don't...
You'll never take me!
I'm not going anywhere without...
(SINGING DAYDREAM BELIEVER)
(SNORING)
I hope for your
sake he stays asleep
for the entire flight.
Maybe we should
give him another shot,
just to be sure.
(GASPS) Ugh!
(SNIFFING)
Any ideas on how
we find Aunt Jackie?
Got it! Follow me.
Excuse me. Ooh, sorry. Whoo!
Excuse me. Coming through.
Look! Aunt Jackie!
Oh, yeah! Aunt Jackie!
ALVIN: Popcorn Jackie!
Oh, hello, dears!
SIMON: Cool wheelchair.
THEODORE: Yay, we found you!
Popcorn! Where's
Simon and Theodore's?
Oh, there's plenty
for everyone.
But let's have a hug first.
Oh!
Get over here,
you old teddy bear!
I'm not really
much of a hugger.
Oh, boys,
I want you to meet someone.
This is my grandson Toby.
Toby?
Hi! I'm Theodore.
Toby.
Huh? What?
What happened? What?
The boys.
Oh, hey.
Hi!
Hey! How are you?
I'm Toby.
Nice to meet you.
Toby's living with me
till he figures out
what he wants to
do with his life.
So far, that means going
"pyu, pyu-pyu-pyu-pyu"
with his thumbs all day.
Well, for the record,
going "pyu-pyu-pyu-pyu-pyu"
with my thumbs right now
is keeping me in first place.
So that's important.
Toby, get the bags.
What bags?
The luggage.
Get the luggage.
The... Oh, the... Right.
Yeah, let me get those.
Oh, sorry.
Toby?
SIMON: Hit the brakes!
Hit the brakes!
(EXCLAIMING)
ALVIN: Abandon wheelchair!
Toby!
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)
I'm fine. Don't worry.
(SHOUTING)
(CRASHING)
(ALL GROANING)
I'm so sorry, Aunt Jackie. I'm so sorry! Is she gonna be okay?
Don't worry about me. I'll be home in no time.
In you go. I wouldn't be so sure.
What? It was an accident. I swear.
Been there, done that. Several times.
I guess you'll be taking care of us now.
I'll take "Frightening Thoughts" for $500, please, Alex.
Not a problem. I can totally do this. I took care of my cat,
until he ran away. Well, "ran away" is kind of strong wording.
I think he just wanted his space.
I still see him around the neighborhood, you know.
He, like, hisses and claws at me,
but I think that's just his way of saying we're still tight. You know.
You guys have nothing to worry about, seriously,
'cause I'm not gonna be like Dave. You know, Dave's gone.
Gone?
Not gone. Not gone, guys. He's... He's not dead. He's very much alive.
He's completely coming back. I'm just gonna be in his room,
keeping his bed warm. I'm gonna be doing my thing,
you'll be doing your thing. You're not even gonna know I'm there.
Uh, we're supposed to know you're there.
That's, uh... That's the whole idea.
Yeah. Yeah! Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, you'll know that I'm there.
I'm just saying, I'm not gonna be, like, "I know everything"
and, "You do this, and you do that," like my dad.
All right! Let's do this.
(STARTS ENGINE)
Oh, boy.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
SIMON: Theodore,
we're gonna be just fine.
The important thing is
we're all still alive.
Well, maybe my get well card
will help Dave
get home faster.
Um... It needs
just a touch more glitter.
Yep, that should do it.
Who's hungry?
Ooh! Ooh!
Me, me! Me! Me!
Let's eat.
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
Simon?
It's a food ghost
town in here. Alvin?
Holla! The Cheese Balls
are in the hizzouse!
Well, you can tell
by the way I use my walk
I'm a Cheese Balls man
No time to talk
Whether you're a brother
or whether you're a mother
You gotta love Cheese Bias
Gotta love Cheese Balls
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Get in my belly
Cheese Balls, get in there
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Stayin' alive
Bingo!
Dinner, she's a-served.
THEODORE: Yay! All right!
Hey! What're you
doing in here?
Uh... Cheese Ball?
MAN ON PHONE: Dude,
let's go! Come on!
Tom-bo, hey, hey,
give me a second,
real quick.
Alvin, I really, really need
to focus right now
because I am
one knockout away
from a heavyweight title.
Ooh, can we play as well?
Uh... You know,
I don't wanna
hurt your feelings,
but I also don't wanna see
anybody get hurt,
and there are gonna be
fists of fury a-flying.
We can play Monopoly. We play Monopoly with Dave all the time.
Do you? That sounds fun, and we should do that sometime,
but right now I gotta get back to floating like a butterfly
and stinging like a bee. So...
Hey, Tom-bo,
you still there, buddy?
(GRUNTS) Who needs Toby,
Theodore? You got us!
Yeah, who needs Toby?
Boys, right this way.
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
(ALL LAUGHING)
(CHIPMUNKS SINGING
YOU SPIN ME ROUND)
(CHIPMUNKS HARMONIZING)
Whoa!
(ALL LAUGHING)
ALVIN: I'm gonna puke!
Do you know
what Dave would say
if he were here right now?
Alvin!
Alvin!
Not bad.
But I think it needs to come
more from the belly.
Alvin!
Alvin!
(ALL LAUGHING)
(PHONE RINGING)
Oh!
SIMON: Phone.
Get it together.
ALVIN: Yee-haw!
SIMON: Shh, shh, shh! Be cool.
Hello?
Yes?
DAVE: Boys, it's me.
(GASPING) Dave!
Dave? As in, "Dave"?
Well, I guess since you
answered the phone,
you haven't burned
down the house yet.
ALVIN: Have a little
faith, Dave.
Yeah. Mayday!
(CLATTERING)
What was that?
(WHISPERING)
Don't stress him out.
Uh, that was
Aunt Jackie. Yeah.
(CHUCKLES) She's making us
a zesty five-course meal.
Really?
Well, can I talk to her?
She's practicing
her pole dancing.
Pole dancing?
What happened
to making dinner?
Guys, what's going on?
Gotta go, Dave.
Alvin, I'm not kidding.
Feel better.
Alvin!
(PHONE BEEPS OFF)
Yep. Nobody does
that better than him.
(ALVIN AND SIMON SNORING)
(THEODORE WHIMPERING)
(EXCLAIMS)
(PANTING)
Toby? Toby, wake up.
(SNORTS) Huh?
Oh, sorry.
Huh? No, that's... That's okay. What is it?
I had a nightmare.
Oh, the nightmares. I hate the nightmares. What was it?
I dreamt we didn't have a family anymore.
Oh, Theodore. Theodore, that couldn't happen.
No, you guys are tight. Nothing could ever separate you.
Unless, like, an eagle swooped down from the sky and was like, caw-caw!
What? And grabbed you and...
(SPUTTERING)
(SHUDDERING)
Which... Which couldn't happen, ever. So why would you...
Why would you ever think that that would ever happen?
You know, 'cause the Eagles are in Philadelphia.
THEODORE: No! No!
Sweet dreams.
(ALARM CLOCK BUZZING)
ALVIN: Toby!
Toby, make it stop!
What are you doing?
There's something
wrong with the clock!
It won't shut up!
I can't sleep!
(YELLING)
(STUTTERING)
That's the point.
It's an alarm clock.
It helps you wake up
early in the morning.
Why would anyone
wanna wake up early?
Well, for school.
You gotta be there by 8:00.
In the morning?
Look, I don't like
getting up this early
any more than you do.
But we are in
this together, Alvin.
Sooner you get to school,
sooner I get to come home
and get back to sleep.
You mean, you don't stay with us at school?
No, no, no, no, no. No, I've done my time, thank you very much.
But school is fun, right?
(CHUCKLING) Fun? Well, I guess maybe it's fun-ish.
Hey, it's my cat! Hey, remember I was telling you? Hey!
Hey! Hey, kitty. It's me. Remember?
(HISSING)
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
(CAT YOWLING)
I treated you good.
(CAT SCREECHING)
Okay, here we go.
Enjoy your first day at school. See you around 3:00-ish.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
Okay.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
We got this. This'll be
a walk in the park.
ALVIN: A chaotic and frightening
walk in the park!
Hi, I'm Theodore.
Hi, I'm Theodore.
Hi, I'm Theodore.
ALVIN: Watch out!
SIMON: Look out!
Hi, I'm...
(ALL SCREAMING)
SIMON: Guys? Guys?
(ALL SCREAMING)
Oh, boy!
(GASPS) Eagle!
MASCOT: Go, Eagles!
Eagle!
MASCOT: Whoa!
(MASCOT EXCLAIMING)
(MASCOT SHOUTING)
(THUDDING)
(MASCOT GROANING IN PAIN)
(CRASHING)
That wasn't very fun-ish.
(CLEARING THROAT)
You must be our new students.
I'm Dr. Rubin, the principal.
And we're the Chipmunks.
Yes, well, that would explain
the fur and the bushy tails.
Follow me, gentlemen.
Gentlemen? Oh, us. Right.
There was a minute left
and we were down by two.
And I'm like,
"Coach, I don't care
if my leg's broken.
Put me in. I can win this."
I never get tired
of this story.
So I hobble out,
barely able to stand.
Did I mention my
leg was broken?
Miss Ortega.
Yes?
Good luck.
Thanks.
Hello, guys. Welcome to homeroom.
Good to be here.
I hope.
THEODORE: So this is a classroom.
(INHALING DEEPLY)
I love the smell of zit cream in the morning.
Hello, ladies.
Is that the Chipmunks?
The Chipmunks!
EMILY: We love you, Alvin!
(GIRLS GIGGLING)
Hi, I'm Theodore. Hi, I'm Theodore.
Yes, he's Theodore, in case you missed it. And I am Simon.
GIRL: Aw! The name's Seville. Alvin Seville.
(GREETS IN FRENCH)
Ah...
Somebody's gonna have to knock those guys down to size.
Well, that should be pretty easy. I mean, they're only 8 inches tall.
IAN: I had 15 cars.
I mean,
that's, like, five more cars
than anybody really needs.
I had seven maids.
I had courtside seats
to the Lakers.
Even my maids had
courtside seats
to the Lakers.
And now look at me.
Look at me!
MAN ON RADIO:
Alvin and the Chipmunks!
I lost everything.
Except for my dignity.
They can't take that
away from me.
(CHIPMUNKS SINGING
YOU REALLY GOT ME
ON RADIO)
And it's all because of them.
(EXCLAIMS)
Oh, hey. Breakfast.
Now I run around
hoping and praying
that I can find other animals
that can sing or dance.
I mean...
(SQUEAKING)
Wait a second.
You don't sing, do you?
Hey! Hey!
That's my muffin!
Give me my muffin,
you dirty rat!
I will get you, Chipmunks.
BRITTANY: Whoa!
Girls,
we gotta get out of here.
JEANETTE: I can't see.
ELEANOR: Ow! Not on my nose!
That's my tail!
Sorry.
BRITTANY: Move your butt!
Okay.
Who's squishing me?
(ALL GRUNTING)
We made it.
Jett Records.
Whoo!
Oh, my gosh.
It's him. Ian Hawke.
Uh, Mr. Hawke?
That voice. I can't
get it out of my head.
Hello? Mr. Hawke!
That's not in my head.
That's really happening.
What do you want?
We want to
introduce ourselves.
That's right.
I'm Brittany, and this
is my sister Eleanor.
Hello, sir.
Such a pleasure
to meet you.
And I'm their
sister Jeanette.
Although I feel more like an Olivia, or sometimes a...
Anyway, we're the Chipettes.
And, well, we would just be so honored to have you represent us.
You made Alvin and the Chipmunks stars. We wanna be stars, too.
Yeah. And hang out with the Chipmunks.
Okay, now, listen, before we get all girlie and giggly about this,
just tell me one thing. You can sing, right?
(ALL WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
No, no, wait. Hang on. Not here. Um...
Why don't we take this meeting upstairs in my penthouse office?
ELEANOR: Sure! This is so exciting.
We're really on our way now.
Oh, my gosh. Guys, can you believe it? My first penthouse office!
JEANETTE: Wow!
ELEANOR: Oh, boy!
Oh, my. The Hollywood sign.
Thought you might like the view.
So, ladies, tell me a little something about yourselves.
Well, we grew up in a small town, population 300, and--
Yeah? Really? That's fascinating. Great.
All right, impress me.
(CHIPETTES WHISPERING)
BRITTANY: One, two, three.
(SINGING PUT YOUR RECORD ON)
Girls, girls, girls, girls.
Guess who just became the number one Chipette fan in the whole dang world?
Ian Hawke, that's who.
ELEANOR: Yay! Nice!
BRITTANY: Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh!
So when can we meet the Chipmunks?
That's an excellent question. And the excellent answer is,
I don't really represent Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.
Oh, no! What happened?
Oh, classic tale.
Sweet and innocent when I met them, and they had nothing.
And then I work my butt off to make them rock stars,
and they changed.
Turned on me like bad cheese.
No! Oh, that's terrible.
I know! I mean, I treated Alvin like he was my own son, you know?
And then he just goes and spits on me.
Literally. He filled his chipmunk cheeks with saliva and just had at it.
And don't even get me started about Simon.
(GASPS) But not Theodore, right?
It's the cuddly ones you have to watch out for.
Oh. But what are we talkin' about them for?
Come on! They're over. Tired. Novelty act.
Chipmunks who can sing.
But girl chipmunks who can sing?
Fasten your seatbelts!
Yippee!
Yay!
So, I'm on Jay-Z's yacht,
right? And I say,
"Jay, where's Beyonce?"
And he says, "She's holding
a plate full of Cheese Balls.
Turn around."
And guess what?
She was!
(ALL LAUGHING)
P.S., Dave left me in charge.
Staying up till 10:00
every night. Oh, yeah!
Hey, girls,
look what I can do.
GIRLS: Aw!
You are Theodore-able.
THEODORE: Thank you.
You're so cute.
Oops! Oh!
I am so sorry.
It's cool. No harm done.
Not yet.
Girls? Please?
Private conference.
(GIRLS GROANING)
Thank you.
Listen up, rock stars.
If you talk to
those girls again,
you're dead.
If you look at
those girls again,
you're dead.
If you even think
about those girls...
Are you thinking about them?
Well, I am now!
That's it. You're dead!
Run!
RYAN: Xander! Come on!
Back here, you dirty rats!
Hang ten, bros!
ALVIN: Scatter!
RYAN: Go, go!
That way! Over there!
Oh, Ryan!
Hey, slowpokes!
Catch me if you can!
You're dead, fur ball.
Not!
(BOYS GRUNT IN PAIN)
It's wedgie time!
RYAN: Oh! My butt!
(ALVIN LAUGHING)
(BOTH GROANING)
(PANTING)
Oh, boy. Uh... Eagle.
(SCREAMING)
Eagle! Eagle!
RYAN: Get them!
Bully! Bully!
RYAN: This way! This way!
Gotcha!
SIMON: Guys, wait, wait.
Time out!
RYAN: It's swirlie time!
Come on, come on, guys.
This is so 1980s.
Please! Please!
(GURGLING)
Oh, man! Come on.
(LAUGHING) Oh!
That's a good look for you.
Oh, thank you.
(GASPING)
Can't swim. Help!
Grab on, Simon.
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(PANTING) Thanks.
(SPUTTERING)
You okay?
Well, considering that
you just saved me from
drowning in a toilet,
I'm pretty good.
I'll be right back.
Alvin! Alvin!
We're not going to solve
anything with violence.
RYAN: It's the fatty-ratty!
THEODORE: Cut it out!
RYAN: This rat has
serious junk in the trunk.
XANDER: Yeah, little fatty!
THEODORE: Stop it!
RYAN: He jiggles
when I poke him.
(CHIPMUNKS THRASHING)
RYAN: Mommy!
Simon, does this make
my butt look smaller?
Theodore,
your butt looks fine.
Those guys are just jerks.
(BOTH GASPING)
(GROWLING)
(BARKING)
Gentlemen.
You threatened to
climb inside of him
and build a nest.
That was out of line.
I'm not even sure
that's physically possible.
I should suspend
all three of you.
Please do.
(BOBBLEHEAD SQUEAKING)
Instead,
I have a better idea.
Due to budget cutbacks,
we are in jeopardy of losing
our beloved music program.
That's awful.
RUBIN: I know.
But there is one
small ray of hope.
Every year the district sponsors a music competition.
And the winner's school receives $25,000.
If we win,
we can save our program.
And you want us to perform?
'Cause I didn't think you were a fan.
Why don't you sleep on it?
Wait a minute! What is that? That's us! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. THEODORE: I look skinny.
Promise me that you won't say anything.
A principal has a certain image to uphold,
and if the faculty ever found out about this, I could...
I just cannot believe that you're actually sitting in my office.
I have all of your CDs. I even went to see you last year in Denver.
That's where I got this. It was my birthday.
And I was like, "Oh! The Chipmunks! Ah!"
So what do you say? Will you represent our school?
Honestly, suspension still sounds pretty good to me.
Come on, Alvin. What do you say?
One for all and three for one!
Well put, Theodore. Very well put.
Count us in.
(UNENTHUSIASTICALLY) Yay.
Go, Eagles!
(SCREECHES)
Eagles? Where?
IAN : Ah, the penthouse level.
Tres exclusivo.
(DOG WHIMPERING)
Isn't that that Chihuahua? You know, from the movie?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it... I mean, yeah, of course it is.
A lot of big names live here.
ELEANOR : Hola! Como esta?
BRITTANY : I must have his autograph.
IAN : Hey, hey, Brittany, uh-uh.
You wanna be a star? Act like a star.
All right? You don't get autographs, you give them.
Oh. Right.
Uh... Hey, look, over there! There're a couple of the Jonas Brothers.
(GASPS) Where? I don't see them.
IAN : Here we are! Okay!
Let's scoot in to my...
What? Did I... Oh, darn it! Darn it to heck!
ELEANOR : What's wrong?
IAN : Girls, I apologize,
but I seem to have left my keys back in my office.
What if one of you were to shoot through that mail slot
and open it up from the inside, huh?
ELEANOR : Oh, I'll do it.
(GRUNTING)
I'm stuck!
IAN : All right, I got you. I got you.
(IAN GRUNTING)
ELEANOR : Ow! Not so hard!
IAN : Might want to lay off the nuts.
ELEANOR : Oh.
IAN : All right, how about you, Glasses? You're in better shape. Wanna go?
I'm not that great at things like this.
I got it!
(DOOR UNLOCKING)
Yes!
Ooh! Impressive!
BRITTANY : Nice!
Gee willikers! Stripes!
Oh, snazzy!
Circles! This is the best tree house ever!
A red piano! Oh, Brit.
Is this a dream? Somebody pinch me.
This is way better than a tree.
I just adore a penthouse view.
Nice one, Hawke.
Yeah? You like it? BRITTANY : Do I?
I live here. It's so beautiful!
Yeah.
NARRATOR ON TV : Last time We visited Meerkat Manor,
a rival group called the Commandos
was making large inroads into the Whiskers' territory.
(SNIFFING)
Ah, Toby! I thought Alvin was messy.
This is literally disgusting. I feel like I'm living in a dumpster.
Simon, it's Meerkat Manor. Watch with me.
(SIGHS) You know, you're right. You're right. I just need to relax.
Maybe that'll ease my nerves a little.
(CRUNCHING)
What is this? What...
Oh, you've got to be joking. A taco? In a blanket? Toby!
TOBY: Ladies and gentlemen,
going for his turkey,
it's the Tobester.
(GRUNTS)
Come on, baby!
(LAUGHING) Yes!
Yes!
(EXCLAIMS)
No problem.
Watch and learn, my friends.
Oops. Well, it looks like it's time to play my second favorite game.
Hide the Broken TV from Dave. You wanna play?
No! Go easy on him, taco boy.
This day's been bad enough already.
Oh! I think I see what's going on.
You guys have been having some problems at school?
Uh, no. Not really. Unless you consider
getting your head dumped into a public toilet a problem.
(LAUGHING) Ouch! Swirlies are the worst.
At least that's what I've heard.
Because there's no way that I could possibly know that on a personal level.
Toby, what was school like for you?
Toby? Toby?
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
(GASPING)
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
Ow! Ow!
(EXCLAIMING)
(SCREAMS)
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
(GASPS)
THEODORE: Toby? Toby!
What?
What was school like for me? Uh, in a word, awesome.
But, you know, that's 'cause I was, like, extremely popular.
Is that why you still live with your grandma?
And refer to yourself as "the Tobester"?
And go "pyu-pyu-pyu" all day?
(CHUCKLING SARCASTICALLY) Bedtime!
(ALARM CLOCK BUZZING)
(SLEEPILY) Alvin?
Alvin, wake up and
turn off the alarm!
Alvin!
Alvin, I'm not kidding! I'm not kidding,
buddy. Turn it off!
Guys! Guys...
(BUZZING CONTINUES)
Boys, this isn't funny.
ALVIN: (MUFFLED) Hello. Humane Society? Yes. I need help.
A man is after us. He wants to take us to a terrible place.
School! TOBY : Out!
Aw, have a heart, huh? Have a heart?
Dave wants you to go to school, so you're going.
Yeah, well, don't worry about picking us up at 3:00, Toby.
We'll get a ride. In a hearse!
(CHUCKLING) Guys, guys, come on. Look, trust me.
The second day is never as bad as the first.
(CHIPMUNKS EXCLAIMING)
Glasses! Glasses! You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you?
BOY 1 : You're out, man! BOY 2 : Ha!
Right in the pancreas.
(PANTING)
(BOTH EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)
Call the nurse. COACH : Out! Out! You're out.
SIMON: Come on, Alvin! Remember your five D's!
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge!
COACH : Move! You're next, fur ball.
You talking to me? You talking to me?
I'm the only one here, so you must be talking to me.
(BOYS LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING) Yeah! Got him!
BOY : Did you see that?
Oh! Boo-yah!
Unbelievable. He caught it. You're out, man.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
And the fat lady, she's a-singing.
Dude's got hands. I think they're paws, actually.
Whatever. We can definitely use him on the team.
Hey, fur ball! How would you like a spot on the football team?
Football?
(SPEAKS FRENCH)
I gotta say, you're good. I'm gonna let you hang out with us at lunch.
That is, if you wanna be on the team.
Hmm. Interesting proposition.
SIMON : Alvin?
Let me get back to you on that.
This is a one-time offer. Don't take too long to think it over.
Right! Like I would ditch my brothers just to become the first chipmunk ever
to play on an actual varsity football team.
(LAUGHING) Fat chance!
ALVIN: The stadium is pandemonium!
It's fourth and goal. It's up! It's up!
And he catches it! The crowd goes crazy!
(IMITATING CROWD ROARING)
RYAN : Psst! Hey!
Me? ALVIN: Alvin! Alvin! Alvin! Alvin!
Alvin, I think the super-cool jock table is paging you.
Why would I go over there? Like I really need to worry about being popular.
Hello? Talking chipmunk? Huh? World-famous rock star?
Guy with his own plush doll? Guys, I'm on pajamas!
Not to toot my own horn, but...
(IMITATING HORN TOOTING)
Come on. It's laughable.
Just go, Alvin.
Really? You mean it?
Yeah. Thanks! I'll be right back!
What up, dudes? RYAN : What's up, little man?
XANDER : Welcome to the cool table. Yeah! Bring it.
BOY : Yeah! Pound the paw.
(ALVIN GRUNTING)
I want it! I got it! I got it! I...
Don't got it.
I think he's cute. Me, too.
Toss. And he's up!
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
Thank you. Hey, Alvin.
Call me.
Bernie, I'm telling you, the Chipmunks are old news.
I got the next big thing. Singing female chipmunks.
(PHONE LINE DISCONNECTS)
Hello? Bernie? Hello?
God! What part of "singing female chipmunks" don't these people...
Girls, we're going to school.
ALVIN : And he's up and he scores!
Hey! What up, S?
Whoa! Don't hate on the high-five.
(SARCASTICALLY) Yeah. High-five.
Look, Alvin, I know you guys have been busy
with your sporting endeavors and whatnot,
but I can really use your help at home.
Oh, no can do.
Ry-dawg is gonna teach me how to get pretty girls to do my homework.
(STAMMERING) Alvin, you promised Theodore we'd hang out.
We are watching Meerkat Manor tonight. No pretty girls.
Dude, I can't swing it today, bro.
That's what you say every day, Alvin.
Need I remind you it's your day to do the laundry?
You better listen to your daddy, Alvin. You don't wanna get grounded. Oh!
Are you going to pick that up?
Are you going to make me?
(SPEAKS FRENCH)
I'm just going to elegantly show you how it's done.
Uh, Simon...
Off the glass.
And you call yourself a jock.
(LAUGHING MOCKINGLY)
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
My brother, he's a real jokester. Always kidding.
Uh, anyhoo, um, see you guys in class.
Hey, that's my pudding. It's my pudding.
(LAUGHING)
Why are you trying to embarrass me in front of my friends?
Are you kidding me? They're the ones you should be embarrassed by.
Good luck with the show, guys.
Front row seats. Can't wait.
So? What song are we gonna sing?
No pressure, but the whole school is counting on us.
Oh, relax. It's like Ryan says,
who's gonna beat
singing chipmunks?
(I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT LOVE IS PLAYING)
(ALL SIGHING)
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
Oh, that Simon is dreamy!
I think Theodore was looking at me.
Yeah, I know. But, guys, remember what Ian said?
We can't trust them.
Whoa! Wow!
(SIMON GROWLING)
(PLAYING FOLLOW ME NOW)
(CHIPMUNKS SINGING)
Wow.
What happened?
I never thought I'd say this,
but pink is my
new favorite color.
Her glasses were
quite fetching.
She's like a beautiful
green gumdrop.
Okay, well,
if you guys wanna do this,
you have to pay attention.
Maybe this is a good time
for us to take a break.
Good call. Take five.
She's right.
We need to focus, fellas.
Right.
This is for my screensaver.
Cheese Balls!
Hey, you guys! Hey. You guys ready to go?
'Cause I got a lot of important stuff to do at home.
Oh, you must be their guardian.
That I... That I am. Yes, I am.
Hi, how are you? How are you, Dr. Rubin?
I know that because I went to school here a few years ago.
I don't know if you remember me. Toby Seville? Probably not.
Mmm. Uh...
Toby?
(STUTTERING)
No way! Hi! Hey, no braces.
(GASPING)
Your teeth look great.
(STAMMERING) You... I... Thank you. I appreciate...
I did. I did. I did get my braces off 'cause they were just...
(EXCLAIMING)
Oh! Okay. Oh...
(CYMBALS CLATTERING)
(IMITATING HORN TOOTING)
That... You know what, I know a guy who actually...
Who works on drum heads. So that's very good.
I'll be in the car, guys. So...
Somebody's in love.
That aside, we're going to replace everything. Chipmunk's honor.
Ah, yes, the old false-modesty suck-up routine.
Ian Hawke? I thought I smelled a rat.
May I help you, Mr. Hawke?
Well, I was wondering if I could help you.
I just heard about your musical competition,
and I just skedaddled down here as quick as I could to volunteer my girls.
Oh. Well, that's very thoughtful of you,
but I've already made up my mind.
Well, perhaps this will change your mind. Girls?
(ALL GASPING)
They're with Ian?

(BAND PLAYING HOT N COLD)
(SINGING HOT N COLD)
Wow! They're good!
Good? They're astounding!
(STUDENTS CHEERING)
My good people
of West Eastman,
you have just witnessed
the debut of the Chipettes.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
So?
They were splendid, but as I said before, I have made my decision.
Brit? No!
I see. You've made your decision.
I don't mean to speak out of school, Doctor,
but in the true spirit of democracy,
which our great, wonderful country was founded upon,
I say let the people vote. Let them choose!
One person, one vote. I say, let us vote!
STUDENTS: Let us vote!
Let us vote!
Let us vote!
Let us vote!
Please,
don't be a fascist granny.
Let freedom ring, Doctor.
STUDENTS: Let us vote!
Let us vote!
You make a persuasive case, Mr. Hawke.
All right, here's what I'm going to do.
This Friday, each group will perform one song in front of the student body.
Yes! All right!
Whoever gets the most applause will represent the school.
What?
Thank you! Yes!
We did it!
In your face!
Oh, it is on like Donkey Kong.
NARRATOR ON TV:
The meerkats Huddle together
at the end of a traumatic day

The Whiskers are gonna
Have to rely on each other

Guys, I am so happy that
Ms. Ortega can rehearse with
us every day after school.
Whoa! Every day?
But Ryan and I have...
Alvin,
stop right there, okay?
We're a team.
We need you.
Would you relax?
We're not gonna lose.
We'll talk about
this in the morning.
Not much to talk about.
I will see you at rehearsal.
Stop hogging.
I'm not hogging.
You might as well be
rooting out truffles in
the French countryside,
because you are,
in fact, HOGGING!
I'm not!
Are so!
Not! Am not! Not! Not!
So! So! So! So!
Ah, forget it!
I think I'll sleep
in my own bed tonight.
Ditto for me.
I'm so glad I'm
not a meerkat!
SIMON: Oh, really?
Why is that?
Because as cold as I am,
I would never
huddle with you!
Good!
You hear me?
I won't huddle!
Fine!
(WHIMPERS)
Uh, Toby?
Can I sleep with you?
What?
Dave lets me.
My brothers are fighting.
Well... I'm... Okay.

It's too late! It burns.

Mama, it burns!
(GASPING)
(WHIMPERING)
Hmm, let's see.
What else am I
in the mood for?
How about a side order
of friendly advice?
Courtesy of me.
No, thanks.
Grapes, please.
Ooh! Oh! Excuse me.
Oh! Um...
(LAUGHING) Yeah, well,
(STAMMERING)
I just wanted to
warn you about Ian.
What? You should
be grateful to Ian.
He did
everything for you, Alvin,
and you broke his heart.
Hmm. Really?
How do I put this gently?
He's the devil.
He doesn't have a heart.
Oh, and one of
the things he did for us
was put us in a cage.
Alvin,
he would never do that.
Yeah, 'cause you
were there. I forgot.
Brittany,
you'd better watch out.
I don't need advice from you.
But...
But nothing, Alvin.
Ian's taking us
straight to the top!
(SCREAMING)
(ALL LAUGHING)
Got it.
Straight to the top.
Ironic.
Yeah, funny.
(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY)
(CHIPETTES SINGING

We are so going
to destroy those Chipmunks.
I don't wanna
destroy them.
Me, neither.
I just wanna hang out with them.
All right, all right, all right. Hold... All right, look.
You know, if you feel that way,
maybe we should just withdraw from the contest.
What? Then I'll put you in a FedEx package
and mail you back to whatever tree you came from. Sound good?
No. Okay, then.
Take it from the top. Let's go!
(MUSIC RESUMES)
All right. Wait. Stop!
Short one in the green dress.
What's your name again? Eleanor.
Yeah, look, I'm losing you there, you know.
Have you always been that short?
I... I guess.
Well, you got to work on that. Okay?
All right, let me try something here.
Brittany. Here, come up here. BRITTANY: Uh...
No, you two stay back. Little further.
Oh, yeah. Now, that I like.
And it's not just because Brittany's
more of a mega, ultra superstar than you guys.
Good, good. Okay, you know what?
Let's get a little more separation.
Brittany, stay there. Let's get a little more separation from you guys.
Yeah, let's give her some room.
Give her some room, guys. Back.
Okay. All right, watch me now. One, two, three!

Toby?
What are you doing at the house? Where's Aunt Jackie?
Dave! Hey! Hey, Dave, what's happening?
(STUTTERING)
Aunt Jackie is, uh, in the hospital.
I'm a little worried. Who's watching the boys?
I am.
So, Dave, how is Paris?
Wait, are the boys behaving?
Absolutely. They've been just peachy.
Toby, what's going on?
Huh? Nothing. Nothing. No, don't even... Don't even worry about it.

JEREMY : I don't mean to interrupt your game,
but I saw you stand up to Ryan
when he littered. That took guts. Really?
And that's the type of guy that we're looking for.
Jeremy Smith, student body president.
How do you do? I'm...
International recording star and litter monitor Simon Seville.
Litter monitor?
Litter monitor. It's a new position that we've created
to help raise awareness of a pressing problem in our society.
I agree 99% plus 1. You do the math.
Well, Simon, I know this is a lot to ask,
but we're looking for a take-charge guy
to take charge of this very rewarding position.
What do you say?
SIMON : Excuse me, everybody. Quick announcement.
I'm Simon. I'm the litter monitor.
Put your trash in the garbage can. Peace out.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Hello, ladies! You probably weren't aware
that you dropped a wrapper on the ground,
so we're just gonna call this one a warning.
Carry on.
What up, dudes? What up, Al?
Hey, everybody! Check it out!
The newest member of the football team.
Suiting up for our first away game.
Ry, don't mess with me.
I talked to coach. You're in.
Dude! That's great! Awesome!
So check it out, A-man. We're watching the new litter monitor.
I wasn't aware the school even had a litter monitor.
We don't. But don't tell him that.
Are you going to pick that up? No.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
I guess I'm going to have to give you a citation.
Oh, no! I got a citation for littering! Oh, no!
You wanna play that game, do you? Well, guess what?
I can play that game all day long.
Simon! It's a joke, dude.
Litter is no joking matter.
No. You're the joke. We're messing with you.
There's no such thing as a litter monitor.
What? Good one, huh?
(CHUCKLES)
You knew about this, Alvin?
Does the word "brother" mean anything to you?
(STAMMERING) Yes. Of course.
Yeah, well, he has some new brothers now that he's on the football team.
(TEETH CLENCHED) You still haven't picked up that litter.
You want me to get rid of litter? Yeah.
Let's start with you. Hey, let... Let go. Let go!

for Theodore's sake.
I know. That's why I'm giving you the Alvin guarantee
that I will be at that sing-off Friday night.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why wouldn't you be there?
(STAMMERING) Because I have a...

Don't worry, Theo! Everything is going to be fine.
Alvin, do not miss that sing-off.
Don't worry, Simon. I'll be there.
I can do both.
Hey, guys, thanks so much for helping out today.
Toys for Tots is a really cool organization.
So, everybody's getting cool points today.

Jeanette and Eleanor?
Yeah, well,
they can sing backup.
I got them some stuff, too.
Oh!
Hey!
But we're her sisters.
And the three of us
sing together
or not at all.
Okay, fine.
All I really need
is the B-girl.
Ian, I won't do it
without them.
Okay. Fine, fine.
Let's move on to plan B.
Okay! Who likes barbecue?
Barbecue?
Because I know this awesome little
barbecue restaurant in the Valley
that makes the best roasted chipmunk.
(INHALES) Mmm, real tasty.
Unless, of course, you wanna sing.
Oh!
(BRITTANY SIGHS)
Welcome to West Eastman, and thank you
for supporting music in our schools.
Now, remember, the group you pick tonight
will win $25,000 for their school!
Now, we've got a lot of acts, and we Have to turn the Heat off at 9:30,
so without any further ado, representing Orange Grove,
put your Hands together for Li'l Rosero!
(ALL NIGHT DANCE CREW
PLAYING ON STEREO)
So, we meet again.
What? You want a piece of this, eagle?
(CHUCKLES)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Ian Hawke?
I'll take that.
Oh, I didn't realize
I pocket-dialed
1-800-LOWLIFE.
BRITTANY: (SOFTLY) Alvin?
Brittany?
Yeah, could you guys
fill in for us?
We're not gonna be able
to perform tonight.
What about
the music department?
The whole school
is counting on you.
I know. I know.
I should have listened
to you about Ian.
Don't tell me!
Yep. He locked us
in a cage.
What? This is the biggest you have?
I had my assistant call
and ask for the biggest limo.
This is not the biggest limo you have.
I'll go break the news to Dr. Rubin.
Brittany?
Alvin, don't move!
You got it!
Brittany, I'm coming to get you.
Simon, tell Jeanette how to pick the lock.
Roger that!
Oh, man. I need to get to the girls, fast!
Oh! I know how!
(WHOOPING)
(ALL NIGHT DANCE CREW
CONTINUES PLAYING)
Jeanette, focus.
The third number is notoriously the hardest to crack.
I'm assuming it's a prime number, but we can't assume...
Simon! The first two numbers were ones. I got to go with one.
(GASPS) It opened!
IAN: All right, girls.
Ian's coming.
Put the phone back. Hurry!
Get ready to be fabulous.
Oh, we're ready.
Yeah, you better be.
Because tonight's performance is going to put me back on top.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(ENGINE REVVING)
MAN: Next up,
please welcome Cherice!
(BAND PLAYING NO ONE)
(SINGING)
(SO WHAT PLAYING)
Driver-man,
take me to the arena.
VIP entrance.
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
How about a little
moon roof action?
Moon roofs are go!
Rooves? Moon roof.
Roofs? Rooves?
Ooh, champagne.
Don't mind if I do.
You know why
I don't mind if I do?
Because tonight,
we've got to toast
to a very special someone
named me.
They said
I couldn't do it.
They said I'd never
bounce back.
Guess what?
Time to kiss
my sweet... Ooh.
Oh, yeah.
A toast to the ladies
who're gonna
make the world
forget about the Chip...
What...
(GIGGLING) See you!
No. No, no, no! No!
What are you doing? Alvin!
Hi, Ian!
Good to see you!
You never write!
Oh...
No! Brittany... No!
ALVIN: Come on, girls!
I signed a contract!
Jump, Jeanette!
IAN: Wait!
Uh, I'm not
really good at...
BRITTANY: I got you.
IAN: I'm dead
if you don't perform!
Punch it, Alvin!
You got it!
No! Don't!
BRITTANY: Hey, Ian!
In the words of the Donald,
"You're fired!"
Alvin!
(CONTINUES SINGING NO ONE)
Hey! Hey. Hey, guys. Any sign of Alvin yet? Huh?
No. No Alvin, and no Chipettes.
Just Dr. Rubin and, you know, the entire school counting on us.
(STAMMERING) Well... Yeah, you know, don't worry.
Everything will work out-ish.
(CONTINUES SINGING)
BRITTANY: Faster, Alvin!
ALVIN: Don't worry.
I'm gonna get a little help from my friend Digger!
Roger that, Alvin! Look out!
Whoa! Feels like I'm back at the race track.
MAN: Hey! Careful!
IAN: Keep going! What are you doing?
Yeah.
Wait till I tell everybody back home I saved Alvin Seville.
I guess I owe you an apology about Ian.
Stick with me, Brit. I'll never steer you wrong.
(BRITTANY EXCLAIMING)
BRITTANY: Oh, yeah. I'll never doubt you again.
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)
I gotta say, he is definitely persistent.
We have got to lose him.
Hang on!
(CHIPETTES EXCLAIMING)
I've got a plan. Jump on the count of three. Three!
CHIPETTES: Whoa!
Oh! That's it.
JEANETTE: I'm not
really good with heights.
BRITTANY: Just
hang on tight, Jeanette.
Bring my girls right to me.
We need the remote.
Guys, I know what to do.
It's hats off to Ian.
Whoa!
ALVIN: The remote!
ELEANOR: I can't reach it!
I'm going for it.
Grab my ankles.
(EXCLAIMING)
I got it!
(GASPS) I got it.
ALVIN: Way to go, Jen!
BRITTANY: Nice work, Jeanette!
Good going, Jen!
Hey, Ian, you were wrong.
I don't need these!
Oops!
(GROANING)
JEANETTE: Ooh!
BRITTANY: Ouch!
My bad!
Adios, Ian!
And now for our
final act of the night.
Now, listen, we've had
a last-second change
to the line-up,
but we don't think
you're gonna be
too disappointed.
Representing West Eastman,
it's the Chipmunks!
We may have to
go out there, Theodore.
ALL: Chipmunks! Chipmunks!
Chipmunks! Chipmunks!
Chipmunks!
Well, if there are
no Chipmunks, we're gonna
have to move on. So now...
(ALL BOOING)
I don't wanna be
booed again.
I'm sorry.
We're gonna have to move on.
Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! I...
Um...
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
(STAMMERING)
I'm not a Chipmunk,
as you can see.
BOY 1: Play some music, you loser!
BOY 2: Play some music!
ALL: Yeah!
More music!
Play some music!
(STAMMERING) Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, I got a song.
I got a song, I got a song.
(SINGING) Ever since I met you
I wanted to be your guy
But as you've
probably noticed
I'm pathologically shy
And standing on
this stage right now
I think I'd rather die
So I'm just
gonna start by saying
Hi
Hi.
Now, that was huge.
(ALL CHEERING)
Thank you. Thank you.
No, really. Thank you.
What the...
The Chipettes
are in the building!
It's the Chipettes!
Alvin!

BRITTANY: Hello, West Eastman!
I'm putting her down!
Hang on!
THEODORE: Alvin!

high-five, brother.
High-five!
Oh... Oops.
Ladies and gentlemen,

it is my great pleasure...
This is such an honor.
For you or for us?

(ALL MURMURING)
One, two, three.
(SINGING SINGLE LADIES)

the Chipettes!
(ALL BOOING)
Come on, lady.
I know, I know.
All right, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I know, I'm sorry!
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
I'm going!
(CHIPMUNKS AND CHIPETTES
SINGING SHAKE YOUR
GROOVE THING)
Dave!
You're dancing!
You're moving
good, Dave!
Yeah!
Welcome home.
So, did you miss us?
Of course I missed you.
You're my boys.
SIMON: Cool!
And, Dave, just think
how much you'd miss us
if there were six of us.
Alvin, what did you say?
Well, the Chipettes
needed a place
to crash, right?
So, I said
that you said
they could stay
with us for as long
as they needed to.
Alvin!
Okay! This one's for Dave.
Everybody,
shake what your
mamma gave you!
(CHIPMUNKS AND CHIPETTES
CONTINUE SINGING)
(ALL CHEERING)
Look at you.
All ready for bed.
Looks like the Chipettes
are a good influence.
Thanks, Dave.
Thanks, Dave.
Thanks, Dave. (LAUGHS)
Okay, guys. Now lights out.
Good night, everybody.
Good night, Jeanette.
Good night, Simon.
Good night, Dave.
Good night, Alvin.
Alvin?
I'm not tired.
Sorry, but you've got
school tomorrow.
Not tired.
Alvin, come on.
It's time for bed.
Not tired.
Alvin?
Still not tired.
More awake. Tired.
Just kidding.
Much more awake.
Alvin, that's it.
Don't make me
come over there.
Okay.
Whoa!
(CRASHING)
Ooh, boy! I suddenly got
really, really tired.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Night, Dave.
DAVE: Alvin!
(CHIPMUNKS SINGING
YOU SPIN ME ROUND)
Good start, gentlemen.
Only 10 more rows
of bleachers to go.
Let's do it.
(ALL GROANING)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(BRING IT ON PLAYING)
All right, guys.
All right. All right.
All right,
I'm out. I'm out.
Oh, is this necessary?
Oh, come on.
Oh, is that necessary?
Is that...
At least let me go
back and get my purse.

Radio:... continuing with the investigation
into the cause of the Millenium Bridge disaster.


  
River traffic has been halted
as police divers search for survivors.


  
The surrounding area remains closed.


  
The mayor...


  
- Harry Potter. Who's Harry Potter?


  
- Umm, no one. Bit of a tosser, really.


  
Funny that paper of yours. Half an hour or so
ago I could've sworn I saw a picture move.


  
- Really?
- Of course,...


  
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.


  
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.


  
- You've been reckless this summer, Harry.
- I like riding the underground trains.


  
Takes my mind off things.


  
- Oh, unpleasant to behold, isnt't it?


  
The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself,
but now is not the time to tell it.


  
Take my arm.


  
Do as I say.


  
- I have just apparated, didn't I?
- Indeed.


  
Quite successfully, too, I might add.
Most people vomit the first time.


  
- Can't imagine, why.


  
- Welcome to the charming village
of Budleigh Babberton.


  
Harry, I assume, right about now, you must
be wondering, why I brought you here, am I right?


  
- Actually, Sir,... here,
so I just looked over it.


  
- Wands out, Harry.


  
Horace?


  
Horace?


  
- Merlin's beard.
No need to disfigure me, Albus.


  
- Well, I must say, you make a
very convincing arm chair, Horace.


  
- It's all in the upholstery.
I come by this stuffing naturally.


  
What gave me away?


  
- Dragon's blood.
- Oho!


  
- Oh yes, introductions.


  
Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend
and colleague of mine: Horace Slughorn.


  
Horace, well, you know who this is.


  
- Harry Potter.


  
So, what for all the theatrics, Horace?


  
You weren't by any chance waiting
for someone else, were you?


  
- Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.


  
Oh, all right. The death eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.


  
Do you know what that's like?


  
Can only say no to these people so many times,
so I never stay anywhere more than a week.


  
The muggles who own this place
are in the Canary islands.


  
- Well, I think we should put it
back in order for them, don't you?


  
Mind?


  
That was fun.


  
Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.


  
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.


  
The answer is still no.


  
Absolutely and unequivocally NO.


  
You're way like your father.


  
Except the eyes, of course, you have...
- My mother's eyes, yeah.


  
- Lilly. Lovely Lilly.
She was exceedingly bright, your mother.


  
Even more impressive when one
considers she was a muggle born.


  
- One of my best friends is muggle born.
She's the best in our year.


  
- Oh, please don't think
I'm prejudiced, no, no, no.


  
Your mother was one of my absolute favourites.
Look, there she is, right at the front.


  
All mine, each and every one.
Ex-students, I mean.


  
You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,
editor of the Daily Prophet.


  
Always takes my owls, should I wish
to register an opinion on the news of the day.


  
Gwenog Jones, captain of the Hollyhead Harpies.
Free tickets whenever I want them.


  
Of course I haven't been
to a match in some time.


  
Ah, yes, Regulus Black.


  
You no doubt know of his older
brother, Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.


  
I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius.
It's a shame, talented boy.


  
I got Regulus, when he came along
of course, but I do like the set.


  
- Horace? Do you mind if I take this?


  
I do love knitting patterns.


  
- Yes, of course, but
you're not leaving, are you?


  
- Oh, I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.


  
I would've considered it a great personal triumph
had you consented to return to Hogwarts. Oh, well.


  
You're like my friend Mr. Potter, here.
One of a kind. Well, bye-bye, Horace. Bye.


  
- All right, I'll do it.


  
But I want Professor Merrythought's
old office, not the water closet I had before.


  
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times, really, they're mad.


  
- They are indeed.


  
- Sir, exactly what was all that about?


  
- You're talented, famous and
powerful, everything Horace values.


  
Professor Slughorn is going
to try to collect you, Harry.


  
You would be his crowning jewel.
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.


  
And it's crucial he should return.


  
I fear I may have stolen a
wondrous night from you, Harry.


  
She was truthfully very pretty, the girl.


  
- It's all right, Sir. I'll go back
tomorrow, make some excuse.


  
- Oh, you'll not be returning to
Little Whinging tonight, Harry.


  
- But, Sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?


  
- Both are waiting for you.


  
- Hedwig!


  
- Mom!
- Ginny, what is it?


  
- I was only wondering when Harry got here?
- What? Harry? Harry who?


  
- Harry Potter, of course.


  
- I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?


  
- His trunk is in the kitchen and his owl.
- But, no dear, I seriously doubt that.


  
- Harry? Did someone say Harry?
- Me, nosey. Is he up there with you?


  
- Course not. I think I'd know if my best
friend was in my room, wouldn't I?


  
- Is that an owl I heard?


  
- You haven't seen him, have you?
Apparently he's wandering about the house.


  
- Really?
- Really.


  
- Harry!


  
- Harry!


  
- What a lovely surprise.


  
Why didn't you let us know you were coming?


  
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.


  
- Oh, that man. But then
what'd we do without him.


  
- Got a bit of tooth paste.


  
- So when did you get here?
- A few days ago.


  
Though for a while I wasn't
sure I was coming.


  
- Mom sort of lost it last week.


  
Said Ginny and I had no business going
back to Hogwarts. That it's too dangerous.


  
- Oh, come on.


  
- She's not alone. Even my parents and they're
muggles know something bad's happening.


  
- Anyway. Dad stepped in, told her she was being
balmy and it took a few days but she came out.


  
- This is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?


  
- There's been a lot of talk recently
that Dumbledore's got a bit old.


  
- Rubbish! Why he's only...
What is he?


  
- Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.


  
- Cissy, you can't do this,
he can't be trusted.


  
- The Dark Lord trusts him.


  
- The Dark Lord's mistaken.


  
- On our own, Wormtail.


  
- I... I know I ought not to be here.


  
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.


  
- If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak.
Put it down, Bella. We mustn's touch what isn't ours.


  
- As it so happens I'm aware
of your situation, Narcissa.


  
- You? The Dark Lord told you?


  
- Your sister doubts me.


  
Understandable. Over the years I played my part well, so well,
I have deceived one of the greatest wizards of all times.


  
Dumbledore is a great wizard,
only a fool would question it.


  
- I don't doubt you, Severus.


  
- You should be honest, Cissy.
As should Drako.


  
- He's just a boy.


  
- I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.


  
But it might be possible
for me to help Drako.


  
- Severus...
- Swear to it.


  
- Make the unbreakable vow.
It's just empty words.


  
He'll give it his best effort when it matters most.
He'll just slither back into his hole.


  
Coward.


  
- Take out your wand.


  
- Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Drako Malfoy,
as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes?


  
- I will.


  
- And will you, to the best of your
ability, protect him from harm?


  
- I will.


  
- And, if Drako should fail, will you yourself carry out the
deed the Dark Lord has ordered Drako to perform?


  
- I will.


  
- Step up, step up, we've got fainting fancies,
nosebleed nougat and just in time to school:...


  
- Puking pastils.


  
Into the cauldron, handsome.


  
...order. I will have order.


  
- Peruvian instant darkness powder.
- A real many spin to that one.


  
- Handy if you need to make a quick getaway.


  
- Hello, Ladies. Love potions, ey?


  
Yeah, they really do work.


  
Then again the way we heard is
you're doing just fine on your own.


  
- Meaning?


  
- Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?
- That's none of your business.


  
- How much for this?
- Five galleons.


  
- Come on, it's for me.
- Five galleons.


  
- I'm your brother.
- Ten galleons.


  
- Come on, let's go.


  
- Hi, Ron.
- Hi.


  
- How're Fred and George doing it?
Half the alley's closed down.


  
- I'd reckon people need a laugh these days.


  
- I reckon he's right.


  
- Oh, no. Everyone got their
wands from Olivander's.


  
- Harry.


  
Is it me or do Drako and mommy look like
two people who don't want to be followed?


  
- Quibbler.


  
Quibbler.


  
He's lovely. They've been
known to sing on boxing day, you know.


  
Quibbler?


  
- Oh, please.
What's a racksbird?


  
- Invisible creatures, they float in your
ears and make your brain go fuzzy.


  
- Quibbler.


  
- So, what was Drako doing with
that weird looking cabinet?


  
And who were all those people?


  
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony. An initiation.


  
- Stop it Harry. I know where
you're going with this.


  
- It happened. He's one of them.
- One of what?


  
- Harry is under the impression
Drako Malfoy is now a Death Eater.


  
- You're barking. What would you-know-who
want with the sort like Malfoy?


  
- Well, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes?
Browsing for furniture?


  
- It's a creepy shop, he's a creepy boy.


  
- Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.


  
Besides, Hermione saw it with her own eyes.


  
- I told you, I don't know what I saw.


  
- I need some air.


  
- What was that?
- I don't know.


  
- Relax, boys. It was probably just a flash...


  
Come on, Drako. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts, soon.


  
- Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school.


  
I think I'll pitch myself off the astronomy tower
at the thought I have to continue for another two years.


  
- What's that supposed to mean?


  
- It's just that I can't see myself
waisting time in charms class next year.


  
Amused, Gless?
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.


  
- You two go on. Wanna check something.


  
- Where's Harry?
- Probably already half up. Come on.


  
- Didn't mommy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?


  
PETRIFICUS TOTALUS!


  
Oh yeah. She was dead before you
could wipe the drawl off your chin.


  
That's for my father. And
you're going right back to London.


  
- Penihe.


  
Hello, Harry.


  
- Luna. How did you know where I was?
- Racksbirds. Your head's full of them.


  
- Sorry, I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna.
- That's all right. It was like being with a friend.


  
- Well, I am your friend, Luna.
- That's nice.


  
- Ah, about time. I've been looking all over
for you two. All right. Names?


  
- Professor Flitwick, you know me for five years.


  
- No exceptions, Potter.


  
- Who are those people?
- Aurors. For security.


  
- What's this cane here, then?
- It's not a cane, you... old...


  
- And what is that...


  
...be considered an offensive weapon?


  
- It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.


  
- Nice face, Potter.


  
- Would you like me to fix it for you?


  
Personally I think you look a bit more
devil-may-care this way, but it's up to you.


  
- Umm... Have you ever
fixed a nose before?


  
- No, but I've done several toes.
And how different are they, really?


  
- Umm, okay, yeah, give it a go.


  
- Episky.


  
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.


  
- Brilliant.


  
- Worried? He'll be here in a bit.


  
- Well, turn around you lunatic.


  
- Will you stop eating?
Your best friend is missing.


  
- He's covered in blood again.
Why is it he's always covered in blood?


  
- Looks like it's his own this time.


  
- Where have you been?
What happened to your face?


  
- Nothing. Blood.


  
- Sorry, her urge is to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.


  
- ???


  
- Very best of evenings to you.


  
First off, let me introduce the newest
member of our staff: Horace Slughorn.


  
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed
to assume his old post as potions master.


  
Meanwhile, the post of the defence against
the Dark Arts will be taken by Professor Snape.


  
As you know, each and everyone of you was
searched upon your arrival here tonight.


  
And you have the right to know why.


  
Once, there was a young man who, like you, sat in this
very hall, walked this castle's corridors, slept under its roof.


  
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.


  
His name:


  
Tom Riddle.


  
Today of course he's known
all over the world by another name.


  
Which is why, as I stand looking out upon
you tonight, I'm reminded of a sobering fact:


  
Every day, every hour, this very minute perhaps,
dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls.


  
But in the end their greatest weapon is you.


  
- That was cheerful.


  
- Straight magic is upstairs, ladies, not down.


  
Mr. Levis, that is the girl's lavatory.


  
Potter.


  
- Now this can't be good.


  
- Enjoying ourselves, are we?
- What, I have free period this morning, professor.


  
- So I noticed.


  
I would think you would want to fill it with potions.
Or is it no longer your ambition to become an auror?


  
- It was, but I was told I had to
get an "outstanding" in my O.W.L.


  
- So you did when professor
Snape was teaching potions.


  
However professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept
mute students with "exceeds expectations".


  
- Brilliant. Well, I'll head there straight away.
- Good, good.


  
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.


  
- I don't wanna take potions.
There's quidditch tryouts coming up, I need to practice.


  
- ... to detail in the preparation is the prerequisite of all...
Ah. Harry, old boy. I was beginning to worry.


  
We've got someone with us, I see.
- Ron Weasley, Sir.


  
I'm dead awful at potions, I'm menaced
actually, so I'll probably just go.


  
- Nonsense. We'll sort you out.


  
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.


  
Sorry, Sir, I haven't actually got my book yet. Nor does Ron.
- Not to worry, then, get you one from the cupboard.


  
Now, as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning.
Any ideas what these might be?


  
Yes, Miss...
- Granger, Sir.


  
That one there is Veritaserum. It's a truth telling serum.


  
And that one...


  
...terribly tricky to make. And this is Amortentia.
The most powerful love potion in the world.


  
It's rumoured to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.


  
For example I smell freshly mown grass and
new parchment and spearmint toothpaste.


  
- Now, amortentia doesn't create actual love, that'd be impossible,
but it does cause powerful infatuation or obsession.


  
And for that reason it is probably the
most dangerous potion in this room.


  
- Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one.


  
- Ah, yes. What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen,
is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis.


  
But it is more commonly referred to as...
- Liquid luck.


  
- Yes, Miss Granger.


  
Liquid luck.


  
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.


  
One sip and you'll find that
all of your endeavours succeed.


  
At least until the effects wear off.


  
So, this is what I offer each of you today.


  
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who, in the hour
that remains manages to brew an acceptable draft of Living Death.


  
Recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books.


  
You should not doubt however: Only once did a student manage
to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this price.


  
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.
Let the brewing commence.


  
- How did you do that?


  
- Crush it, don't cut it.


  
- No, the instructions specifically say to cut.
- Oh, really.


  
- Merlin's beard. It's perfect.


  
So perfect I dare say
one drop would kill us all.


  
Here we are, then, as promised.
One vial of Felix Felicis.


  
Congratulations. Use it well.


  
- Ah, Harry, you got my message. Come in.


  
How are you?
- Fine, Sir.


  
- Enjoying your classes?


  
I know professor Slughorn is most impressed with you.


  
- I think he overestimates my abilities, Sir.


  
- Do you?
- Definitely.


  
- What about your activities outside the class room?


  
- Sir?
- Well, I noticed you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger.


  
I can't help wondering if...
- Oh, no, no. I mean...


  
She's brilliant, and we're friends, but... no.
- Forgive me.


  
I was mainly being curious.


  
But enough chit chat.
You must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight.


  
The answer lies here.


  
What you're looking at are memories.
In this case pertaining to one individual: Voldemort.


  
Or as he was known then: Tom Riddle.


  
This vial contains the most particular memory of the day I first met him.


  
I'd like you to see it, if you would.


  
- I must admit to some confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.


  
In all the years Tom's been here he's never once had a family visitor.


  
There have been incidents with the other children.
Nasty things.


  
Tom, you have a visitor.


  
- How do you do, Tom?


  
- Don't!


  
You're a doctor, aren't you?
- No. I'm a professor.


  
- I don't believe you.
She wants me locked up.


  
I think I'm different.
- Well, perhaps they're right.


  
- I'm not mad.


  
- Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.
Hogwarts is a school.


  
A school of magic.


  
You can do things, can't you, Tom?


  
Things other children can't.


  
- I can make things move without touching them.


  
I can make animals do what I want without training them.


  
I can make bad things happen to people who're mean to me.


  
I can make them hurt if I want.


  
Who are you?
- Well, I'm like you Tom.


  
I'm different.


  
- Prove it.


  
- I think there's something in your
wardrobe trying to get out, Tom.


  
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom.


  
At Hogwarts you'll be taught not only
how to use magic but how to control it.


  
Do you understand me?


  
- I can speak to snakes, too.


  
They find me, whisper things.
Is that normal for someone like me?


  
- Did you know, Sir? Then?


  
- Did I know I just met the most dangerous
dark wizard of all times? No.


  
If I had, I...


  
Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle
grew close to one particular teacher.


  
Can you guess who that teacher might be?


  
- You didn't bring professor Slughorn back
simply to teach potions, did you, Sir?


  
- No, I did not.


  
You see, professor Slughorn posesses something
I desire very dearly.  But he will not give it up easily.


  
- You said professor Slughorn would try to collect me.


  
- I did.


  
- Do you want me to let him?


  
- Yes.


  
- Ahem. Okay, so this morning I'm going to be putting you
all through a few drills just to assess your strengths.


  
Quiet, please.


  
- SHUT IT!


  
- Thanks. All right.


  
Now then, remember, just because you made the team last
year does not guarantee you a spot this year, is that clear?


  
Good.


  
- No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?


  
- Hard feelings?


  
- Yeah, I'll be going for keeper as well, it's nothing personal.


  
- Really? It's ???, you've got more
of a beaters build, don't you think?


  
Keepers need to be quick, agile.


  
- I like my chances.


  
Say, you think you could introduce
me to your friend Granger?


  
Wouldn't mind getting on a first
name basis, know what I mean?


  
- Come on, Ron. Come on.


  
- Come on, Ron.


  
- Confundus.


  
- I have to admit, I thought I was going to miss that last one.


  
Hope Cormac is not taking it too hard.


  
He's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione, Cormac.


  
- He's vile.


  
- Have you ever heard of a spell Sectum Sempra?
- No, I haven't.


  
And if you had a shred of self respect you'd hand that book in.


  
- Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.


  
He's even better than you, Hermione.


  
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.


  
What?


  
- I'd like to know whose that book was. Let's have a look, shall we?
- No.


  
- Why not?


  
- The binding is fragile.


  
- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.


  
- Who's the Half Blood Prince?
- Who?


  
- That's what it says, right here.
This book is property of the Half Blood Prince.


  
- For weeks you carry about this book.


  
You practically sleep with it, and yet you have no
desire to find out who the Half Blood Prince is?


  
- I didn't say, I wasn't curious and I don't sleep with it.


  
- Well that's true. When I ??? go to bed,
anything you do is read that bloody book.


  
It's just like being with Hermione.


  
- Well, I was curious, so I went to...
- ... the library.


  
- And?


  
- And nothing.


  
I couldn't find a reference anywhere to a Half Blood Prince.


  
- There you go, that settles it then.


  
- ... hoping to find you in the three Broomsticks.


  
- Ah, no, emergency choir practice I'm afraid, Horace.


  
- Does anyone fancy a butter beer?


  
- ... Clagsby Hill, we had a... long, homemade norwegian style...


  
- No, sit beside me.


  
- 'kay.


  
- Something to drink?


  
- Um, three butter beers and some ginger wine, please.


  
- Oh, bloody hell.


  
Slick git.


  
- Honestly, Ron, they're only holding hands.


  
And snogging.


  
- I'd like to leave.
- What?


  
You can't be serious.


  
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?


  
- What if she looked at me and saw you snogging me,
would you expect her to get up and leave?


  
- Hey, my boy.
- Hello, Sir, wonderful to see you.


  
- And you, and you.
- So, what brings you here?


  
- Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.


  
I could have ??? with one Broomstick.


  
Oh, hands on deck, Granger.
Listen my boy:...


  
In the old days I used to throw together
the occasional supper party.


  
Select studenthood.
Would you be game?


  
- I'd consider it an honour, Sir.


  
- You'll be welcome, too, Granger.


  
- I'd be delighted, Sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.


  
Good to see you, Wallanby.


  
- What are you playing at?


  
- Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him.


  
- Get to know him?
- Downright.


  
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.


  
- Got... you've... a bit...


  
- Katie, you don't know what it could be.
- Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.


  
- Harry, did she mean what she was saying back
at the pub about me and her snogging?


  
As if.


  
- Wands out. I warned her not to touch it.


  
- Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.


  
Now, now, now, now...


  
Do not touch that except for the wrappers,
do you understand?


  
- You're sure, Katie did not have this in her
posession when she entered the Three Broomsticks?


  
- It's like I said. She left to go to the loo,
and when she came back she had the package.


  
She said it was important that she deliver it.


  
- Did she say to whom?


  
- To professor Dumbledore.


  
- Very well, thank you, Lianne, you may go.


  
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?


  
- Believe me, professor, I've been asking myself
the same question for six years.


  
- Oh, Severus.


  
What do you think?


  
- I think, Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.


  
- She was cursed, wasn't she?


  
I know Katie, off the quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly.


  
If she was delivering that to professor Dumbledore
she wasn't doing it knowingly.


  
- Yes, she was cursed.


  
- It was Malfoy.


  
- That is a very serious accusation, Potter.


  
- Indeed.


  
Your evidence?


  
- I just know.


  
- You just... know.


  
- Aren't you getting astonished with your gifts, Potter?
Gifts mere mortals can only dream of posessing.


  
How grand it must be to be the chosen one.


  
- I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.


  
- What do you suppose Dean sees in her, Ginny?


  
- What does she see in him?


  
- Dean? He's brilliant.


  
- You called him slick git not five hours ago.


  
- Yeah, well, he was running his hands all
over my sister, wasn't he?


  
Something snaps, you've got to hate him, you know.


  
On principle.


  
- I suppose.


  
- So, what is it he sees in her?


  
- I don't know.
She's smart. Funny.


  
Attractive.
- Attractive?


  
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?


  
You're saying Dean's dating my
sister because of her skin?


  
- Look, no, I mean, I'm just...
I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor.


  
- Hermione's got nice skin,
wouldn't you say, as skin goes, I mean.


  
- I've never really thought about it, but...
I suppose, yeah. Very nice.


  
I think I'll be going to sleep now.


  
- Right.


  
- So tell me Cormac, you see anything
of your uncle Tiberius these days?


  
- Yes, Sir. In fact I meant to go hunting with
him and the minister for magic over the holidays.


  
- Ah, well, be sure to give them both my best.


  
- What about your uncle, Belby? For those of you who don't know,
Marcuses uncle invented the wolfsbane potion.


  
Is he working on anything new?


  
- Don't know.
He and me dad don't get on.


  
Poor git says me dadses potions are rubbish.
His only potion worth anything is a stiff one at the end of the day.


  
- What about you, Miss Granger. What exactly does
your family do in the muggle world?


  
- My parents are dentists.


  
They attend to people's teeth.


  
- Fascinating.
And is that considered a dangerous profession?


  
- No.


  
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick, did
bite my father once. He needed ten stitches.


  
- Ah, Miss Weasley.
Come in, come in.


  
- Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.


  
- Sorry, I'm not usually late.


  
- No matter. Just in time for desert.
That is if Belby's left you any.


  
- What?
- Nothing.


  
- Good bye.
Bye-bye.


  
- Potter.


  
- I'm sorry, Sir, I was just
admiring your hour glass.


  
- Ah, yes, most intriguing object.


  
The sand runs in accordance with
the quality of the conversation.


  
If it is stimulating,
the sand runs slowly.


  
If it is not...
- I think I'll be going then.


  
- Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.


  
As for some of your class mates,
well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf.


  
- The shelf, Sir?


  
- Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.


  
But then again, you already
are someone, aren't you, Harry?


  
- Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, Sir?


  
You knew him, didn't you, Sir? Tom Riddle?
You were his teacher.


  
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.


  
- What was he like?


  
I'm sorry, Sir. Forgive me.
He killed my parents.


  
- Of course, it's only natural you should
want to know more.


  
But I'm afraid, I must disappoint you, Harry.


  
When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet, obedient,
brilliant boy committed to becoming a first rate wizard.


  
Not unlike others I've known.
Not unlike yourself, in fact.


  
If the monster existed,
it was buried deep within.


  
- Good luck today, Ron.


  
- We're counting on you, Ron.
I've two galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?


  
- So, how was it, then?


  
- How was what?


  
- Your dinner party?


  
- Pretty boring, actually.
Although I think Harry enjoyed desert.


  
Slughorn's having christmas, too, you know.
And we're meant to bring someone.


  
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug club, isn't he?


  
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?


  
- Good luck today, Ron.
I know you'll be brilliant.


  
- I'm resigning.
After today's match McLaggen can have my spot.


  
- Have it your way.
Juice?


  
- Hello, everyone.


  
You look dreadful, Ron.
Is that why you put something in his cup?


  
Is it a tonic?


  
- Liquid luck?


  
Don't drink it, Ron.


  
You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.


  
- Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.


  
- YES!


  
- Weasley! Weasley!
Weasley! Weasley!


  
- YEAH!


  
- Weasley! Weasley!
Weasley! Weasley!


  
- Weasley! Weasley!
Weasley! Weasley!


  
- You shouldn't have done it.


  
- I know.
I suppose I could have just used a confundus charm.


  
- That was different.
That was tryouts, this was an actual game.


  
You didn't put it in?


  
Ron only thought you did.


  
Charm spell.
Just practicing.


  
- They're really good.


  
- How does it feel, Harry?


  
When you see Dean with Ginny?


  
- How...? How...


  
- I know.


  
I see the way you look at her.


  
You're my best friend.


  
- Oops.
I think that we're mistaken.


  
- What's with the birds?


  
- Oppugno!


  
- It feels like this.


  
- I can't help her if she's got
knickers in a twist.


  
And what Lav and I have...
well, let's just say, there's no stopping it.


  
It's chemical.


  
Will it last?
Who knows.


  
Point is, I'm a free agent.


  
- He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.
I really couldn't care less.


  
Was I under the impression, he and I
would be attending Slughorns christmas party together?


  
Yes.


  
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.


  
- Have you?


  
- Yes. Why?


  
- Well I just thought seeing as neither of us can
go with who we'd really like to, we should go together.


  
As friends.


  
Why didn't I think of that?


  
Who are you going with?


  
- Umm, it's a surprise.
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry about.


  
You can't take anyone.


  
See that girl over there?


  
That's Romilda Vane.


  
Apparently she's trying to smuggle you a love potion.


  
- Really?


  
- Hey, she's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the chosen one.


  
- But I am the chosen one.


  
- Right. Sorry. Umm...
Getting... umm...


  
I'll ask someone I like.
Someone cool.


  
- I've never been to this part of the castle.
At least not while awake.


  
I sleepwalk, you see.
That's why I wear shoes to bed.


  
- Hommonia nectare passus.


  
- Hommonia nectare passus.


  
- Hommonia nectare passus.


  
- Drink?


  
- Neville.


  
- I didn't get into the Slug club.


  
It's okay, though.
He's got Belby handing out towels in the loo.


  
- I'm fine thanks.
- 'kay.


  
- Hermione. What are you doing?
What happened to you?


  
- I've just escaped. I mean...
Left Cormac under the mistle toe.


  
- Cormac?
That's who you invited?


  
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.


  
- Thank you very much.


  
He's got more tentacles than a straffola plant.


  
- Dragon tartar?
- No, I'm fine, thank you.


  
- Just as well.
They give one a horribly bad breath.


  
- On second thoughts...
might keep Cormac at bay.


  
God, here he comes.


  
- I think she just went to powder her nose.


  
- Slicker than a mynx, your friend.


  
Nice to work her mouth, too, isn't she?


  
Yeah, yeah, yeah...


  
What is this meat I'm having?


  
- Dragon balls.


  
- You've just bought yourself a month detention, McLaggen.
Not so quick, Potter.


  
- Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party.
My date...


  
- Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
Besides, I only wish to convey a message.


  
- A message?


  
- From professor Dumbledore. He asked me to give you his best
and he hopes you enjoy your holidays.


  
He's travelling and he won't return until term resumes.


  
- Travelling where?


  
- Aww, take your hands off me, filthy squibb.


  
- Professor Slughorn, Sir. I've just discovered this
boy lurking in an upstairs corridor.


  
He claims to have been invited to your party.
- Okay, okay, I was gate crashing.


  
Happy?
- I'll escort him out.


  
- Certainly, professor.


  
- All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.


  
- You had to ???, and you didn't.


  
What's it to you?


  
- A squat of attention.
I made the unbreakable vow.


  
- I don't need protection.
I was chosen for this.


  
Out of all of us. Me.


  
- You're afraid, Drako.


  
You'd hate to consider it, but it's obvious.
Let me assist you!


  
- No!


  
I was chosen.
This is my moment.


  
- The unbreakable vow.
You're sure that's what Snape said?


  
- Positive. Why?


  
- It's just you can't break an unbreakable vow.


  
- I... I... worked that thing out myself, funny enough.


  
- Can't understand.


  
Oh, bloody hell.


  
- I'll miss you.


  
- Lovely.


  
- All she wants to do is snogg me.
My lips are getting chapped blue.


  
- I'll take your word for it.


  
So what happens to you?
What happens if you break an unbreakable vow?


  
- You die.


  
- So Voldemort has chosen Drako Malfoy for a mission.


  
- I know it sounds bad.


  
- Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending
to offer Drako help, so he could find out what he was after?


  
- That's not what it sounded like.


  
- Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.


  
I mean to make an unbreakable vow...


  
- It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgement.


  
Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.


  
- Dumbledore can make mistakes, he said so himself.
- You're blinded by hatred!


  
- I'm not.
- Yes you are.


  
- People are disappearing, Harry, daily.
We can only place our trust in a handfull of people.


  
If we start fighting amongst ourselves we are doomed.


  
- Ginny?


  
- Open up, you.


  
Don't you trust me?


  
- It's good.


  
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.


  
- You'll have to forgive Remus.
It takes its toll, his condition.


  
- Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?


  
- We're being followed, all of us.
Most days, Molly doesn't leave the house.


  
It's not been easy.


  
- Did you get my owl?


  
- Yes, I did.


  
If Dumbledore's travelling, then that's news to the ministry,
but perhaps that's the way, Dumbledore wants it.


  
As for Drako Malfoy, I know a bit more.


  
- Go on.


  
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.


  
I think from what you described what you
and Ron saw at the end of the summer...


  
...the object, that Drako is so interested in, is a vanishing cabinet.


  
- A vanishing cabinet?


  
- They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power.


  
You can see the appeal.


  
Should the Death Eaters come knocking, one simply
had to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two.


  
Can transport you practically anywhere.


  
Tricky contraptions though, very temperamental.


  
- What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?


  
- Nothing.


  
- It's still there.


  
- It was delicious, Molly, really.


  
- Are you sure you won't stay?


  
- No, we should go.
The first night of the cycle is always the worst.


  
- Remus?


  
- Sweetheart?


  
- Has Ron gone to bed?


  
- Umm, not yet, no.


  
- Shoelace.


  
- Merry christmas, Harry.


  
- Merry christmas.


  
- Harry, NOOO!


  
Remus!


  
- Ginny!


  
- I killed Sirius Black.
I killed Sirius Black.


  
You coming to get me?


  
- Harry?


  
- Stupefy!


  
- HARRY!


  
- GINNY!


  
- Molly.


  
- If it's so easy for them to get to you,
you're bloody lucky you weren't killed.


  
You have to realize who you are, Harry.
- I know who I am, Hermione, all right.


  
I'm sorry.


  
- Of course I'll wear it.
- I'm sorry, Won-Won.


  
- Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.


  
- Sir, is it true professor
Merrythought is retiring?


  
- Tom, I couldn't tell you
if I knew, could I?


  
By the way, thank you for the pineapple,
you're quite right, it is my favourite.


  
But how did you know?


  
- Intuition.


  
- Good gracious, is it that time already? Off you go,
boys, or professor Dippet will have us all in detention.


  
Look sharp, Tom. Don't be caught
out of bed after hours.


  
Is something on your mind, Tom?


  
Yes, Sir.


  
See, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to.


  
The other professors, well, they're not like you.


  
They might misunderstand.


  
- Go on.


  
- I was in the library the other night,
in the restricted section.


  
And... I read something rather odd
about some piece of rare magic.


  
I thought, perhaps you could illuminate me.


  
It's called, as I understand it, Hobdudlb.


  
- I beg your pardon. I don't know anything
about such things and if I did I wouldn't tell you.


  
Now, get out of here at once. And don't let me
ever catch you ??? again!


  
- Confused?


  
I'd be surprised if you weren't.


  
- Why, I don't understand.
What happened?


  
- This is perhaps the most important memory I've collected.
It is also a lie.


  
This memory has been tampered with, by the same
person whose memory it is. Our old friend, professor Slughorn.


  
- But why would he tamper with his own memory?


  
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?


  
- Why indeed?


  
I asked you to get to know professor Slughorn and you have done so.


  
Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.


  
Any way you can.


  
- I don't know him that well, Sir.


  
- This memory is everything.
Without it we are blind.


  
Without it we leave the fate of our world to chance.


  
You have no choice.
You must not fail.


  
- I highly recommend you reacquaint yourself
with the chapter on antidotes.


  
I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class.
Right up you go.


  
Louise, don't forget your rat tail.


  
- Aha! If it isn't the prince of potions himself.


  
What do I owe this pleasure?


  
- Well, Sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.


  
- Ask away, dear boy, ask away.


  
- Well, you see, the other day I was in the library in the restricted section.


  
And I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic.


  
- Yes? What was this rare piece of magic?


  
Why, I don't know, I can't remember the name exactly.


  
But it just got me wondering. Are there some
kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us?


  
- I'm the potions master, Harry, I think your
question's better be posed to professor Snape.


  
- Yes, umm... He and I don't
exactly see eye to eye, Sir.


  
What I mean to say, is...
well, he's not like you.


  
He might misunderstand.


  
- Yes. There can be no light without the dark,
and so it is with magic.


  
Myself, I've always strived to live within the light.


  
I suggest you do the same.


  
- Is that what you told Tom Riddle, Sir,
when he came asking questions?


  
- Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he?


  
Didn't he?


  
- Yes?


  
Ah, it's you Potter.


  
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.


  
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
The moon.


  
- Divine.
Had ourselves a little late night snack, did we?


  
- It was on your bed, the box.
I thought I'd try one.


  
- Or twenty.


  
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.


  
- Honestly, you know, I reckoned
she was starting to annoy you.


  
- She could never annoy me.


  
I think I love her.


  
- Well, brilliant.


  
- Think she knows I exist?


  
- I bloody well hope so.
She's been snogging you for three months.


  
- Snogging? Who are you talking about?


  
- Who are you talking about?


  
- Romilda, of course.
Romilda Vane.


  
- Okay, very funny.


  
- Ow, what's that for?


  
It's no joke!


  
I'm in love with her.
- All right fine, you're in love with her.


  
Have you ever actually met her?


  
- No.
Could you introduce me?


  
- Come on, Ron.
We're going to introduce you to Romilda Vane.


  
- I'm sorry, Sir, I wouldn't bother you if it
weren't absolutely essential.


  
- Where's Romilda?


  
- What's the matter with Wembley?


  
- Very powerful love potion.


  
- Very well, better bring him in.


  
I would've thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.


  
- I thought this called for more practiced hands, Sir.


  
- Hello, darling.
What's your drink?


  
- Perhaps you're right.


  
- I'm sorry, by the way, professor, about
earlier today. Our misunderstanding.


  
- No, not at all. All water under the bridge, you know.


  
Correct?


  
- I expect you're tired a bit after all these years
full of questions about Voldemort.


  
- Don't use that name.


  
Here, old boy. Bottoms up.


  
- What's this?


  
- Tonic for the nerves.


  
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.


  
- Bloody strong one at that.


  
- I feel really bad.
- You'll need a pick-me-up, my boy.


  
Got butter beer, wine, guzzling oak-matured mead.


  
I had other intentions for this, but I think given the circumstances...


  
There, Potter.
To life!


  
- Ron!


  
Ron!


  
Professor, do something.


  
- I don't understand.


  
- Come on, Ron, breathe.


  
These girls, they're going to kill me.


  
- Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using the bezoar.


  
Must be very proud of your student, Horace.


  
- Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.


  
- I think we agree. Potter's actions were heroic.
The question is: Why were they necessary?


  
- Why indeed?


  
This appears to be a gift, Horace.
You don't remember who gave you this bottle?


  
By the way, posesses remarkably
subtle hints of licquorice and sherry...


  
...but not polluted with poison.


  
- Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself.


  
- To whom, I might ask?


  
- To you, headmaster.


  
- Where is he?
Where's my Won-Won?


  
Has he been asking for me?


  
What's she doing here?


  
- I might ask you the same question.


  
- I happen to be his girlfriend.


  
- I happen to be his... friend.


  
- Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.


  
I suppose you want to make up with him
now, that he's suddenly all interesting?


  
- He's been poisoned you daft dimbo.


  
And for the record, I've always
found him interesting.


  
- Ha. See? He senses my presence.


  
Don't worry, Won-won.
I'm here. I'm here.


  
- Her... my... nee.


  
Hermione.


  
Hermione.


  
- Oh, to be young and
to feel love's keen sting.


  
Oh, come on everybody.
Mr. Weasley is well tended.


  
- About time, don't you think?


  
- Thank you.


  
- Oh, shut up.


  
- Stop it, Ron.
You're making it snow.


  
- Tell me how I broke up with Lavender, again.


  
- Umm, well, she came to visit you in the hospital.


  
And you talked.


  
I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation.


  
- Don't get me wrong,
I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of hers.


  
She seems a bit put out.


  
- Yes, she does, doesn't she?


  
You say, you don't remember anything from that night?
Anything at all?


  
- There is something.


  
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?


  
- Boggled.


  
Harry, there's Katie.


  
Katie Bell.


  
- Katie.
How are you?


  
- I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.


  
I've been trying to remember, honestly.


  
But... I just can't.


  
- Katie?


  
- I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?


  
SECTUM SEMPRA!


  
- Vulnera cemento.
Vulnera cemento.


  
Vulnera cemento.


  
- You have to get rid of it. Today.


  
Take my hand.


  
- The room of requirement.


  
- We need to hide the Half Blood Prince's book,
where no one'll ever find it.


  
Including you.


  
- What was that?
- What was that?


  
- See? You never know what you'll find up here.


  
All right, close your eyes.
That way, you can't be tempted.


  
Close your eyes.


  
I can stay hidden up here, too, if you like.


  
- So, did you and Ginny do it, then?


  
- What?


  
- You know, hide the book.


  
- Oh, yeah.


  
- Ah, yes.


  
- Still no luck with Slughorn, then, I take it?


  
- Luck.
That's it.


  
All I need's a bit of luck.


  
- Well?
How do you feel?


  
- Excellent.


  
Really excellent.


  
- Remember, Slughorn usually eats early, takes
a walk and then returns to his office.


  
- Right.
I'm going down to Hagrid's.


  
- What?
No, Harry, you've got to try to speak to Slughorn.


  
We have a plan.


  
- I know, but, I've got a really
good feeling about Hagrid's.


  
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?


  
- No.
- No.


  
- Well, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Or Felix does.


  
Hi.


  
- Oh! Merlin's beard, Harry.


  
- Sorry, Sir. I should have announced myself.
Either spoke or coughed.


  
You probably feared I was professor Sprout.


  
- Yes, I did actually.
What makes you think that?


  
- Oh, well, just your general behaviour, Sir.
Sneaking around, jumping when you saw me.


  
Are those tentacular leaves, Sir?


  
They're very valuable, aren't they?


  
Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer.


  
Not that I'm familiar with any of those back
alley transactions, but one does hear rumours.


  
My own interests are purely
academic, of course.


  
- Personally, these plants always kind
of freaked me out.


  
- Exactly how did you get
out of the castle, Harry?


  
- Through the front door, Sir.


  
I'm off to Hagrid's, you see. He's a very
dear friend, and I just fancied paying him a visit.


  
So, if you don't mind, I will be going now.


  
- Harry!


  
- Sir?


  
- It's nearly nightfall.


  
Surely you realize I can't allow you to
go roaming the grounds by yourself?


  
- Well, then why don't you come along, Sir?


  
- Harry, I must insist you accompany
me back to the castle, immediately!


  
- That would be counterproductive, Sir.


  
- And what makes you say that?


  
- No idea.


  
- Horace.


  
- Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual acromantula?


  
- A dead one, I think, Sir.


  
- Good god.
Dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it?


  
- Kill it?
My oldest friend, he was.


  
- I'm so sorry,
I didn't...


  
- Oh, don't worry yourself.
You're not alone.


  
Seriously misunderstood
creatures, spiders are.


  
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.


  
- Not to mention the pincers.


  
- Yeah, I reckon that, too.


  
- Hagrid, the last thing I wish to be is indelicate,
but acromantula venom is uncommonly rare.


  
Would you allow me to extract a vial or two?
Purely for academic purposes, you understand?


  
- Well, that much isn't going to do him much good, now, is it?


  
- Yeah, my thoughts exactly.


  
I have an ampulle or two about my person
for just such occasions as this.


  
Old potion master's habit, you know?


  
- I wish you could have seen him in his prime.


  
Magnificent he was.
Just magnificent.


  
- Would you like me to say a few words?


  
- Yes.


  
- He had family, I trust?


  
- Oh, yeah.


  
- Farewell...
- Aragog.


  
- Farewell, Aragog, king of the arachnids.


  
Your body will decay,
but your spirit lingers on.


  
In your human friends and sons,
those about to stay.


  
- ... and if you rest, and did one
snout in two, which was sane.


  
- I had him from an egg, you know?


  
Tiny little thing, he was, when he hatched.


  
No bigger than a pekinese.
A pekinese, mind you.


  
- How sweet.
I once had a fish, Frances, was very dear to me.


  
One afternoon I came downstairs
and it vanished. Pouf.


  
- That's very odd, isn't it?


  
- Yes, isn't it?
But that's life, I suppose.


  
You go along and then
suddenly... pouf.


  
- Pouf.


  
- Pouf.


  
- It was a student, who gave me Frances.


  
One spring afternoon, I discovered a bowl on my desk.


  
Just a few inches of clear water in it.


  
And floating on the surface was a flower petal.


  
As I watched it sank.


  
Just before it reached the bottom,
it transformed...


  
...to a wee fish.


  
It was beautiful magic.


  
Wondrous to behold.


  
The flower petal had come from a lilly.


  
Your mother.


  
The day I came downstairs,
the day the bowl was empty...


  
...was the day your mother...


  
I know why you're here.


  
But I can't help you.


  
It would ruin me.


  
- Do you know, why I survived, professor?


  
The night I got this?


  
Because of her.


  
Because she sacrificed herself,
because she refused to step aside.


  
Because her love was more
powerful than Voldemort.


  
- Don't say his name.


  
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.


  
I'm going to tell you something.


  
Something, others have only guessed at.


  
It's true. I am the chosen one.


  
Only I can destroy him, but in order to do so, I need to
know, what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago...


  
...in your office and I need to
know what you told him.


  
Be brave, professor.


  
Be brave, like my mother.


  
Otherwise you disgrace her.


  
Otherwise she died for nothing.


  
Otherwise the bowl will remain empty.


  
Forever.


  
- Please, don't think badly of me, when you see it.


  
You've no idea what he was like even then.


  
- I was in the library the other night.


  
In the restricted section.


  
And, I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.


  
It's called, as I understand it,...


  
...a horcrux.


  
- I beg your pardon?


  
- Horcrux.


  
I came across the term while reading.


  
And I didn't fully understand it.


  
- I'm not sure what you're reading, Tom,
but this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.


  
- Which is...


  
...why I came to you.


  
- A horcrux is an object in which a person has
concealed a part of their soul.


  
- But I don't understand how that works, Sir.


  
- One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.


  
By doing so you are protected should you
be attacked and your body destroyed.


  
- Protected?


  
- The part of your soul which is hidden lives on.


  
In other words, you cannot die.


  
- And how does one split his soul, Sir?


  
- I think you already know the answer to that, Tom.


  
- Murder.


  
- Yes.


  
Killing rips the soul apart,
it is a violation against nature.


  
- Can you only split the soul once?
For instance, isn't seven...


  
- Seven?


  
Merlin's beard, Tom, isn't it
bad enough to consider killing one person?


  
To rip the soul into seven pieces...


  
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?


  
- Of course, Sir.


  
It'll be all this evening.


  
- Sir?


  
- This is beyond anything I imagined.


  
- Do you mean to say he succeeded, Sir?


  
In making a horcrux?


  
Oh yes, he succeeded all right.


  
And not just once.


  
- What are they, exactly?


  
- Could be anything.


  
Most commonplace of objects.


  
A ring, for example.


  
Or a book.


  
- Tom Riddle's diary.


  
- It's a horcrux, yes.


  
Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley
from the chamber of secrets you brought me this.


  
I knew then this was a different kind of magic.
Very dark, very powerful.


  
But until tonight I had no idea just how powerful.


  
- And the ring?


  
- Belonged to Voldemorts mother.
Difficult to find.


  
Even more difficult to destroy.


  
- But... if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each horcrux...


  
- One destroys Voldemort.


  
- How do you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they?


  
- True. But magic, especially dark magic...


  
...leaves traces.


  
- That's where you've been going, isn't there, Sir?


  
When you leave school?


  
- Yes.


  
And I've think perhaps I may have found another.


  
But this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone.


  
Once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry.


  
- Have you ever considered that you ask too much?
That you take too much for granted?


  
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind,
that I don't want to do this any more?


  
- Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.


  
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.


  
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.


  
Ah, Harry.


  
You need a shave, my friend.


  
You know, at times, I forget
how much you've grown.


  
At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard.


  
Forgive my morkishness, Harry.


  
I'm old now.


  
- You still look the same to me, Sir.


  
- Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.


  
A trait people never fail
to undervalue, I'm afraid.


  
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.


  
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.


  
But there's one condition:...


  
You must obey every command I give
you without question.


  
- Yes, Sir.


  
- You do understand what I'm saying:...


  
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.


  
Should I tell you to run, you run.


  
Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself,
you must do so.


  
Your word, Harry.


  
- My word.


  
- Take my arm.


  
- But, Sir, I thought you couldn't
apparate within Hogwarts?


  
- Well, being me has its privileges.


  
This is the place.


  
Oh, yes.


  
This place has known magic.


  
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage payment must be made.


  
Payment intended to weaken any intruder.


  
- You should have let me, Sir.


  
- No, Harry.
Your blood's much more precious than mine.


  
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover this hiding place.


  
He will put certain defences in position.


  
Careful.


  
There it is.


  
The only question is,
how do we get there?


  
If you would, Harry.


  
- Do you think the horcrux
is in there, Sir?


  
- Oh yes.


  
It has to be drunk.


  
All of it has to be drunk.


  
You remember the conditions on
which I brought you with me?


  
This potion might paralyze me.


  
Might make me forget, why I'm here.


  
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.


  
You are not to indulge these requests.


  
It's your job, Harry, to make sure,
I keep drinking this potion.


  
You'll maybe have to force it
down my throat.


  
Understood?


  
- Why can't I drink it, Sir?


  
- Because I am much older,
much cleverer and much less valuable.


  
To good health, Harry.


  
- Professor!


  
Professor!


  
Professor?


  
Can you hear me?


  
Professor?


  
You have to keep drinking,
like you said, remember?


  
It will stop, it will stop,
but only if you keep drinking.


  
- Don't... make me...
- I'm sorry, Sir.


  
- KILL ME!


  
It's my fault.


  
My... fault.


  
My fault.


  
- Just one more, Sir.


  
One more, I promised.


  
I promised I'll do what you say.


  
I promised.


  
Please!


  
- Harry.


  
Water.


  
Water.


  
- Water.


  
You did it, Sir.


  
Look.


  
- Harry.


  
Water.


  
- Aguamenti.


  
- Water.


  
- Lumos.


  
LUMOS MAXIMA.


  
STUPEFY!


  
SECTUM SEMPRA!


  
- Harry.


  
- INCARCERUS!


  
STUPEFY!


  
- HARRY!


  
Harry.


  
AGIT TEMPUS!


  
- Go to your houses.
No dawdling.


  
- We should get you to the hospital wing, Sir.


  
To Madam Pomfrey.


  
- No.


  
Severus.
Severus is whom I need.


  
Wake him.


  
Tell him what happened.


  
Speak to no one else.


  
Severus, Harry.


  
Hide yourself below, Harry.


  
Don't speak or be seen by anybody without my commission.


  
Whatever happens.
It's imperious you stay below.


  
Harry, do as I say.


  
Trust me.


  
Trust me.


  
Good evening, Drako.


  
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?


  
Who else is here?


  
I heard you talking.


  
- I often talk aloud to myself.


  
I find it extraordinarily useful.


  
Have you always been to yourself, Drako?


  
Drako, you are no assassin.


  
- How do you know what I am?


  
I've done things that would shock you.


  
- Oh, like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that they'd
then return to bear a cursed necklace to me?


  
Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison?


  
Forgive me, Drako.


  
I cannot help feeling these actions are so
weak that your heart can't really have been in.


  
- He cursed me.
I was chosen.


  
- I shall make it easy for you.


  
- Expelliarmus.


  
- Very good, very good.


  
You're not alone.


  
There are others.


  
How?


  
- The vanishing cabinet in the room of requirement.


  
I've been mending it.


  
- And I guess it has a sister.
Which one?


  
- Borgin and Burke's.
They form a passage.


  
- Ingenious.


  
Drako, years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.


  
Please let me help you.


  
- I don't want your help.


  
Don't you understand?


  
I have to do this.


  
I have to kill you...


  
...or he's going to kill me.


  
- Well.


  
Look what we have here.


  
Well done, Drako.


  
- Good evening, Bellatrix.


  
I think introductions are in order, don't you?


  
- I'd love to, Albus.


  
But I'm afraid we're on a bit of a tight schedule.


  
Do it!


  
- He doesn't have the stomach.


  
Just like his father.


  
Let me finish him in my own way.


  
- NO!


  
The Dark Lord has ??? to do it.


  
'Cause it's ???


  
Go on, Drako, NOOW!


  
- No.


  
- Severus.


  
Please.


  
- Avada kedavra.


  
- SNAPE!


  
He trusted you!


  
- Go on!


  
- Incarcerus!


  
FIGHT BACK!


  
YOU COWARD, FIGHT BACK!


  
- NO!
He belongs to the Dark Lord.


  
SECTUM SEMPRA!


  
- You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?


  
Yes, I'm the Half Blood Prince.


  
- Potter.


  
In light of what has happened,
if you should have the need to talk to someone...


  
You should know, professor Dumbledore...


  
You meant a great deal to him.


  
- Do you think he would have done it?
Drako?


  
- No.


  
No, he was lowering his wand.


  
In the end it was Snape.


  
It was always Snape.


  
Can't do nothing.


  
It's fake.


  
Open it.


  
- To the Dark Lord.


  
I know I will be dead long before you read this,
but I want you to know it was I who discovered your secret.


  
I have stolen the real horcrux and I intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.


  
I face death in the hope that, when you meet your match,
you will be mortal once more.


  
R.A.B.


  
R.A.B.?


  
- Don't know.


  
But whoever they are,
they have the real horcrux.


  
Which means, it was all a waste.


  
All of it.


  
- Ron's okay with you, you know?


  
You and Ginny.


  
If I were you when he's around
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.


  
- I'm not coming back, Hermione.


  
I've got to finish whatever Dumbledore started, and...


  
...I don't know where that'll lead me...


  
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am, when I can.


  
- I've always admired your courage, Harry.


  
But sometimes you can be really thick.


  
You don't really think you're going to be able to find all
those horcruxes by yourself, do you?


  
You need us, Harry.


  
- I never realized how beautiful this place was.

Head cocked to the left. 


  
Partial deafness in ear. 


  
First point of attack. 


  
Two. Throat. Paralyse
vocal cords. Stop screaming. 


  
Three. Got to be heavy drinker. 
Floating rib to the liver.


  
Four. Finally, drag the 
left leg. Fist the patella.


  
Summary prognosis: 
Conscious in 90 seconds


  
Martial efficacy: quarter 
of an hour at best.


  
Full faculty of recovery, unlikely.


  
- I like the hat. 
- I just picked it up. 


  
You remember your revolver? 


  
Oh, knew I'd forgotten something. 


  
- I thought I'd left the stove on. 
- You did. 


  
I think that's quite enough. 


  
You're a doctor, after all. 


  
Always nice to see you, 
Watson. 


  
Where is the inspector? 


  
He's getting his troops lined up. 


  
That could be all day. 


  
Sherlock Holmes. 


  
And his loyal dog. 


  
Tell me, doctor 


  
As a medical man, have 
you enjoyed my work? 


  
Let me show you
how much I've enjoyed it. 


  
Watson! Don't! 


  
Observe. 


  
How did you see that? 


  
Because I was looking for it. 


  
Lord Blackwood! 


  
You seem surprised. 


  
I'd say that the girl deserves 
our attention more than he. 


  
Indeed. 


  
Oh, I'd leave that alone
if I were you, boyo. 


  
Good lad. 


  
Impeccable timing, 
Lestrade. 


  
We've one for the doctor, 
and one for the rope. 


  
- Clarky? 
- Sir. 


  
This woman needs 
a hospital immediately. 


  
- Put her in the back of the maria. 
- Right lads, that's it. 


  
Come on.


  
If you don't mind. 


  
Get him out of my sight. 


  
And you were supposed
to wait for my orders. 


  
If I had, you'd be 
clearing up a corpse.


  
and chasing a rumor. 


  
Besides, the girl's parents 
hired me, not the Yard. 


  
Why they thought you'd require 
any assistance is beyond me? 


  
- Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.
- Indeed. 


  
- Congratulations, Lestrade. 
- Bravo, Inspector. 


  
Have a cigar. 


  
Gentlemen... 


  
Cheese! 


  
 


  




  
156 over 80. 


  
Very good. 


  
Me nerves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.


  
Oh, tell me something: 


  
Your new premises...
when you moving in? 


  
I should be in
within the week. 


  
Cavendish Place. 


  
And there will be a 
women's touch too. 


  
- Oh, well that's marvellous.
- Indeed. 


  
Good god! 


  
- That was gunfire! 
- No, no, no, no. 


  
Hammer on nail, wasn't it? 


  
My colleagues, probably just... 
putting up a painting. 


  
I'll go and check. 


  
- Your colleague? 
- Yes 


  
He wont be moving 
with you, will he? 


  
No, he wont. 


  
Mrs. Hudson... 


  
I wont go in there by myself. 
Not while he's got a gun in his hand!


  
You don't need to go in there
at all. Give me the paper. 


  
What will I do when 
you leave, Doctor? 


  
He'll have the whole house down! 


  
He just needs 
another case, that's all. 


  
Couldn't you have 
a longer engagement? 


  
I smell gunpowder. This is not right you know!
Not in a domestic environment. 


  
Thank you, Captain Phillip. 


  
Perhaps a nice 
cup of tea... 


  
Same time next week. 


  
Come on, Captain. 
It's quieter downstairs. 


  
Mrs. Hudson?  Bring 
something to cheer him up. 


  
Permission to enter the armoury.


  
Granted. 


  
Watson, I am in the process 
of inventing a device 


  
that suppresses the 
sound of a gunshot. 


  
It's not working. 


  
- Oh. 
- Can I see that? 


  
You know it's been three 
months, since your last case? 


  
Gently. Gently, Watson. 
Be gentle with me. 


  
Don't you think it's time 
you found another one. 


  
I can't but, agree. 


  
My mind is in a terrible condition,
give me problems, give me work. 


  
The sooner the better. 


  
- Paper. 
- Thank you. 


  
Let's see then. 
There's a letter here, 


  
from...


  
Mrs. Ramsay, of Queenspark. 


  
Her husband's disappeared. 


  
He's in Belgium, with the scullery maid. 


  
Is it November? 


  
Yes, Holmes. 
What?


  
Lady Rathford reports... 


  
her emerald bracelet 
has disappeared. 


  
An insurance swindle. 


  
Lord Rathford likes fast 
women and slow ponies. 


  
I see you're the attending 
physician, at Blackwood's hanging.


  
Yes.


  
It was our last case together


  
and I wanted to see it 
through to the end.


  
A Mr. Louis... 


  
There's only one case, that 
intrigues me at present. 


  
The Curious Case of Mrs. Hudson 


  
The absentee landlady. 


  
I've been studying her 
comings and goings


  
- and they appear most... sinister. 
- Tea, Mr. Holmes? 


  
Is it poisoned, "Nanny"? 


  
There's enough of 
that in you already.


  
Don't touch. Everything 
is in it's proper place. 


  
As per usual, "Nanny". 


  
Oh, his killed the dog... again. 


  
What have you done 
to, Gladstone now? 


  
I was simply testing 
a new anaesthetic. 


  
He doesn't mind. 


  
Holmes,


  
as your doctor... 


  
He'll be straight as 
a trivet in no time.


  
As your friend... 


  
You've been in this room for two weeks. 
I insist, you have to get out. 


  
There's nothing of interest, 
for me, out there on Earth. At all.


  
- So, you're free this evening? 
- Absolutely. 


  
- Dinner? 
- Wonderful. 


  
- The Royal? 
- My favourite. 


  
Mary's coming. 


  
- Not available.
- You're meeting her, Holmes! 


  
Have you proposed yet? 


  
No, I haven't found the right ring. 


  
Well, then it's not official. 


  
It's happening, whether 
you like it or not.


  
8:30, the Royal. 


  
- Where a jacket. 
- You wear a jacket. 


  
- Holmes! 
- Hmm.


  
You're early. 


  
Fashionably. 


  
Miss Mary Morsten. 


  
Oh my goodness. What a pleasure. 


  
For the life of me, I don't know why it's 
taken him so long to introduce us properly.


  
The pleasure is mine. 


  
It really is quite a thrill to
meet you, Mr. Holmes. 


  
I've heard so much about you. 


  
I have a pile of detective 
novels at home... Collins, Poe.


  
It's true. 


  
It can seem a little


  
far fetched though, at times. Making these 
grand assumptions out of tiny details.


  
That's not quite right is it?


  
In fact, the little details are 
by far, the most important. 


  
- Take Watson... 
- I intend to. 


  
See his walking stick over 
there? African snake wood.


  
Hiding a blade of 
high tensile steel. 


  
Few were rewarded to the 
veterans of the Afghan war, 


  
so I can assume, he's 
a decorated soldier. 


  
Strong, brave, born 
to be an adventurer. 


  
and neat, like 
all military men.


  
Now, I check his pockets. 


  
Ah, a stamp from a boxing match. 


  
Now, I can infer that 
he's a bit of a gambler.


  
I'd keep an eye on 
that dowry, if I were you. 


  
- Those days are behind me. 
- Right, behind you. 


  
It's cost us the rent, 
more than once. 


  
Well with all due respect, Mr. Holmes, 
You know John very well. 


  
What about a complete stranger? 


  
What can you tell about me? 


  
- You? 
- I don't think that's... 


  
- I don't know that, that's... 
- Not at dinner. 


  
- Perhaps another time. 
- I insist. 


  
- You insist? 
- You remember we discussed this. 


  
The lady insists 


  
- You're a governess. 
- Well done. 


  
Yes, well done. Shall we... Waiter! 


  
Your student... 
It's a boy of eight.


  
Charlie is seven, actually. 


  
And he's tall for his age. 
He flicked you with ink today. 


  
- Is there ink on my face? 
- There is nothing wrong with your face. 


  
There are two drops 
on your ear in fact. 


  
India blue is nearly
impossible to wash off. 


  
Anyway, very
impetuous act of that boy, 


  
but you're too experienced 
to react rashly, which is why


  
the lady for whom you work 
lent you that necklace.


  
Pearls, diamonds, flawless rubies. 


  
Hardly the gems of a governess .


  
However, the jewels you 
are not wearing, tell us rather more.


  
- Holmes! 
- You were engaged. 


  
The ring has gone, but the lightness of
the skin where it once sat suggests


  
that you spent some time 
abroad, wearing it proudly


  
that is, until you were informed
of its true and rather modest worth


  
and then you broke of the engagement 
and returned to, England 


  
for better prospects. 
A doctor perhaps? 


  
You're right on all counts
Mr. Holmes, apart from one. 


  
I didn't leave him. 


  
He died. 


  
Well done, old boy. 


  
Get up and fight! 


  
Come on! 


  
Come on! 


  
That's it, big man... We're done. 


  
You won. Congratulations. 


  
Oi, we ain't done yet. 


  
This mustn't register
on an emotional level. 


  
First, distract target. 


  
Then block his blind jab. 


  
Counter with cross 
to the left cheek. 


  
Discombobulate. 


  
Dazed, he'll attempt a wild 
hay maker. employ the elbow block. 


  
And body shot. 


  
block thorough left. 


  
weaken right jaw. 


  
Now fracture. 


  
Break cracked ribs. 


  
Traumatize, solar plexus. 


  
Dislocate jaw entirely. 


  
Heel kick to diaphragm. 


  
In summary:


  
jaw fractured, three 
ribs cracked four broken,


  
diaphragm haemorrhaging. 


  
Physical recovery: 6 weeks. 


  
Full psychological 
recovery: 6 months.


  
Capacity to spit at back of head...


  
Neutralized. 


  
Where did that come from? 


  
What the hell's going on here, Charley? 


  
Lord Blackwood's put him 
on some kind of spell, sir. 


  
It's like he's burning 
from the inside out! 


  
Shut up! 


  
Charley. Charley! 


  
Take this man to the infirmary! 
Now! 


  
What's this all about then, Blackwood? 


  
There's someone I want to see. 


  
- Watson? 
- Right. 


  
Let's go. 


  
What started merely 
as an experiment


  
has brought me to the 
threshold of monumental discovery


  
Now if I play, chromatic scale


  
there's no measurable response. 


  
You do know, what you're 
drinking is meant for eye surgery. 


  
But... now, 


  
and this is remarkable 


  
if I change to 
atonal clusters.


  
Voila!


  
They fly in counter-clockwise, 


  
synchronized concentric circles. 


  
As though a regimented flock.


  
Watson this is exceptional. 


  
I, using musical theory, 
have created order out from chaos. 


  
How did you lure them in? 


  
Excellent question. 


  
Individually, I've been 
at it for six hours. 


  
And what happens if I do this? 


  
Clean yourself up. 


  
You are Blackwood's last request. 


  
Look at those towering structures. 


  
It's the first combination of a Bascule's
suspension bridge ever attempted. 


  
Most innovative. 


  
What an industrious empire! 


  
Oh, I have your 
winnings from last night. 


  
You weren't there, so I 
made your customary bet.


  
You're right. I'll keep 
it with your chequebook, 


  
locked safely away in my draw. 


  
Did you know the opera house 
is featuring "Don Giovanni"? 


  
I could easily procure 
a couple of tickets 


  
If you had any cultural 
inclinations this evening.


  
You have a grand gift of silence, 


  
Watson, it makes you quite
invaluable as a companion.


  
I knew she'd been engaged. 


  
She told me. 


  
So that's, no to the opera then. 


  
That was my waistcoat. 


  
I thought we agreed 
it's too small for you. 


  
- I'd like it back. 
- I thought we agreed. 


  
I want it back. 


  
This way, Mr. Holmes. 


  
Blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd into something of a fear frenzy.


  
I'm sure it will disperse once 
his feet have stopped twitching. 


  
Care to come along? 


  
No, you're on your own, old cock.


  
I have no business with him 
whilst he's alive. 


  
Suit yourself, "mother hen". 


  
It seems you still have 
lots of rooms to let. 


  
We had to move the prisoners, sir.


  
Otherwise we're gonna 
have a riot on our hands.


  
He has a peculiar effect on the inmates.


  
As though, he can 
get inside their heads. 


  
I'm sure I can find my own way 
if you have other duties to perform. 


  
Much obliged, sir. 
Thank you. 


  
And I stood upon the sand of the sea, 
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, 


  
having seven heads and ten horns, 
and upon his horns ten crowns,


  
and upon his heads 
the name of blasphemy,


  
and they worshipped the dragon 
which gave power unto the beast


  
they worshipped 
the beast saying, 


  
Who is like the beast? 


  
the beast which I just saw
had the body of a leopard, 


  
but had feet of a bear and the 
mouth was the mouth of a lion.


  
The dragon gave his power unto the 
beast, and his seat and great authority. 


  
I love what you've 
done with the place. 


  
So glad you can accept my invitation. 


  
I just have a small point of concern. 


  
How can I help? 


  
I've already followed the 
murders with some interest.


  
and although my heart went out primarily 
to the families of the victims 


  
I couldn't but notice 
a criminal mastery,


  
in the stroke of your brush. 


  
You're too kind. 


  
However, by comparison, 
your work in the crypt 


  
looks more like a finger painting. 


  
So now you're curious 
if there's a larger game afoot?


  
Either that or, um... 


  
shortly my friend will 
pronounce you dead 


  
and I thought I might 
keep him company. 


  
Your mistake is to 
imagine that anything


  
that is earthly has
led us to this moment. 


  
Your error of judgement is to assume 
that I'm holding the brush at all.


  
I'm merely a channel. 


  
Well my only wish is that 
I could have caught you sooner. 


  
You see? Five lives 
might have been spared. 


  
Those lives were a necessity. 


  
Sacrifice. 


  
Five otherwise meaningless creatures 
called to serve a greater purpose. 


  
I wonder if they'll let me and 
Watson dissect your brain. 


  
After you hang, of course. 


  
I'd wager, there is some deformity 
that would be scientifically significant.


  
Then you too, could serve 
a greater purpose. 


  
Holmes, you must 
widen your gaze. 


  
I'm concerned, you underestimate 
the gravity of coming events. 


  
You and I are bound together on a journey 
that would twist the very fabric of nature. 


  
But beneath your mask of logic 
I sense a fragility... 


  
That worries me. 


  
Steel your mind, Holmes. 


  
I need you. 


  
I'd say, you've come a long way 
down from a house of Lords. 


  
- I will rise again. 
- "Bon voyage". 


  
Pay attention! 


  
Three more will die and there is nothing 
you can do to save them. 


  
You must accept that this
is beyond your control. 


  
by the time you realise 
you made all of this possible 


  
it will be the last sane 
thought in your head. 


  
What did he want? 


  
I'm not sure. 


  
But I don't think you're needed 
father. Not for this one. 


  
Lord Henry Blackwood, 
you are sentenced to death 


  
for the practice of black magic 


  
the unholy murder of
five innocent young women


  
and an attempted 
murder of a sixth.


  
Do you have any final words? 


  
Death... is only the beginning. 


  
That is the end of 
Lord Blackwood. 


  
London's so bleak
this time of year. 


  
Not that I'm pining 
for New Jersey, 


  
but much prefer to 
travel in the winter. 


  
Here, I bought you these. 
All the way from Syria. 


  
I found these exquisite 
dates in Jordan.


  
and your favorite... 


  
olives from the Cyclades. 


  
I thought we might 
have a little tea party.


  
and while I was setting 
the table, I found this. 


  
A file with my name on it. 


  
"The theft of the Velásquez 
portrait from the King of Spain. 


  
Missing naval documents lead to
resignation of Bulgarian prime minister


  
scandalous affair
ends engagement of...


  
perhaps to both
Romanov princess.


  
I'm simply studying your methods. 


  
Should the authorities ask me 
to hunt you down. 


  
But I don't see my name 
in any of these articles. 


  
But your signature was clear. 


  
Is that the Maharajah's missing diamond?


  
Or just another souvenir? 


  
Let's not dwell
on the past. 


  
Shall we? 


  
Now, by the looks of things, 
I'd say you were between jobs.


  
And you between husbands. 


  
How much did 
you get for the ring? 


  
He was boring and jealous 
and he snored. 


  
I'm Irene Adler, again. 


  
Thank you. 


  
I need your help. 


  
I need you to find someone. 


  
Why are you always so suspicious. 


  
Should I answer chronologically 
or alphabetically? 


  
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope. 


  
I think you'll find 
all the information inside. 


  
Who are you working for? 


  
So I'll have to find 
out the hard way. 


  
Keep your money, 
I didn't say I'll take the case. 


  
Well, consider it a 
wager that you will. 


  
You remember the Grand? 


  
They gave me our old room. 


  
Hold the door. 
Thank's, doctor. 


  
Ma'am. 


  
- He'll do it. 
- Well done, Miss Adler. 


  
That's precisely why 
I hired you. 


  
I wager, he'll have our man 
in the next 24 hours. 


  
He'd better. 


  
Reordan is the key to what 
Blackwood was doing. 


  
He's essential to my plan. 


  
Damn! What are you doing? 
Can't you see where you're going? 


  
Get off out of it!


  
A little ride, I've come along way, sir. 


  
Rubbing these calluses off this...


  
God save the queen! 


  
God save the Queen, sir. 


  
Get off out of it! 


  
Look at you? 


  
Why is the only woman 
you've ever cared about


  
a world class criminal? 


  
Are you a masochist? 


  
Allow me to explain... 


  
Allow me! 


  
She's the only adversary, 
who ever out smarted you. Twice.


  
Made a proper idiot out of you. 


  
Right, you've had your fun. 


  
- What she after, anyway? 
- It's time to press on. 


  
What could she possibly need? 


  
It doesn't matter. 


  
An alibi, a beard. A human canoe.


  
She can sit on your back 
and paddle you up the Thames. 


  
That's no consequence 
to you really, is it Watson? 


  
We've done our, last case together. 


  
I've already read it. 


  
Missing person. 


  
Luke Reordan. 


  
4 foot 10, red hair, no front teeth. 
Case solved. 


  
You're obviously not her type. 


  
She likes gingered dwarfs. 


  
Midgets. 


  
- So, you agree. 
- No, I don't agree. 


  
It's more than a technicality, you see. 


  
You are misrepresenting the 
dimensions of foreshortened peoples.


  
I've said too much. 
I can tell, I've upset you. 


  
No, I'm just simply 
stating, that one has... 


  
What were you doing? 


  
- Will you allow me to explain? 
- I wish you would. 


  
- Holmes? What are you doing? 
- Nothing. 


  
- Are you wearing a false... 
- A false nose? No. 


  
- Tell me, that, that wasn't 
- Was... 


  
Holmes! Where are you going? 


  
Watson? 


  
Help! Watson! 


  
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart. 


  
Cut you a deal, cos you're so pretty. 


  
Oh, my lucky day! 


  
Hello gorgeous, you 
got something for me.


  
Don't move! 


  
Now, what have we got here? 


  
Thank you. 


  
That's the Irene I know. 


  
This man Intrigues me, Watson, 
His got Adler on the edge. 


  
And she's no mean feet. 


  
She's intimidated,
she's scared of him. 


  
Yet she work's for him. 


  
Right. 


  
It is nothing to do with me, but I 
advise you to leave the case alone. 


  
I may not always have a choice. 


  
After all, I may be paying the rent 
on my own soon. Thanks to you.


  
Get that out of my face. 


  
It's not "in your face" 
it's in my hand. 


  
Get what's in your 
hand out of my face. 


  
- Mr. Holmes! 
- Clarky! 


  
Sorry. Inspector Lestrade asks
you come with me at once. 


  
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard? 


  
Watson drop a compass, he means us. 


  
No, you means you. 


  
It's Lord Blackwood, 
sir. He... 


  
Well... it appears he's come 
back from the grave, sir. 


  
- Most engaging. 
- Very clever. 


  
I pronounced the man dead myself. 


  
What are the facts? 


  
Ground keeper, claims he saw him walking
through the graveyard just this morning, sir. 


  
I'll leave this in your capable hands. 


  
I have an appointment with, Mary. 


  
It's not my reputation at stake here. 


  
- Don't try that. 
- Have the newspapers


  
- got wind of it yet.
- Well that's what we're trying to avoid, sir. 


  
Certainly.


  




  
- What's the major concern? 
- Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir. 


  
Indeed. 


  
You're not taking this seriously, Holmes? 


  
Yes, as you should.


  
It's a matter of
professional integrity. 


  
No girl wants to
marry a doctor 


  
who can't tell If 
a man's dead or not. 


  
Who do you think 
won the match, Clarky? 


  
- Sir? 
- The rugby match. 


  
Your boys have done a magnificent
job of obliterating any potential evidence.


  
Yes, but at least they 
never miss an opportunity... 


  
to miss an opportunity. 


  
You took your time, Holmes. 


  
And on the third day...


  
These slabs are sand stone, they 
half a ton each if they're a pound,


  
and they were smashed 
open from the inside . 


  
Lestrade. What of the coffin? 


  
We are in the process of 
bringing it up now. 


  
I see... 


  
Hmm... Right. 


  
At what stage of the process? 
Contemplative? 


  
And how is our witness? 


  
He's over there. 


  
And apparently he's got ca... 
cat... cata... 


  
Catatonic, sir. 


  
- He's not feeling very well. 
- Yes 


  
If you lot don't stop behaving like a bunch 
of quivering milk maids, you're on double time. 


  
Now you get down there, and 
you bring that coffin up, now! 


  
Good day, sir! 


  
It's alright. 


  
I'm a doctor. 


  
The man's in shock. 


  
- He may need a few moments
- The witness states that


  
he saw, lord Blackwood, 
rise from the grave. 


  
- Well? 
- Well? 


  
You pronounced him dead. 


  
He had no pulse. 


  
Good lord. 


  
That's not Blackwood. 


  
Well, now we have a 
firm grasp, of the obvious. 


  
Time of death? 


  
Diptera is approximately...


  
2/3 of an inch 


  
which would put the time of death
at between 10 and 12 hours ago. 


  
May I borrow your pen? 


  
- Adler's dwarf. 
- Midget. 


  
I know what I saw! 


  
It was Blackwood! 


  
As clear as I see you. 


  
And when the dead walk... 


  
the living will fill 
these coffins. 


  
Well... Umm...


  
Right, put the lid on 
and clean this lot up.


  
You really believe he was resurrected? 


  
The question is not "if" but "how." 
The game's afoot.


  
Follow your spirit and 
upon this charge, cry


  
god for Harry,
England and St. George. 


  
Here you are. Why that 
certain fish and chips store


  
- I don't understand
- Well there's a particular pier


  
they use out in the back,
northern stout, to be exact. 


  
You know, Holmes 


  
I've seen things in war 
I don't understand. 


  
In India, I once met a man 
who predicted his own death 


  
right down to the number and placement 
of the bullets that killed him. 


  
You have to admit, Holmes 


  
that a supernatural explanation 
to this case, is theoretically possible. 


  
No. Agreed.


  
But, it is a huge mistake to 
theorize before one has data.


  
Inevitably, one begins to twist facts to 
suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts


  
That said I believe


  
our midget is the key to this. 


  
Right. Scratches around the
keyhole where the watch is wound.


  
What does that tell you? 


  
The man was likely a drunk. 


  
Every time he wound the watch, 
his hand slipped, hence the scratches.


  
Yes 
Very good, Watson. 


  
You have developed considerable
deductive powers of your own.


  
Let's see now. There are several 
sets of initials.


  
- Pawn brokers marks. 
- Excellent. 


  
Most recent of which are: 
M.H. M.H. M.H... 


  
- M.H is for... 
- "Maddison and Haig". 


  
They should be able 
to give us an address. 


  
What a coincidence. 


  
There's one thing you failed to 
deduce from the watch, Holmes. 


  
Really? I think not. 


  
The time. 


  
I have to get back, Holmes. 


  
Taking tea with the in-laws.. 


  
- Can I predict your future, sir? 
- Absolutely not. 


  
No thank you, ma'am. 


  
You need to hear what
I have to tell you. 


  
We have no need of your 
lucky hella Gypsy women. 


  
Even if it's to do with Mary. 


  
I see two men. 


  
Brothers. Not in 
blood, but in boned. 


  
What of Mary? 


  
M for Mary, for marriage. 
Oh, you will be married.


  
Go on. 


  
I see patterned table 
cloths and china figurines.  


  
and lace doilies... 


  
doilies... 


  
Lace doilies... Holmes. 


  




  
- Does your depravity know, no bounds? 
- No.


  
Oh she turns fat and has a beard... 


  
And what of the warts? 


  
- Oh She's covered in warts... 
- Enough, enough. 


  
- Are they extensive? 
- Please, enough! 


  
It's the most apt prediction, 
Flora's made in years. 


  
And precisely the reason you 
can't find a suitable ring. 


  
Do you have my money? 


  
You are terrified of a life 
without the thrill of a macabre. 


  
Do you have my cut? 


  
- Admit it, admit it! 
- Give me my money! 


  
Holmes. 


  




  
Oh I see. 


  
Thank you. 


  
Well you've got your ring, and I've got 
the address for the ginger midget. 


  
Should be just there. 


  
I think she'll really like this. 


  
And I have some change in my pocket. 


  
- Should I look after it for you? 
- No, no. 


  
- Don't give it away here. 
- No!


  
I have to go see Mary. 


  
Give her my best. 


  
And the family as well. 


  
It does make a considerable difference 
to me, having someone with me


  
on whom I can thoroughly rely. 


  
Well, you can rely on me 
for exactly 10 minutes. 


  
He clearly felt something 
was coming to get him.


  
Or something did. 


  
Irene Adler was here, 


  
either that or the ginger midget 
wore the same Parisian perfume. 


  
Ah, putrefaction. 


  
Ammonium sulphate, 
among other aromas. 


  
Phosphorus. 


  
Formaldehyde. 


  
It looks like he was 
attempting to combine 


  
some kind of sorcery 
and scientific formula. 


  
More importantly... 


  
let's see what he was 
trying to dispose of.


  
Potassium and magnesium. 


  
Sultafitic acid. 


  
Try to take the ion out of the ink
As long as it's not too burnt.


  
Peculiar. 


  
Hydrated rhododendron. 


  
Holmes. 
Look at the crest. 


  
Reordan was working with, Blackwood. 


  
Of course he was. 


  
Question is, to what end. 


  
Whatever he was working 
on, he clearly succeeded. 


  
How so? 


  
Otherwise, he'd still alive. 


  
Which is why Miss Adler is
so desperate to find him. 


  
Yes.


  
There's one odour I can't 
quite put my finger on. 


  
Is it candy floss?
Molasses. 


  
Maple syrup. Ah, barley sugar.


  
Toffee apple. 


  
Let me guess. 


  
Judging by your arsonist tool kit


  
You're here to burn down the building 
and extinguish all the evidence therein  


  
Just one minute boys.. 


  
Oh, Dredger! 


  
Is there a problem?


  
Meat... 


  
or potatoes? 


  
My 10 minutes are up. 


  




  




  
You alright? 


  




  
 


  
Holmes. 


  
What is that? 


  




  




  




  




  




  




  




  




  




  




  




  




  




  




  
Holmes! 


  
Watson... 


  
What have you done? 


  
I haven't slept all night. 


  
Not a whink. 


  
Why I ever believed... 


  
that I would get to have 
tea with Mary's parents? is beyond me


  
having been talked 
into going with you.


  
We were set upon man,
it was self-defence. 


  
I've been reviewing my notes, of our 
exploits over the last seven months. 


  
would you like to know my conclusion? 


  
I am psychologically disturbed. 


  
How so? 


  
Why else would I be 
continually led into situations 


  
where you deliberately, withhold 
your plans from me? 


  
Why else? 


  
You never complained 
about my methods before. 


  
- I'm not complaining. 
- You're not? 


  
- What do you call this? 
- How...


  
How am I complaining? I 
never complain, when do I


  
ever complain about you practising 
the violin at three in the morning.


  
or your mess, 
your general lack of hygiene 


  
or the fact that you 
steal all my clothes. 


  
We have a barter system. 


  
When do I complain about
you setting fire to my room? 


  
- Our rooms. 
- The rooms,


  
When do I ever complain that 
you experiment on my dog? 


  
- Our dog! It's our dog.
- On the... the dog!


  
But I do take issue, is your campaign 
to sabotage my relationship with Mary. 


  
I understand. 


  
- Do you? 
- I do.


  
- I don't think you do. 
- You're overly tired. 


  
- Yes.
- You're feeling a bit sensitive. 


  
I'm not sensitive. 


  
What you need is to rest. 


  
My brother, Mycroft, 
has a small estate near Chichester. 


  
Beautiful grounds... There's a falling.


  
- We could throw a lamb on the spit... 
- We?


  
Holmes, if I were to go to the country 
it would be with my future wife. 


  
Well certainly, if you must... 


  
No not you, Mary and I. 


  
- You are not... 
- What? Invited? 


  
Why would I be not invited to my 
own brothers country home, Watson? 


  
- Now you are not making any sense! 
- You're not human! 


  
- John Watson? 
- Yes.


  
Your bail has been posted. 


  
Mary! 


  
Just Watson. 


  
I hope you get bail by breakfast, 
because the boys, are getting hungry. 


  
Back off! Back off! 


  
To which the barman says: 
"may I push in your stool?". 


  
Right you, you're out.. 


  
- Until next time, big Joe. 
- Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes. 


  
Thank heaven you're here, Lestrade 
I'd almost ran out of jokes. 


  
You know, In another life, you'd 
have made an excellent criminal. 


  
Yes, sir and you an 
excellent policemen.


  
Tomsky! Thank you. 


  
Now please tell me you have answers. 


  
All in good time, Lestrade.


  
All in good time? what is this some parlour 
game where we have to guess what you're thinking.


  
I've got a public in 
frenzy out there


  
and if you don't fill me in, I'll have you in there 
playing Victoria and Albert quicker than a bookies runner


  




  
Now, clean up and 
make yourself presentable.


  
For whom? 


  
Friends in high places. 


  
They're the ones 
who bailed you out. 


  
I'm terribly sorry to 
inconvenience you, sir. 


  
But I'm going to have 
to put this on you. 


  
Mr. Holmes, apologies for 
summoning you like this. 


  
I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to 
where you are and who I am? 


  
As to where I am... 


  
I was admittedly lost for a moment, 
between Charing Cross and Holborn, 


  
but I was saved by the bread
shop on Southford Hill. 


  
The only baker to use the certain French 
glaze on their loaves a Brittany sage.


  
after that the carriage 
fork left and right


  
until a tell-tale bump 
at the Fleet conduit.


  
And as to who you are? that
took every ounce of my not


  
inconsiderable experience. 


  
The letters on your desk were 
addressed to a Sir Thomas Rodrum. 


  
Lord Chief Justice. That 
would be the official title


  
Who you really are... is of 
course another matter entirely. 


  
Judging by the sacred 
ox on your ring.


  
you're the secret head of the
Temple of the Four Orders


  
in who's headquarters we now sit. 


  
Located, Northwest corner 
of St. James square I think.


  
That's the mystery, the only mystery is to 
why you bothered to blind fold me at all. 


  
Yes... well, standard 
procedure I suppose. 


  
I dare say we have the
right man, gentlemen. 


  
Sherlock Holmes. 


  
I'm Ambassador Standish of America
and Lord Coward, the home secretary. 


  
I suppose you already have some 
notion as to the practices of our order.


  
Yes. They are practically interesting.


  
Be as sceptical as you like. 


  
but our secret system have steered the 
world for the greater good for centuries.


  




  
There danger is they can also be 
used for more nefarious purposes.


  
What some call the dark arts
or practical magic. 


  
We know you don't believe 
in magic Mr. Holmes 


  
We don't expect you 
to share our faith


  
merely our fears. 


  
fear is the more 
infectious condition.


  
In this instance. 


  
fear of your own child. 


  
Blackwood is your son 


  
You have the same irises, a rare dark 
green, the diamond shaped hazel flex


  
together with identical outer ears or pinner, which 
are only past down through direct blood line


  
which makes by 
necessity either brothers


  
or in this case, more 
likely father and son.


  
Very few people are
privy to that information.


  
And we'd want to 
keep it that way. 


  
He was conceived 
during one of our rituals. 


  
His mother wasn't my wife. 


  
But she shared our beliefs. 
She was a powerful practitioner. 


  
though not enough to 
survive giving birth to him. 


  
Death followed him 
wherever he went. 


  
Those five girls were not 
the first to be butchered. 


  
He killed many more using
them to enhance his powers.


  
No one could prove anything 
of course, but we all knew. 


  
The boy was a curse. 


  
We'd done our best to 
stop him ourselves, but its not enough. 


  
His power grows daily. 


  
His resurrection is evidence of that.


  
But what he does next 
will be far more dangerous. 


  
The secret lies in the book of spells. 
This is the source of his power. 


  
His going to raise a force that will 
alter the very course of the world.


  
I want you to find him and 
stop him before he does.


  
We'll give you any 
assistance that we can.


  
As home secretary, I have a 
considerable influence over the police.


  
- Oh, yes 
- So... 


  
Name your price? 


  
Well, of great benefit to being a consulting 
detective is that I can pick and choose my clients.


  
Consider it done, I'll stop him.


  
But not for you. And 
certainly not for a price. 


  
I do have a parting 
query Sir Thomas.


  
What is that? 


  
If the rest of his family's dead... 


  
how long do you expect to survive? 


  
Food for thought. 


  
Well perhaps you'll have 
better luck opening that.


  
Margaux. 58.
Comet vintage.


  
How fascinating that a astronomical 
event can effect the quality...


  
How is it going with our 
case that you refused to take.


  
...wine. 


  
Or I've hit a dead end. Literally.


  
I found your man. He's 
buried in Blackwood's tomb. 


  
If you still need him. 


  
Oh dear... 


  
I hope my client doesn’t 
come looking for a refund.


  
He's a professor, isn't he? 


  
I couldn't see his face, but I spotted 
a bit of chalk on his apparel. 


  
I've never known a professor to carry a 
gun, and on such a clever contraption. 


  
Eye patch. Nice touch... 


  
So... case closed. 


  
Which makes this a social visit. 


  
No. It's you're in over 
your head Irene, visit. 


  
Who ever killed, Reardon 
was covering their tracks, 


  
which makes you the next 
loose end to be snipped. 


  
Let it breathe. 


  
I've never been in over my head.


  
Leave now, disappear. 
You're good at that. 


  
Or stay. And volunteer
for protective custody. 


  
If I'm in danger, 
so are you. 


  
Come with me. 


  
What if we trusted each other. 


  
You're not listening. I'm taking 
you, to either the railway station 


  
or the police station. 


  
So... 


  
Which is it to be? 


  
You decide, which will it be? 


  
I told you to let it breathe. 


  
Can you taste the comet? 


  
Why couldn't you 
just come away with me? 


  
Madam, I need you to remain calm,


  
and trust me, I'm a professional. 
Beneath this pillow 


  
lies the key to my release. 


  
Of course, she misinterpreted 
my intention entirely. 


  
- Naturally sir. 
- That's why I find this modern religious fellow so troubling. 


  
There's no latitude 
for misunderstandings. 


  
It runs right over reason, sir. 


  
And chambermaids were 
once such a liberal breed. 


  
My wife's a chambermaid, sir. 


  
Anyhow, it’s a good thing she was a friend, 
otherwise we may never have found you. 


  
The inspector's been over at Baker 
Street himself this morning, sir. 


  
Just joking about the wife, sir. 


  
We've checked everything. 
There's no sign of a break in


  
and the butler didn't hear a thing. 


  
So, body in the bath tub, 
his eyes were wide open 


  
and the only thing missing was... 


  
His ring, sir. 


  
Why did you drain the water?


  
Out of common decency. 


  
Crime is common. 
Logic, is rare. 


  
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer, 
not provide conflict for the cause. 


  
What is that? 


  
Jasmine bath salt, sir. 


  
Super. Probably comes 
from a larger container. 


  
It would either be in the pantry. 


  
High up where it's warm and dry. 
Or in a linen cupboard with a vent. 


  
Oh and constable, you could 
do worse than to check the 


  
ground under the rear window for 
any signs of footprints not your own


  
data, data, data. I can not
make bricks without clay. 


  
Charles? 


  
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry. 


  
It was in the pantry, sir.


  
I don't know what to make of this.


  
Excellent work.


  
Adieu.


  
What's the meaning of this, Coward? 


  
Why have you called this meeting? 


  
Sir Thomas is dead.


  
I nominate Lord Blackwood 
as head of the Order. 


  
Have you lost your mind? 


  
You know damn well 
what his capable of. 


  
Of course he does. 


  
That's why we're here. 


  
That's why, we're all here. 


  
My powers and my assets were 
given to me for one purpose. 


  
Magnificent, but a simple purpose. 


  
To create a new future. 


  
A future ruled... by us. 


  
Tomorrow at noon, we take the first step 
towards a new chapter in our history. 


  
Magic will lead the way. 


  
Once the people of England 
see our new found power


  
they'll bow down in fear. 


  
Across the Atlantic, lies a 
colony that was once ours. 


  
It will be again. 


  
The civil war has 
made them weak. 


  
Their government is as corrupt 
and as ineffective as ours. 


  
So we'll take it back. 


  
We will remake the world. 


  
Create the future. 


  
These men are with me, 
Standish. 


  
But... are you? 


  
No, sir. I am not. 


  
These powers that 
you're playing with... 


  
no man, can control. 


  
Well gentlemen... Someone 
has to stop them


  
even if you won't. 


  
I wouldn't do that if I were you. 


  
Gentlemen... don't be afraid. 


  
As you can see, 
we are protected. 


  
Come... drink your allegiance here. 


  
You control the 
police, now use them. 


  
I didn't know you were here. 


  
Since this room is no longer yours, 
do you mind if I utilise it? 


  
Be my guest. 


  
- In here chaps. 
- Where shall we put him, sir? 


  
Any where's fine. 


  
Who is he? 


  
His the man who tried to kill 
you at Reardon's lodgings. 


  
I suppose his neck didn't survive the 
impact of Dredger landing on him. 


  
Yes... Thanks for that by the way. 


  
But there is still some consolation in the knowledge 
that he can still be of service to his fellow man. 


  
Elbow is long stained with blood. 


  
But it's older than his own injuries. 


  
I don't know if it's human. 
It's not a butcher. Let me see...


  
Yellow Flame. Green bursts. 


  
An industrial worker. 


  
Coal. River silt. 


  
And the stains on his trousers, 
should put him squarely in... 


  
Nine Elms. 


  
Sorry what? 


  
The area you're looking 
for is, Nine Elms. 


  
Do you remember where I put the 
Lord's registrar of members interests? 


  
It's on the step ladder. 


  
Blackwood has had his hand in almost
everything that is corrosive to the spirit.


  
Woolidge Arsenal. 


  
Lime house Chemical Works. 


  
Probably be a factory
by the river. 


  
What's that? 


  
Never mind. 


  
You don't know where 
my rugby ball went do you? 


  
No, not a clue.


  
Queen side slaughterhouse 


  
Nine Elms. 


  
A factory by the river. 


  
Well done, Watson. That should 
lead us right to Blackwood. 


  
Dead or Alive. 


  
Not us. 


  
You. 


  
Yes... 


  
Just a figure of speech, old boy. 


  
He's left it there on purpose. 


  
More coal doctor.


  
That's a good one.


  
Glad to see you two 
are working hard then. 


  
And I thought you were 
trying to be discrete. 


  
You would not last 
one day in the navy. 


  
Holmes, are you 
sure that there is no 


  
alternative means of 
water transportation, than that.


  
I guarantee you nobody knows 
London's waterways better. 


  
Tanners practically a fish himself.


  
At least he certainly drinks like one. 


  
Oh you've found a
sense of humour, doctor. 


  
If only just a sense. 


  
I better take over. 
A bit tricky down here. 


  
Come on... 


  
- Look familiar? 
- Yep.


  
All that's missing is a ginger midget. 


  
They cleared something away from here. 


  
Not minutes ago. 


  
Like what? 


  
I'm not sure. Something mechanical. 


  
Holmes, look at this. 


  
- 1:18 
- Chapter and verse. 


  
Revelations. 1:18. I am he 
that giveth, and was dead.


  
And behold of the life for ever more. 


  
I warned you, Holmes to accept 


  
that this was beyond your control. 


  
beyond what your rational 
mind could comprehend


  
What a busy afterlife 
that you are having.


  
I want you to bear witness. 


  
Tomorrow, at midday, the 
world as you know it, will end.


  
Show me your face and it will 
be the end of your world right now. 


  
Save the bullets, Watson. 


  
A gift for you. 


  
What was that about saving bullets? 


  
She followed you here, Holmes. 


  
You led your lamb to slaughter. 


  
Holmes! 


  
This game was designed to hurt. 


  
Watson! 


  
It's warm in here, Watson! 


  
In over your head yet, darling? 


  
- Hold on there! 
- I can't. 


  
Let me take your weight. 


  
Give us a leg up, old boy.


  
These German locks always 
give me trouble. 


  
It's a band saw.


  
No matter. We have plenty of time. 


  
Holmes... 


  
- It's not working. 
- Keep calm.


  
Holmes! Hurry up. 


  
Hope you're not getting excited... 


  
Turn of that valve. 


  
And we bounce in... Three


  
...two, 


  
...one. 


  
Thank you. 


  
I'm gonna get after, Blackwood. 


  
Thank you. 


  
We should go help the doctor.


  
Holmes! 


  
Lord. Coward has issued 
a warrant for your arrest. 


  
Watson's alive. 
Just get out of here, sir. Go. 


  
Will the train be departing on time? 


  
The trains been delayed, madam. 


  
Shouldn't be long now though. 


  
The train will depart 
when I tell it too.


  
And you will leave my 
employment, when I allow you too.


  
I fulfilled my contract. 


  
I found Reorden. 


  
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary. 


  
So that's me finished. 


  
Your job was to manipulate, 
Holmes' feelings for you. 


  
Not succumb to them.


  
You have fulfilled nothing.


  
I want what, Reardon 
was making for Blackwood.


  
finish the job, or the next dead 
body will be Sherlock Holmes.


  
The surgeon should 
be along shortly. 


  
He should be 
able to rest now. 


  
Excuse me. 


  
Is that the best you can do? 


  
Yes for now. 


  
I must attend to 
my other patients. 


  
Doctor... 


  
Doctor! 


  
Please! 


  
I know that you care 
for him as much as I do. 


  
This is not your responsibility,
It was his choice. 


  
He'd say it was worth the wounds. 


  
Solve this. 


  
Whatever it takes. 


  
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. 


  
I've never been in over my head.


  
It's nothing to do with me, but I'd 
advise you to leave the case alone.


  
You're not taking this 
seriously are you, Holmes.


  
I told you to accept, this 
was beyond your control 


  
Tomorrow at mid-day, the world will end.


  
Holmes.


  
You and I are bound together on a journey 
that will twist the very fabric of nature.


  
Steel your mind, Holmes.


  
He will raise a force that will 
change the very course of the world.


  
His power grows. 


  
This is the source of his power.


  
I need you.


  
The secret lies in the book of spells.


  
Three more will die...


  
and there's nothing 
you can do to save them.


  
We know you don't believe in magic.


  
Reardon was working with Blackwood. 


  
The only thing missing 
was his ring.


  
Give up, Holmes.


  
This is a riddle you can not solve.


  
Good morning. 


  
Now, you need to work. 


  
Familiar artwork? 


  
You look gorgeous. 


  
Some how, I knew you wouldn't leave. 


  




  
You made the front page. 


  
Only a name, and no picture? 


  
So it looks like, you'll be needing 
to work outside the law now,


  
and that's my area of expertise. 


  
I feel safer already. 


  
You seem to be making a rapid recovery. 


  
Yes... 


  
I took this shrapnel out myself. 


  
Mary said I had a lousy doctor. 


  
Well I'm... I'm just so...


  
very glad that you're 
um... well, with us.


  
Now that you’re sitting 
comfortably, I shall begin.  


  
My initial approach 
was far to narrow. 


  
When Blackwood invited 
me to Pentonville prison 


  
he suggested I widen my gaze.


  
and at minimum, I have done just that. 


  
In fact, I may well have reconciled thousand's 
of years of theological disparity. 


  
But that's for another time. 


  
Blackwood's method is based 
on a ritualistic mystical system


  
that's been employed by the Temple 
of the Four Orders for centuries. 


  
To fully understand the 
system, to get inside it, 


  
I re-enacted the ceremony 
we interrupted at the crypt, 


  
with a few enhancements of my own. 


  
my journey took me some what 
further down the rabbit hole than I intended 


  
and though I dirtied 
my fluffy white tail


  
I have emerged, enlightened.


  
The fraternity who 
decidedly control the empire


  
who share the belief with the kings,
Pharaohs, and emperors of old


  
that the Sphinx was a door 
to another dimension. 


  
A gateway to immeasurable power. 


  
It's made up of four parts. 


  
The foot of a lion, the tail of 
an ox, the wings of an eagle 


  
and the head of a man. 


  
In Sir Thomas’s secret chamber, 
I found a bone of an ox


  
the tooth of a lion, the feather 
of an eagle and a hair of a man. 


  
Map. 


  
The points of the stars represent 
the five murdered girls


  
but the cross is what 
we're now interested in. 


  
It’s a wildly held belief, that within 
the architecture of the great cities 


  
are coded references to the system 


  
Since he rose from the grave,
Blackwood's killed three men.


  
Each murder was committed at a location that 
has a direct connection with the temple 


  
therefore the system.


  
Reardon, the ginger midget. 


  
represents man. We 
found his body here. 


  
Sir Thomas... master of the 
temple, wore the ox ring. 


  
He died here. 


  
Standish, the ambassador to America
Where the eagle has been the national 


  
emblem for over a hundred years .


  
The headquarters of the Temple of the
Four Order is where he died, 


  
is here. 


  
Correspondingly, the map will tell 
us the location of Blackwood's final act  


  
So we have man, the ox,
eagle, only the lion remaining.


  
Right here. 


  
Parliament. 


  
Alright you four stay here and 
the rest of you come with me.


  
Right this way. 


  
Ladies first. 


  
Follow these instructions. 


  
Hello, hello, hello... 


  
Did the devil turn up? 


  
Well never mind. 


  
You've got the next best thing. 


  
Beg your pardon my lord, 
I know that it’s unorthodox 


  
But Mr. Holmes here, his been making 
some serious accusations about you


  
and The Order. 


  
I see. 


  
At least this solves the great mystery 
of how you became inspector.


  
Excuse me, my lord.


  
But I've been wanting 
to do that for a long time. 


  
Well inspector, I have five minutes 
before my next engagement.


  
So why don’t you regale me 
with your stories of conspiracy 


  
Thank you Lestrade. 


  
My lord... 


  
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist 
Blackwood in all his murders.


  
or just the one I prevented? 


  
Very distinctive, those hand 
made shoes of yours. 


  
But the price of quality is often 
the unique imprint they leave


  
Nonetheless I confess to being 
completely outmatched.


  
I could deduce very little 
from my investigation.


  
Fortunately there’s nothing 
more stimulating than a


  
case where everything 
goes against you. 


  
How many members of parliament do 
you intend to murder at noon today.


  
Man, ox, eagle, lion. The 
lion's parliament isn't it? 


  
Very clever. 


  
But it's not murder, 
Mr. Holmes. 


  
It's mercy. 


  
We are giving the weak 
masses a strong Shepard.


  
Don't you see that 
it's for their own...


  
No. But I don't care 
much what you think. 


  
I just simply wanted to know the 
location of Blackwood’s final ceremony. 


  
And now you've given it to me. 


  
I've told you nothing. 


  
But your clothes say infinitely more 
than you could ever hope.


  
The mud smeared on your boots 
from where you’ve been walking. 


  
A touch of red brick dust on your knee 
from where you’ve been kneeling.


  
A small bandage on your thumb 
from where you’ve been vowing.


  
A faint aroma of excrement from 
where you’ve been standing.


  
You and Blackwood laid the final 
touches to your ceremony in the sewers 


  
beneath parliament


  
less than an hour ago. 


  
Both houses meet today. 


  
The whole government will be present. 


  
It's a shame you made an 
enemy out of Blackwood, Holmes.


  
You would have 
made a valuable ally.


  
How terrible is wisdom.


  
when it brings no 
profit to the wise. 


  
We take power at noon. 


  
Then isn't anytime to waste then. 


  
Is there? 


  
I told you you he'd be coming out the 
top window, soldier boy. 


  
There isn't any way he'd be 
coming over that terrace.


  
Technically that isn’t the 
top window, is it sailor boy.


  
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window. 


  
Anyway, you’d be pleased to know 
that Lestrade performed in his role perfectly.


  
Actually, I think 
he rather enjoyed it. 


  
I hope you know what 
you're doing, Holmes. 


  
Here's the key. 


  
You got what you 
needed from, Coward? 


  
Yes, I smoked him out 
with relative ease.


  
- Tanner? 
- Yes? 


  
If you would captain, 
take us onto the bridge


  
Port side. proximately 100 yards beyond that 
you'll find a tunnel, that leads us to the sewers.


  
Right away, sir.


  
The end is nigh.


  
Blackwood’s come back from hell 
and laid a curse upon this land


  
Behold, Blackwood's magic revealed.


  
What does it do? 


  
It's a chemical weapon. 


  
The first of its kind. 


  
You deduced that, how? 


  
From my pocket. 


  
I snipped this of a rather common 
rat at the slaughterhouse.


  
Notice the blue discolouration.


  
The faintest smell of almonds,
tell-tale traces of cyanide.


  
Now we know what the 
ginger midget was working on.


  
- It will revolutionise warfare.
- Yes killing a lot of people.


  
Now, there's 7 minutes until 
noon. What are we going to do? 


  
We must do this carefully...


  
She loves an entrance, your muse.


  
Shoot him! Now please! 


  
My lords! My lords.


  
Time has come for any of 
those who believe, to remain.


  
Behold... Lord Blackwood. 


  
You seem surprised. 


  
I have returned from beyond the 
grave to fulfil England’s destiny.


  
and extend the boundaries 
of this great empire. 


  
Listen to the rabble outside. 


  
Listen... 


  
to the fear. 


  
I will use that as a
weapon to control them... 


  
and then the world. 


  
I've never seen anything 
like it. Look at this. 


  
It’s specifically designed to 
prevent us from disarming it.


  
These components appear to be designed 
to receive a signal of some sort.


  
Electromagnetic waves? 


  
When triggered, the electrodes 
will send a charge


  
converting the chemical into gas.


  
and the gas will travel up that shaft 


  
and filter through the ventilation 
system that leads directly to parliament. 


  
Within seconds, of it's administration the most 
powerful men in the world will be choking on death.


  
Blackwood must have 
some sort of transmitter 


  
that connects with it remotely. 


  
Three minutes and ten seconds. 


  
I will create an empire that 
will endure for a millennia 


  
Indestructible and eternal. 


  
Move it! Move it! 


  
We don't have to actually disarm the device, 
we just have to remove the cylinders. 


  
Yes.


  
Except that they're welded in. What 
we need is a controlled explosion.


  
We need a container to direct the blast
my clay pipe should service that ambition


  




  
I rather wish you 
hadn't done that, Irene. 


  
On the twelfth chime, I will 
summon the dark powers.


  
All those of you who are with 
me shall be protected.


  
All others will perish. 


  
I need your pipe. 


  
Nut him! 


  
A new order... begins now. 


  
What are you waiting for? 


  
That. 


  




  
- Can you manage? 
- Of course I can. 


  
Relax. I'm a doctor. 


  
Did you take a wrong turning somewhere? 


  
We're safe now. 


  
Interesting assessment. 


  
Run off. 


  
I won't be chasing you any more. 


  
Fare thee well. 


  
I don't want to run any more. 


  
I'll tell you everything. 


  
I wish you would. 


  
No! 


  
There was never any magic. 


  
Only conjuring tricks.


  
The simplest involves 
paying people off. 


  
Like the prison guard who pretended 
to be possessed outside you cell.


  
Your reputation and the 
inmates fear did the rest.


  
Others required more 
elaborate preparations.


  
It was sandstone slab 
that covered your tomb. 


  
you had it broken before your burial


  
then put back together 
using a mild adhesive.


  
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe. 


  
A mixture of egg and honey, besides 
it'd be washed away by the rain.


  
Holmes! 


  
Arranging for your father to 
drown in his own bathtub 


  
required more modern science. 


  
Very clever of, Reordan 
to find a paralytic


  
that was activated by the 
combination of copper and water.


  
and therefore was undetectable 
once the bath water was drained. 


  
It might have been quite a 
challenge for me,


  
had he not also tested it on 
some unfortunate amphibian.


  
The death of Standish 
was a real mystery 


  
until you used the same 
compound, to blow up the wharf. 


  
An odourless, tasteless flammable liquid


  
yet it burned with 
an unusual pink issue. 


  
Did Standish mistake it for rain 
as he entered the temple. 


  
All it took was a spark. 


  
A simple rigged 
bullet in his gun. 


  
Ingenious. 


  
Like all great performers, you saved 
your pièce de résistance for the end. 


  
A chemical weapon, 
distilled from cyanide.


  
and refined in the bellies of swine. 


  
Had it worked, your followers in 
parliament would have watched unharmed


  
as their colleagues were 
dying around them. 


  
They didn't know that you'd 
given them the antidote. 


  
Instead they would have 
believed it was magic.


  
and that you'd harnessed 
the ultimate power.


  
and the world would have followed.
Fear, in the most powerful weapon of all.


  
You'd better hope that it's 
nothing more than superstition, 


  
as you performed all 
the rituals perfectly. 


  
The devil's due
a soul, I'd say. 


  
For god's sake, 
Holmes cut me loose! 


  
First, the world will see 
you for what you are. 


  
A fraud. 


  
Then you'll be hanged,
properly this time. 


  
It's a long journey 
from here to the rope. 


  
I've never woken up 
in handcuffs before. 


  
I have. 


  
Naked. 


  
A storm is coming. 


  
Well... we've still got a moment. 


  
- Moriarty... 
- What? 


  
That's his name. 


  
And he is a professor. 


  
Everyone has a weak spot. 


  
And he found mine. 


  
What was it precisely? 


  
Please don't underestimate him. 


  
He's just as brilliant as you are.


  
and infinitely more devious. 


  
We'll see about that. 


  
You'll miss me, Sherlock? 


  
Sadly... yes. 


  
- Afternoon, sir. I put the notebook in this one, sir. 
- Thank you. 


  
What's in these, John? 


  
- Scribbles. 
- Scribbles? 


  
- Notes. 
- They're your adventures! 


  
I'd like to read them. 


  
Come on, what's wrong? 


  
I think his finally come 
to terms with you leaving? 


  
Mary, look at the 
ring his given us. 


  
Now 5 minutes here, 
and we'll go home. 


  
Our home. 


  
Careful on the stairs. 


  
Don't worry, dear. 


  
Suicide is not in his repertoire. He's 
far to fond of himself for that. 


  
Holmes! 


  
Good afternoon. 


  
I was trying to deduce the manner in 
which Blackwood survived his execution.


  
Clearing your good 
name, as it were. 


  
But it had a surprising 
Soporific effect on me, and


  
I was carried off in 
the arms off, Morpheus 


  
like a caterpillar in a cocoon. 
Good afternoon, dear. 


  
Get on with it, Holmes. 


  
Cleverly concealed in the 
hang-mans knot, was a hook


  
Oh dear, I think my legs have fallen 
asleep I should probably come down. 


  
John, shouldn't we 
help him down?


  
No, no, no, I'd hate to 
cut him off midstream. 


  
Carry on. 


  
Well the executioner 
attached it to a harness.


  
Thus lowering the weight 
contributed around the waist and


  
the neck to remain intact. 


  
Oh my lord, I can't feel my cheeks. 


  
Might we continue 
this at ground level? 


  
How did you manage it, Holmes? 


  
I managed it with braces, 
belts and a coat hook. 


  
Please, Watson, my tongue is going 
and I'll be of no use to you at all.


  
- Worse things could happen. 
- John. 


  
None of this, explains
Blackwood's lack of pulse


  
Right. 


  
Now the medical mystery.


  
We must restore your reputation, Watson. 


  
There is a toxin refined from the 
nectar of rhododendron ponticum. 


  
It's quite infamous in the region of Turkey, 
bordering the Black Sea, for it's


  
ability to induce an 
apparently mortal paralysis.


  
Enough to mislead a medical mind even as
tenacious and well-trained as your own.


  
It's known locally as... 


  
What's wrong with Gladstone? 


  
Mad honey's disease. 


  
His demonstrating the very 
effects that I just described.   


  
He doesn't mind. 


  
Mary don't worry. 
he's seen far worse. 


  
Mr. Holmes? 


  
Doctor, Miss Mary... 


  
Sorry. Inspector Lestrade asks 
you come with me right away. 


  
What is it this time, Clarky? 


  
It’s one of our sergeants, sir. 


  
He went missing in the sewers the 
day, you stopped Lord Blackwood. 


  
I’m afraid the sewage workers
found his body just this morning, sir


  
We believe the sergeant, 
was our first man on the scene... 


  
Can I help you, officer? 


  
Shot in the head. 


  
Was it a small calibre bullet? 


  
Yes.


  
Was there powder 
burns on his eyebrows? 


  
Indeed, sir. 


  
Point blank range. 


  
Moriarty. 


  
Professor Moriarty. 


  
There's a good boy! 


  
Everything's gonna be fine. 


  
Where is Blackwood's device now? 


  
Secret Service have it, sir. 


  
They've taken over the case. 


  
I'd wager, there's a piece missing. 


  
So Moriarty was after 
a piece of the machine.


  
Not the poison. 


  
There’s nothing more elusive 
than an obvious fact.


  
The wire free invention 
was the game all along. 


  
And Adler was just the diversion. 


  
He knew I'd chase after her, 


  
there by leaving the machine accessible. 


  
The technology of that kind can 
be worth, an untold fortune. 


  
Imagine being able to control a radio device 
simply by sending a command via radio waves.


  
It's the future, Watson. 


  
I've loaded the last 
of your boxes, sir. 


  
- Well... 
- Well...


  
Gladstone! 


  
Stop him before he 
gets to the front door. 


  
Clarky? 


  
Case reopened.


In space as the USS Kelvin slowly comes into view

KELVIN COMM OFFICER: Starfleet base. We sent you a transmission. Did you receive?
FEMALE STARFLEET COMM OFFICER: Kelvin, have you double-checked those readings?
KELVIN COMM OFFICER: Our gravitational sensors are going crazy here, you should see this. It looks like a lightning storm.

GEORGE KIRK: (over comm) Captain to Shuttle Thirty-Seven: Is my wife onboard?
PILOT: Yes sir, she is.
[Bridge]
GEORGE KIRK: I need you to go now. Do you hear me?
[Shuttle]
PILOT: We're waiting on you, sir.
GEORGE KIRK: (over comm) No, just go...
[Bridge]
GEORGE KIRK: ...take off, immediately.
[Shuttle]
GEORGE KIRK: (over comm) That's an order.
PILOT: Yes, sir.
WINONA: No, wait. We can't go yet. Please, stop. Agh, agh. (on communicator) George, the shuttle's leaving. Where are you?
[Bridge]
GEORGE KIRK: Sweetheart, listen to me.
[Shuttle]
GEORGE KIRK: (over comm) I'm not going to be there.
WINONA: No.
[Bridge]
GEORGE KIRK: This is the only way you'll survive.
[Shuttle]
WINONA: Please, don't stay on the ship. You have to be here.
[Bridge]
GEORGE KIRK: The shuttles will never make it if I don't fight them off.
[Shuttle]
WINONA: George, I can't do this without you.
FEMALE ALIEN DOCTOR: Okay, I need you to push now.
WINONA: Aghh!
(Big musical overture as George prepares to ram the Narada and destroys a torpedo from destroying the shuttle, while Winona gives birth)
[Bridge]
BABY KIRK: (crying, over comm)
[Shuttle]
BABY KIRK: (crying as he's handed to Winona)
[Bridge]
GEORGE KIRK: What is it?
[Shuttle]
WINONA: It's a boy.
[Bridge]
GEORGE KIRK: A boy!
[Shuttle]
GEORGE KIRK: (over comm) Tell me about him.
[Bridge]
WINONA: (over comm) He's beautiful.
[Shuttle]
WINONA: George, you should be here.
[Bridge]
COMPUTER VOICE: Impact alert.
GEORGE KIRK: What are we going to call him?
[Shuttle]
WINONA: We can name him after your father.
[Bridge]
GEORGE KIRK: Tiberius? Are you kidding me? No, that's the worst. Let's name him after your dad. Let's call him Jim.
[Shuttle]
WINONA: Jim. Okay. Jim it is.
[Bridge]
GEORGE KIRK: Sweetheart, can you hear me?
[Shuttle]
WINONA: I can hear.
[Bridge]
GEORGE KIRK: I love you so much. I love you...
(George gets thrown out of his seat as the Kelvin is destroyed in impact)
CREDITS
[Abandoned Iowa street]
(Young Jim Kirk is driving a corvette as his Nokia phone chirps)
STEPDAD: Hey, are you out of your mind? That car's an antique. You think you can get away with this just 'cause your mother's off-planet? You get your ass back home, now! You live in my house, buddy. You live in my house and that's my car. You get one scratch on that car and I'm going to whip your a...
(Kirk hits the media button on the phone, cutting off his stepdad's conversation, as the Beastie Boys play)
KIRK: Yeah!
(a hitchhiking boy is seen)
KIRK: Hey, Johnny!
(a police officer begins pursuit)
COP: Citizen, pull over.
(Kirk pulls onto a dirt, side road. He jumps out of his corvette as it flings over a quarry and pulls himself up off the side of the cliff.)
KIRK: Is there a problem, officer?
COP: Citizen, what is your name?
KIRK: My name is James Tiberius Kirk.
[Vulcan School]
TEACHING COMPUTER: What is the formula of the volume of a sphere?
VULCAN BOY: Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.
(various other questions and answers occurs, barely legible)
YOUNG SPOCK: one thousand five hundred forty-eight.
TEACHING COMPUTER: What is the...
SPOCK: Dimensionality equals the logarithm divided by...
SPOCK: Non-exclusability and non-rivalry...
SPOCK: Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.
SPOCK: When it is morally praiseworthy, but not morally obligatory.
(the learning montage ends as he has left his bowl)
VULCAN BULLY 1: Spock.
SPOCK: I presume you've prepared new insults for today.
VULCAN BULLY 1: Affirmative.
SPOCK: This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit an emotional response from me.
VULCAN BULLY 2: You're neither Human nor Vulcan and therefore have no place in this universe.
VULCAN BULLY 3: Look at his Human eyes. They look sad, don't they?
VULCAN BULLY 2: Perhaps an emotional response requires physical stimuli.
(the bully shoves Spock)
VULCAN BULLY 2: He's a traitor you know, your father. For marrying her, that Human whore.
SPOCK: Aghh!
(he attacks the bully, pushing him into the bowl and getting into a fight)
[Vulcan Hallway]
SPOCK: They called you a traitor.
SAREK: Emotions run deep within our race. In many ways, more deeply than in Humans. Logic offers a serenity Humans seldom experience. The control of feelings, so that they do not control you.
SPOCK: You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan, and yet you married a Human.
SAREK: As ambassador to Earth, it is my duty to observe and understand Human behavior. Marrying your mother was logical. Spock, you are fully capable of deciding your own destiny. The question you face is: which path will you choose? This is something only you can decide.
[Vulcan Hallway - Years later]
AMANDA: Spock, come here. Let me see you.
SPOCK: No.
AMANDA: Spock. There's no need to be anxious. You'll do fine.
SPOCK: I am hardly anxious, mother. And fine has variable definitions. Fine is unacceptable.
AMANDA: Okay.
SPOCK: May I ask a personal query?
AMANDA: Anything.
SPOCK: Should I choose to complete the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr, and purge all emotion, I trust, you will not feel it reflects judgment upon you.
AMANDA: Oh, Spock. As always, whatever you choose to be, you will have a proud mother.
[Vulcan Science Academy]
(Spock is in front of the Vulcan Council)
MINISTER: You have surpassed the expectations of your instructors. Your final record is flawless. With one exception, I see that you have applied to Starfleet as well.
SPOCK: It was logical to cultivate multiple options.
MINISTER: Logical but unnecessary. You're hereby accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy. It is truly remarkable, Spock, that you have achieved so much, despite your disadvantage. All rise!
SPOCK: If you would clarify, Minister. To what disadvantage are you referring?
MINISTER: Your Human mother.
SPOCK: Council, Ministers, I must decline.
MINISTER: No Vulcan has ever declined admission to this academy.
SPOCK: Then, as I am half-human, your record remains untarnished.
SAREK: Spock. You have made a commitment to honor the Vulcan way.
MINISTER: Why did you come before this council today? Was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel?
SPOCK: The only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration. Live long and prosper.
[Riverside Shipyard Bar - Iowa]
(Uhura enters the bar)
UHURA: Hey. Hey. Hi. (she addresses people as she enters the main bar area)
UHURA: Hi. I'd like a Klavnian fire tea. uhh... three Budweiser classics, two Cardassian sunrises, and a...
SAL THE BARTENDER: Try the Slusho, it's good.
UHURA: The Slusho mix, thank you.
KIRK: That's a lot of drinks for one woman.
UHURA: And a shot of Jack straight up.
KIRK: Make that two, shots on me.
UHURA: Her shot's on her. (to Kirk) Thanks but no thanks.
KIRK: Do you at least want to know my name before you completely reject me?
UHURA: I'm fine without it.
KIRK: You are fine without it. It's Jim, Jim Kirk. If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna have to make one up.
UHURA: It's Uhura.
KIRK: Uhura, no way. That's the name I was gonna make up for ya. Uhura what?
UHURA: Just Uhura.
KIRK: They don't have last names on your world?
UHURA: Uhura is my last name.
KIRK: Well then, they don't have first names on your world?
(Kirk gets up and goes closer to Uhura)
KIRK: So, you're a Cadet, you're studying... what's your focus?
UHURA: Xenolinguistics. You have no idea what that means.
KIRK: The study of alien languages, morphology, phonology, syntax. It means you've got a talented tongue.
UHURA: I'm impressed. For a moment there, I thought you were just a dumb hick who only has sex with farm animals.
KIRK: Well, not only.
(Uhura laughs)
"CUPCAKE": This townie isn't bothering you, right?
UHURA: Oh, beyond belief. But it's nothing I can't handle.
KIRK: You could handle me, if that's an invitation.
CUPCAKE: Hey! You better mind your manners.
KIRK: Oh, relax cupcake, it was a joke.
(Kirk puts his arm on "Cupcake" as the officer then gets belligerent)
CUPCAKE: Hey, farmboy, maybe you can't count, but there are four of us and one of you.
KIRK: Well, some more guys and then it'll be an even fight.
(a fight breaks out)
UHURA: Stop it! Stop it, all of you! Enough! Guys, he's had enough!
(a big whistling sound is heard)
PIKE: Outside. All of you. Now!
MALE CADET: Yes, sir.
(various grumblings as the bar empties, including "He wouldn't even listen" and "what a freak")
PIKE: You all right, son?
KIRK: You can whistle really loud, you know that?
[Later that evening]
PIKE: You know, I couldn't believe it when the bartender told me who you are.
KIRK: Who am I, Captain Pike?
PIKE: Your father's son.
KIRK: (to bartender) Can I get another one?
PIKE: For my dissertation, I was assigned the USS Kelvin. Something I admired about your dad, he didn't believe in no-win scenarios.
KIRK: Sure learned his lesson.
PIKE: Well, it depends on how you define winning. You're here, aren't ya?
KIRK: Thanks.
PIKE: You know, that instinct to leap without looking, that was his nature too, and in my opinion, it's something Starfleet's lost.
KIRK: Why are you talking to me, man?
PIKE: 'Cause I looked up your file while you were drooling on the floor. Your aptitude tests are off the charts, so what is it? You like being the only genius-level repeat offender in the midwest?
KIRK: Maybe I love it.
PIKE: Look, so your dad dies. You can settle for less than an ordinary life. Or do you feel like you were meant for something better? Something special? Enlist in Starfleet.
KIRK: Enli-- (laughs) You guys must be way down in your recruiting quota for the month.
PIKE: If you're half the man your father was Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could be an officer in four years. You could have your own ship in eight. You understand what the Federation is, don't you? It's important. It's a peacekeeping and humanitarian armada.
KIRK: We done?
PIKE: I'm done. Riverside Shipyard. The shuttle for new recruits leaves tomorrow oh-eight hundred. You know, your father was Captain of a starship for twelve minutes. He saved eight hundred lives, including your mother's. And yours. I dare you to do better.
(Pike leaves as Kirk stares at a Kelvin-shaped salt shaker)
[Riverside Shipyard]
(Kirk rides his motorcycle outside the shipyard, where he briefly witnesses the building of the Enterprise. After a moment, he rides toward the recruits' shuttle)
SHIPYARD ENGINEER: Nice ride, man.
KIRK: It's yours. (to Pike) Four years? I'll do it in three.
[Shuttlecraft]
KIRK: (to Cupcake and his crew) At ease, gentlemen.
(Kirk finds a seat and seatbelt, and spies Uhura)
KIRK: Never did get that first name.
FEMALE ACADEMY OFFICER: You need a doctor.
MCCOY: I told you people, I don't need a doctor. I am a doctor.
OFFICER: You need to get back to your seat.
MCCOY: I had one in the bathroom with no windows.
OFFICER: You need to get back to your seat, now!
MCCOY: I suffer from aviophobia. It means fear of dying in something that flies.
OFFICER: Sir, for your own safety, sit down or else I'll make you sit down.
MCCOY: Fine.
OFFICER: Thank you.
PIKE: (over comm) This is Captain Pike. We've been cleared for takeoff.
MCCOY: (to Kirk) I may throw up on you.
KIRK: I think these things are pretty safe.
MCCOY: Don't pander to me, kid. One tiny crack in the hull, and our blood boils in thirteen seconds. A solar flare might pop up and cook us in our seats. And wait 'til your sitting pretty with a case of Andorian shingles. See if you're still so relaxed when your eyeballs are bleeding. Space is disease and danger after darkness and silence.
KIRK: Well, I hate to break this to you, but Starfleet operates in space.
MCCOY: Yeah, well, got nowhere else to go. The ex-wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce. All I've got left is my bones.
KIRK: Jim Kirk.
MCCOY: McCoy, Leonard McCoy.
[Narada - Three years later]
ROMULAN: Captain Nero. You've been requested on the bridge, sir. Ayel, say's it's time.
[Narada Bridge]
AYEL: Sir, we've arrived at the coordinates you calculated.
ROMULAN 2: There's nothing here.
AYEL: What are your orders?
NERO: We wait. We wait for the one who allowed our home to be destroyed, as we've been doing for twenty-five years.
AYEL: And once we've killed him?
NERO: Kill him? I'm not gonna kill him. I'm gonna make him watch.
(a black hole opens and the Jellyfish exits)
NERO: Capture that ship. Welcome back, Spock.
[Starfleet Academy grounds]
MCCOY: Why are you so happy?
KIRK: I don't know what you're talking about.
MCCOY: No, I don't suppose you do.
KIRK: Hello, ladies. (to McCoy) I'm taking the test again.
MCCOY: You got to be kidding me.
KIRK: Yeah, tomorrow morning and I want you there.
MCCOY: You know, I've got better things to do than to watch you embarrass yourself for a third time. I'm a doctor, Jim, I'm busy.
KIRK: Bones, it doesn't bother you that no one's ever passed the test?
MCCOY: Jim, it's the Kobayashi Maru. No one passes the test, and no one goes back for seconds, let alone thirds.
KIRK: I got to study.
MCCOY: Study my ass.
[Dorm Room]
(Kirk and Gaila, a green-skinned Orion, are together on her bed)
GAILA: Ahh.. Jim, I think I love you.
KIRK: That's so weird.
GAILA: Lights.
MALE COMPUTER VOICE: Lights On.
GAILA: Did you just say "that is so weird?"
KIRK: Yeah, I did but I...
GAILA: You don't love me too?
(the door opens)
GAILA: Oh, that's my roommate.
KIRK: I thought you said she was gone for the night?
GAILA: Well, obviously, she's not. Quick, you've got... get under the bed.
KIRK: Under...
GAILA: Look, under the bed.
KIRK: C'mon
GAILA: She can't see you.
KIRK: Why not?
GAILA: Because I promised her I'd stop bringing guys back to the room.
KIRK: Wait, how many guys have you...?
GAILA: Down, just down. (to Uhura) Hey.
UHURA: Hey.
GAILA: How are you?
UHURA: Good. The strangest thing. I was in the long-range sensor lab...
GAILA: Yeah... I thought all night.
UHURA: I was tracking solar systems and I picked up an emergency transmission.
GAILA: Really?
UHURA: Yeah, from a Klingon prison planet.
GAILA: No?
UHURA: Yeah. A Klingon armada was destroyed. Forty-seven ships.
GAILA: So, you're not going back to the lab tonight?
UHURA: Gaila, who is he?
GAILA: Who's who?
UHURA: The mouth-breather hiding under your bed.
(Kirk gets out from under the bed)
KIRK: You could hear me breathing?
UHURA: You!
KIRK: Big day tomorrow.
UHURA: You're gonna fail.
KIRK: Gaila, see you around.
UHURA: Get out.
KIRK: If I pass, will you tell me your first name?
UHURA: No. Goodnight.
KIRK: I think the fact that you picked up a transmission is very interesting.
[Kobayashi Maru Scenario]
UHURA: We're receiving a distress signal from the USS Kobayashi Maru. The ship has lost power and is stranded. Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them.
KIRK: Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them, Captain.
MCCOY: Two Klingon vessels have entered the neutral zone and are locking weapons on us.
KIRK: That's okay.
MCCOY: That's okay?
KIRK: Yeah, don't worry about it.
[Overhead]
INSTRUCTOR 1: Did he say don't worry about it?
INSTRUCTOR 2: Is he not taking the simulation seriously?
[Scenario]
MCCOY: Three more Klingon warbirds decloaking and targeting our ship. I don't suppose this is a problem either.
CADET: They're firing, Captain.
KIRK: Alert medical bay to prepare to receive all crew members from the damaged ship.
UHURA: And how do you expect us to rescue them when we're surrounded by Klingons, Captain.
KIRK: Alert medical.
MCCOY: Our ship is being hit. Shields at sixty percent.
KIRK: I understand.
MCCOY: Well should we, I don't know, fire back?
KIRK: No. (he eats an apple)
MCCOY: Of course not.
(the power seems to go out for a second)
[Overhead]
INSTRUCTOR 2: What is this? What's going on?
[Scenario]
KIRK: Hmm... arm photons, prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds.
CADET: Yes, sir.
MCCOY: Jim, their shields are still up.
KIRK: Are they?
MCCOY: No. They're not.
KIRK: Fire on all enemy ships. One photon each should do it, so don't waste ammunition.
CADET: Target locked and acquired on all warbirds. Firing.
(the warbirds are easily dispatched)
CADET: All ships destroyed, Captain.
KIRK: Begin rescue of the stranded crew. So, we've managed to eliminate all enemy ships, no one onboard was injured, and the successful rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is underway.
[Overhead]
INSTRUCTOR 3: How the hell did that kid beat your test?
SPOCK: I do not know.
[Starfleet Academy Hearing]
BARNETT: This session has been called to resolve a troubling matter. James T. Kirk, step forward. Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this council, suggesting that you violated the ethical code of conduct pursuant to Regulation One-Seven point three of the Starfleet Code. Is there anything you care to say before we begin, sir?
KIRK: Yes, I believe I have the right to face my accuser directly.
(Spock rises from the audience)
BARNETT: Step forward, please. This is Commander Spock. He's one of our most distinguished graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru exam for the last four years. Commander?
SPOCK: Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed to install and activate a subroutine to the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test.
KIRK: Your point being?
BARNETT: In academic vernacular, you cheated.
KIRK: Let me ask you something, I think we all know the answer to. The test itself is a cheat, isn't it? You programmed it to be unwinnable.
SPOCK: Your argument precludes the possibility of a no-win scenario.
KIRK: I don't believe in no-win scenarios.
SPOCK: Then, not only did you violate the rules, you also failed to understand the principle lesson.
KIRK: Please, enlighten me.
SPOCK: You of all people should know, Cadet Kirk. A Captain cannot cheat death.
KIRK: I of all people.
SPOCK: Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, assumed command of his vessel before being killed in action, did he not?
KIRK: I don't think you like the fact that I beat your test?
SPOCK: Furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test.
KIRK: Enlighten me again.
SPOCK: The purpose is to experience fear. Fear in the face of certain death. To accept that fear, and maintain control of oneself and one's crew. This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain.
AIDE: Excuse me, sir.
(the aide hands something to Admiral Barnett)
BARNETT: We've received a distress call from Vulcan. With our primary fleet engaged in the Laurentian system, I hereby order all cadets to report to Hangar One immediately. Dismissed.
KIRK: (to McCoy) Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
MCCOY: I don't know, but I like him.
[Hangar One]
COMMANDER: ...Regula I, Tracy, USS Farragut... USS Enterprise, McGrath, USS ... Vader, USS Hood. Welcome to Starfleet, godspeed.
KIRK: He didn't call my name. Commander! Sir, you didn't call my name. Kirk, James T.?
COMMANDER: Kirk, you're on academic suspension. That means you're grounded, until the Academy board rules.
MCCOY: Jim, the board'll rule in your favor. Most likely. Look, Jim, I got to go.
KIRK: Yeah, get going. Be safe.
OFFICER: Excuse me.
KIRK: Yeah, yeah, sorry.
MCCOY: Dammit. Come with me.
FEMALE ASSIGNER: ...USS Neutral, Uhura, USS Farragut, Petroski, USS Antares. Go to your stations and good luck.
(Gaila smiles wide past Uhura, who has a dour expression)
KIRK: Bones, where are we going?
MCCOY: You'll see.
(they pass Uhura)
UHURA: Commander, a word.
SPOCK: Yes, Lieutenant?
UHURA: Was I not one of your top students?
SPOCK: Indeed you were.
UHURA: And did I not, on multiple occassions, demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity, and I quote, "an unparalleled ability to identify sonic anomalies in subspace transmission tests?"
SPOCK: Consistently, yes.
UHURA: And while you were well aware that of own qualified desires to serve on the USS Enterprise, I'm assigned to the Farragut?
SPOCK: It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism.
UHURA: No, I'm assigned to the Enterprise.
(Spock presses some buttons on his PADD)
SPOCK: Yes, I believe you are.
UHURA: Thank you.
[Medical Bay]
KIRK: What are you doing?
MCCOY: I'm doing you a favor. I couldn't just leave you there looking all pathetic. Take a seat. I'm going to give you a vaccine against viral infection from Melvaran mud fleas.
KIRK: Oww! What for?
MCCOY: Give you the symptoms.
KIRK: What are you talking about?
MCCOY: You're going to start to lose vision in your left eye.
KIRK: Yeah, I already have.
MCCOY: Oh, and you're going to get a really bad headache and a flop sweat.
KIRK: You call this a favor?
MCCOY: Yeah, you owe me one.
[Hangar One]
MALE ASSIGNER: Kirk, James T. He's not cleared for duty aboard the Enterprise.
MCCOY: Medical Code states the treatment and transport of a patient to be determined at the discretion of his attending physician, which is me. So, I'm taking Mister Kirk aboard. Or would you like to explain to Captain Pike why the Enterprise warped into a crisis without one of its senior medical officers?
MALE ASSIGNER: As you were.
KIRK: As you were.
MCCOY: C'mon.
[Shuttlecraft Gilliam]
(as the shuttlecrafts head to their various ships, including the Enterprise)
KIRK: I might throw up on you.
MCCOY: Oh Jim, you got to look at this. Jim, look!
KIRK: What?
(they look out at Earth Spacedock and the massive Enterprise)
[Enterprise Shuttlebay]
MCCOY: We need to get you changed.
KIRK: I don't feel right. I feel like I'm leaking.
MCCOY: Hell, it's that pointy-eared bastard.
(Kirk and McCoy swerve to narrowly avoid being spotted by Spock. Spock enters a turbolift and arrives on the bridge)
[Bridge]
PIKE: Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Captain. Engineering reports ready for launch.
PIKE: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden voyage of our newest flagship deserves more pomp and circumstance than we can afford today. A christening will just have to be our reward for a safe return. Carry on.
(Pike takes the Captain's chair)
PIKE: (to the communicator) All decks, this is Captain Pike, prepare for immediate departure. Helm, thrusters.
SULU: Moorings retracted, Captain. Dock control reports ready. Thrusters, fired. Separating from Spacedock.
(the Enterprise and other ships leave the Spacedock)
SULU: The fleet's cleared Spacedock, Captain. All ships ready for warp.
PIKE: Set course for Vulcan.
SULU: Aye aye, Captain. Course laid in.
PIKE: Maximum warp. Punch it.
(Sulu "punches it" but the ship only flares up and does not enter warp. Everyone stares at Sulu)
PIKE: Lieutenant, where's Helmsman McKenna?
LIEUTENANT: He has lungworm, sir. He couldn't report to his post.
SULU: I'm Hikaru Sulu.
PIKE: And you are a pilot, right?
SULU: Uh, very much so, sir. I'm, uh, not sure what's wrong.
PIKE: Is the parking break on?
SULU: Uh, no. I'll figure it out, I'm just, uh...
SPOCK: Have you disengaged the external inertial dampener?
(Sulu presses a couple buttons)
SULU: Ready for warp, sir.
PIKE: Let's punch it.
(they enter warp)
[Sickbay]
KIRK: Where are we?
MCCOY: Medical bay.
KIRK: This is worth it.
MCCOY: A little suffering's good for the soul.
KIRK: (to a nurse) Hi, how are you.
MCCOY: Over here.
KIRK: My mouth is itchy, is that normal?
MCCOY: Well, those symptoms won't last long. I'm going to give you a mild sedative.
KIRK: Agh, I wish I didn't know you.
MCCOY: Don't be such an infant.
(he applies the sedative to Kirk)
KIRK: Aggh... how long is it supposed to...
(he falls unconscious)
MCCOY: Unbelievable.
[Bridge]
SULU: Engines at maximum warp, Captain.
PIKE: Russian whiz kid, what's your name? Chenko, Chirpoff?
CHEKOV: Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, sir.
PIKE: Fine, Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, begin shipwide mission broadcast.
CHEKOV: Yes, sir, happy to.
(he punches in a code)
CHEKOV: Ensign authorization code nine-five-wictor-wictor-two
COMPUTER VOICE: Authorization Not Recognized.
CHEKOV: Ensign authorization code nine-five-vwictor-vwictor-two
COMPUTER VOICE: Access Granted.
CHEKOV: (shipwide broadcast) May I have your attention, please. At twenty-two hundred hours, telemetry detected at an anomaly in the neutral zone. What appeared to be a lightning storm in space.
[Engineering]
CHEKOV: (on monitor) Soon after, Starfleet received a distress signal from Wulcan High Command that their planet was experiencing seismic actiwity.
[Shuttlebay]
CHEKOV: (on monitor) Our mission is to assess the condition of Wulcan, and to assist in the ewacuations if necessary.
[Sickbay]
CHEKOV: (on monitor) We should be arriving at Wulcan within three minutes. Thank you for your time.
(Kirk awakes in front of the monitor)
Kirk: Lightning storm!
MCCOY: Uh, Jim, you're awake. How do you feel?
KIRK: ah.. uh...
MCCOY: Good god, man!
KIRK: What? Ah!
(His hands come into view, extremely swollen)
KIRK: What the hell's this?!
MCCOY: Reaction to the vaccine. Dammit! Nurse Chapel, I need fifty cc's of cortazone.
CHAPEL: (offscreen) Yes, sir.
(Kirk replays Chekov's message as McCoy scans Kirk)
KIRK: Nice. We got to stop the ship!
[Corridor]
(Kirk and McCoy are frantically running through the corridors)
MCCOY: Jim! I'm not kidding, we need to keep your heart rate down!
KIRK: Computer, locate crew member Uhura!
MCCOY: I haven't seen a reaction this severe since med school.
KIRK: We're flying into a trap!
MCCOY: Dammit Jim, stand still.
(McCoy hypos Kirk in the neck)
KIRK: Ow! Stop it!
(Kirk runs and finds Uhura)
KIRK: Uhura, Uhura.
UHURA: Kirk, what are you doing here?
KIRK: The transmission from the Klingon prison planet, what exactly was...
UHURA: Oh my god, what's wrong with your hands?!
(McCoy begins scanning Kirk again)
KIRK: It-it-it... look, who is responsible for the Klingon attack? Was the ship Romul...
UHURA: Was the ship what?
KIRK: (to McCoy) What's happening to my mouth?
MCCOY: You got numb tongue?
KIRK: (mumbled) Numb tongue!
MCCOY: I can fix that!
(McCoy briefly leaves)
UHURA: Was the ship what?
KIRK: (mumbled) Romulan!
UHURA: What?
KIRK: (mumbled, but clearer) Romulan
UHURA: Romulan?
KIRK: (mumbled) Yeah
UHURA: Yes.
KIRK: (mumbled) Yes!
(Kirk is hypoed again by McCoy)
KIRK: (mumbled) Ahh... dammit!

[Narada Bridge]
AYEL: Lord Nero, seven Federation ships are on their way.

MCCOY: Jim!
UHURA: What's going on?!
MCCOY: Jim, come back!
UHURA: Kirk!

KIRK: Captain!
MCCOY: Jim, no!
KIRK: Captain Pike, we have to stop the ship!
PIKE: Kirk, how the hell did you get on board the Enterprise!
MCCOY: Captain, this man's under the influence of a severe reaction of a Melvaran flea vaccine, completely...
KIRK: Bones, Bones...
MCCOY: ...delusional. I take full responsibility.
KIRK: Vulcan is not experiencing a natural disaster. It's being attacked by Romulans.
PIKE: Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you've had enough attention for one day. McCoy take him back to medical, we'll have words later.
MCCOY: Aye Captain.
KIRK: Look, sir, that same anomaly...
PIKE: Mister Kirk...
SPOCK: Mister Kirk is not cleared to be aboard this vessel.
KIRK: Look, I get it, you're a great orator. I'd love to do it again with you to.
SPOCK: I can remove the Cadet...
KIRK: Try it! This Cadet is trying to save the bridge.
SPOCK: By recommending a full stop mid-warp during a rescue mission?
KIRK: It's not a rescue mission, listen, it's an attack.
SPOCK: Based on what facts?
KIRK: That same anomaly, a lightning storm in space that we saw today, also occurred on the day of my birth. Before a Romulan ship attacked the USS Kelvin. (to Pike) You know that, sir, I read your dissertation. That ship which had formidable and advanced weaponry was never seen or heard from again. The Kelvin attack to place on the edge of Klingon space and at twenty-three hundred hours last night, there was an attack. Forty-seven Klingon warbirds destroyed by a Romulan, sir. It was reported that the Romulans were in one ship, one massive ship.
PIKE: And you know of this Klingon attack how?
UHURA: Sir, I intercepted and translated the message myself. Kirk's report is accurate.
KIRK: We're warping into a trap, sir. The Romulans are waiting for us, I promise you that.
SPOCK: The Cadet's logic is sound. And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics, we would be wise to accept her conclusion.
PIKE: Scan Vulcan space, check for any transmissions in Romulan.
MALE LIEUTENANT: Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish the Romulan language from Vulcan.
PIKE: (to Uhura) What about you? Do you speak Romulan, Cadet?
UHURA: Uhura. All three dialects, sir.
PIKE: Uhura, relieve the lieutenant.
UHURA: Yes sir.
PIKE: Hannity, hail the USS Truman.
HANNITY: All the other ships are out of warp, sir, and have arrived at Vulcan, but we seemed to have lost all contact.
UHURA: Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission, or transmission of any kind in the area.
KIRK: It's because they're being attacked.
PIKE: Shields up, red alert.
SULU: Arrival in Vulcan in five seconds... four... three... two...
(the arrive into a huge space battle)
PIKE: Emergency evasive.
OFFICER: Running sir.
(bridge officers begin their reporting)
PIKE: Damage report.
OFFICER: Deflector shields are holding.
PIKE: All stations. Engineer Olson, report.
PIKE: Full reverse, come about starboard ninety degrees, drop us underneath and...
(everyone is amazed at the massive Narada)
[Narada Bridge]
ROMULAN WEAPONS OFFICER: Sir, there's another Federation ship.
NERO: Destroy it, too.
WEAPONS OFFICER: Fire torpedoes.
[Enterprise Bridge]
SPOCK: Captain, they're locking torpedoes.
PIKE: Avert auxiliary power from port nacelles to forward shields.
(torpedoes slam into the Enterprise)
PIKE: Sulu, status report.
SULU: Shields at thirty-two percent. They're weapons are powerful, sir. We can't take another hit like that.
PIKE: Get me Starfleet Command.
SPOCK: Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered some kind of high energy pulse device into the Vulcan atmosphere. It's signal appears to be blocking our communications and transporter abilities.
PIKE: All power to forward shields. Prepare to fire all weapons.
[Narada Bridge]
WEAPONS OFFICER: Weapons ready.
(Nero recognizes the starship on his viewscreen)
NERO: Wait! The hull. Magnify.
WEAPONS OFFICER: Yes, sir.
(the NCC-1701 registry is shown)
[Enterprise Bridge]
UHURA: Captain, we're being hailed.
NERO: (on viewscreen) Hello.
PIKE: I'm Captain Christopher Pike. To whom am I speaking.
NERO: (on viewscreen) Hi Christopher, I'm Nero.
PIKE: You've declared war against the Federation. Withdraw. I'll agree to arrange a conference with Romulan leadership at a neutral location.
NERO: (on viewscreen) I do not speak for the Empire. We stand apart, as does your Vulcan crewmember, isn't that right, Spock?
SPOCK: Pardon me, I do not believe that you and I are acquainted?
NERO: (on viewscreen) No, we're not. Not yet. Spock, there's something I would like you to see. Captain Pike, your transporter has been disabled. As you can see by the rest of your armada, you have no choice. You will man a shuttle, come aboard the Narada, for negotiations. That is all.
(the viewscreen is turned off. Pike gets up)
KIRK: He'll kill you, you know that.
SPOCK: Your survival is unlikely.
KIRK: Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy. Going over to that ship is a mistake.
SPOCK: I, too, agree. You should re-think your strategy.
PIKE: I understand that. I need officers who have been trained in advanced hand-to-hand combat.
SULU: I have training, sir.
PIKE: Come with me. Kirk, you too. You're not supposed to be here anyway. Chekov, you have the conn.
CHEKOV: Aye aye Captain.
[Narada Bridge]
NERO: Prepare the red matter.
AYEL: Yes, sir.
(Ayel leaves for the Jellyfish, where he extracts a small portion of red matter and loads it into the drill platform apparatus)
[Enterprise Engineering]
PIKE: Without transporters, we can't beam off the ship, we can't assist Vulcan, we can't do our job. Mister Kirk, Mister Sulu, Engineer Olson, will space-jump from the shuttle. You will land on that machine they lowered into the atmosphere that's scrambling our gear. You'll get inside. You'll disable it, then you'll beam back to the ship. Mister Spock, I'm leaving you in command of the Enterprise. Once we have transport capabilities, communications back up, you'll contact Starfleet, report what the hell's going on here. And if all else fails, fall back, rendezvous with the fleet in the Laurentian system. Kirk, I'm promoting you to first officer.
KIRK: What?
SPOCK: Captain, please, I apologize. The complexities of Human pranks escape me.
PIKE: It's not a prank, Spock. And I'm not the Captain, you are. Let's go.
KIRK: Sir, after we knock out that drill, what happens to you?
PIKE: Oh, I guess you'll have to come and get me. (to Spock) Careful with the ship, Spock. She's brand new.
[Bridge]
(Spock takes the Captain's chair)
SPOCK: (to communicator) Doctor Puri, report.
MCCOY: (on comm) It's McCoy. Doctor...
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: ...Puri was on deck six. He's dead.
[Bridge]
SPOCK: Then you have just inherited his responsibility as Chief Medical Officer.
[Sickbay]
MCCOY: Yeah, tell me something I don't know.
[Shuttle 89]
CREWMAN: (over loudspeaker) Shuttle eight nine, USS Enterprise. You are cleared forward...
KIRK: You got the charges right?
OLSON: Oh yeah. I can't wait to kick some Romulan ass. Right?
KIRK: Yeah.
OLSON: Oh yeah.
(the shuttle departs the Enterprise)
KIRK: (to Sulu) So, what kind of combat training do you have?
SULU: Fencing.
PIKE: Pre-jump.
(the group put their EV helmets on and prepare for the space-jump)
CREWMAN: (over comm) ...You are clear from USS Enterprise airspace...
PIKE: Gentelmen, we're approaching the drop zone. You have one shot to land on that platform. You may have to fix this to pull your 'chute as late as possible. Three... two... one. Remember, the Enterprise won't be able to beam you back until you turn off that drill. Good luck.
(Pike pulls a lever, sending the three out of the shuttle)
[Enterprise Bridge]
CHEKOV: Away team is entering the atmosphere, sir. Twenty thousand meters.
(the team enter the atmosphere, Pike's shuttle comes up to the Narada)
CHEKOV: Approaching the platform at fifty-eight hundred meters.
KIRK: (on comm) Kirk to Enterprise.
[Vulcan atmosphere]
KIRK: Distance to target, five thousand meters.
[Bridge]
CHEKOV: Forty-six hundred meters from the platform.
[Atmosphere]
SULU: Forty-two hundred meters to target.
KIRK: Four thousand meters.
[Bridge]
SULU: (on comm) Three thousand meters.
[Atmosphere]
OLSON: Three thousand meters.
KIRK: Two thousand meters.
SULU: Pull your chute.
(Sulu and then Kirk pull their chutes. Olson does not.)
OLSON: Two thousand meters!
KIRK: C'mon, pull your chute, Olson!
OLSON: Not yet! Fifteen hundred meters!
SULU: Open your chute!
OLSON: Yeah!
KIRK: Olson, pull your chute!
OLSON: One thousand meters.
(Olson pulls his chute. He slams into the platform and is sucked into the energy beam)
KIRK: Olson!
[Bridge]
CHEKOV: Olson is gone, sir.
(Kirk lands and nearly does the same as Olson, but retracts his parachute instead)
CHEKOV: Kork has landed, sir.
[Drill Platform]
(some Romulans arrive to attack Kirk)
KIRK: Ahh!
(a Romulan and Kirk inadvertently shoot down Sulu. Sulu gets snagged and takes out a retractable sword to fight off the Romulans with Kirk)
SULU: Give me your hand! C'mon!
(He pulls up Kirk from near death falling off the platform)
SULU: Olson had the charges!
KIRK: I know!
SULU: What do we do!
KIRK: This!
(they disable the platform with the Romulans' disruptor rifles)
[Enterprise Bridge]
UHURA: The jamming signal is gone. Transport abilities are reestablished.
CHEKOV: Transporter control is reengaged, sir.
SPOCK: Chekov, run gravitational sensor, and I want to know what they are doing on the planet.
CHEKOV: Aye commander, ack, Captain. Sorry, Captain.
[Narada]
(more Romulan over the loudspeaker)
ROMULAN OFFICER: The drill's been sabotaged, sir, but we have reached the planet's core.
NERO: Launch the red matter.
(the red matter is launched in a case right past Kirk and Sulu)
[Drill Platform]
KIRK: (to wrist communicator) Kirk to Enterprise. They just launched something at the planet, through the hole they just drilled.
[Enterprise Bridge]
KIRK: (on comm) Do you copy Enterprise?
COMMAND OFFICER: Yes, sir.
(various other activity on the bridge)
CHEKOV: Captain, gravitational sensors are off the scale. If my calculations are correct, they're creating a singularity, that will consume the planet.
SPOCK: They're creating a black hole at the center of Vulcan?
CHEKOV: Yes sir.
SPOCK: How long does the planet have?
CHEKOV: (shrugs) Minutes, sir. Minutes.
(Spock gets out of his chair)
SPOCK: (to Uhura) Alert Vulcan command center to signal a planetwide evacuation on all channels, all frequencies. (to another officer) Maintain standard orbit.
FEMALE OFFICER: Yes, sir.
UHURA: Where are you going?
SPOCK: To evacuate the Vulcan High Council. They are tasked with protecting our cultural history and my parents will be among them.
UHURA: Can't you beam them out?
SPOCK: It is impossible. They will be in the katric ark. I must get them myself. (to Chekov) Chekov, you have the conn.
CHEKOV: Aye. Uh, yay.
[Drill Platform]
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Beam us outta here!
[Enterprise transporter room]
FEMALE TRANSPORTER CHIEF: Standby, locking on your signal.
[Narada]
NERO: Retract the drill. Let's move out.
AYEL: Yes, sir. (to other officers) Pull it up!
[Drill Platform]
(the platform begins retract and Sulu falls off)
TRANSPORTER CHIEF: (over comm) I can't lock onto you. Don't move. Don't move!
SULU: Kirk!
KIRK: Sulu!
(Kirk jumps off)
[Vulcan atmosphere]
KIRK: Sulu! Hold on!
(Kirk catches up with Sulu, and they continue their freefall into Vulcan)
KIRK: I got ya! Now, pull my 'chute!
(The chute flies out and breaks off leaving Kirk and Sulu continuing their fall)
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise! We're falling without a chute! Beam us up!
[Transporter room]
TRANSPORTER CHIEF: I'm trying. I can't lock on your signal, you're moving too fast.
[Bridge]
CHEKOV: I can do that. I can do that! Take the conn!
FEMALE OFFICER: Aye, sir.
ANOTHER FEMALE OFFICER: The black hole's expanding. We won't reach minimum safe distance if we don't leave immediately.
[Corridor]
(Chekov continues his frantic run to the transporter room)
CHEKOV: Move, move, move, move, move! I can do that, I can do that! Move, move, move move!
[Transporter room]
CHEKOV: Give me radio control, I can lock on!
KIRK: (over comm) Beam us out!
[Vulcan atmosphere]
KIRK: Enterprise, where are you?
[Transporter room]
CHEKOV: Hold on, hold on!
KIRK: (over comm) Now, now, now!
[Vulcan atmosphere]
KIRK: Do it now! Now, now, now!
[Transporter room]
CHEKOV: Don't move! Hold on! Computating gravitational pull and... gotcha!
(Kirk and Sulu slam into the transporter pad)
CHEKOV: Oh! ё моё!
KIRK: God.
SULU: Thanks.
KIRK: No problem.
(Spock enters)
SPOCK: Clear the pad. I'm beaming to the surface.
KIRK: The surface of what? What, are you going down there? Are you nuts? Spock, you can't do that?!
SPOCK: Energize.
KIRK: Spock!
(Spock transports to Vulcan and heads to the Katric ark)
[Katric ark]
AMANDA: Spock?
SPOCK: The planet has only seconds left. We must evacuate. Mother, now!
(a few grunts as various Vulcan elders are killed by the falling statues and debris)
[Vulcan surface]
AMANDA: Oh!
SPOCK: Spock to Enterprise. Get us out now!
[Transporter room]
CHEKOV: Locking on you.
[Vulcan surface]
CHEKOV: (over comm) Don't move. Stay right where you are.
(they begin glowing for transport)
[Transporter room]
CHEKOV: Transport in five...
[Vulcan surface]
CHEKOV: (over comm) Four... three... two...
(Amanda falls off the collapsing cliff)
SPOCK: No, no!
[Transporter room]
(alarms begin blaring)
CHEKOV: I'm losing her. I'm losing her, I'm losing her! No, I've lost her.
(the group, minus Amanda, are transported up. Vulcan is shown imploding as Enterprise leaves the area)
[Sickbay]
SPOCK: (voice-over) Acting captain's log, stardate twenty-two fifty-eight point four two. We have had no word from Captain Pike. I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero. Nero, who has destroyed my home planet and most of its six billion inhabitants. While the essence of our culture has been saved in the elders who now reside upon the ship, I estimate no more than ten thousand have survived. I am now a member of an endangered species.
(various cuts and bruises are being fixed, including Kirk's hands and the Vulcan elders)
[Bridge]
(Spock exits the bridge and enters the turbolift. Uhura follows him)
[Turbolift]
(Uhura stops the lift)
UHURA: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
(she kisses Spock)
UHURA: What do you need? Tell me. Tell me.
(Spock turns the lift back on)
SPOCK: I need everyone to continue performing admirably.
UHURA: Okay.
(they kiss some more and Spock exits unto a corridor)
[Narada torture chamber]
(Pike is strapped to a table)
NERO: You must have a lot of questions for me. I only have one for you. I need the subspace frequencies of Starfleet's border protection grids. Specifically, those surrounding Earth. Christopher, answer my question.
PIKE: No. You answer for the genocide you just committed against a peaceful...
NERO: I prevented genocide. In my time, where I come from, this is a simple mining vessel. I chose a life of honest labor, to provide for myself and the wife who was expecting my child. I was off-planet, doing my job, while your Federation did nothing and allowed my people to burn while my planet broke in half. And Spock, he didn't help us. He betrayed us.
PIKE: No, no, you're confused. You've been misinformed. Romulus hasn't been destroyed. It's out there right now. You're blaming the Federation for something that hasn't happened.
NERO: It has happened! I watched it happen! I saw it happen! Don't tell me it didn't happen! And when I lost her, I promised myself retribution. And for twenty-five years, I planned my revenge against the Federation, and forgot what it was like to live a normal life. I did not forget the pain. That's the pain that every surviving Vulcan now shares. My purpose, Christopher, is to not simply avoid the destruction of the home that I love, but to create a Romulus that exists free of the Federation. You see, only then will she be truly saved. That is why I will destroy all the remaining Federation planets, starting with yours.
PIKE: Then we have nothing left to discuss.
(Nero grabs a Centaurian slug with tongues)
NERO: You will give me the frequencies to disable Earth's defenses. Centaurian slugs. They latch unto your brainstem, and release a toxin that will force you to answer. Frequencies please, sir.
PIKE: Christopher Pike, Captain, USS Enterprise, serial number...
NERO: As you wish.
(they forcibly open Pike's mouth and drop in the slug as he screams)
[Enterprise Bridge]
SPOCK: Have you confirmed that Nero is headed for Earth?
UHURA: Their trajectory suggests no other destination, Captain.
SPOCK: Thank you, Lieutenant.
(Kirk is seated in the Captain's chair)
KIRK: Earth may be his next stop, but we have to assume every Federation planet's a target.
SPOCK: Out of the chair.
CHEKOV: Well, if the Federation is a target, why didn't they destroy us?
SULU: Why would they? Why waste the weapons? You know... we obviously weren't a threat.
SPOCK: That is not it. He said he wanted me to see something. The destruction of my home planet.
MCCOY: How the hell did they do that, by the way? Where did the Romulans get that kind of weaponry?
SPOCK: The engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create a black hole may suggest an answer. Such technology could theoretically be manipulated to create a tunnel through space-time.
MCCOY: Dammit man, I'm a doctor, not a physicist. Are you actually suggesting they're from the future?!
SPOCK: If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
MCCOY: How poetic.
KIRK: Then, what would an angry, future Romulan want with Captain Pike?
SULU: As Captain, he does know details of Starfleet's defenses.
KIRK: What we need to do is catch up to that ship. Disable it, take it over, and get Pike back.
SPOCK: We are technologically outmatched in every way. A rescue attempt would be illogical.
CHEKOV: Nero's ship would have to drop out of warp for us to overtake him.
KIRK: Then, what about assigning engineering crews to try and boost our warp gear?
SPOCK: Remaining power and crew are being used to repair radiation leaks on the lower decks...
KIRK: Okay, alright. There's got to be some way...
SPOCK: ...we must gather with the rest of Starfleet, to balance the terms of the next engagement.
KIRK: There won't be a next engagement. By the time we've gathered, it'll be too late. But you say he's from the future, knows what's going to happen, then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.
SPOCK: You are assuming that Nero knows how events are predicted to unfold. To the contrary, Nero's very presence has altered the flow of history, beginning with the attack on the USS Kelvin, culminating in the events of today, thereby creating an entire new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party.
UHURA: An alternate reality?
SPOCK: Precisely. Whatever our lives might have been, if the time continuum was disrupted, our destinies have changed. Mr. Sulu, plot a course to the Laurentian system warp factor three.
KIRK: Spock, don't do that. Running back to the rest of the fleet for a, a, a confab is a massive waste of time...
SPOCK: ...orders issued by Captain Pike when he left...
KIRK: He also ordered us to go back and get him. Spock, you are captain now! You have to be...
SPOCK: I am aware of my responsibilities, Mister...
KIRK: Every second we waste, Nero's getting closer to his next target.
SPOCK: That is correct and why I am instructing you to accept the fact that I alone...
KIRK: I will not allow us to go backwards...
MCCOY: Jim!
KIRK: ...instead of hunting Nero down!
SPOCK: Security. Escort him out.
(two security officers grab Kirk and he starts to fight them off)
SECURITY OFFICER: Hey!
MCCOY: No, Jim!
(Spock stops the fight with a Vulcan nerve pinch)
SPOCK: Get him off this ship.
(Kirk is shot out of the Enterprise in an escape pod, into Delta Vega)
[Escape Pod]
KIRK: Aggh. Computer, where am I.
COMPUTER VOICE: Location: Delta Vega. Class-M planet. Unsafe. There is a Starfleet outpost fourteen kilometers to the northwest. Remain in your pod until ... summoned authorities.
KIRK: Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
(Kirk exits the pod)
[Delta Vega surface]
KIRK: (to his communicator) Stardate twenty-two fifty-eight point four two, four uh, four whatever. Acting Captain Spock has marooned me on Delta Vega, what I believe to be a violation of security protocol forty-nine point oh nine, covering the treatment of prisoners aboard as starship.
(Kirk is suddenly chased by a creature)
KIRK: Whoah! Agh!
(The creature is attacked and killed by a bigger monster)
KIRK: Ahhhh!
(He's chased by the monster down a hill and into a cave)
[Delta Vega cave]
(Kirk's nearly eaten by the monster when the elder Spock shows up with a torch, scaring away the monster)
SPOCK PRIME: James T. Kirk.
KIRK: Excuse me?
SPOCK PRIME: How did you find me?
KIRK: How do you know my name?
SPOCK PRIME: I have been, and always shall be, your friend.
KIRK: Wha... oh, look... uh, I don't know you.
SPOCK PRIME: I am Spock.
KIRK: Bullshit.
(some time later, they are around a fire)
SPOCK PRIME: It is remarkably pleasing to see you again, old friend. Especially after the events of today.
KIRK: Uh, sir I appreciate what you did for me today, but, but if you were Spock you would know we're not friends at all. You hate me, you marooned me here for mutiny.
SPOCK PRIME: Mutiny?
KIRK: Yes.
SPOCK PRIME: You are not the Captain?
KIRK: No, no. Umm... you're the Captain. Pike was taken hostage.
SPOCK PRIME: By Nero.
KIRK: What do you know about him?
SPOCK PRIME: He is a particularly troubled Romulan. Please, allow me. It will be easier.
(Spock Prime attempts to mind meld with Kirk)
KIRK: Whoah, whoah. What are you doin'?
SPOCK PRIME: Our minds. One and together.
(Spock Prime melds with Kirk)
SPOCK PRIME: One hundred twenty-nine years from now, a star will explode, and threaten to destroy the galaxy.
[Space]
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) That is where I'm from, Jim. The future. The star went supernova...
(a star explodes)
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) ...consuming everything in its path. I promised the Romulans that I would save their planet...
[Romulus]
(a group of Romulans are seen with Spock Prime)
[Jellyfish Hangar]
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) We outfitted our fastest ship.
[Jellyfish]
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) Using red matter, I would create a black hole, which would absorb the exploding star.
[Space]
(the Jellyfish goes through space)
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) I was en route, when the unthinkable happened. The supernova destroyed Romulus.
(Romulus is consumed by the nova)
[Jellyfish]
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) I had little time. I had to extract the red matter, and shoot it into the supernova.
(he loads up a drop of red matter and it's shot into the star)
[SPACE]
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) As I began my return trip, I was intercepted.
[Jellyfish]
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) He called himself Nero. Last of the Romulan Empire.
[SPACE]
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) In my attempt to escape, both of us were pulled into the black hole.
(the Narada and Jellyfish are sucked through time)
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) Nero went through first. He was the first to arrive.
(scenes from the beginning of the film and the destruction of the Kelvin)
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) Nero spent the next twenty-five years awaiting my arrival. But what was years for Nero, was only seconds for me.
[Jellyfish]
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) I went through the black hole. Nero was waiting for me.
[Narada]
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) He held me responsible for the loss of his world.
(Spock Prime kneels before Nero)
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) He captured my vessel, and spared my life for one reason. So that I would know his pain.
[Delta Vega surface]
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) He beamed me here, so that I could observe his vengeance. As he was helpless to save his planet, I would be helpless to save mine.
(Spock Prime witnesses the destruction of Vulcan from Delta Vega)
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) Billions of lives lost, because of me, Jim. Because, I failed.
[Delta Vega cave]
(the meld ends and Kirk is sweaty and crying)
SPOCK PRIME: Forgive me. Emotional transferrance is an effect of the mind meld.
KIRK: So you do feel?
SPOCK PRIME: Yes.
KIRK: Going back in time, you changed all our lives.
SPOCK PRIME: Jim, we must go. There is a Starfleet outpost not far from here.
KIRK: Wait. Where you came from, did I know my father?
SPOCK PRIME: Yes. You often spoke of him as being your inspiration for joining Starfleet. He proudly lived to see you become Captain of the Enterprise.
KIRK: Captain?
SPOCK PRIME: A ship we must return you to as soon as possible.
[Enterprise Bridge]
SULU: Warp three, sir.
CHEKOV: Course one-five-one-mark-three, Laurentian system, sir.
SPOCK: Thank you, gentlemen.
MCCOY: You wanted to see me?
SPOCK: Yes, Doctor. I am aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours. I recognize that supporting me as you did must have been difficult.
MCCOY: Is that a thank you?
SPOCK: I am simply acknowledging your difficulties.
MCCOY: Permission to speak freely, sir.
SPOCK: I welcome it.
MCCOY: Do you? Okay, then. Are you out of your Vulcan mind? Are you making the logical choice, sending Kirk away? Probably, but the right one? You know, back home we got a saying, "If you're gonna ride in the Kentucky Derby, you don't leave your prize stallion in the stable."
SPOCK: A curious metaphor, Doctor, as a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential.
MCCOY: My god, man. You could at least act like it was a hard decision.
SPOCK: I intend to assist in the effort to reestablish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale was better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I will gladly defer to your medical expertise. Excuse me.
(Sarek enters the bridge)
MCCOY: Green-blooded hobgoblin.
[Delta Vega outpost]
(Keenser is heard speaking in an alien language as Spock Prime and Kirk enter the outpost)
KIRK: Hello!
(Keenser walks up to them and leads them through the outpost. They come up to Montgomery Scott and Keenser gets his attention)
SCOTT: What? You realize how unacceptable this is?
SPOCK PRIME: Fascinating.
KIRK: What?
SCOTT: Yeah, I'm sure you're just doing your job, but could you not come a wee bit sooner? Six months I've been here, living off Starfleet protein nibs and a promise of a good meal. And I know exactly what's going on here, okay. Punishment, isn't it? Ongoing, for something that was clearly an accident.
SPOCK PRIME: You are Montgomery Scott.
KIRK: You know him?
SCOTT: Aye, that's me. You're in the right place. Unless there's another hard-working, equally starved Starfleet officer around.
KEENSER: Me.
SCOTT: Keenser, shut up! You don't eat anything. You can eat like a bean, and you're done. I'm talking about food. Real food. But, you're here now, so thank you. Where is it?
SPOCK PRIME: You are, in fact, the Mister Scott who postulated the theory of transwarp beaming.
SCOTT: That's what I'm talking about. How'd you think I wound up here? I had a little debate with my instructor on the issue of relativistic physics and how it pertains to subspace travel. He seemed to think that the range of transporting something like a, like a grapefruit, was limited to about a hundred miles. I told him that I could not only beam a grapefruit from one planet to the adjacent planet in the same system, which is easy by the way, I could do it with a lifeform. So, I tested it on Admiral Archer's prized beagle.
KIRK: Wait, I know that dog. What happened to it?
SCOTT: I'll tell you when it reappears. I don't know. I do feel guilty about that.
SPOCK PRIME: What if I told you that your transwarp theory was correct? That it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is travelling at warp speed?
SCOTT: I think if that equation had been discovered, I'd have heard about it.
SPOCK PRIME: The reason you haven't heard about it, Mister Scott, is because you haven't discovered it yet.
SCOTT: I'm a, uh, what... Are you from the future?
KIRK: Yeah. He is, I'm not.
SCOTT: Well that's brilliant. Do they still have sandwiches there?
(a wee bit later, in the Delta Vega transporter area)
SCOTT: Well, she's a wee bit dodgy. Shield emitters are totally bandjacked(?), as well as a few other things. In you go. So, the Enterprise has had its maiden voyage, has it? She is one well endowed lady. I'd like to get my hands on her ample nacelles, if you'll pardon the engineering parlance.
[Delta Vega shuttle]
SCOTT: (to Spock Prime) Except, the thing is, even if I believed you, right, where you're from, what I've done, I don't, by the way, you're still talking about beaming aboard the Enterprise while she's traveling faster-than-light, without a proper receiving pattern. (to Keenser) Get off there! It's not a climbing free(?). (to Spock Prime) The notion of transwarp beaming is like, trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse. What's that?
SPOCK PRIME: Your equation for achieving transwarp beaming.
SCOTT: (mumbles something) Imagine that. It never occurred to me to think of space as the thing that was moving.
KIRK: (to Spock Prime) You're coming with us, right?
SPOCK PRIME: No, Jim. That is not my destiny.
KIRK: Your dest... He... the other Spock is not going to believe me. Only you can explain what's gonna happen.
SPOCK PRIME: Under no circumstances, can he be aware of my existence. You must promise me this.
KIRK: You're telling me I, I can't tell you that I'm following your own orders. Why not? What happens?
SPOCK PRIME: Jim, this is one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero, you alone must take command of your ship.
KIRK: How? Over your dead body?
SPOCK PRIME: Preferably not. However, there is Starfleet regulation six-one-nine. Six-one-nine states that any command officer who's emotionally compromised by the mission at hand, must resign said command.
KIRK: So, so you're saying that I have to emotionally compromise you guys?
SPOCK PRIME: Jim, I just lost my planet. I can tell you, I am emotionally compromised. What you must do is get me to show it.
SCOTT: Aye then, Laddie. Live or die, let's get this over with.
(Kirk and Scott enter the transporter areas. Keenser attempts to as well, but Scott pushes him out)
SCOTT: (to Keenser) You cannae come with me. Go on.
KIRK: (to Spock Prime) You're coming back in time, changing history, it's cheating.
SPOCK PRIME: A trick I learned from an old friend. (he does the salute) Live long and prosper.
(they transport away as Keenser whimpers)
[Enterprise Engineering]
(Kirk is seen transporting on the ship)
KIRK: Mister Scott!
(a pounding occurs on the wall next to Kirk)
KIRK: Mister Scott, can you hear me!
(Scott is stuck in the coolant/water pipes)
KIRK: Uh... uh.. hold on a second! Oh no. Don't worry I... Oh. No, no!
(Kirk sees that Scott's pipe route takes him directly into a spinning turbine area, and he quickly finds a computer to open the release valve)
COMPUTER VOICE: Turbine release valve activated.
(Scott falls out of the release valve)
KIRK: You alright? You alright?!
SCOTT: My heads buzzing, and I'm soaked, but otherwise I'm fine!
[Bridge]
CHEKOV: Captain Spock, detecting unauthorized access to water turbine control board.
SPOCK: Bring up the video.
(Video of Kirk and Scott is shown)
SPOCK: (to communicator) Security, seal the engineering deck. We have intruders in turbine section three. Set phasers to stun.
[Engineering]
(Kirk and Scott run wildly out of Engineering until security catches up with them)
CUPCAKE: Halt! Come with me, cupcake!
[Bridge]
(Kirk and Scott are escorted onto the bridge)
SPOCK: (to Scott) Who are you?
SCOTT: I'm with him.
KIRK: He's with me.
SPOCK: We're travelling at warp speed. How did you manage to beam aboard this ship?
KIRK: You're the genius, you figure it out.
SPOCK: As Acting Captain of this vessel, I order you to answer the question.
KIRK: Well I'm not telling, Acting Captain. What di... What, now, that doesn't frustrate you, does it? My lack of cooperation. That, that doesn't make you angry.
SPOCK: (to Scott) Are you a member of Starfleet?
SCOTT: I.. um.. yes. Can I get a towel, please?
SPOCK: Under penalty of court martial, I order you to explain to me how you were able to beam aboard this ship while moving at warp.
SCOTT: Well...
KIRK: Don't answer him.
SPOCK: You will answer me.
SCOTT: I'd rather not take sides.
KIRK: What is it with you, Spock? Hmm? Your planet was just destroyed, your mother murdered, and you're not even upset.
SPOCK: If you're presuming that these experiences in any way impede my ability to command this ship, you are mistaken.
KIRK: And yet you were the one who said fear was necessary for command. Did you see his ship? Do you see what he did?
SPOCK: Yes, of course I did.
KIRK: So, are you afraid or aren't you?
SPOCK: I will not allow you to lecture me about the merits of emotion.
KIRK: Then why don't you stop me.
SPOCK: Step away from me, Mister...
KIRK: What is it like not to feel anger or heartbreak or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the death of the woman who gave birth to you?
SPOCK: Back away from me...
KIRK: You feel nothing! It must not even compute for you! You never loved her!
(fight between Spock and Kirk breaks out, ending up with Spock nearly strangling Kirk on the helm console)
SAREK: Spock!
SPOCK: I am no longer fit for duty. I hereby relinquish my command, based on the fact that I have been emotionally compromised. Please note the time and date in the ship's log.
(Spock leaves the bridge, followed by Sarek)
SCOTT: I like this ship! You know, it's exciting.
MCCOY: Well, congratulations, Jim. Now we've got no Captain and no goddamn first officer to replace him.
KIRK: Yeah we do.
(Kirk takes the Captain's chair)
MCCOY: What?
SULU: Pike made him first officer.
MCCOY: You've got to be kidding me.
KIRK: Thanks for the support.
UHURA: I sure hope you know what you're doing, Captain.
KIRK: So do I. (to communicator) Attention crew of the Enterprise, this is James Kirk.
[Corridor]
(Spock is walking through the corridor)
KIRK: (over comm) Mister Spock has resigned commission and advanced me to Acting Captain. I know you were all expecting to regroup with fleet, but I'm ordering a pursuit course of the enemy ship to Earth. I want all departments at battle stations and ready in ten minutes.
[Bridge]
KIRK: (to communicator) Either we're going down, or they are. Kirk out.
[Transporter room]
(Spock is staring at the transporter pad as Sarek enters)
SAREK: Speak your mind, Spock.
SPOCK: That would be unwise.
SAREK: What is necessary is never unwise.
SPOCK: I'm as conflicted as I once was as a child.
SAREK: You will always be a child of two worlds. I am grateful for this. And for you.
SPOCK: I feel anger for the one who took mother's life. An anger I cannot control.
SAREK: I believe, as she would say, do not try to. You asked me once why I married your mother. I married her because I loved her.
[Bridge]
(as the crew talks, Chekov does calculations on a board)
KIRK: Whatever the case, we need to get aboard Nero's ship undetected.
MCCOY: And just go in there guns blazing, Jim. No...
SULU: I'm telling you the math doesn't support...
CHEKOV: Captain Kork, Captain Kork!
KIRK: Yes, Chekov. What is it?
CHEKOV: Based on the fastest course from Wulcan, I have projected that Nero will travel past Saturn. Like you said, we need to stay inwisible to Nero or he'll destroy us. If Mister Scott can get us to warp factor four, and if we drop out of warp behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan, the magnetic distortion from the planet's rings will make us inwisible to Nero's sensors. From there, as long as the drill is not actiwated we can beam aboard the enemy ship.
SCOTT: Aye, that might work.
MCCOY: Wait a minute, kid, how old are you?
CHEKOV: Seventeen, sir.
MCCOY: Oh, oh good, he's seventeen.
SPOCK: Doctor, Mister Chekov is correct. I can confirm his telemetry. If Mister Sulu is able to maneuver us into position, I can beam aboard Nero's ship, steal back the black hole device, and if possible, bring back Captain Pike.
KIRK: I won't allow you to do that, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Romulans and Vulcans share a common ancestry. Our cultural similarities will make it easier for me to access the ship's computer to locate the device. Also, my mother was Human, which makes Earth the only home I have left.
KIRK: I'm coming with you.
SPOCK: I would cite regulation, but I know you will simply ignore it.
KIRK: See, we are getting to know each other.
[Narada]
NERO: Prepare the drill.
(the platform lowers to Earth)
[Enterprise Bridge]
SULU: All stop in three... two... one. Give me one quarter impulse burst for five seconds. I'll do the rest with thrusters, on my mark.
CHEKOV: Aye.
SULU: Fire. (to comm) Transporter room.
[Transporter room]
SULU: (on comm) We are in position above Titan.
SCOTT: Really? Fine job, Mister Sulu. Well done.
(Spock, Kirk, and Uhura enter)
KIRK: How are we, Scotty?
SCOTT: Unbelievably, sir, the ship is in position.
KIRK: (to comm) Whatever happens, Mister Sulu, if you think
you have the tactical advantage, you fire on that ship, even if we're still onboard. That's an order.
[Bridge]

SULU: Yes, sir.
KIRK: (on comm) Otherwise, we'll contact the Enterprise when we're ready to be beamed back.
SULU: Good luck.
[Transporter room]
(Kirk gets on the transporter pad with Spock. Spock and Uhura have an intimate moment)
SPOCK: (to Uhura) I will be back.
UHURA: You better be. I'll be monitoring your frequency.
SPOCK: Thank you, Nyota.
(Uhura leaves)
KIRK: So her first name's Nyota?
SPOCK: I have no comment on the matter.
SCOTT: Okey-dokey then. If there's any common sense in the design of the enemy ship, I should be putting you somewhere in the cargo bay. There shouldn't be a soul in sight.
KIRK: Energize.
[Narada "cargo bay"]
(Kirk and Spock beam into an area with many Romulans. Screaming in the Romulan language is heard as they notice the away team's presence and a firefight begins)
ROMULAN: (to comm) Captain, we have Starfleet officers aboard the ship. One of them is Vulcan.
[Narada Bridge]
NERO: No. (he runs to get his lieutenant) Ayel!
[Narada cargo bay]
KIRK: (to Spock) I'll cover ya.
SPOCK: Are you certain?
KIRK: Yeah, I got ya.
(Spock melds with an injured Romulan)
KIRK: Do you know where it is? The black hole device?
SPOCK: And Captain Pike.
(the drill platform starts the drill beam)
[Starfleet Academy]
CADET: Quickly!
(Cadets are running frantically)
[Enterprise corridor]
(Uhura runs toward the bridge)
UHURA: Move!
[Enterprise Bridge]
CHEKOV: They have actiwated the drill.
UHURA: Communication and transport are inoperative. Sulu, please tell me you have them. Otherwise, we won't be able to beam them back.
SULU: Kirk and Spock are on their own now.
(Kirk and Spock find the Jellyfish)
[Jellyfish]
SPOCK: I foresee a complication. The design of this ship is far more advanced than I've anticipated.
COMPUTER VOICE: Voice print and face recognition analysis enabled. Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.
KIRK: Wow, that's weird.
SPOCK: Computer, what is your manufacturing origin?
COMPUTER VOICE: Stardate twenty-three eighty-seven. Commissioned by the Vulcan Science Academy.
SPOCK: (to Kirk) It appears that you have been keeping important information from me.
KIRK: You'll be able to fly this thing, right?
SPOCK: Something tells me I already have.
KIRK: Good luck.
SPOCK: Jim, the statistical likelihood that our plan will succeed is less than four point three percent.
KIRK: It'll work.
SPOCK: In the event that I do not return, please tell Lieutenant Uhura...
KIRK: Spock, it'll work.
(Kirk leaves and Spock sits down. The chair moves into position)
SPOCK: Fascinating.
COMPUTER VOICE: Startup sequence initiated.
[Narada drill area]
(Kirk finds Nero)
KIRK: Nero order your men to disable the drill or I will--
(Ayel knocks Kirk down)
NERO: I know your face, from Earth's history.
(a fight between Nero and Kirk ensues, with Nero gaining the upper hand)
NERO: James T. Kirk was considered to be a great man. He went on to captain the USS Enterprise, but that was another life. A life I will deprive you of, just like I did your father.
(Elsewhere, Spock destroys the drill platform)
ROMULAN OFFICER: (on comm) Captain Nero, the Vulcan ship has been taken, the drill has been destroyed.
NERO: Spock! Spooockk!
(Nero runs off, leaving Kirk and Ayel)
[Narada bridge]
NERO: Open a channel
ROMULAN OFFICER: Yes, sir.
NERO: (to Spock) Spock, I knew I should have killed you when I had the chance.
[Jellyfish]
SPOCK: I hereby confiscate this illegally obtained ship and order you to surrender your vessel. No terms.
[Narada bridge]
NERO: That ship, take it out.
ROMULAN OFFICER: Sir, if you ignite the red matter...
NERO: I want Spock dead, now!
(the Jellyfish warps away)
ROMULAN OFFICER: He went to warp, sir.
NERO: Go after him!
ROMULAN OFFICER: Yes, sir!
[Narada drill area]
(Kirk attempts to jump away, but Ayel grabs him by the throat)
AYEL: Your species is even weaker than I expected.
KIRK: I can't...
AYEL: You can't even speak. What?
KIRK: I got your gun.
(Kirk shoots Ayel and leaves)
[Narada bridge]
(the Jellyfish heads straight for the Narada)
NERO: What's he doing?
[Jellyfish]
COMPUTER VOICE: Ambassador Spock, you are on a collision course.
[Narada bridge]
NERO: Fire everything!
[Jellyfish]
COMPUTER VOICE: Incoming missiles. If the ship is hit, the red matter would be ignited.
SPOCK: Understood.
[Narada bridge]
ROMULAN OFFICER: Captain, I've picked up another ship.
(the Enterprise appears firing full phasers at the Narada)
[Narada torture room]
(Kirk shoots off a Romulan and finds Pike on his table)
PIKE: What are you doing here?
KIRK: Just following orders. Enterprise go!
(the Jellyfish collides with the Narada. Pike, Kirk, and Spock are transported on the Enterprise)
[Transporter room]
KIRK: Nice timing, Scotty.
SCOTT: Ha ha ha ha! I've never beamed three people from two targets onto one pad before.
MCCOY: Jim!
KIRK: Bones!
MCCOY: (re: Pike) I've got him.
SCOTT: That was pretty good.
[Enterprise bridge]
(Kirk and Spock enter)
CHEKOV: Captain, the enemy ship is losing power. Their shields are down, sir.
KIRK: Hail them now.
CHEKOV: Aye.
(Nero appears on the viewscreen as a black hole appears in the Narada)
KIRK: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise. Your ship is compromised. Your too close to the singularity to provide assistance, which we will provide.
SPOCK: (to Kirk) Captain, what are you doing?
KIRK: You show them compassion may be the only way to earn peace with Romulus. It's logic, Spock. Thought you'd like that.
SPOCK: No, not really. Not this time.
NERO: (on viewscreen) I would rather suffer the end of Romulus a thousand times. I would rather die in agony than accept assistance from you.
KIRK: You got it. Arm phasers, fire everything we got.
SULU: Yes, sir.
(the Narada is shot upon before disappearing in the black hole)
KIRK: Sulu, let's go home!
SULU: Yes, sir!
(the Enterprise gets really close to the black hole)
KIRK: Why aren't we at warp?
CHEKOV: We are, sir.
KIRK: Kirk to engineering. Get us out of here, Scotty.
[Engineering]
SCOTT: You bet your arse, Captain. Captain McCoy(?), the gravity well has got us!
[Bridge]
KIRK: Go to maximum warp. Push it!
[Engineering]
SCOTT: I'm giving her all that she's got, Captain?
[Bridge]
(the bridge begins cracking)
KIRK: All she's got isn't good enough. What else you got?
[Engineering]
SCOTT: Okay. If we eject the core and detonate, the blast could be enough to push us away! I cannae promise anything, though!
[Bridge]
KIRK: Do it, do it, do it!
[Engineering]
SCOTT: (to an engineer) Go!
ENGINEER: Yes, sir!
(multiple warp cores appear to be launched. A shockwave appears and pushes the Enterprise to safety)
[Hangar One]
OFFICER: (over comm) Engineer fourteen to engine room two.
SPOCK: Father.
SPOCK PRIME: I am not our father. There are so few Vulcans left, we cannot afford to ignore each other.
SPOCK: Then why did you send Kirk aboard, when you alone could have explained the truth?
SPOCK PRIME: Because, you needed each other. I could not deprive you of the revelation of all that you could accomplish together. Of a friendship, that would define you both, in ways you cannot yet realize.
SPOCK: How did you persuade him to keep your secret?
SPOCK PRIME: He inferred that universe-ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise.
SPOCK: You lied.
SPOCK PRIME: Oh, I... I implied.
SPOCK: A gamble.
SPOCK PRIME: An act of faith. One I hope that you will repeat in the future at Starfleet.
SPOCK: In the face of extinction, it is only logical I resign my Starfleet commission and help rebuild our race.
SPOCK PRIME: And yet, you can be in two places at once. I urge you to remain in Starfleet. I have already located a suitable planet on which to establish a Vulcan colony. Spock, in this case, do yourself a favor. Put aside logic. Do what feels right. Since my customary farewell would appear oddly self-serving, I shall simply say good luck.
[Starfleet Academy hearing]
BARNETT: This assembly calls Captain James Tiberius Kirk. Your inspirational valor and supreme dedication to your comrades is in keeping with the highest traditions of service, and to reflect utmost credit to yourself, your crew, and the Federation, it is my honor to award you with this commendation. By Starfleet Order two-eight four five five, you are hereby directed to report to Admiral Pike, USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.
(Kirk walks over to wheelchaired Pike)
KIRK: I relieve you, sir.
PIKE: I am relieved.
KIRK: Thank you, sir.
PIKE: Congratulations, Captain. Your father would be proud.
SPOCK PRIME: (watching overhead) Thrusters on full.
[Enterprise bridge]
SULU: Engineering thrusters and impulse engines at your command, sir.
CHEKOV: Weapons systems and chutes on standby.
UHURA: Dock control reports ready, Captain.
(Kirk enters the bridge in his Captain's uniform)
KIRK: Bones, buckle up. (to comm) Scotty...
[Engineering]
KIRK: (on comm)... how we doin'?
SCOTT: Dilithium chambers at maximum, Captain. (to Ensign Keenser) Get down!
[Bridge]
KIRK: Mister Sulu, prepare to engage thrusters.
(Spock enters the bridge)
SPOCK: Permission to come aboard, Captain.
KIRK: Permission granted.
SPOCK: As you have yet to select a first officer, respectfully, I would like to submit my candidacy. Should you desire, I can provide character references.
KIRK: It would be my honor, Commander. (to Sulu) Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
SULU: Thrusters on standby.
KIRK: Take us out.
SULU: Aye aye, Captain.
[Space]
SPOCK PRIME: (voice-over) Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new lifeforms and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.

There's a moment of orderly silence
before a football play begins.


  
Players are in position,
linemen are frozen,


  
and anything's possible.


  
TV commentary


  
Then, like a traffic accident,
staff begins to randomly collide.


  
From the snap of the ball
to the snap of the first bone


  
is closer to four seconds than five.


  
TV commentary


  
One Mississippi.


  
Joe Theismann,
the Redskins quarterback


  
takes the snap and hands off
to his running back.


  
TV commentary


  
Two Mississippi.


  
It's a trick play, a flea flicker,


  
and the running back tosses the ball
back to the quarterback.


  
TV commentary


  
Three Mississippi.


  
Up to now the play's been defined
by the what the quarterback sees.


  
It's about to be defined
by what he doesn't.


  
Four Mississippi.


  
Lawrence Taylor is the best
defensive player in the NFL


  
and has been from the time he stepped
onto the field as a rookie.


  
TV commentary


  
TV commentary


  
He will also change the game of football
as we know it.


  
...And we'll look at it
with the reverse angle one more time.


  
And I suggest if your stomach is weak
you just don't watch ...


  
Legendary quarterback Joe Thiessman
never played another down of football.


  
Now, y'all would guess
that more often than not


  
the highest paid player on
an NFL team is the quarterback.


  
And you'd be right.


  
What you probably don't know
is that more often than not


  
the second highest paid player is,
thanks to Lawrence Taylor,


  
a left tackle.


  
Because, as every housewife knows,


  
the first check you write
is for the mortgage


  
but the second is for the insurence.


  
And the left tackle's job
is to protect the quarterback


  
form what he can't see coming.
To protect his blind side.


  
The ideal left tackle is big,
but a lot od people are big.


  
He is wide in the butt
and massive in the thighs.


  
He has long arms, giant hands
and feet as quick as a hiccup.


  
This is a rare and expensive combination


  
the need for which can be traced
to that Monday night game


  
and Lawrence Taylor.


  
For on that day he not only
altered Joe Theismann's life,


  
but mine as well.


  
Mr. Oher?


  
Mr. Oher?


  
Do you understand..?
Do you know why I'm here?


  
To... investigate?


  
Yes. To investigate.


  
Im here to investigate your odd...
predicament.


  
Do you find the odd?
Your predicament?


  
Michael?...


  
Iono.
[I don't know]


  
Can I... can I leave now?


  
No. You can't.

# Told of a life where #

They say you the coach.


  
Bert Cotton.


  
Tony Hamilton, but everybody
just calls me big Tony.


  
Hey, Big Mike! Check it out.


  
Not even locked!


  
White people are crazy.


  
I promises my mama Boo, on her deathbed


  
that I'd get my son Steven outta
public school and into a church school.


  
I appreciate that, Tony.
But I'm not involved with admissions.


  
This figured maybe I'd come
to talk to you,


  
seeing as you might need some players.


  
What kind of sport
is he playing?


  
Anything with a ball.
Boy's good, too.


  
Classes start in a week. It would
have to be for the next semester.


  
I know, what you're thinking, Coach.
But, look here, I got money, alright?


  
See I'm mechanic at Wilson's Auto
t'other side of town.


  
Look, what if somebody drops out
or moves?


  
Could they get in then?


  
"They?"
You only mentioned one son.


  
That's right, Steven.
But there's another boy.


  
- Another boy?
- Yeah.


  
Big Mike.


  
Sleeps on my coach
from time to time.


  
It's a bad deal. You know,
his mama's on the crack pipe.


  
He ain't got nobody else.


  
He just wanted to come along
for the ride.


  
- They're here?
- Yeah.


  
The little one is Steven


  
and the big one...


  
Big Mike.


  
Switch!


  
Mike!


  
Come on!


  
Mother of God....


  
Steven Hamilton's paperwork
looks acceptable to me.


  
And I believe he would do fine.


  
- But this other kid...
- Big Mike.


  
Michael Oher gives us
no reason to believe it,


  
based on his record,
that he would be successful here.


  
How bad could it be?


  
We're not exactly sure how old
he is due to lack of records.


  
He has a measured IQ of 80.
Which is 6th percentile.


  
His grade point average begins with zero.


  
Zero-point-six.


  
Everyone passed him along


  
they gave him D's so they could hand
their problem off to the next school.


  
It's a brave kid.


  
For wanting to come here.


  
For wanting a quality education.


  
An education denied him by the poor
quality of the schools he's attended.


  
I tell you most kids
with his background


  
wouldn't come within two hundred miles
of this place.


  
Coach Cotton, we understand your interest
in this young man's athletic abilities.


  
Now, he wouldn't be able to play sports
until he got his grades up anyway.


  
Forget sports!


  
Look at the wall.


  
Christian.


  
We either take that seriously
or we paint over it.


  
You don't admit Michael Oher
because of sports,


  
you admit him
because it's the right thing to do.


  
Class, this is Michael Oher
and he's new here


  
so I expect you all
to make him feel welcome.


  
Mike, just take any empty seat.


  
This is a quiz based on the information
you learned last year


  
in your science curriculum.


  
Don't worry.
It's not gonna be graded.


  
I just want to see how much
information we need to hit again.


  
Just answer whatever you know.


  
Thank you.


  
- Can I leave now?
- Yeah.


  
Take your book.


  
Why should he always stay in our home?


  
- He's gonna eat all our food.
- This is not true.


  
I try to be Christian abot the son,
alright?


  
Let somebody else be
Christian about this kid.


  
You want me to throw him out
on the street like some dog?


  
Let somebody else take
over the responsibility!


  
Should I throw him out
on the street?


  
He's here all the time.
I just want to be with you!


  
Alright. Alright.


  
You win. I'll take care of it.


  
I don't care if Patrick Ramsey
approved the chair.


  
He's the NFL quarterback
not Martha frickin' Stewart.


  
Because there's a difference between
Bunny Williams and a La-Z-boy.


  
No. See, when MTV Cribs
comes to his house


  
he's gonna be showing off
his home theatre


  
all I'm gonna see is
a brown Barca-lounger.


  
No. No, listen to me.
I'm the designer, my name's on it.


  
Deliver what I ordered!
Alright? Thank you.


  
- What'd I miss?
- Collins has just got a dig.


  
It's a girl's volleyball, Mom.
You didn't miss anything.


  
- Come on Collins! Move your feet! Come on!
- Good job, Collins!


  
Go!


  
Collins, we're gonna wait
for you outside.


  
But don't double condition in
the shower, you have homework!


  
I'm going over to Cannon's to study.


  
SJ! SJ, do not go to the
broad locker room again.


  
Come here!
SJ, come here!


  
Well, the big kid's been here
for a month


  
he's still not cutting in my class.


  
Why this Admissions do this?


  
I mean, it's not fair to us or the boy.


  
Just setting him up to fail.


  
I don't think, he has any idea
what I'm teaching.


  
And how would you know if he did?
He won't even talk.


  
- He writes.
- His name. Barely.


  
He thew this in the trash can.


  
"I look and I see white everywhere:


  
white walls, white floors,
and a lot of white people.


  
The teachers do not know I have no idea
of anything they are talking about.


  
I do not want to listen to anyone,
especially the teachers.


  
They are giving homework
and expecting me


  
to do problems on my own.


  
I have never done homework
in my life.


  
I go to the bathroom,
look in the mirror and say,


  
"This is not Michael Oher."


  
He entitled it "White Walls."


  
How's the spelling?


  
Hi.


  
Smile at 'em.


  
And that let them know
you're their friend.


  
You're Big Mike, right?


  
I'm Sean.
But everyone calls me SJ.


  
It's for Sean junior,


  
my Father's name is Sean. Sean Tuohy.


  
He was a basketball star
at Ole Miss, point guard,


  
now he owns like
a million Taco Bells.


  
Maòana'.


  
- Who's that SJ?
- Big Mike.


  
Get you feet off my dash.


  
Thank you. Put on your seatbelt!


  
Big Mike?


  
Mike, I got a call from someone
at the police departement.


  
Do you remember the story in the papers
while back about...


  
a man who fell off an overpass?


  
No one knew who he was
and or he jumped, or...


  
Umm... anyway he...
he passed away.


  
Mike, the man was your father.


  
They've been looking for somebody to
notify and they...


  
They found your name on our registry.


  
I'm really sorry, son.


  
You were close to him?


  
When's the last time you saw him?


  
Iono.


  
- He knows it!
- Who knows it and what is he know?


  
The material. Michael Oher.
I gave him this test verbally.


  
- Got even allowed?
- I see.


  
- On how big a curve?
- He's been listening all along.


  
It's amazing what he's absorbed.
Trust me. He's listening to you, too.


  
Now, his reading level is low


  
and he's got no idea how to learn
in the classroom.


  
I'm not saying he's going to pass
but Big Mike is not stupid.


  
- Hey.
- What, Mom?


  
- Good job.
- Yes?


  
Good job.
Hey, I got a question for you.


  
Go.


  
There was a little girl
about two rows back.


  
What was her name?


  
- Oh, that was Chimsey.
- Kinsey. Yeah.


  
I saw your little indian feathers
get all ruffle up.


  
Yeah. It's nice.


  
SJ, don't let this go to your head
but I've thought you were


  
very convincing in the role of...


  
- Indian Number Three.
- Yes.


  
I tried out for the Chief
but they gave it to Andy Sung.


  
I can't be sure, but I think there was
some multi-cultural bias thing working.


  
Or maybe they just thought
he'd make a better Chief.


  
Dad, he's like Chinese.


  
Yeah. You're Irish.


  
And if you weren't the Chief,
how did you get that headdress?


  
Dad, I'm gonna need a few more
of those free Quesadilla tickets.


  
And where does the acorn fall?


  
Hey, don't laugh too hard.
The Quesadilla saved our ass.


  
Don't use the a-word.


  
What is he wearing?


  
It's freezing.


  
What's his name again?


  
Big Mike.


  
Where's he going?


  
Hey, Big Mike!
Where you headin'?


  
Gym....


  
Okay.


  
Turn around.


  
Big Mike...
Stop the car.


  
Big Mike.


  
Hey, my name is Leigh Anne Tuohy.
My kids go to Wingate.


  
You said you're going to the gym?


  
The school gym's closed.


  
Why were you going to the gym?


  
Big Mike?!
Why were you going to the gym?


  
Because... it's warm.


  
Do you have any place to stay tonight?


  
Don't you dare lie to me.


  
I've seen that look many times.


  
She's about to get her way.


  
Come on.


  
Come on.


  
SJ, make room.


  
Get in the car.


  
Come on.


  
- Where are we going?
- Home.


  
Oh no! That's my favourite part.


  
So cute.


  
How'd the dork do
in the school play?


  
Umm... Okay.


  
Collins, you know Big Mike
from the School?


  
I'd give you the best bedroom
but it's full of sample boxes.


  
And the sectional in the family room
slides apart when you sleep on it.


  
At least that's what Sean says.


  
Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the coach?


  
Only when he's bad. Alright.


  
The powder room's right there and
we'll be upstairs if you need us.


  
Alright? Right.


  
Sleep tight, honey.


  
- Was this a bad idea?
- What?


  
Don't lie there and pretend like you're
not thinking the same thing as me.


  
Fine, tell me what you're thinking


  
so I know what's supposed to be
on my mind.


  
How well do you know Big Mike?


  
In case you haven't noticed
he doesn't have much to say.


  
What's the big deal?
It's just for one night, right?


  
It is just one night, right?
Leigh Anne?


  
You don't think he'll steal anything,
do you?


  
I guess we'll know in the morning.


  
Well if you hear a scream
call the insurence adjustor.


  
Mike?


  
Big Mike?!


  
Mike?


  
Big Mike!


  
You're gonna make me
walking away?


  
Alright then.


  
Where are you going?


  
Iono.


  
Well, are you spending Thanksgiving
with your family?

- SJ, come down.
- Come on.


  
- No.
- That's just fantastic.


  
Oh, y'all forget the potato salad!


  
- How's Ole Miss doing?
- xxx kicking butt.


  
Sean, salad.


  
- Thanks, Mom.
- Oh, good. Thanks, Mama.


  
Yeah, Mama.


  
- Come on!
- Come on!


  
He wants to be bet.


  
- Hey! Mom!
- Whoa.


  
But it's Thanksgiving.


  
Wow.


  
- Why are we in here?
- Shhh!


  
Shall we say a grace?


  
Heavenly Father. We thank you for
all the many blessings on this family.


  
We thank you for bringing us
a new friend.


  
And we ask that you look after us
in this holiday season


  
that we may never forget
how very fortunate we are.


  
- Amen.
- Amen.


  
- SJ, the score?
- Up by ten.


  
Collins, can you pass me
the green beans, please?


  
Don't pick it with your fingers
just take a spoon. Okay.


  
- SJ! Elbows!
- Sorry.


  
So, Big Mike. You like to shop?


  
Because tomorrow I think I'll have
to show you how it's done.


  
I got clothes.


  
You "have" clothes.


  
And an extra T-shirt in the plastic bag
does not a wardrobe make.


  
I have clothes.


  
Fine, let's go get 'em.
Just tell me where I'm going.


  
Alright. Tell me everything
I need to know about you.


  
Who takes care of you?
A mother?


  
Do you have any mother?
A grandmother maybe?


  
Tell you what, Big Mike.


  
We can do this the easy way,
or we can do it the hard way.


  
You take a pick.


  
Fine.


  
Tell me just one thing I should know
about you. Just... just one.


  
I don't like to be called Big Mike.


  
Okay.


  
Tell you what, from now on,
to me, you're Michael. Okay?


  
So,... Michael,
where we headed?


  
xxx
everything, right?


  
Savi.
Savi, give it to me.


  
She's just the ...


  
- Hey, B.J.
- Hey.


  
- That's nice
- Yo. Check it.


  
- Yay.
- S7.


  
For real. Yeah.


  
You like that?


  
- xxx
- Do you know 'em?


  
Man, I got no idea.


  
It's where your mother lives?


  
- Let's go get 'em.
- No. Don't get out.


  
Who's going to help you carrying
your clothes, Michael?


  
Don't get out of the car.


  
No way.


  
Oh, that's Big Mike, man.


  
Oh, Big Mike is in the house!


  
Big Mike! Where you been?!


  
And who's that fine thing that
driving you around like Ms. Daisy?


  
Hey, Dave.


  
You need to let me buy you new snickers, man.
I'll take care, you know.


  
I run this over here and the
whole Village, baby. Got it?


  
Look at that.


  
Hey. Hey, D. Watch this.


  
They always go for the wing.
Watch this. Big.


  
Dear snowflake.


  
You like that? Yeah.


  
She wasn't home.


  
Well, we can come back.


  
She prolly moved to a nicer place.


  
I've lived in Memphis my whole life
and never been anywhere near here.


  
You're going to take care of me, right?


  
I got your back.


  
xxx


  
Here we go.


  
Oh, we also got a parole
for the ladies.


  
But everything we got that'd fit him
is right here.


  
This is it?


  
If this is all you got, why's it say
"Big and Tall" on the sign?


  
Big and Tall.
You need "Bigger and Taller."


  
- Howl, if you need me.
- Thank you.


  
You see anything, you like?


  
Hey. I got a just
what you're looking for.


  
Well, one thing I know
about shopping is


  
that if you don't absolutely love it
in the store, you won't wear it.


  
The store is, were you like it best.


  
So before you choose something
think of yourself wearing it


  
and say to yourself:
Is this me?


  
No.


  
What about this one?


  
This isn't atrocious.


  
Alright, well, you go look over there
I go look over here.


  
Who would imagine this many clothes
are plastic?


  
Good Lord...
What is this made of?


  
That's the one?
That's the one you like?


  
Alright then.


  
Have a great day.
Learn something!


  
Don't get your panties in a wad.


  
The best part about Paris was the food.
They use sauce like we use gravy.


  
I had to join a gym the day I got back.


  
Any of y'all spent much time
on the other side of town?


  
- Where exactly are you talking about?
- Alabama Street... Hurt Village.


  
Hurt Village - that sounds like a threat.


  
You're not far off.


  
- I think it might "hurt" me to go there.
- It'd hurt your reputation to go there.


  
Well actually I'm from there
but didn't mind hard work


  
and look where I am now.


  
Eating an eighteen dollar salad.


  
And it's a little soggy to be honest.


  
Leigh Anne? What is this sudden interest
in the project?


  
Is this another one
of your charities?


  
Wait. A project for the projects.


  
Oh, that's catchy.
Money would raise itself.


  
Okay. Count me in, Leigh Anne.


  
- xxx
- xxx


  
SJ, you have two more minutes
on that playbox thing, alright?


  
Oh, Mom!


  
Michael, do you want to stay here?


  
Because... if you want to stay here...
for awhile longer...


  
I can find some time to figure out
a bedroom for you.


  
Because look at this, you've practically
ruined a ten thousand dollar coach.


  
You want to stay here, Michael?


  
I don't want to go anyplace else.


  
Well alright then.


  
- SJ, you'd better be off that playbox.
- That wasn't two minutes.


  
Good night Mrs. Tuohy.


  
I see on the admission that
we're Michael's contact


  
for medical emergencies?


  
Sean wrote that in last week.


  
We needed contact number and the ones
listed weren't in service.


  
Sean. Love that man.


  
What's this?


  
The state makes schools measure
for career aptitude in eight grade.


  
and this just came with his file.


  
What does it say
about Michael?


  
Spatial relations - third percentile.
Ability to learn - fifth percentile.


  
It's funny though. He tested in
the 98th percentile in one category.


  
- Which one?
- "Protective instincts."


  
So over here we have a desk.
Chest o'drawers.


  
Here's a night stand, a lamp, Alarm.


  
Sean says all the pro athletes use futons
if they can't find a bed big enough.


  
So I got you one of those
'cause frames xxx


  
It's not about to let that in my house.
But I got you some nicer.


  
- It's mine?
- Yes, sir.


  
What?


  
Never had one before.


  
What? A room to yourself?


  
A bed.


  
Well, you have one now.


  
Okay. Define Osmosis.


  
I think I know what.


  
It's when water passes
through the barrier.


  
That's basically right.
Michael we'll get it.


  
Name the combatants in the battle
of Waterloo.


  
I know that one. Umm...


  
The little guy, Napoleon...
He was on one side and...


  
- ...and Duku's on the other.
- Duke of Wellington.


  
Yeah. And the Duke of Wellington
and Russia or something.


  
Prussia.


  
Enough with the rugby shirts.
You look like a giant bumble bee.


  
That Taco Bell, KFC catty corner.
The Long John Silvers on the next block.


  
- You owe all of 'em?
- Yeah. We've got like hundreds.


  
Eighty five.


  
Is that why Mr. Tuohy don't
have to go to work?


  
Ho! Ho! Hey! I'm working
even when I'm not working.


  
What?


  
And y'all eat at those places for free?


  
All you want. It's awesome.


  
What do y'all do with the leftover food?
From the restaurant?


  
Well, we have to throw some of it away.
What's already been cooked.


  
- That's too bed.
- Yeah. I'd rather sell it.


  
Seems like you could give it away
or something?


  
- You should check into that, Daddy.
- Alright, I will, SJ.


  
How come we ain't eatin' at one
of your restaurants tonight?


  
Because tonight is a special occasion.


  
What?


  
I talked to Coach Cotton and he said that
Michael's grades had improved enough


  
that he can go out for spring football
in March.


  
Isn't that great?


  
Oh, man!
You are gonna crush some people!


  
- Hey, guys. How you doin'?
- Great. Thank you.


  
I've got a design book I need to get.
Sean, go check on our reservation.


  
They're gonna seat us right away.
Can't you wait after dinner.


  
Might be closed by then!
Come on, SJ.


  
- Please.
- I need some new magazines.


  
Michael, come on. Come on.


  
Collins! Collins!


  
Collins. Come on!
Your dad's already PO'ed.


  
- Lets' go. Come on.
- Over here.


  
Mike.


  
Remember this one, Mom?


  
You read it to us
like thousand times.


  
"And he gnashed his terrible teeth
and he roared his terrible roar."


  
I always liked this one.


  
Oh, Ferdinand...
Me too.


  
Michael, your mama ever read
either one of those books to you?


  
No?


  
How cute.


  
It was a good steak.


  
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Thank you for lovely dinner, Papa.


  
Here we go.


  
Michael?...


  
Who was that boy you were
talking to, at the restaurant?


  
Marcus.


  
Marcus. And he works there?


  
Yeah.


  
How do you know him?


  
He's my brother.


  
Well, we'd really like
to meet him someday.


  
Would that be okay with you?


  
I don't know where he stays.


  
When's the last time you saw him?


  
When I was little mebbe.


  
"Once upon a time in Spain, there was a
little bull and his name was Ferdinand.


  
All the other little bulls he lived with
would run and jump


  
and butt their heads together,


  
but not Ferdinand.


  
He liked to sit just quietly
and smell the flowers.


  
He had a favorite spot out in the pasture
under a cork tree.


  
It was his favorite tree


  
and he would sit in its shade all day
and smell the flowers."


  
- Good night.
- Good night.


  
What?


  
Why are you smiling?


  
I don't know. I'm just happy.
Really happy.


  
Does this happiness have anything
to do with Michael?


  
No.


  
It has everything to do with Michael.


  
Happy's good.


  
You know what I think we should do?


  
We should start a charity
for kids like Michael.


  
Okay.


  
- Maybe fund a program at Wingate.
- Sure.


  
Lord knows that school
could use a little color.


  
Michael's like a flying and milking
that place.


  
Are you listening to me?


  
I try to concentrate on one...
thing... at a time.


  
You knew I was multi-tasker
when you married me, right?


  
- I sure did.
- Alright. Okay. Let's check it.


  
Okay. Tuohy family.
Big smiles everyone!


  
And, one , two, three...


  
Michael! Michael come over here
and get in the next one.


  
Come on. Come on. Come over here.


  
Oh, come on. It's not like I'm gonna
put it on the Christmas card.


  
Okay, let's scootch in a little tighter.


  
That's good.


  
Really big smiles.


  
Okay, one, two three... say Rebels!


  
"Rebels"


  
TV commentary


  
I got it.


  
- Who's winning?
- Tennessee.


  
- Who are they playing?
- Clemson.


  
Your mom roots against Tennessee
no matter who they're playing?


  
Oh, yes, I do. With gusto.


  
She can't stand Tennessee.


  
Collie-bell, I thought you were
going to your boyfriend's?


  
I thought of hanging around here today.


  
I like that.


  
Hey, baby. There's a coupla messages
on the machine but I didn't check 'em.


  
Alright.


  
Hey, Sean, hey, Leigh Anne,
It's cousin Bobby. Happy New Years!


  
Listen, I've had about five cold ones...


  
- Of course she had. - So I'm...
I'm just gonna go ahead and ask...


  
Ya'll know there's a colored boy
in your Christmas Card?


  
What?


  
You just looked teeny-tiny next to him.
Right? Like Jessica Lange and King Kong.


  
Hey, does Michael get the family discount
at Taco Bell?


  
Because if he does Sean's gonna lose
a few stores.


  
He's a great kid.


  
Well, I say make it official
and just adopt him.


  
He's gonna be eighteen
in a few months.


  
Doesn't really make much sense
to legally adopt.


  
Leigh Anne, is this some
sort of white guilt thing?


  
What will your daddy say?


  
Umm... before or after he turns over
in his grave?


  
Daddy's been gone five years Elaine,


  
make matters worse you were
at the funeral.


  
Remember? You were Chanel
and that awful black hat.


  
Look, here's the deal.


  
I don't need y'all to approve
my choices, alright?


  
But I do ask you to respect them.


  
You've no idea what this boy's
been through.


  
And If this is going to be
some running diatribe


  
I can find an overpriced salad
a lot closer to home.


  
Leigh Anne, I'm so sorry.
We didn't intend to---


  
No. We didn't really.


  
I think, what you're doing is so great.


  
To open up your home... to him.


  
Honey, you're changing that boy's life.


  
No.


  
He's changing mine.


  
That's awesome for you,
but what about Collins?


  
What about Collins?


  
Aren't you worried, I mean,
even just a little?


  
He's a boy, a large, black boy,


  
sleeping under the same roof.


  
Shame on you.


  
I've got this.


  
Be honest with me, okay?


  
Is Michael being here making
you uncomfortable?


  
They're stupid kids,
who cares what they say.


  
What kids?


  
At school.


  
They're juvenile.


  
And what do they juvenile kids say?


  
It's really not worth repeating.


  
And don't worry about SJ;
he likes all the attention.


  
He introduces Michael
as his big brother.


  
- What about you?
- It's fine.


  
I mean, you can't just throw him
out on the street.


  
I can make other arrangements.


  
- Hi, Mike.
- Hi.


  
- Need a push?
-Yeah.


  
Higher, Mike! Higher!


  
Higher!


  
Higher!


  
Don't look down.
Don't look down!


  
- Where are you going?
- Collins?


  
Quit looking at me like that.


  
I mean, we study together at home.


  
You know how much those things weigh?
This kid's gonna make us all famous.


  
Easy, Bert, man.
It's only the spring


  
he hasn't even been through
his first practice yet.


  
No. He's a player.


  
Ready.


  
Get down, son.
Get down in your stands.


  
In your stands!


  
Go!


  
Mike! Son!


  
You fall off the block and then
you wanna shuck-shuck the blocker.


  
Right? Shuck it!
Alright? Let's go!


  
Papa?


  
How's he doing?


  
Doesn't quite have
the hang of it yet.


  
Hey, Mike. Son...


  
Shuck the blocker. Don't hold him!


  
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No.


  
Balloons! There are balloons!


  
Guys, quit looking at the balloons.
Everybody.


  
Most kids from bad situations
can't wait to be violent


  
and that comes out on the field.


  
This kid, he acts like he doesn't want
to hit anyone.


  
He's Ferdinand the Bull.


  
- What?
- Nothing.


  
I thought sure he was gonna be a player.


  
I can't believe I used up my chiefs
to get him in school.


  
I thought you said it was
your Christian duty?


  
Look, Bert. He's never played before.


  
And he won't this fall if he doesn't
improve a lot before then.


  
Who xxx made him Bert bright?


  
Unbelievable!


  
Oh, God bless me.


  
This is your summer workout sheet.


  
Now, first it says to warm up
and get loose.


  
Go ahead, get loose.


  
Are you loose?


  
Okay, next is five one hundred yard runs
to stretch out your legs.


  
Let's go home,
play some video games.


  
Look, everybody at Wingate is expecting
you to be a star football player.


  
You don't want to let
them down, do you?


  
Iono.


  
What about Dad and Mom?


  
'Cause you see, in our family
everyone's an athlete.


  
Dad was a basketball star,


  
Collins plays volleyball
and runs track.


  
And me, as you know, I do it all.


  
And Mom...
Mom was a cheerleader,


  
which doesn't exactly count
but don't tell her I said that.


  
- Okay?
- Okay.


  
Okay.


  
...fifty, fifty one,


  
fifty two, fifty three...


  
Come on and get it!
Go, go, go, go, go!


  
Come on. Five seconds left in the game!


  
Just like!
Just like!


  
High knees, high knees, high knees!
xxx baby.


  
Run like the wind!


  
Go, Michael, go!


  
...ninety eight, nine,


  
one hundred.


  
Move your feet! Move your feet!
Come on! Come on! Come on!


  
Go. There you go.


  
Get on the tackle!
Come on! Come on! Come on!


  
Come on, Michael!


  
Mrs. Tuohy?


  
I hear "Mrs. Tuohy" I look over my
shoulder for my mother-in-law.


  
Call me Leigh Anne or Mama
or almost anything else.


  
- Can you help me get something?
- What?


  
Driver's licence.


  
Why do you need a driver's licence
when you don't even have a car?


  
Michael, why do yo want
a driver's licence?


  
Something to carry.
With my name on it.


  
There's nobody named
Michael Oher in the system.


  
Another last name perhaps?


  
Look, I will sign something
that says he lives with us


  
and we'll pay for all the insurence;
whatever it takes, okay?


  
What's it gonna take?


  
- You wanna do what?!
- You heard me.


  
- Shouldn't we at least talk about this?
- What do you think we're doing?


  
And don't act like I'm going
behind your back.


  
I know you put us down as Michael's
medical contact at school.


  
There's a huge difference between
paying for broken arm


  
and being legally responsible
for someone.


  
I mean the kid we barly know.


  
That's another thing. We need
to find out more about his past.


  
He won't talk about it.
He's like an onion,


  
you have to peel him back
a layer at a time.


  
Not if you use a knife.


  
What if we took him to a child
psychologist or something?


  
- Do you really expect Big Mike---
- "Michael"


  
You really expect Michael to lie down
on a coach and talk about his childhood


  
like he's Woody Allen or something?


  
I mean, Michael's gift
is his ability to forget.


  
He's mad at no one and he really
didn't care what happened in the past.


  
You're right.


  
Excuse me?


  
"You're right?"


  
How'd those words taste
coming out of your mouth?


  
Like vinegar.


  
At least promise me you'll think about it.


  
Alright.


  
"Alright" you'll think about it or
"alright" we should do it?


  
Is there a difference?


  
Just tell Gerald to hold on the chiffonier
and I'll get by after while.


  
You don't...
I got to call you back. Bye.


  
Excuse me.


  
I'm not cutting, I'm just asking.
Let me tell you something, alright?


  
We've been sitting around here
for over an hour


  
and when i look around
and all I see


  
is people shooting the bull
and drinking coffee.


  
Who runs this place?


  
Well, I'd have it in shape in two days,
I can tell you that.


  
I'd bet you would.
How can I help you?


  
- Oh, he was first.
- No, you go ahead.


  
- I think I want to hear this
- Me too.


  
I do not appreciate
the attitude.


  
Ma'am,
now you can tell me what you want


  
or I'll make sure you wait all day.


  
Now how can I help you?


  
I'd like to become
a legal guardian.


  
Lord help that child.


  
There's very little on Michael.
Most of his files have been lost.


  
- What is in there?
- A few case notes.


  
This one describes an incident where
Officers forcibly removed Michael


  
from Denise Oher's care
when Michael was seven.


  
Quite a scene evidently.
They had to split up the kids.


  
And it's far from the worst.


  
Where is she? His mother?


  
Dunno, if you find her we got
a bunch more files we could add to.


  
- How many kids does she have?
- At least a dozen, probably.


  
If not more.
With her drug arrest record


  
my guess would be
she can't even remember.


  
May I see that?


  
So we'd need her permission, right?


  
No. Michael is a ward of the state.


  
Just apply and get a Judge
to sign off on it.


  
So you would just give him away
without even telling his mother?


  
Mrs. Oher?


  
Hi.


  
Mrs. Oher?


  
- You from the state?
- No.


  
My name is Leigh Anne Tuohy
and your son Michael lives with me.


  
And my family.


  
How's my boy? How's big Mike?


  
He's fine. He's doing really well.


  
We might have some wine
in the kitchen, if you...


  
Oh, no, no, no.
That's really kind.


  
When did you last see Michael?


  
I don't know.


  
How many foster kids you got
living with you?


  
Oh, I'm not a foster parent to Michael.
We were just helping him out.


  
- State don't pay you nothing?
- No.


  
And you feed him?
You buy him clothes, too?


  
Well, when I can find them in his size.


  
You a fine Christian lady.


  
Well I try to be.


  
This is all really nice
what you're doing,


  
but don't be surprised if one day
you wake up and he gone.


  
- What do you mean?
- He's a "runner."


  
That's what the state called him
after they took him from me.


  
Every foster home they sent him to,


  
he'd slip out the window at night
and come looking for me.


  
No matter where I was that boy would
come find me, take care of me.


  
I've had some health problems.


  
Mrs. Oher, was Michael born
under a different name?


  
Proctor. That was his Daddy's last name.


  
- Where is he?
- Ain't seen him since he left.


  
And when was that?


  
Week after was Mike born?


  
Do you have his birth certificate?


  
It's alright. I'll figure it out.


  
Mrs. Oher, you'll always
be Michael's Mama.


  
Would you like to see him?


  
No. Not this way.


  
It's Williams.


  
His last name's Williams.


  
Couldn't even remember
who the boy's father is.


  
The color is better, the graphic is bright.
It's awesome!


  
Michael, we have something
we'd like to ask you.


  
What?


  
Leigh Anne and I, we...


  
Well...


  
We'd like to become your legal guardians.


  
What's that mean?


  
What it means is, that we want to know


  
if you'd like to become
a part of this family?


  
I kinda thought I already was.


  
Well alright then.


  
Right here.


  
We got a couple of steps.


  
- Watch your big foot.
- One more.


  
One more. There we go.


  
Alright. Take off the belt.


  
Well, that's the one you want it,
didn't it?


  
Here. Here you go.
Go ahead. Take it for a ride. Go.


  
- Can I go too?
- Yeah.


  
Michael? Be careful.


  
xxx


  
- He wanted a truck?!
- Michael thinks he's a redneck.


  
Come on, Michael!


  
Okay. See, you're the ketchup, here
at Left Tackle. On the weakside.


  
The fist play is simple. "Gap."


  
Now, see, dishes means you're going
to block whoever is in front of you,


  
or on your inside shoulder if you're not
covered by a defender.


  
Now, I'll be the running back and you
show me what you're supposed to do.


  
Ready.... Hike!


  
You block him, you hit him,


  
quarterback will hand it off,
he gets the ball and...


  
Open lane to the end zone.
All there is to it.


  
What's going on here?!


  
Player Spice just scored.


  
We're going through the playbook.
Michael got move to offense.


  
Yeah. Well, when you're done, please,
put the players back in the spice cabinet.


  
- Thank you.
- No problem.


  
Oh, actually, Mom, we were
kinda waiting for you.


  
You see, the new Madden game came out
and me and Michael wanted to go get it.


  
I can't, baby. I've got a meeting
in ten minutes


  
But he can drive!


  
He can drive us.


  
Oh, yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.


  
- What do you know about this?
- I already know all about this!


  
- Alright, show me something.
- I'll tell you something, alright?


  
I'll start it. Follow my leads.


  
- Ready?
- Yes.

This is not a 40.000 dollar Oushak,
Omeed.


  
You're crazy, Leigh Anne!


  
The borders have different width.
They've been altered.


  
We'll give you seventeen tops, alright?


  
Hello?


  
Hey, hey, ma'am.
Ma'am, we check it.


  
Those are my kids. Those are my kids!


  
Oh my God!


  
- It will be okay.
- Where are they?


  
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry.
Oh my God!


  
- Michael, you okay?
- I'm fine. SJ!


  
- Michael, you're alright?
- Go help SJ!


  
I'm so sorry - so sorry!


  
Excuse me, ma'am?


  
SJ! SJ!


  
- Mom?
- Yes, baby?


  
Do you think the blood will come
out of my shirt?


  
Yes, I think the blood will come
out of your shirt.


  
Ma'am, an airbag deploys
at 200 miles an hour.


  
Your son's too small to sit
in the front seat.


  
But he's okay, right?


  
Busted lip, bruised face.


  
Usually when someone his size
gets the airbag


  
it's fractured faces, a broken neck.


  
Maybe worse.


  
Like the air bag was coming at him
then changed direction.


  
Quiet defective or something like that.


  
Your son's very, very lucky.


  
No idea. I called the insurence.
He's fine. He's fine!


  
I'll talk to you later.
I got to go. Bye.


  
SJ's fine.


  
He is. He's actually enjoying all
the attention he's getting back there.


  
Hey, Michael. Could happen to anyone,
alright? It's not your fault.


  
Honey, look at me.


  
Michael, what happened to your arm?


  
I stopped it.


  
Let's go!


  
Oher! You've got a hundred pounds
on Collis


  
and you can't keep him out
of our backfield?!


  
Hold your block until the whistle blow.
Hold it!


  
Alright, let's go!


  
What's with the camera?


  
Michael always does better when he sees
what he's supposed to be doing.


  
- Holding ... Left tackle.
- Michael! Come on!


  
Oher? Come here, son.


  
You got to hold it. Hold it inside here,
between the tits. You got it?!


  
Would you look at me, son.


  
If you grab 'em outside here like this
without horse colour thing, you just did,


  
we're going to get flagged and
I'm gonna get pissed. You hear me?


  
Alright, let's go!


  
Baby, watch my stuff, alright?


  
Okay.


  
Well at least he'll look good
coming off the bus.


  
They'll be terrified 'til they realize
he's a marshmallow.


  
Looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane.


  
Gimme a minute, Bert.


  
We're in the middle of practice,
Leigh Anne!


  
You can thank me later.


  
Come.


  
Michael,


  
do you remember
when we first met


  
we went to that horrible part of town
to buy those dreadful clothes?


  
And I was a little bit scared
and you told me not to worry about,


  
because you had my back.
Do you remember that?


  
Yes, ma'am.


  
And If anyone tried to get to me,
you would have stopped them, alright?


  
And when you and SJ were
in that car wreck,


  
what did you do to that airbag?


  
- I stopped it.
- You stopped it.


  
You stopped it.


  
This team is your family, Michael.


  
You have to protect them
from those guys.


  
Okay? Listen.


  
Okay.


  
Tony here is your quarterback, alright?
You protect his blind side.


  
When you look at him,
you think of me.


  
How you had my back.
How you have his.


  
Okay? Alright. Tony, go back.


  
Alright.


  
Oomaloompah here is your tailback.


  
When you look at him,
you think of SJ,


  
how you never let anyone
or anything to hurt him.


  
You understand me?


  
Alright. Go back.


  
- You got it?
- What about Collins and Mr. Tuohy?


  
Fine. They can be on the team too.


  
Are you gonna protect
the family, Michael?


  
Yes, ma'am.


  
Good boy. Now, go have some fun.


  
Yelling at him doesn't work, Bert.
Doesn't trust men.


  
In his experience they pretend
to care about 'til they disappear.


  
Wanna little play?


  
SJ, you're gonna wanna get this.


  
Okay.


  
Come on, Mike!


  
Alright. Michael! Come on!


  
- Yes! Michael!
- Alright! Way to go!


  
Yes!


  
Good boy.


  
Okay. What'd you say to him?


  
Should get to know your players, Bert.


  
He tested 98 percent
in protective instincts.


  
I said you could thank me later.


  
It's later, Bert.


  
So much for home field advantage.


  
You ever seen so many
Rednecks in one place?


  
Nascar, not even close.


  
Crusaders! Get Ready for
forty eight minutes of Hell!


  
You have fat ass.


  
Hey, back on the field.


  
Let me go. Hold on.
Listen up! Listen up!


  
Don't let 'em get inside your head.
Now, keep your focus.


  
- You ready?
- "Yeah"


  
- Alright. Let's go!
- "Go"


  
- Come on!
- Michael!


  
Damn, that ain't fair!


  
They got big ole' black
bear playing for 'em!


  
- What is this, a circus?
- Right.


  
Eyes forward, SJ! Sticks and stones.


  
Sticks and stones! Come on!


  
- Alright!
- Alright! Good start!


  
Let's go O! Let's go!


  
Here we go. Look at this big bull
we got right here.


  
Coming after you!
Coming after you!


  
All night. All night.


  
Don't let him get through, Oher!
Come on, son!


  
Boy! All night long, fat ass!
All night long!


  
I got you, boy. All night long!


  
That's my boy!


  
- It's alright, Michael!
- It's alright. Come on!


  
- Let's go!
- Take it off. Come on!


  
Here we go! Round two, baby! Round two!


  
- Switch! Switch!
- Get it! Get it! Get it! Go!


  
Oher, don't let them get
the inside gap zone!


  
- Come on! Use your head!
- What is Bert doing? Nothing.


  
Hey, fat boy. We're not done yet.


  
All game long, boy! All game long!


  
Alright. Alright.


  
Go!


  
Pass! Pass! Pass!


  
Stop! Oh!


  
Why another pass, Bert?


  
Hey! Where you going, fat boy?


  
Better stay out of my field.


  
You are not welcome here!
This is my field!


  
Sixty six, get beck to your own bank.


  
Bert!
Be quiet! Bert!


  
- Hello?
- Umm...


  
Enough with the trick plays, Bert.
Run the dang ball.


  
You heard it. Run the dang ball.
Run it.


  
Wait a minute, did he just
hanged up the phone?


  
- No, I think he lost service.
- He did not lose service.


  
That's my boy, Jimmy! Number 66!


  
Kicking that blue guy's ass.


  
Hey crotch mouth!


  
Yeah, you!


  
Zip it or I'll come up there
zip it for ya!


  
Sticks and stones?


  
You know what, SJ?
Just turn forward.


  
Just take up the camera and keep shoot.
Come on.


  
Lock it!


  
It's alright. Alright. Alright.
We come back.


  
Go!


  
Come on! Get him!


  
Gone. He's gone.


  
We got to shut xxx


  
Unbelievable. Three plays. Three plays.
Where were we... 4.3?


  
Come on.


  
Baby, me and you. Me and you, baby.
One more time.


  
Here we go!


  
Alright, we got to cut back!
We got to cut back!


  
Come on. Let's go!


  
Black piece of crap!


  
Hey! Hey!


  
Raf! Are you gonna do
something about this?!


  
He just kicked my boy in the head
and cussed him!


  
Thank you!


  
Unsportsmanlike conduct... Wingate!
Fifteen yards!


  
What?!


  
You shut up, or you'll get another fifteen.


  
This young man plays for my team.
My team!


  
And I will defend him like he's my own son.


  
Against you or any other
redneck sonofabitch!


  
Don't worry, Coach.
I got your back.


  
Alright then.


  
Come here, son. Come here.


  
Try "Gap."


  
- "Gap?"
- "Gap."


  
Alright, gun rip, 47 Gap, on and on.
Ready?


  
Coach ain't here to protect you now,
is he?


  
Ready!


  
Team is your family, Michael.


  
Go!


  
Go back, go back!
Block them all!


  
We got to hold! We got to hold!


  
Oh god!


  
- Run, Michael!
- SJ!


  
- Michael!
- Run, Michael! Run!


  
Go!


  
- Go, Mike!
- Go, Michael.


  
Touchdown!


  
Yo! Deliverance! You see number 74?


  
Well, that's MY son.


  
- Way to go big bro!
- See, here's what we got it.


  
- Dead ball foul.
- Now what?!


  
- Was he holding!
- No.


  
- Did he hit after the whistle?
- I don't believe so.


  
So what is the flag for?


  
I dunno...
Excessive blocking.


  
You're kidding me.


  
Sorry, Coach.
I stopped when I heard the whistle.


  
Where were you taking him, Mike?


  
To the bus.
That was the time for him to go home.


  
Attaboy, Michael Oher. Attaboy!
Go get 'em. Go get 'em, Crusaders!


  
Rub the heads! Rub the heads!
Alright! Let's go!


  
Go!


  
Stay!


  
Red, 41!
Red, 41!


  
Tom Lemming Recruiting,
please hold...


  
Tom Lemming Recruiting,
please hold....


  
Coach Saban wants his monthly
recruitment update Fed Ex.


  
Does he really think getting it one day
early is gonna give LSU a leg up?


  
Hey, have you filled all the slots
for the Army All Star Game?


  
Yeah, why?


  
You might want to open one up.


  
What did I tell you?


  
I want him.
I want him bad.


  
Y-E-L-L! Everybody yell!
Say, everybody yell!


  
Y-E-L-L! Everybody yell!


  
Nice kick this time, Collins.
Nice job.


  
What in the world?


  
Alright. Y'all keep practicing.
Remember point your toes.


  
One, two, three, one!


  
One, two, three, two!


  
One, two, three, three!


  
You okay, son?


  
xxx


  
Shoot, man, Fulmer's here.
I might as well go home.


  
What to say, fellas?
How's doing your life?


  
I came all the way from Knoxville,
to see for myself.


  
Hey, Coach.
We drove from Clemson, nine hours!


  
Coach Fulmer, it's a real honor.


  
Coach Cotton, my pleasure. I watched
your program you've done really well.


  
I don't think there is any question
that you'll be at the next level soon.


  
Oh, well, you know,
we do all we can, all we got.


  
Is that Michael?
Is that O'Hair?


  
It's Oher.


  
Like a paddle in a boat. Oher.


  
You think we might see some drills?


  
Perhaps... I think all the Coaches
would appreciate it.


  
- Yeah?
- Oh, yes, sir. You bet.


  
Listen up, fellas! New board drill!


  
Big Mike, Jay Collis.
Best on best. Right here.


  
Let's go! Come on! come on!


  
On my whistle, men!


  
Wow!


  
Coach, thank you.


  
- Where are you going, Coach?
- Back to South Carolina.


  
You tell to Michael Oher,
if he can qualify with his grades...


  
Clemson wants him.


  
Yeah. Good luck with that, Brad!


  
Coach, you've done a great job
with this young man.


  
Oh, well he was little rough
when we first got him


  
but we, you know,
coached him up a little bit.


  
Hello, mom.


  
Did you know that to be eligible
for a Division One scholarship


  
Michael's gonna need
to make it a 2.5 GPA?


  
Really?


  
His ACT is low and I don't see him doing
any better if he retakes it right there.


  
- What's his GPA now?
- 1.76.


  
Oh, that's not too bad, when you
consider where he started.


  
He's gonna make it all A's this year.


  
I'm serious.
And that might not even be enough.


  
So he goes to Junior College?


  
Most inner city kids that go to JC
drop out in the first year.


  
His shot at the pros would go
out the window.


  
Pros? Are we even sure
he's gonna get college offers?


  
Michael, Nick Saban from LSU.
(Louisiana State University)


  
I'm looking forward to you're coming
down and visit us sometime.


  
Gready. I'm Lou Holtz form
South Carolina. I'm call...


  
We're very interested in having Michael
over to Knoxville for a visit.


  
- Phil Fulmer, from Tennessee?
- There's twenty more among there.


  
And these things right here.
Fifty of 'em.


  
Any of those from Ole Miss?


  
No, they're not gonna start recruiting
until they hire a another coach.


  
Does make any difference
unless Michael makes his grades.


  
So, what are we going to do?


  
I understand you applied for
a teaching position at Wingate?


  
I won't religious enough for 'em.


  
I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy, but
I have certain, shall we say... doubts.


  
Oh, I appreciate your honesty, Miss Sue.


  
- What's the situation with Michael?
- He needs to be better in school.


  
Obviously. Why the big push?


  
Well, he's in line for
football scholarship


  
if he gets his grades up.


  
- Is he considering Ole Miss?
- He'd better be.


  
- I'd love to work with him.
- Well, when'd you like to start?


  
Ms. Tuohy... Umm... There's something
you should know about me.


  
I don't usually tell many people, but
it's something I feel should be aware of


  
before you hire me.


  
What is it?


  
I 'm a Democrat.


  
Okay.


  
- I don't understand it.
- Yet.


  
You don't understand it yet.


  
- How big is your head, Michael?
- Big.


  
And what's in there?


  
- A brain.
- A brain.


  
It's full of knowledge -


  
like a file cabinet with maps;


  
and shortcuts for figuring things out.


  
You'll get there, Michael Oher


  
because I'm to help you use those maps
and reach your destination.


  
Like Sacagawea helped
Lewis and Clark.


  
Sacagawea?


  
We'll get to that.
And the history books have it wrong,


  
All you need to know
is I'll get you there.


  
Do you believe me?


  
You trust me, Michael?


  
Yes, Miss Sue.


  
Try it again.


  
Now, what's the next one?
Read that to me.


  
Hey, what is it?
As first, we have to find the constant.


  
Now, where is the constant?


  
Good. See?


  
Who'd thought we'd have a black son
before we knew a Democrat.


  
- Doorbell!
- I got a guest.


  
Coach, how are you? Come in.


  
- Sean Tuohy.
- Sean.


  
- Nick Saban. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you. Pleasure.


  
I appreciate the opportunity
to come in your home.


  
- That's my daughter, Collins.
- Hi. Pleasure to meet you.


  
- And you must be Leigh Anne.
- That would be me, Coach Saban.


  
- Nice to meet you.
- Me too.


  
Please, call me Nick.


  
With an incredible home.
The windsor valances are a nice touch.


  
Oh, thank you. You obviously
have an excellent taste.


  
Well we appreciate the quality.
And recognize it when we see it.


  
Michael, why don't you come over here
and say hello to Coach Saban.


  
Hello, Michael. Nick Saban.


  
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.


  
- And you must be SJ.
- That's me.


  
Michael, why don't you and Nick
go into the living room to talk?


  
Can SJ come?


  
Absolutely.
We'll recruit the both of you.


  
Alright.


  
I find him extremely handsome.


  
Yeah, I'm right here, Leigh Anne.


  
Yeah, I know.


  
So Michael, we'd like to
get you down to LSU for visit.


  
We've got a great thing going there
right now,


  
you have an opportunity to be
successful as a person, as a student,


  
and an opportunity to be a part of the next
National Championship team with LSU.


  
So what do you say?
You'd like to commit to a visit?


  
- Can I ask a question?
- Sure.


  
My brother and I are very close.


  
And so... I'm very afraid that
if he goes off to school,


  
I might not get to see him.


  
- So ...
- Go on.


  
I guess I was just wondering how much
access I'd have to him.


  
Well, SJ, you'd have total access
to Michael.


  
But better than that, in his first game
at Tiger stadium,


  
we would like for you to lead
the team out of the tunnel.


  
- What do you think about that?
- Sounds good.


  
Come on in!


  
Gready. I'm Lou Holtz.
The University of South Carolina.


  
Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.
Come on in. Michael!


  
Hello. I'm Tommy Tuberville.
Albany University.


  
Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.
Michael!


  
Howdy, Houston Nutt.
University of Arkansas.


  
Leigh Anne Tuohy.
Very nice to meet you.


  
- Ole Miss Cup, huh?
- Michael!


  
Oh, come on. You know this.


  
It's logical.


  
I guarantee you come to the
University of South Carolina


  
will be the smartest decision
you've ever made.


  
We want you, we need you,
but the other thing is,


  
Mike, you need us.


  
Knoxville is a tremendous place
to live and...


  
I know there's lions, there's tigers,
there's bears...


  
Hey, there's only one razorback
in the world.


  
...and not only that, you'd look great
in Gamecock Red!


  
What's in if for me?


  
SJ, I'd get you a hawkhat,
and for whole family a hawkhat.


  
Are you telling me,
that's the best you can do?


  
SJ, you remind me of me as a boy.


  
Coach, help me, help you.


  
I can get you a Gamecock headdress.
And with real feathers.


  
What you got for me, Phil?


  
SJ, I've been thinking a lot of
about that and one of the things


  
that think will be special for both
of us is we'll walk arm in arm


  
to center of Union Stadium
at the first ball game,


  
and we'll do the coin toss together.


  
How's that sound?


  
Coach Fulmer, a pleasure doing
a business with you


  
My pleasure, SJ.
Could be sure, buddy.


  
Congratulations on gettin' hired.


  
Thank yew, Ma'am.
Ole Miss is my dream job.


  
You're coming a little late to the party
but we're diehard Rebels


  
so I'm gonna give you
a frickin' road map.


  
- Alright?
- Got it.


  
LSU is out. Everybody knows
Saban's going to the NFL.


  
I don't wanna name names, but on
Michael's first two recruitment trips


  
somebody took him to the tittybar.


  
- That's terrible.
- Tell me about it.


  
He'll have nightmares about for a weeks.
So when he comes to visit


  
I want you to feed him Italian -
he likes Fettucine Alfredo -


  
and I want you to take him to a movie -
not Chainsaw Massacre


  
because he'll just cover his eyes -
and get him to bed by ten.


  
- You got it?
- Yes'm.


  
- Alright.
- What about Tennessee?


  
It breaks my heart but they're still
in the hunt.


  
Fulmer made SJ a sweet deal.


  
I heard the kid can really
pepper the gumbo.


  
He's his daddy's boy.


  
- You ready?
- Lets' do it.


  
Alright.


  
Mike, do you like to barbecue?
I tell you what, Mike.


  
You can go to the gas station
and get best barbecue,


  
you've ever got in your life.


  
It's a wonderful place to live,
fried catfishes,


  
all the good food
that we love to eat


  
but it's not good for us
as football players,


  
you'd have to be aware, Mike.
I promise.


  
And for you, SJ,
this is what I can do.


  
At Ole Miss we have the Grove
by the stadium.


  
We walk it before every game,
in front of thousands of people.


  
It is a sacrad ritual. And I'm in front.


  
Seen it a thousand times.


  
Ever seen it from the front
of the line?


  
Next year, you and me;
leading the team.


  
Tennessee offered to let me run
on the field and flip the coin.


  
I'll throw in a sideline pass.


  
Have you decided yet, Michael?


  
No, Miss Sue.


  
But you like Tennessee?


  
It's a good school.


  
Not at academic level of Ole Miss,


  
but they have an outstanding
science department.


  
You know what they're famous for?


  
They work with the FBI


  
to study the effects of the soil
on decomposing body parts.


  
What's that mean?


  
Well when they find a body, the police
want to know how long it's been dead.


  
So the fine fox at Tennessee
help them out.


  
They have a lot of body parts.


  
Arms and legs and hands -
form hospitals and medical schools.


  
And you know where they store them?


  
Right underneath the football field.


  
So, while it's fine and dandy,
there're 100,000 fans cheering for you,


  
the bodies, you should be worried about
are right underneath the turf.


  
Set to poke up through the ground
and grab you.


  
But it's your decision where you wanna
play ball.


  
Don't let me influence you.


  
All the other teachers are on board,
I don't know, what your problem is.


  
I'm sorry.


  
I will not give a student a grade
he, or she, doesn't deserve.


  
Well, Michael needs a B.


  
What is he have to do to "deserve" that?


  
Right now is Michael doing C minus,
D plus work.


  
His best chance at improving
is with the written essay


  
at the end of the year.


  
It counts a third of his grade.


  
Well that's it. We're sunk.


  
Why don't you write about
"Great Expectations"?


  
You're a lot like Pip.


  
I mean he was poor, he was an orphan
and someone kind of found him.


  
You should be able to relate to that.


  
Fine, let's go through the reading list.


  
But you're gonna have to pick one, Michael.


  
"Pygmalion"...


  
"A Tale of Two Cities".....
"The Charge of the Light Brigade"...


  
"Half a league, half a league,
half a league onward"


  
I love that one.


  
He loves it.


  
Why don't you do this
and I'll watch basketball?


  
Okay.


  
"All in the Valley of Death rode
the six hundred."


  
They named LSU's stadium Death Valley
because of this story.


  
Alfred, Lord Tennyson has writing
about LSU Ole Miss.


  
- You're kidding?
- No. It's a great story.


  
It's a poem.


  
"Forward the Light Brigade!"


  
It's like the offense.


  
"Charge for the guns he said."


  
That's the end zone.


  
"Into the Valley of Death rode
the six hundred."


  
"Forward the Light Brigade!


  
Was there a man dismay'd?


  
Not tho' the soldier knew
someone had blundered."


  
Someone made a mistake?


  
Yeah, their leader, their coach.


  
But why would they go ahead
if they knew he messed up?


  
"Theirs not to make reply,
theirs not to reason why,


  
theirs but to do and die:


  
Into the Valley of Death rode
the six hundred."


  
They're all gonna die, aren't they?


  
Yeah.


  
That's really, really sad.


  
I think you just found something
to write about, Michael.


  
Courage is a hard thing to figure.


  
You can have courage based
on a dumb idea or mistake,


  
but you're not supposed
to question adults,


  
or your coach
or your teacher


  
because they make the rules.


  
Maybe they know best


  
but maybe they don't.


  
It all depends on who you are,
where you come from.


  
Didn't at least one of the six hundred
guys think about giving up.


  
and joining with the other side?


  
I mean, Valley of Death
that's pretty salty stuff.


  
That's why courage it's tricky.


  
Should you always do
what others tell you to do?


  
Sometimes you might not even know
why you're doing something.


  
I mean any fool can have courage.


  
But honor, that's the real reason
you either do something or you don't.


  
It's who you are and maybe
who you want to be.


  
If you die trying for
something important


  
then you have both
honor and courage


  
and that's pretty good.


  
I think that's what the writer
was saying.


  
That you should hope for courage
and try for honor.


  
And maybe even pray that the people
telling you what to do have some, too.


  
Kevin Lynn.


  
- Good job.
- Excuse me.


  
Matthew Nicols.


  
2.52.


  
Michael's final GPA.
Got it off Paul's computer.


  
Jamie North.


  
He did it, Sean. He did it!


  
Baby, you've been broken to
the principal's computer?


  
Michael Oher.


  
Where in the world did you find
a baby picture of Michael?


  
Scanned it off an Internet ad
for a toddler boutique.


  
Congratulations, Mike.


  
Michael, our greetings.


  
Way to go, bro!


  
Alright, that's enough.
Young man...


  
I think I need a proper hug.


  
Alright. You're gonna be staying
in Deaton Hall - where is it?


  
109. It's right there.
And you're gonna be on a meal plan


  
so you're gonna be eating all the way
here in Johnson Commons. Right there.


  
Johnson Commons has all you
can eat self-serve ice cream.


  
As much as you want?


  
Yes, that's how Mama put
on her freshman ten.


  
Stop it!


  
Hello?


  
This is Mrs. Tuohy.


  
He just want ask you a couple
of questions,  Michael.


  
You have nothing to hide.


  
Ms. Tuohy? Mr. Oher?


  
My name is Jocelyn Granger,
and I'm the Assistant Director


  
of Enforcement for the NCAA.


  
Please, call me Leigh Anne.


  
So, let's do this. Shall we?


  
Ms. Tuohy, if you wouldn't mind
I'd prefer to speak with Michael alone.


  
- And how long is that gonna take?
- Awhile.


  
Go, Mike. Okay? Go.


  
Michael? Michael! I'll be waiting
for you in the lobby, alright?


  
I don't know, Sean. I just have
a bad feeling about this one.


  
This woman is tough, tough...
Hold on.


  
Hey.


  
The client wants what?


  
Were you aware that Coach Cotton
is accepting a job at Ole Miss?


  
No.


  
And that this job offer came after
you signed with them?


  
Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian
went to Ole Miss.


  
He played basketball.


  
And Mrs. Tuohy went to Ole Miss as well.


  
She was a cheerleader.


  
Is this safe to say that Ole Miss
is their favorite school?


  
Did they like any other Universities?
What about, say Tennessee?


  
No. They can't stand Tennessee.


  
- And your tutor...
- Miss Sue.


  
Miss Sue.
Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too.


  
Miss Sue ever tried to persuade you
to attend Ole Miss?


  
Did you know that the Tuohys make
generous donations to Ole Miss?


  
That even Miss Sue makes donations?


  
That the Tuohys, they have
a condo in Oxford


  
so they can attend as many
athletic events as possible?


  
That, in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy
are by our definition... "boosters."


  
Mr. Oher.


  
Mr. Oher?


  
Do you understand...
Do you know, why am I here?


  
To... investigate.


  
Yes. To investigate.


  
I'm here to investigate your odd...
predicament.


  
Do you find it odd?
Your predicament?


  
Michael?...


  
Iono.


  
Can I... can I leave now?


  
No. You can't.


  
- What do you want, ma'am?
- I want the facts!


  
- I need the truth.
- I didn't lie!


  
- And I want to know what you think
about all this. - THINK ABOUT WHAT?!


  
The NCAA fears that with your recruitment
a door might be opened -


  
that boosters from lots
of schools in the south


  
will become legal guardians for
young athletes without means


  
and funnel them to their Alma Maters.


  
I'm not saying I believe it
and I'm not saying I don't,


  
but there're many people
involved with this case


  
who would argue that Tuohys
they took you in,


  
- they clothes you, they fed you,
- No.


  
- they paid for your private education,
- No.


  
- they bought you a car,
- No!


  
- and paid for your tutor,
- No.


  
all as part of a plan to insure
that you play football


  
for the University of Mississippi.


  
Michael! We're not finished.


  
It's not available. Just like I told you
three months ago.


  
So why don't we go with the canvas.


  
The low napa, it's a beautiful---
Oh, I'll call you back. Bye.


  
Michael. So what happened?


  
- Why'd you do it?
- What?


  
All along you wanted me
to go to Ole Miss.


  
Of course, I did.
We love Ole Miss!


  
Why did you do this for me?


  
- What?
- Everything!


  
Was it for you or was it for me?


  
Was it so I would go to school
where you wanted?!


  
Was it so i would do what you wanted?!


  
- Michael, no...
- That's what she thinks.


  
Is she right?


  
Michael, honey, I need for you
please, listen to me, alright?


  
Don't you dare to lie to me.


  
I'm not stupid!


  
Michael?!


  
Michael, of course,
you're not stupid.


  
Michael?!
Come on.


  
I should have followed him.


  
You had no way of knowing
he'd disappear.


  
Was he right?


  
What he said about us?


  
Leigh Anne, be reasonable.


  
We gave clothes to a boy
who had one pair of shorts.


  
We gave him a bed.


  
To hell with the NCAA,
I'd do it again tomorrow.


  
What about all the rest of it -


  
all the stuff we did to make sure
that he got a scholarship?


  
A scholarship at Ole Miss.


  
He could go whenever he wanted,
he knew that.


  
Oh, did he?
Did you ask him?


  
'Cause I sure as I know I never did.


  
Hey.


  
Come here.


  
Am I a good person?
Not a joke. Not rhetorical.


  
You're the best person I know.


  
Everything you do, you do for others.


  
And why is that?


  
I have not a clue.


  
But you obviously get some
sort of sick satisfaction out of it.


  
- Sean...
- Yeah?


  
What if he never comes back?


  
Oh, shit!


  
Big Mike?
Hey, get your ass in here, man.


  
I'm looking for my Moms.


  
Your Mama?
Yeah, I seen Dee Dee around.


  
As a matter of fact...


  
Oh, yeah. She usually stop by for a taste
around this time.


  
But I tell you what.
Why don't you just come inside


  
I'll get you a forty and we're
gonna chop it up like real fo,


  
just 'til she get here.


  
Come on, man.
Nobody gonna bite you, man.


  
Hey! Big Mike! Man, go down
xxx and have a seat.


  
Yeah, bitch!


  
Hey, baby, gimme a couple of cold beers
from the refrigerator!


  
Sit down, man. Big Mike.


  
- What?
- I'm so glad to see you.


  
Yeah. You lookin' good.
Too, you lookin' fit.


  
I heard you playin' little ball.


  
But you know that rich kid football
ain't like the public school league.


  
Niggers packing knives in their socks.


  
Hey, I played little ball myself.


  
Back in the day, you know that, alright?


  
Yeah, I heard.


  
A quarterback. Up there at MLK.


  
- Thank you, baby.
- What about you, Dave?


  
You still playing ball over at JC?


  
- Naw.
- No, man.


  
Dave no longer a student.


  
He with me now!


  
As a matter of fact...
Look, I can open a spot for you, too.


  
I got tired of going to class.


  
People are tryin' tell me what to do.


  
Well, in that case, Dave, look here...


  
Turn it up, like that
little bit of bitch!


  
Bitch!


  
Hey, man.
Don't mess with D, man.


  
I heard you stayin' on
the other side of town.


  
Yeah, that what Dee Dee said.
Said you got a new Mama now.


  
- Yeah?
- Oh yeah!


  
- She fine too.
- Yeah. She fine.


  
xxx


  
She got other kids?


  
She got a daughter?


  
You tap that?


  
Yeah, you taped that!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!


  
Big Mike!


  
Big Mike got his white babes!


  
Hey, Big Mike!


  
You should enjoy 'em, man.


  
Hey, where you going?


  
Going to wait my mom
to the apartement.


  
Hey, man, just don't go away now.


  
Hey, sit down, man.


  
I'm just trying to find out little bit
about your fine white sister.


  
Because I like me some
mommy/daughter action.


  
Shut up.


  
Shut up? Who the hell is
you telling to shut up?


  
I will bust and cap your fat ass.


  
And then drive east and pay
a visit to your cracker Mom!


  
And her sweet little daughter.


  
MAMA!!!!!


  
He gone, snowflake.


  
Michael was here?


  
Yeah, but you tell him,
I'll be seeing him around.


  
Or he gonna get this.


  
So Michael was here?


  
Last night. He come by here.
Sneaked me then run off.


  
Yeah. Tell him, sleep with one eye open.


  
You hear me, bitch?


  
No, you hear me, bitch!


  
You threaten my son you threaten me.


  
You so much as cross downtown
you will be sorry.


  
I'm in a prayer group with the D.A.,
I'm a member of the NRA


  
and I'm always packing.


  
What you got in there, a .22?
A Saturday Night Special?


  
And it shoots just fine
all the other days, too.


  
- Michael?!
- Mama?...


  
You think the police is gonna come
and get me?


  
I'd imagine the last thing
they want at Hurt Village


  
is bunch of cops snooping around.


  
I swore I'd never ask this, but
how'd you get out of there, Michael?


  
When I was little and something
awful was happening


  
my Mama would tell me to close my eyes.


  
She was tryin' to keep me from seeing
her do drugs or other bad things.


  
And then when she was finished
or the bad things were over


  
she'd say, "now when I count
to three, you open your eyes


  
and the past is gone,
the world is a good place,


  
and it's all gonna be okay."


  
You closed your eyes.


  
You know, when I was driving all over
Kingdom Come looking for you


  
I kept thinking about one thing.


  
Ferdinand the bull.


  
I know I should have asked this
a long time ago, Michael.


  
Do you even wanna play football?


  
I mean do you even like it?


  
- I'm pretty good at it.
- Yeah, you are.


  
Sean and I have been talking and...


  
Michael, if you're gonna accept
the football scholarship


  
we think it should be to Tennessee.


  
And I promise that I will be at
every game cheering for you.


  
- Every game?
- Every game.


  
But I will not wear that gaudy orange.
I will not.


  
It is not in my color wheel
and I'm not gonna wear it.


  
So you want me to go to Tennessee?


  
I want you to do
whatever you want.


  
It is your decision, Michael.
It's your life.


  
What if I want to flip burgers?


  
It's your decision; it's your life.


  
Okay.


  
Okay, what?


  
I'm sorry I left the other day.


  
- You were pretty upset.
- You ask a lot of questions.


  
I'm just trying to get
to the bottom of this.


  
But all questions you asked
were about why everybody else


  
wanted me to go to Ole Miss.


  
Okay...


  
Not once did you ask
why did I want to go there.


  
Alright, fine, Michael...
Why do you want to go to Ole Miss?


  
Because it's where my family
goes to school.


  
It's were they've always gone to school.


  
College is going to be different
experience for you, Michael.


  
SJ, stop it.


  
- There are lots of distractions.
- Have a fun.


  
There's gonna be some nimrod in the dorm
who wants to play video games all night,


  
or goof on the internet.


  
Just have fun.


  
And you will spend a lot of time
at practice, which means...


  
which means you have to be very
dedicated to your studies, alright?


  
SJ, if you don't stop it right---


  
- Come here.
- No.


  
Relax, Mama.


  
I just got back from the library


  
I reserved a private cubicle
for the semester.


  
Here's your class schedule
and our study hall hours.


  
Now, if y'all don't mind I'm gonna
go move into my new apartment.


  
- Thank you, Miss Sue.
- "Thank you, Miss Sue"


  
Yeah, yeah, yeah....


  
Let's see what you've got:
College's Writing, good,


  
psychology, math lab...


  
It's gonna be good. Just...


  
xxx know why.
A lot of good classes.


  
You'll have a lot of fun.


  
SJ!


  
Michael Oher, you listen to me, alright?


  
I want you to enjoy yourself, but if
you get a girl pregnant out of wedlock


  
I'll crawl in the car, drive up here
to Oxford and cut off your penis.


  
She means it.


  
- Yes ma'am.
- Alright


  
Now, 78's gonna be a parking lot.
So we should be going. Or everyone...


  
Say the goodbyes, alright?
Here.


  
Bye, baby.


  
- Thank you, Mama.
- You're welcome.


  
Why'd she always do that?


  
She's an onion. Michael. You have
to peel her back one layer at a time.


  
I'll be back.


  
What?


  
What, Michael?


  
I need a proper hug.


  
I read a story the other day
about a boy from the projects.


  
No daddy, in and out of foster care.


  
He'd been killed in a
gang fight at Hurt Village.


  
In the last paragraph they talked about
his superb athletic skills


  
and how different his life
might have been


  
if he hadn't fallen behind
and dropped out of school.


  
He was twenty-one years old
the day he died.


  
It was his birthday.


  
That could have been anyone.


  
It could have been my son, Michael.


  
But it wasn't.


  
And I suppose I have God
to thank for that.


  
God and Lawrence Taylor.


  
One Mississippi.


  
The New England Patriots have traded
the twenty third pick


  
to the Baltimore Ravens.


  
And with the twenty third
pick in 2009 NFL draft


  
The Baltimore Raven select...


  
Michael Oher.
Offensive tackle, Mississippi.


You've reached
Doug. Sorry I missed your call.


  
Please leave a name and number
and I'll get back to you.


  
Hi, you've reached...


  
...Dr. Stuart Price with Divine Dentistry.


  
Please leave a message after...


  
Hey, this is Phil.


  
Leave me a message or don 't.
Do me a favor, don 't text me. It's gay.


  
- Anything?
- I tried them all.


  
It keeps going straight to voicemail.


  
Well, there has to be an explanation.


  
Sweetie, it's Vegas.
You lose track of time in casinos.


  
There's no windows, there's no clocks.
He's probably on a heater.


  
And you never walk away from the table
when you're on a heater.


  
You do if you're getting married.


  
- Hello?
- Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil.


  
Phil, where the hell are you guys?


  
I'm freaking out.


  
Yeah, listen.


  
Uh...


  
We fucked up.


  
What are you talking about?


  
The bachelor party,
the whole night. It...


  
Things got out of control, uh...


  
...and we lost Doug.


  
- What?
- We can't find Doug.


  
What are you saying, Phil?
We're getting married in five hours.


  
Yeah.


  
That's not gonna happen.


  
To my left a little.


  
Thank you.


  
Okey-dokey.


  
- Whoa, watch it, pervert!
- Alan, he's just doing your inseam.


  
- He's getting very close to my shaft.
- All done. You can change now.


  
Right. Thanks, Floyd.
Thank you very much.


  
All right, buddy,
we should get a move on.


  
You know, Doug, I was thinking...


  
If you wanna go to Vegas without me,
that is totally cool, you know?


  
What are you talking about?


  
You know, Phil and Stu, they're your
buddies, and it's your bachelor party.


  
Come on, Alan. Those two love you.


  
And also, I don't want you to feel
like you have to hold back...


  
...because your wife's brother's there.
I just...


  
It's not like that.


  
It's not like that.
I already told you, Alan.


  
Okay? We're just spending the night
in Vegas. It's no big deal.


  
Besides, you're not just my wife's
brother, you're my brother now.


  
I want you to know, Doug,
I'm a steel trap.


  
Whatever happens tonight, I will
never, ever, ever, speak a word of it.


  
Okay. Yeah, I got it. Thank you.
I don't think that...


  
Seriously. I don't care what happens.


  
- I don't care if we kill someone.
- What?


  
You heard me. It's Sin City.


  
I won't tell a soul.


  
Okay. I got it.


  
Thank you.
No, thank you.


  
I love you so much.


  
No. Sid.


  
- Really?
- Come on, we're family now.


  
- You sure? I mean, you love this car.
- Doug, it's just a car.


  
Just make sure to put some Armor All
on the tires so the sand doesn't seep in.


  
Absolutely. That's easy.


  
Oh, and, uh, don't let Alan drive...


  
...because there's
something wrong with him.


  
- Understood.
- Oh, and Phil either. I don't like him.


  
I will be the only one driving this car.
I promise.


  
Good.


  
Remember, what happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas.


  
Ah!


  
Except for herpes.
That shit'll come back with you.


  
All right. Hold on. I still need
some of your permission slips...


  
...and $90 for the field trip to the
Griffith Observatory next weekend.


  
Pay now, or forever regret missing out
on the experience of a lifetime, guys.


  
You're good, you got it.


  
- Thanks, Mr. Wenneck.
- Thank you, Russ.


  
Thanks. Thanks, Bobbitt, way to go.


  
Hold on, I got it.


  
Ahem, do you have to park so close?


  
- Yeah. What's wrong?
- I shouldn't be here.


  
Why is that, Alan?


  
I'm not supposed to be within 200 feet
of a school.


  
- What?
- Or a Chuck E. Cheese.


  
- Mr. Wenneck, I was...
- It's the weekend.


  
I don't know you. You do not exist.


  
- Shit.
- Heh, heh, heh.


  
- Nice car.
- Yeah.


  
I'm driving.


  
Whoa, no chance,
buddy... Don't step...


  
God. Watch the leath...


  
Shut up and drive before these nerds
ask me another question.


  
- Animal.
- Who's this?


  
- It's Alan. Tracy's brother.
- I met you, like, four times.


  
Oh, yeah. How you doing, man?


  
Don't forget your Rogaine.


  
Rogaine, check.


  
And don't forget to use it.


  
I can totally tell when you forget,
your hair just looks thinner.


  
Using of the Rogaine, check.


  
Make sure to call me
right when you get to the hotel...


  
...not like that conference in Phoenix.


  
I had to wait two hours
for you to call me.


  
Yeah, I was the keynote speaker.
I was late to the podium.


  
- Still?
- Yeah, you're totally right. I'm sorry.


  
- What is the matter?
- I don't know.


  
I hope you're not gonna go to
some strip club when you're up there.


  
Melissa, we're going to Napa Valley.


  
I don't even think they have strip clubs
in wine country.


  
Well, I'm sure if there is one,
Phil will sniff it out.


  
It's not gonna be like that.


  
Besides, you know how I feel about that.


  
I know, I know. It's just boys
and their bachelor parties, it's gross.


  
You're right, it is gross.


  
- Not to mention it's pathetic.
- Mm-hm.


  
- Those places are filthy.
- Yeah.


  
And the worst part is...


  
...that little girl...


  
...grinding and dry humping
the fucking stage up there...


  
...that's somebody's daughter up there.
- I was just gonna say that.


  
See? I just wish your friends
were as mature as you.


  
They are mature, actually. You just
have to get to know them better.


  
Paging Dr. Faggot.


  
Dr. Faggot!


  
- I should go.
- That's a good idea, Dr. Faggot.


  
Have a good weekend.
I'm gonna miss you.


  
Whoo!


  
Road trip!


  
Vegas! Vegas, baby!


  
Vegas!


  
You're nuts!


  
Come on, just till Barstow.
Everybody's passing us.


  
Absolutely not. I promised Sid.
I will be the only one driving this car.


  
Besides, you're drinking.


  
Oh, what are you, a cop now?
You know I drive great when I'm drunk.


  
True. Don't forget, Phil was always
our designated drunk driver.


  
Yeah. You wanna explain it
to them, Alan?


  
Guys, my dad loves this car
more than he loves me, so, yeah.


  
Aw, whatever. I left my wife and kid
at home so I could go with you guys.


  
- You know how difficult that was?
- That's really sweet.


  
- Yeah.
- Dude, I was being sarcastic.


  
I fucking hate my life.


  
I may never go back.
I might stay in Vegas.


  
Here we go.


  
Doug, enjoy yourself,
because come Sunday...


  
...you're gonna start dying
just a little bit every day.


  
Yeah. That's why I've managed to stay
single this whole time, you know?


  
- Oh, really? That's why you're single?
- Yeah.


  
Cool. Good to know.


  
- Am I all right over there, Alan?
- Yeah, you're good.


  
Aw, Jesus Christ!


  
- Oh, my God!
- That was awesome!


  
That was not awesome.
What's wrong with you?


  
- That was insane. We almost just died.
- You should have seen your face.


  
- Classic.
- That's funny. Ha-ha.


  
It's not funny.


  
- Boy, you've got a sweet ride there.
- Don't touch it.


  
Don't even look at it. Go on, get out.


  
You heard me.
Don't look at me, either.


  
Yeah, you better walk on.


  
- He's actually kind of funny.
- Yeah, he means well.


  
I'll hit an old man in public.


  
Is he all there? Like, mentally?


  
I think so. He's just an odd guy.
You know, he's kind of weird.


  
- I mean, should we be worried?
- No.


  
- All right.
- No.


  
Tracy did mention
that we shouldn't let him gamble.


  
Or drink too much.


  
Jesus, he's like a gremlin.
Comes with instructions and shit.


  
And one water.


  
- All good with Melissa?
- Oh, yeah.


  
Told her we're two hours outside of
wine country, and she bought it.


  
You think it's strange you've been
in a relationship for years...


  
...and you have to lie about Vegas?


  
Yeah, I do.
But trust me, it's not worth the fight.


  
Oh, so you can't go to Vegas...


  
...but she can fuck a bellhop
on a Carnival Cruise Line?


  
Hey.


  
Okay, first of all, he was a bartender.


  
And she was wasted.


  
And, if you must know,
he didn't even come inside her.


  
And you believe that?


  
Uh, yeah, I do believe that,
because she's grossed out by semen.


  
That'll be 32.50.


  
It's 32.50, you gonna pay for it?


  
It says here we should work in teams.
Who wants to be my spotter?


  
I don't think you should be doing
too much gambling tonight, Alan.


  
Gambling?
Who said anything about gambling?


  
It's not gambling
when you know you're gonna win.


  
Counting cards is a foolproof system.


  
It's also illegal.


  
It's not illegal, it's frowned upon,
like masturbating on an airplane.


  
I'm pretty sure that's illegal too.


  
Yeah, maybe after 9/11,
where everybody got so sensitive.


  
Thanks a lot, Bin Laden.


  
Either way, you gotta be super smart
to count cards, buddy, okay?


  
- Oh, really?
- It's not easy.


  
Well maybe we should tell that
to Rain Man...


  
...because he practically bankrupted
a casino, and he was a retard.


  
What?


  
He was a retard.


  
Retard.


  
Here we go.


  
Hi, welcome to Caesars.


  
- Hello.
- Checking in?


  
Yeah. We have a reservation
under Dr. Price.


  
Okay, let me look that up for you.


  
Dr. Price?


  
Stu, you're a dentist, okay?
Don't try and get fancy.


  
- It's not fancy if it's true.
- He's a dentist. Don't get too excited.


  
And if, uh, someone has a heart attack,
you should still call 911.


  
We'll be sure to do that.


  
Can I ask you a question? Do you
know if the hotel's pager-friendly?


  
- What do you mean?
- I'm not getting a sig on my beeper.


  
- I'm not sure.
- Is there a payphone bank?


  
Bunch of payphones? Business.


  
Um, there's a phone in your room.


  
That'll work.


  
So I have you in a two-bedroom suite
on the 12th floor, is that okay?


  
It sounds perfect.


  
Actually, I was wondering
if you had any villas.


  
- We're not even gonna be in the room.
- It's unnecessary.


  
No big deal. We can share beds.
It's one night.


  
If we're share beds,
I'm bunking with Phil.


  
- You good with that?
- No, I'm not.


  
Guys, we are not sharing beds.
What are we, 12 years old?


  
Lisa, I apologize.
How much is the villa?


  
Well, we have one villa available,
and it's 4200 for the night.


  
- Is it awesome?
- It's pretty awesome.


  
- We'll take it. Give her your credit card.
- I can't give her my credit card.


  
- We'll split it.
- Are you crazy? No, this is on us.


  
You don't get it.
Melissa checks my statements.


  
We just need a credit card on file.


  
We won't charge you until check out,
so you can figure it out then.


  
That's perfect. Thank you, Lisa.
We'll deal with it tomorrow. Come on.


  
Fine.


  
- Can I ask you another question?
- Sure.


  
You probably get this a lot.


  
This isn't the real Caesars Palace,
is it?


  
What do you mean?


  
Did, uh...


  
- Did Caesar live here?
- Um, no.


  
I didn't think so.


  
Holy shit.


  
Now, this is Vegas.


  
Oh, my... This place is enormous.


  
Now we're talking.


  
Is this all one suite?


  
Thank you, guys.


  
Or should I say, "Thank you, Stu"?


  
You're welcome.
It's only because I love you.


  
Okay, ladies, pick a room, get
dressed. Let's be ready in 30 minutes.


  
I just wish you could see this place,
because you, of all people, would love it.


  
Yeah. No, it's so quaint.


  
Yeah, no, there's no TVs, no phones.


  
They just have these cute little antique
radios in all the rooms.


  
Yeah.


  
What else? Um...


  
We met the, uh, proprietor.


  
- Oh, I bet you...
- What's his name?


  
Um, Caesar. Palacè.


  
Yeah, like the salad.


  
Okay. Well, listen, I gotta go, because
we're gonna hit this wine tasting.


  
Wait, wait. I love you. Okay. Bye.


  
I'm not even gonna say anything,
it's so embarrassing.


  
- Where's Alan?
- He, uh, he went downstairs.


  
He said he had to grab a few things.


  
Good, because I have something
to show you.


  
Uh-Oh.


  
- What the hell is that?
- What do you think?


  
If it's what I think it is,
I think it's a big fucking mistake.


  
I'm gonna propose to Melissa
at your wedding. After the ceremony.


  
- Stuey, congratulations!
- Thank you, Doug.


  
- That's a beautiful ring.
- Yeah. It's my grandmother's.


  
She made it all the way through
the Holocaust with that thing.


  
Wait, have you not listened
to anything I have ever said?


  
Phil, we've been dating for three years.
It's time. This is how it works.


  
A, that is bullshit.
And B, she is a complete bitch.


  
Hey, that's his fiancée.


  
What? It's true. It's true.
You know it's true. She beats him.


  
That was twice, and I was out of line.


  
She's strong-willed. And I respect that.


  
Wow. Wow.


  
He's in denial.
Not to mention, she fucked a sailor.


  
Hey, he wasn't a sailor.


  
He was a bartender on a cruise ship.
You know that.


  
Guys, I'm standing right here. So I can
hear everything that you're saying.


  
Hey, guys.
You ready to let the dogs out?


  
- What?
- Do what?


  
Let the dogs out. You know.


  
Who brought this guy?


  
Yes, Alan, we are ready
to let the dogs out.


  
- Hey, congrats.
- Thank you.


  
I love this fucking town.


  
- You're not really wearing that, are you?
- Wearing what?


  
The man-purse.


  
You're actually gonna wear that
or are you guys fucking with me?


  
It's where I keep all my things.
I get a lot of compliments on this.


  
Plus, it's not a man-purse.
It's called a satchel.


  
Indiana Jones wears one.


  
So does Joy Behar.


  
- We're going up, guys.
- Yeah, that's perfect.


  
Really?


  
We're going up?


  
I'm just saying,
it's clearly marked, okay?


  
We are definitely
not supposed to be up here.


  
Come on, we're paying for a villa.
We can do whatever the fuck we want.


  
- Yeah, but...
- Just wedge the door open.


  
- Guys, come on up here.
- Fine.


  
How the hell did you find this place?


  
Don't worry about it.


  
Oh!


  
- You all right?
- Yeah.


  
- Look at the view up here.
- You happy?


  
- This is great.
- Whoa!


  
Are you kidding?


  
- Alan, how we doing, buddy?
- Good.


  
What do you got
over there, Alan?


  
That's the Eiffel Tower.


  
Uh-oh.


  
- Right?
- A little Jägermeister.


  
- Good idea.
- There it is. Good call.


  
On the roof.


  
Um, no, this is good.
I'd like to make a toast.


  
To Doug and Tracy.


  
May tonight be...


  
...but a minor speed bump...


  
...in an otherwise very long
and healthy marriage.


  
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


  
Short and sweet.


  
Oh, it's like college.


  
- All right. I wanna talk about something.
- All right.


  
- I want to...
- I'd like to...


  
I'd like to say something...


  
...that I prepared...


  
...tonight.
- All right, Alan.


  
"Hello.


  
How about that ride in?


  
I guess that's why they call it
Sin City.


  
You guys might not know this,
but I consider myself a bit of a loner.


  
I tend to think of myself
as a one-man wolf pack.


  
But when my sister brought Doug home,
I knew he was one of my own.


  
And my wolf pack, it grew by one.


  
So were there two... So there
were two of us in the wolf pack.


  
I was alone first in the pack,
and then Doug joined in later.


  
And six months ago...


  
...when Doug introduced me
to you guys, I thought:


  
'Wait a second. Could it be?'
And now, I know for sure.


  
I just added two more guys
to my wolf pack."


  
- All right.
- All right.


  
"Four of us wolves...


  
...running around the desert together
in Las Vegas...


  
...Iooking for strippers and cocaine."


  
So tonight...


  
...I make a toast.
- Whoa.


  
- What...?
- What do you got there?


  
- Dude, what the fuck?
- What the hell are you doing?


  
- What is that?
- Blood brothers.


  
- Don't... Why did you...?
- Damn it.


  
- Here.
- Alan...


  
- No.
- No, I'm not doing that.


  
- Go ahead, Stuart.
- Make him stop.


  
Alan, we're not gonna cut ourselves.
Give me the knife.


  
Slowly. Thank you.
Okay. Thank you very much.


  
- You all right? Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.


  
- Do you need a doctor?
- He's good.


  
- You sure?
- I'm good.


  
- Perfect. Alan, come here, buddy.
- Get in here, crazy.


  
All right, to a night the four of us
will never forget.


  
- There it is.
- Hear, hear.


  
Hey, thanks, guys.


  
Hm.


  
Stupid tiger.


  
What the fuck?


  
Control yourself, man.
Goddamn, will you put on some pants?


  
- Phil, do not go in the bathroom.
- AI, just calm down. It's me.


  
Phil, there is a tiger in the bathroom.


  
- What's going on?
- There's a jungle cat in the bathroom!


  
- Okay, okay, Al. Al, I'll check it out.
- Don't go in.


  
Don't go in, don't go in.
Be careful. Don't, don't.


  
- Oh! Holy fuck! He's not kidding.
- See? See?


  
- There's a tiger in there.
- No, there isn't.


  
Yeah!


  
- It's big. Gigantic.
- You okay, buddy?


  
No. I am in so much pain right now.


  
Goddamn. Look at this place.


  
Whew.


  
I know. Phil, they have my credit card
downstairs. I am so screwed.


  
How does a tiger get in the bathroom?
It almost killed me.


  
Hey, bro?
You mind putting on some pants?


  
I find it a little weird
I have to ask twice.


  
Pants at a time like this?
I don't have any p...


  
What the fuck happened last night?


  
Hey, Phil, am I missing a tooth?


  
I can't... Oh, shit.


  
Oh, my God.


  
My lateral incisor's... It's gone!


  
It's okay. Okay, okay. Just calm down.
We're fine. Everything's fine.


  
Alan, go wake up Doug.


  
Let's get some coffee and get
the fuck out of Nevada...


  
...before housekeeping shows.


  
What am I gonna tell Melissa?
I lost a tooth.


  
I have no idea how it happened.


  
You're freaking me out, man.


  
I got a massive headache, okay?
Let's just calm down.


  
How am I supposed to calm down?
Look around you.


  
- Hey, guys, he's not in there.
- Did you check all the rooms?


  
Yeah, I looked everywhere.
Plus, his mattress is gone.


  
He probably went to the pool
to get something to eat.


  
I'll just call his cell.


  
I look like a nerdy hillbilly.


  
- Hello?
- Alan.


  
Hey.


  
- It's Phil.
- Oh, hey, Phi...


  
This is Doug's phone.
This is Doug's phone.


  
- No shit.
- Yeah.


  
What the fuck is that?


  
Whose fucking baby is that?


  
Alan, are you sure you didn't see
anyone else in the suite?


  
Yeah, I checked all the rooms.
No one's here.


  
Check its collar or something.


  
Shh. Shh.


  
- It's okay, baby.
- Stu, we don't have time for this.


  
Let's go hook up with Doug,
we'll deal with the baby later.


  
Phil, we're not gonna leave a baby
in the room.


  
- There's a fucking tiger in the bathroom.
- It's not our baby.


  
Yeah, I gotta side with Stu on this one.


  
All right, fine.
Okay, we'll take it with us.


  
Could you at least just find some pants?


  
Why can't we remember a
goddamn thing from last night?


  
Because we obviously
had a great fucking time.


  
Why don't you just stop worrying
for one minute.


  
Be proud of yourself.


  
Oh, how cute. What's his name?


  
- Ben.
- Carlos.


  
Carlos?


  
Thank you.


  
Hey, Phil, look.


  
He's jacking his little weenis.


  
- Pull yourself together, man.
- Not at the table, Carlos.


  
I looked everywhere.


  
Gym, casino, front desk.
Nobody's seen Doug. He's not here.


  
He's fine. He's a grown man.


  
Seriously, Stu, you gotta calm down.
Here, have some juice.


  
I can't have juice right now.


  
Okay. All right.
Let's just track this thing.


  
What's the last thing
we remember doing last night?


  
Well, the first thing was
we were on the roof...


  
...and were having those shots of Jäger.


  
And then we ate dinner
at The Palm. Right?


  
That's right.


  
And then we played craps at the
Hard Rock, and I think Doug was there.


  
That sounds right.
No, no. He definitely was.


  
You know what, guys?
I don't even remember going to dinner.


  
What the fuck? I don't think
I've ever been this hung-over.


  
After the Hard Rock, I blacked out.
It was like emptiness.


  
Okay. We have up until 10 p. m...


  
...so that gives us a 12-hour window
where we could have lost him.


  
- What is this?
- Oh, my God. That is my tooth.


  
Why do you have that?
What else is in your pockets?


  
This is a good thing. No. Check
your pockets. Check your pockets.


  
Do you have anything?


  
I have an ATM receipt
from the Bellagio.


  
Eleven-oh-five for $800!
I am so fucked.


  
I have a valet ticket from Caesars.
- 15 a.m.


  
Oh, shit. We drove last night?


  
Driving drunk. Classic.


  
What's on your arm?


  
- What the fuck is that?
- Jesus, Phil.


  
- You were in the hospital last night.
- I guess so, yeah.


  
- You okay?
- Yeah, Alan. I'm fine.


  
What the hell is going on?


  
Well, Stu, Stu, this is a good thing.
We have a lead now.


  
Hey, Stu, watch this.


  
- You ever seen a baby do that?
- Dude, Alan, not cool.


  
So, uh, are you sure you're qualified
to be taking care of that baby?


  
What? I've found a baby before.


  
- You found a baby before?
- Yeah.


  
- Where?
- Coffee Bean.


  
Wait, what?


  
Hey, Phil? I don't think Doug
would want us to take the Mercedes.


  
Relax, we'll be careful.


  
My dad is crazy about that car.
He left Doug in charge...


  
Alan. We got bigger problems here.


  
Doug could be in the hospital,
he could be hurt.


  
- Let's worry about the car later.
- Uh, guys? Check it out.


  
All right, grab it from the other side.


  
Is that the mattress from Doug's room?


  
What the fuck?


  
Hey, man, what's going on here?


  
Some asshole threw his bed
out the window last night.


  
- No shit.
- Yeah.


  
Some guys just can't handle Vegas.


  
Ha-ha.


  
Oh, God.


  
It's gonna be okay, Stu.


  
How the hell did we manage that?


  
- Here's your car, officers.
- Oh, God.


  
All right, everybody act cool.
All right, don't say a word.


  
Come on, let's just get in and go.
Come on.


  
- Stu, you got a five?
- No.


  
- I'll hit you on the way back.
- Thank you, sir.


  
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.


  
You just nailed the baby.


  
Are my glasses okay?


  
Your glasses are fine, dick.


  
This is so illegal.


  
Can't you see the fun part in anything?


  
Yeah, we're stuck in traffic
in a stolen police car...


  
...with a missing child
in the back seat.


  
Which part of this is fun?


  
- I think the cop-car part's pretty cool.
- Thank you, Alan. It is cool.


  
Doug would love it.


  
Come on.


  
- Check this out.
- Oh, no. No, Phil. No, Phil.


  
Don't do this!


  
- Take it easy.
- Just try to call more attention to us.


  
- Attention.
- Sorry.


  
Attention, please. Move out of the way.


  
I repeat, please disperse.


  
Phil, stop the car, I wanna get out.
Stop the car, I wanna get out. Pull over.


  
Ma'am, in the leopard dress,
you have an amazing rack.


  
Get off the sidewalk!
Get off the sidewalk!


  
I should have been a fucking cop.


  
Look, I already told you.


  
You came in with a mild concussion,
some bruised ribs. No big deal.


  
Although none of you could articulate
how it happened.


  
Do you remember how many of us
were here?


  
Ah...


  
I don't know. I think it was just
you guys. Definitely no baby.


  
- And one other guy.
- That's our guy. Was he okay?


  
Yeah. He was fine. Just whacked
out of his mind. You all were.


  
All right, come forward.
And turn.


  
All right.


  
There you go. And cough.


  
Cough. Cough. Give me one more.


  
All right. Thattaboy.


  
Okay, Felix, you can put your robe on.


  
And the nurse will be in here
in a minute.


  
I'll see you after the weekend.


  
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, doctor.


  
Guys, I really gotta go. I'm sorry.
I have a surgery up on the fourth floor.


  
No, I know. But we just need
a couple more minutes of your time.


  
Yeah. Tuck it right in there.
I don't want to re-sterilize.


  
Walk with me.


  
Okay, here we go. Patient name,
Phil Wenneck, 2:45 a.m. arrival.


  
Minor concussion, like I said.
Some bruising. Pretty standard.


  
Do you mind if I look?
I'm actually a doctor.


  
Yeah, you said that several times last
night. But really, you're just a dentist.


  
Okay, this is interesting.
Your blood work came in this morning.


  
Wow.


  
They found a large amount of Ruphylin
in your system.


  
Ruphylin. Roofies.
Commonly known as the date-rape drug.


  
What, so, what are you saying,
I was raped last night?


  
Actually...


  
I don't think so.
But someone did slip you the drug.


  
I'm not surprised
you don't remember anything.


  
Doc, none of us can remember anything
from last night. Remember?


  
Yeah. How could someone
have drugged all of us?


  
I wouldn't worry about it.


  
The stuff's out of your system.
You're gonna be fine.


  
Wait, wait, wait. Please, doctor.
Is there anything else?


  
Like, something we
may have been talking about...


  
...or some place we were going?


  
Actually, there was something.


  
You guys kept talking about
some wedding last night.


  
Yeah. No shit. Our buddy Doug's
getting married tomorrow.


  
- You know what? I want the 100 back.
- No, no. Easy.


  
You kept talking about some wedding
you just came from.


  
At the, uh, Best Little Chapel.


  
You kept saying how sick the wedding
was and getting all crazy about it.


  
Okay, I hope this helps.
I really have to leave.


  
Best Little Chapel,
do you know where that is?


  
I do. It's at the corner of Get A Map
and Fuck Off.


  
I'm a doctor, not a tour guide.


  
Figure it out yourself, okay?
You're big boys.


  
What about the baby?


  
Leave him in the car.
We're gonna be five minutes.


  
Whoa, we're not leaving
a baby in the car.


  
He'll be fine. I cracked the window.


  
- What if they don't remember us?
- Well, let's just find out.


  
I'm sor... Excuse me, sir? Hi.


  
Look at these guys.


  
What happened?
You miss me?


  
You miss Eddie?
You want more from me?


  
How are you, my friend?
Look at this guy. You're fucking crazy.


  
What's going on, man?


  
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something.
I know some sick people in my life.


  
This guy is the craziest, wildest bastard
I ever met in my life, man.


  
- This guy?
- This guy is out of his mind.


  
What's going on,
you fucking crazy motherfucker?


  
I thought he was gonna eat my dick.


  
What happened?
No love for Eddie? You don't hug me?


  
No, no. It's not that, Eddie.


  
Uh, it's just that we're having
a hard time remembering...


  
...what happened here last night.


  
Yeah, was there a wedding here?
Do you do weddings here?


  
You are cracking my balls, man.


  
Obviously we were here.
We're looking for our friend Doug.


  
- Do you remember?
- Yeah, the small guy. Like a monkey.


  
- Yeah.
- You saw him?


  
Of course.


  
Is there anything you can tell us about
what may have happened last night?


  
You don't remember nothing?


  
- Congratulations, Stu, you got married.
- This... This can't be happening.


  
- Oh, God.
- Look at that.


  
I'll tell you one thing,
you look seriously happy here, man.


  
That's it. My life is over.


  
Stu, it's okay. Look, shit happens.


  
Come on. Melissa's not gonna know
anything about this.


  
- This never happened. I'll take care of it.
- Come on. Put it here.


  
Hey, what's all that?


  
The High Roller package. It's what
you ordered. I have coffee mugs.


  
- What?
- You have baseball caps, huh?


  
And fancy calendars, all with pictures
of Stu and Jade.


  
Her name's Jade?


  
Yeah, and she's beautiful, man.
Clean, very tight. Tits like that.


  
- But that's because she had a baby.
- That explains the baby.


  
- Oh, Carlos. Carlos.
- Great. All right.


  
Uh, here's the deal.
We made a mistake last night.


  
We need this marriage annulled.
You do annulments?


  
Of course I do. It breaks my heart
and gonna make me sad...


  
...but it's no problem.
Good price for you.


  
I can't do it with just him, though.
I need the chick. I need both parties.


  
Oh, not a problem. That's great.
Isn't that great, Stu?


  
Come on, buddy.
She probably knows where Doug is.


  
- Awesome.
- All right, all right. Okay. Uh...


  
We need her address.
She filled out some paperwork, right?


  
Of course.


  
Hey. Excuse me.
What is the matter with you?


  
Go and get the paperwork, man.


  
I spend my life waiting for you.
Come on.


  
Okay. I'm going.


  
And get the baklava, please.


  
- Hey, Phil, what about my dad's car?
- I'm sure Doug has it. We'll get it back.


  
Then I vote we torch the cop car
and all this shit with it.


  
- Torch it? Who are you?
- I don't know, Phil.


  
Apparently I'm a guy who marries
complete strangers.


  
This whole situation
is completely fucked.


  
- These mugs. This hat. This car.
- Hey!


  
It's all evidence
of a night that never happened.


  
That is why we're torching all of it.


  
Whoa, I'm a schoolteacher,
I got a family, okay?


  
I'm all for secrecy,
but I'm not gonna torch a cop car.


  
- Fine. I'll do it.
- Can I help?


  
Yeah, thanks.


  
- Is it Doug?
- I don't have it.


  
It's Doug, it's Doug.


  
Uh, it's Melissa.


  
- Don't answer.
- I have to. She's called twice already!


  
- Can I ride shotgun?
- Don't touch me.


  
Hey, sweetheart, how are you?


  
There you are.
This is the third time I'm trying you.


  
I know. The reception up here's crazy.


  
I think it's all the sequoia trees,
block the signal.


  
Ugh, I hate that.
So how was it last night?


  
Ah, it was really fun, actually.
It was quiet, but it was a good time.


  
That sounds nice.


  
- I'm learning all kinds of vino factoids.
- Hi.


  
lt'd be so cool if I could breast-feed,
you know?


  
Well, listen...


  
...we're about to go for a tractor ride.
- What the fuck?


  
- I should get going. So pretty.
- A tractor ride?


  
- Go, out of the car!
- What was that?


  
They started up the tractor.
I think it backfired.


  
- Where the hell is he?
- Hey, easy, easy.


  
I think we're looking for
the same guy, okay?


  
Hey! What the hell, man?


  
What the fuck, Stu?
Is that a baby?


  
Why would there be a baby?
We're at a winery. That's a goat.


  
Where is he?


  
I don't know!
What are you talking about?


  
Sir, can you please start the tractor
so we can get out of here?


  
I'm trying to, but we're fucking blocked.


  
Oh, my God!
What the hell is happening, Stu?


  
- Hey! There's a baby on board!
- Someone just said "baby."


  
- Get out of the car!
- It's a baby goat.


  
Why you making trouble
for my business, man?


  
- Go away from here.
- Get out of the car!


  
- Phil, he's got a gun!
- No shit he's got a gun!


  
- I gotta call you back. Bye.
- Come on.


  
- Fuck! Shit.
- He shot me!


  
- He shot Eddie!
- Fuck this shit!


  
Fuck! Fuck!


  
Go, go, go!


  
Fuck.


  
Okay. Oh, that was some sick shit!


  
Who were those guys?


  
We're gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.


  
What the fuck is going on?!


  
I have no idea.


  
Why don't you just let that
go to voicemail?


  
Ha-ha-ha.


  
That's a fake laugh, by the way.


  
It's got, uh, Ted Danson and Magnum
P.I. and that Jewish actor.


  
Shut up, Alan.


  
- What room was it again?
- It's 825.


  
I know, I did. I already checked with her.


  
I found him, I'll call you back.
Thank God, he's with his father.


  
I was freaking out.
I missed you, sweetie.


  
And I miss you.


  
No.


  
What the hell happened
to you guys?


  
Actually, we were hoping
you could tell us.


  
What do you mean? I got up this
morning, I went to get coffee...


  
...and I came back and you were gone.


  
- Why are you being so quiet?
- I'm not being quiet.


  
Ha, ha. You're so cute.


  
Yeah, I gotta feed Tyler.
Come inside, you guys.


  
Did you hear that? Baby's name is Tyler.


  
Yeah. I thought he looked
more like a Carlos too, bud.


  
Okay, what's up?
You guys are acting weird.


  
- Look, it's Jade, right?
- Very funny, Phil.


  
Right, Jade, uh, ahem,
you remember our friend, Doug.


  
Are you kidding? He was the best man.


  
Exactly. Well, we can't find him,
and we're getting worried.


  
Oh, my God, that is so Doug.


  
Ha, ha. Oh.


  
Oh, sweetie, I'm...
I'm gonna go clean him off.


  
It's all right, Daddy didn't mean it.


  
Oh, my God.


  
What the fuck, man,
you gotta hold it together.


  
- Holy shit.
- She is super hot.


  
- You should be proud of yourself.
- She's wearing my grandmother's ring!


  
- What?
- The ring I'm gonna give to Melissa.


  
You remember,
my grandmother's Holocaust ring?


  
- Fuck. Okay.
- She's wearing it.


  
I didn't know they gave out rings
at the Holocaust.


  
- He's okay.
- Oh, good.


  
- He was just hungry, he's fine.
- Oh, good.


  
About last night, uh, ahem, do you
remember the last time you saw Doug?


  
Uh, I haven't seen him
since the wedding.


  
The wedding. Okay. Great.


  
And, uh, we can't re...
What time was that at?


  
Well, it was, um...


  
I guess it was around 1, because I had
to go back to work and finish my shift.


  
And then when I got out I headed over
to the hotel with Tyler.


  
And was Doug there then?


  
I didn't see Doug because you guys were
passed out. The room was a wreck.


  
- So I just curled up next to Stu.
- Uh-huh.


  
- Rowr.
- Oh.


  
I got a question.
Um, you said when your shift ended.


  
Does that mean you're a nurse?
Or a blackjack dealer?


  
- You know this. I'm a stripper.
- Mm-hm.


  
Well, technically I'm an escort...


  
...but stripping's a great way
to meet the clients.


  
- Smart.
- Savvy.


  
But that's all in the past,
now that I married a doctor.


  
I'm just a dentist.


  
- Las Vegas Police! Freeze!
- Okay.


  
Shut that baby up! Shut that baby up!


  
- Oh, God!
- Okay, okay, okay.


  
After we take the mug shots,
we bring them down here...


  
...where they wait to be interviewed
by the arresting officers.


  
Trust me, kids, you do not
wanna be sitting on these benches.


  
We call this place Loserville.


  
Follow me.
All right, let's do it. Come on.


  
Hello.


  
- Hey, Tracy! It's Phil.
- Hey, Phil.


  
- Where are you guys?
- We are at the spa at the hotel.


  
Cool. We're just getting some sun.
Is Doug around?


  
Of course. Why wouldn't he be?


  
I'm just wondering
why you're calling me.


  
Um...


  
We made a deal,
no talking to girlfriends or wives.


  
So we're all calling each other's.


  
Okay. What's up?


  
Uh, you are not gonna believe this.


  
We got comped an extra night
at the hotel.


  
You did?


  
Yeah. The suite is... It's ridiculous.
It's out of control.


  
There's, like, room service and a butler.
I mean, just the works.


  
We're thinking of spending the night...


  
...and we're gonna come back
in the morning.


  
You wanna stay an extra night?
But the wedding's tomorrow.


  
That's why we're gonna get up early,
and we'll be back in plenty of time.


  
Okay. Are you sure that's a good idea?


  
Wenneck, Price, Garner. Room 3.


  
Okay, Trace, I gotta go.
We'll talk to you later.


  
Uh...


  
- Come on, chop-chop.
- Okay, spin around.


  
- That's it.
- Goddamn it.


  
- Wait a second.
- I'll go over. I'll go over.


  
- Stop pulling.
- Can you just...? Hold on.


  
We got it. Alan, just relax.
And then just... There we go.


  
Good.


  
Gentlemen.


  
We've got some good news,
and we've got some bad news.


  
The good news is
we found your Mercedes.


  
- That's great news.
- That's great. See?


  
Yeah, it's over at impound right now.
We picked it up at 5 a.m. this morning...


  
...parked in the middle
of Las Vegas Boulevard.


  
- In the middle. That's weird.
- Yeah, that is weird.


  
There was also a note.


  
It says, uh, "Couldn't find a meter,
but here's 4 bucks."


  
The bad news is...


  
...we can't get you in front of a judge
until Monday morning.


  
Oh, no, uh, officer,
that's just impossible.


  
No, we need to be in L.A.
tomorrow for a wedding.


  
You stole a police car.


  
We didn't steal anything.
Um, we found it.


  
Yeah, if anything, we deserve a reward
or something, like a trophy.


  
- I see assholes like you every day.
- Every fucking day.


  
"Let's go to Vegas,
we'll all get drunk and laid!


  
- Yeah. Whoo! Woo-hoo.
- Woo-hoo.


  
Let's steal a cop car,
because it'd be really fucking funny."


  
Think you gonna get away with it?
Not up in here.


  
- Not up in here!
- Oh.


  
Uh...


  
Sir...


  
...if I may, um...


  
...I'm assuming that that squad car
belongs to one of you.


  
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


  
Look, I'm not a cop.


  
I'm no hero. I'm a schoolteacher.


  
But if one of my kids went missing
on a field trip...


  
...that would look really bad on me.


  
- What are you getting at?
- Yeah, Phil, what are you getting at?


  
No one wants to look bad.
We gotta get to a wedding...


  
...and you guys don't need people
talking about...


  
...how some obnoxious tourists
borrowed your squad car last night.


  
But look, the point is,
I think we can work out a deal.


  
Discreetly of course, ma'am.


  
What do you say?


  
Let me ask you a question:


  
Do, uh, any of you gentlemen have a
heart condition or anything like that?


  
Uh, no.


  
Okay, kids,
you're in for a real treat today.


  
These gentlemen have kindly volunteered
to demonstrate...


  
...how a stun gun is used
to subdue a suspect.


  
Ooh!


  
- That's right.
- Wait a sec. What?


  
Now, there's two ways to use
a stun gun. Up close and personal.


  
- What the fuck?
- Or you can shoot it from a distance.


  
Do I have any volunteers?


  
You wanna come up here
and do some shooting? Huh?


  
All right, how about you, young lady?
Come on up here. All right.


  
Let's go, handsome, come on.


  
Not you, fat Jesus, slide it on back.
You, pretty boy.


  
Fat Jesus.


  
All right, now,
it's real simple.


  
All you gotta do is point,
aim and shoot.


  
All right?


  
Okay, look.
You don't really wanna do this.


  
You can do this. Just focus.


  
Don't listen to this maniac.
Let's think this through.


  
Finish him!


  
- Oh, fuck.
- Yeah!


  
Right in the nuts! That was beautiful.


  
- Well done. Give her a hand, everybody.
- Good job. Good job.


  
Good job. Well done. Good job.
That was great.


  
Good. Hey, we got
one more charge left.


  
Anybody wanna do some
shooting up here?


  
How about you, big man?
Come on up here.


  
Okay, same instructions.
Just point, aim and shoot.


  
There you go. That's the stuff.


  
I like the intensity.


  
Eye of the tiger. Good.


  
You're holding 50,000 volts, little man.
Don't be afraid to ride the lightning.


  
In the face! In the face!


  
Oh, he's still up. He's still up.


  
- Aah!
- No.


  
All right, everybody relax, take it easy.


  
We've seen it before.
He just needs a little extra charge.


  
There we go.


  
Some of these big boys,
you gotta give them two shots.


  
All right, kids, who wants to get
their fingerprints done, huh?


  
Come on, let's go.


  
Fuck those guys, you hear me?


  
That was bullshit.
I'm telling everybody we stole a cop car.


  
- They let us go, who cares?
- I care!


  
You can't just do that.


  
You can't just tase people
because you think it's funny.


  
That's police brutality.


  
I'm getting a soda.
Do you guys want anything?


  
No.


  
My man doesn't shut up. Jesus Christ.


  
Alan, you okay?


  
I'm just worried.


  
What if something happened to Doug?
Something bad.


  
Come on, you can't think like that.


  
I mean, what if he's dead?


  
I can't afford to lose anybody
close to me again. It hurts too much.


  
- I was so upset when my grandpa died.
- Oh, I'm s... How'd he die?


  
- World War II.
- Died in battle?


  
No, he was skiing in Vermont.
It was just during World War II.


  
Alan...


  
...Doug is fine.
- Well, why hasn't he called?


  
I don't know,
but we're gonna figure it out.


  
I'll tell you another thing,
6-1 odds our car is beat to shit.


  
Stu, not now.


  
No, how much do you wanna bet
it's fucked beyond recognition?


  
That's enough. Alan's seriously worried,
okay? Let's not freak him out any more.


  
Sorry, Alan.


  
You know what?


  
We'll search the car for clues
and everything's gonna be okay.


  
Oh, shit. I can't watch.
Just tell me what it looks like.


  
Not looking. Not looking.


  
- Wow. All right.
- Oh, thank God.


  
You see?


  
It's gonna be all right.


  
- Anything?
- Hmm, I got a cigar.


  
Oh, I found, uh...
These are some black shoes.


  
- They women's shoes?
- I don't know.


  
- Whose are those?
- I don't know. It's a men's size 6.


  
- That's weird.
- What is this, a snakeskin?


  
Oh, come on! Ew!


  
- That's a used condom, Alan.
- Oh, God. Blech!


  
- Get it out of the car.
- Gross, it's wet.


  
- I don't want the thing.
- Hey! Come on.


  
I got jizz on me. Jesus Christ, guys!


  
- Get it out.
- Fuck!


  
Oh, my God.


  
All right, what the fuck, man?
We gotta get this shit together, guys!


  
What was that?


  
It's in the trunk.


  
- Doug's in the trunk.
- Oh, fuck! Holy shit!


  
Holy shit!


  
- Open it! Open it! Open it!
- Okay, okay, okay.


  
Okay, okay, okay.


  
Oh God!


  
Please! Please! Please stop!


  
Whoa. I'm with you, I'm with you!


  
- You gonna fuck on me?
- Nobody's gonna fuck on you!


  
We're on your side. I hate Godzilla!
I hate him too. I hate him!


  
He destroys cities! Please!


  
This isn't your fault.
I'll get you some pants.


  
What the fuck was that?


  
I have internal bleeding.
Somebody call 911.


  
That was some fucked up shit.


  
Who was that guy? He was so mean.


  
Guys, there's something
I need to tell you.


  
Last night on the roof,
before we went out...


  
...I slipped something
in our Jägermeister.


  
- What?
- I'm sorry, I fudged up, guys.


  
- You drugged us?
- No, I didn't drug you.


  
I was told it was ecstasy.


  
Well, who told you it was ecstasy?


  
The guy I bought it from
at the liquor store.


  
Why would you give us ecstasy?


  
I wanted everybody to have a good time
and I knew you guys wouldn't take it.


  
It was just one hit each.
I used to do three hits a night.


  
But it wasn't ecstasy, Alan,
it was roofies!


  
You think I knew that, Stu?


  
The guy I bought it from
seemed like a real straight shooter.


  
You mean the drug dealer at
the liquor store wasn't a good guy?


  
Let's just calm down.


  
You fucking calm down! He drugged us.
I lost a tooth. I married a whore.


  
- How dare you! She's a nice lady.
- You are such a fucking moron.


  
- Your language is offensive.
- Fuck you!


  
All right,
let's just take a deep breath, okay?


  
Seriously, this is a good thing.


  
At least it's not some stranger who
drugged us for God knows what reason.


  
Yeah, you're right, Phil,
it's totally a good thing.


  
We're so much better off now.


  
Here's something
I would like to remind you two of:


  
Our best friend Doug is probably
facedown in a ditch right now...


  
...with a meth-head butt-fucking
his corpse.


  
- That's highly unlikely.
- It's true.


  
Does not help. All right,
let's get our shit together, guys.


  
Let's go back to the hotel,
and I'm gonna make a couple calls.


  
Maybe Doug's back there.
Maybe he's asleep.


  
Come on. Let's go.


  
- Stu? Little help?
- Shut up.


  
- Ow.
- Oh, God. Oh, God, are you okay?


  
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Alan, I'm sorry.


  
Wait, guys. Guys.


  
What about the tiger?
What if he got out?


  
Oh, fuck. I keep forgetting
about the goddamn tiger.


  
How the fuck did he get in there?


  
I don't know,
because I don't remember.


  
Shh. Stu. Stu, keep it down.


  
Because one of the, uh, side effects
of, uh, roofies is memory loss.


  
You are literally too stupid to insult.


  
- Thank you.
- Hey.


  
Hey, come on.


  
Did we leave the music on?


  
Hey. Shh.


  
Don't make any sudden movements.


  
- Unh. Whoa!
- Aah!


  
- Who the hell are you?
- No, who are you?


  
Quiet, quiet.


  
Mike Tyson?


  
Shh. This is my favorite part
coming up right now.


  
Need a chorus line, guys.


  
One more time, guys.


  
Oh, Jesus!


  
Oh, fuck!


  
Why did you do that?


  
Mr. Tyson would like to know
why is his tiger in your bathroom.


  
Hold on,
that was completely unnecessary.


  
I'm a huge fan. When you knocked out
Holmes, that was...


  
Explain.


  
All right, look,
we were drugged last night.


  
We have no memory
of what happened.


  
It's true.


  
We got in all kinds of trouble last night
and now we can't find our friend.


  
If you wanna kill us,
go ahead because I don't care anymore.


  
- What are you talking about?
- I don't care.


  
Why the fuck
would you wanna steal his tiger?


  
We tend to do dumb shit
when we're fucked up.


  
- I don't believe these guys, man.
- Wait, how did you guys find us?


  
One of you dropped your jacket.
Found it in the tigers' cage this morning.


  
That's Doug's.


  
Yeah, Doug.
His wallet and his room key is in there.


  
- No, that's our missing friend.
- I don't give a fuck.


  
- Did you guys see him?
- I was fast asleep.


  
Because if he was up, this
wouldn't have gone down so smoothly.


  
Maybe one of the tigers
ate his ass like Omar.


  
Respect.


  
Wha...? What happened to Omar?


  
Oh, don't worry about Omar,
he's not with us no more.


  
Okay, I know this is asking a lot...


  
...but do you think we could
go to your house and look around...


  
...see if there's any clues?


  
Absolutely. How else you think
we're gonna get the tiger back anyway?


  
- Come on, champ.
- I'm sorry?


  
We're not gonna put it in the Bentley.
You brought it here, you bring it back.


  
What you think, about 40 minutes?


  
Don't make me come back for him.


  
- That was Mike Tyson.
- Yeah, no shit that was Mike Tyson.


  
I'm just saying, he's still got it.


  
Alan.


  
Bud, are you okay?


  
- Oh, my God.
- Shit!


  
Fuck, where'd he get him?


  
Hey.


  
This does not seem fair.


  
It's Rock, Paper, Scissors.
There's nothing more fair.


  
- Alan should do it.
- Alan took a punch from Mike Tyson.


  
Come on. For Doug.


  
Why are you peppering the steak?
You don't know if tigers like pepper.


  
Tigers love pepper. They hate cinnamon.


  
Phil, just do it. You should do it.


  
I would, but you lost.
It wouldn't be right.


  
Okay, I jammed five roofies in there.


  
Just go in there and throw it in to him.


  
Fine.


  
Make sure he eats the whole thing.


  
Fuck.


  
Oh, fuck.


  
Hey, kitty.


  
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.
I got a little snack for you.


  
Real important that you eat this, okay?


  
Yeah, just have a little...


  
Shit!


  
What do we do now?


  
We wait.


  
What do tigers dream of


  
When they take a little tiger snooze?


  
Do they dream of mauling zebras


  
Or Halle Berry in her Catwoman suit?


  
Don 't you worry your pretty striped head


  
We're gonna get you back to Tyson
And your cozy tiger bed


  
And then we're gonna find
Our best friend Doug


  
And then we're gonna give him
A best-friend hug


  
Doug


  
Doug


  
Doug, Dougie, Dougie, Doug, Doug


  
But if he's been murdered
By crystal-meth tweakers


  
Well, then we're shit out of luck


  
By the way, we're all gonna die.


  
Wait.


  
- Oh, God.
- Watch it!


  
His nose. That's his nose.


  
Hey, guys, when's the next
Halley's comet?


  
- Who cares, man?
- Do you know, Stu?


  
I don't think it's for, like,
another 60 years or something.


  
- But it's not tonight, right?
- No, I don't think so.


  
But you don't know for sure?


  
No.


  
I got this cousin who saw one.
He said it blew his mind.


  
I wanna make sure I never, ever miss out
on a Halley's Comet.


  
So if you guys
know if there's gonna be one...


  
Oh, fuck!


  
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck it!


  
Stu! Stu, it got me! Stu!


  
You got clawed! You're bleeding!


  
- Oh.
- I'm panicking.


  
- Aah!
- Oh, my God.


  
Okay. Okay, okay. Wait, hold on.


  
I can't do it.


  
Get your fucking hand
back in there...


  
...and steer the car.
- I'm too nervous.


  
Alan. We need you, buddy.
This is your time to shine, okay?


  
Okay, yeah. Whew.


  
Daddy's gonna kill me.


  
- That's it.
- That's good.


  
Keep it straight.


  
- You're late.
- Whatever, man.


  
We had to push it the last mile.


  
Come on in. Mike's got something
he wants to show you.


  
That thing's out of control, man.
Seriously, you gotta put it down.


  
When we got back,
we took a look at the security cameras.


  
Great.


  
This is how you walk.
This is how you walk.


  
- Oh, it's Doug.
- Oh, thank God he's alive.


  
That's our buddy.
That's who we've been missing.


  
We're all best friends.


  
Why don't you just pay attention?
I don't have all night.


  
Yeah, of course. Of course.


  
What are you doing?


  
Hey, guys. Check it out.
Watch this.


  
That's me, I'm on TV.
I've never been on TV before.


  
What are you doing, man?


  
Really? Really, Alan?


  
You got a fire hose, man?


  
Yeah, I was, uh...


  
You're gonna overflow the pool, man.


  
- Maybe... Should I wait outside?
- I think that's a good idea, Alan.


  
Yeah.


  
Don't touch anything out there, either.


  
You know what? He's not our good fr...
We don't know him that well.


  
Come on. Come on, come on.


  
By the way,
where you get that cop car from?


  
We, uh, stole it from
these dumb-ass cops.


  
Nice.


  
High five that one.


  
Yeah, that's nice.


  
You know, I just have to say...


  
...I have never seen a more beautiful,
elegant, just regal creature.


  
Check it out. Stu. Stu.
Fuck this tiger.


  
- Oh, my God. That's awful.
- Oh, man.


  
- Oh, shit.
- Who does shit like that, man?


  
Someone who has a lot of issues,
obviously. I'm a sick man.


  
Oh, my God.


  
That's all we got.


  
This was hugely helpful.


  
Really. Because now we know
that our buddy Doug...


  
...was with us at 3:30, totally alive.


  
Thanks again, champ. And, uh, again,
we are so sorry we stole your tiger.


  
Don't worry about it, man.


  
Like you said, we all do dumb shit
when we're fucked up.


  
- I told you he'd get it.
- I did say that.


  
You know, everyone says
Mike Tyson is such a badass...


  
...but I think he's kind of a sweetheart.


  
I think he's mean.


  
All right. I think it's officially time
we call Tracy.


  
Hallelujah. Finally, Phil says something
that makes sense.


  
We don't have much of a choice.
And maybe she's heard from Doug.


  
That's what I been saying
this whole time.


  
We just need to be completely honest.
We need to tell her everything.


  
We don't have to tell her everything.
We can leave out the stuff...


  
...about me marrying a hooker.


  
Just stay focused on Doug.


  
- What am I gonna tell my dad?
- Alan, relax. It's just the inside.


  
Come on. I got a guy in L.A.
who's great with interiors.


  
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, my God.


  
- Are you guys okay?
- What the fuck?


  
I know that guy.
That's the guy from the trunk.


  
Get out of the car. Please.


  
W... W... Wait.
Those are the guys that shot Eddie.


  
- Listen...
- Let's go!


  
- Okay.
- Oh, no.


  
- Easy, easy.
- Come on.


  
Okay. All right.


  
- All right, all right.
- Let's go.


  
Hey, relax. Ow. Ow. Ow!


  
- I have whiplash.
- Get this other fat boy.


  
Get the fat boy.


  
Hey, hey, hey.


  
- All right, all right.
- Hey, take it easy, take it easy!


  
I want my purse back, assholes.


  
- What? Your purse?
- That's not a purse, it's a satchel.


  
It's a purse. Okay?
And you steal from wrong guy.


  
Wait a second, wait a second.
We stole from you?


  
Okay, you know what?


  
We don't remember anything
that happened last night...


  
...so help us out a little here.


  
Well, apparently you guys met
at a craps table late last night.


  
You were on a heater,
and he played your hot streak.


  
He ended up winning
just under 80 grand.


  
No shit? Eighty grand is nice.


  
Okay, that's good.


  
He put the chips in his purse,
and then you guys took off with it.


  
That doesn't sound like us.


  
Mine had $80,000 inside.
And this one? Nothing.


  
Hey, there are Skittles in there.


  
Ow! Oh, not again.


  
Don't let the beard fool you.
He's a child.


  
It's funny because he's fat.


  
Now, look, this was obviously
a very simple misunderstanding.


  
Alan picked up the wrong purse,
it's no big deal.


  
Okay, if it's, "No big deal,"
why, when I come after you guys...


  
...he starts screaming like crazy and
throw me in trunk?


  
What, I did that?


  
Yeah, you said he was
your lucky charm...


  
...and you want to take him
home with you.


  
- Lucky charm.
- Oh, it's just funny.


  
Fuck you.


  
If you want to see your friend again,
you get me my 80 grand.


  
- What?
- Our friend?


  
- You have Doug?
- You know about our friend?


  
- Doug!
- Doug!


  
- Doug's in the car! Doug's in the car!
- Doug, it's okay!


  
You chill out, goatee!


  
- Okay, okay. All right, fine, fine.
- What do you want?


  
Not so good now.
Quid pro quo, douche bag.


  
What?


  
Look, we're very sorry.
But this is an easy fix.


  
- Alan, where's his purse?
- I don't know.


  
- It's in the hotel room, right?
- Yeah, we can get it.


  
We can get you the... We can even
write you a check right now.


  
No chance. Cash only.


  
- There's a person in there.
- Boring.


  
Take nap. Come on.


  
Wait. I'm sorry we're boring you!


  
- Doug, it's okay.
- You kidnapped our friend! Kidnapper!


  
Wait.


  
Oh, no.
You're not going anywhere.


  
Stop.


  
Stop. Run me over.


  
- Okay. Whoa. Whoa.
- Stu, Stu, Stu.


  
Bring money to Big Rock
in Mojave Desert at dawn.


  
- What?
- Toodle-oo, motherfucker.


  
Well, at least take the bag
off his head! Fuck!


  
Oh!


  
Come on, get out of here.


  
Guys, I'm telling you, I looked
for it this morning before we left.


  
It's not anywhere.


  
Fuck.


  
Stu, how much you got in the bank?


  
About 10 grand.
I was gonna use it for the wedding.


  
You're already married,
so we're good there.


  
Besides, enough with Melissa,
she's the worst.


  
Yeah, Doug told me she had sex
with a pilot or something.


  
It was a bartender on a cruise.
What is wrong with you people?


  
- Ew. Alan, did you just eat sofa pizza?
- Yes.


  
What are we gonna do?
We are so fucked.


  
Hey, guys?


  
- Did you find it?
- Nope.


  
But check this out.


  
Change only, 10,000.


  
- Hey, uh, these seats taken?
- No, feel free.


  
All right, let's play some blackjack!


  
That's it. Shut up, bitches.


  
Hmm.


  
- I'll stick.
- Oh, fuck you! Fuck you!


  
Splitting fives.


  
- Too many.
- Yes!


  
I don't even know you,
but I'm gonna tell you that's dumb.


  
- Yes!
- Oh!


  
Okay, come on.
He can't lose. He can't lose.


  
I think the pit boss is watching him.


  
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?


  
I'm such a klutz. I get so nervous
when I gamble. I'm so silly.


  
- It happens.
- Whoa. Hold on a beat, okay?


  
- Let's just take it easy. This is my wife.
- It's hurting.


  
Make sure... Does it hurt? Does this hurt?


  
- Oh, ow.
- You all right?


  
- I don't know.
- I don't know either. I don't...


  
I think you're fine. Let's go.


  
- Really? Okay.
- Upsy-daisy, there.


  
I'm sorry,
she's had a little too much to drink.


  
Thanks, buddy. That's for you.


  
And 100, 200, 300, 400.


  
With all this, that's $82,400.


  
Oh, goddamn it.
I don't fucking believe it.


  
Whoo!


  
- Alan, you're the man.
- You are too, Phil.


  
We should come back next week,
take the whole city down.


  
Oh, I'm free next week.


  
Or we could just focus
on getting Doug back, right now.


  
Uh, you know what? Next week's no
good, the Jonas Brothers are in town.


  
But any week after that is totally fine.


  
I think it's safe to say that our luck
has officially turned around, guys.


  
We are back, baby.
We are fucking back.


  
We're back. Classic.


  
We are back, we are back
- That's right.


  
We are getting Doug back


  
And we're the three best friends
That anybody could have


  
We're the three best friends
That anyone could have


  
We're the three best friends
That anyone can have


  
And we'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever
Leave each other


  
We're the best three friends
That anybody could have


  
I mean, the three best friends
That anybody could have


  
That's right, the three best friends
That anybody can have


  
- Now what?
- Give him the signal.


  
- What signal?
- Flash your lights. Let him know it's on.


  
- What's on?
- The deal.


  
Of course it's on. We just drove 30 miles
into the desert. He knows it's on.


  
Phil, just do something.


  
Fine.


  
- Oh, shit.
- See?


  
All right, let's go.


  
Funny fat guy fall on face.


  
You okay?


  
All right, we got the money.
Eighty grand, cash.


  
Throw it over. Then I give you Doug.


  
Um, I'm sorry.
First of all, good morning.


  
And we didn't catch
your name last night.


  
Mr. Chow. Leslie Chow.


  
Mr. Chow, it is a pleasure.
My name is Stu.


  
And we would very much appreciate
an opportunity to see Doug...


  
...before we give you the money,
just to verify that he's okay.


  
- lf that's cool.
- Of course, Stu. That is cool.


  
- Oh, thank God.
- Okay.


  
See, he fine. Now give me money...


  
...or I shoot him,
and I shoot all you motherfuckers.


  
And then we take it.
Your choice, bitches.


  
- Give him the money, Stu.
- Okay.


  
- It's all there.
- Let him go.


  
All right, take it easy. Take it easy.


  
Ta-da.


  
Is this some kind of joke?
Who the hell is this?


  
That is not Doug.


  
What you talking about, Willis?
That him.


  
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Chow.
That's not our friend.


  
- He... That's...
- The Doug we're looking for is a white.


  
Ah! I told you you had the wrong guy,
little boy.


  
Damn, Alan,
what the fuck you got me into?


  
- You know him?
- This is the guy...


  
...that sold me
the bad drugs.


  
- How you doing?
- I didn't sell you no fucking bad drugs.


  
- Wait. He sold you the Ruphylin?
- Ruphylin? I sold you that Ru...? Wha...?


  
- Who gives a shit? Where is Doug?
- I am Doug.


  
- Your name's Doug?
- Yes, I'm Doug.


  
His name's Doug too.
Ha. Classic mix-up.


  
Come on.


  
Hey, Chow.
You gave us the wrong Doug.


  
Not my problem.


  
No, fuck that shit. Now, you give us our
80 grand back and take him with you!


  
- No. Come on. I'll be your Doug.
- Oh, yeah, okay. Oh, I take him back.


  
Right after you suck on
these little Chinese nuts.


  
- Ah. That's nasty.
- Mmm. How that sound?


  
Unh, pshh.


  
- So long, gay boys.
- Wait a second.


  
He's a nasty little motherfucker.


  
Did you ever get any ecstasy?


  
No, I ain't got no fucking ecstasy.


  
- Goddamn it!
- Gosh darn it!


  
- Shit!
- Shoot!


  
- Hello?
- Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil.


  
Phil, where the hell are you guys?
I'm freaking out.


  
Yeah, listen.


  
We fucked up.


  
Thanks for the lift back to town.


  
- I got a question for you.
- What's up?


  
How did you wind up in Chow's car?


  
That crazy asshole
kidnapped me yesterday.


  
Okay, but why? I mean, why you?


  
He thought I was with you guys because
we were hanging over at the Bellagio.


  
- What?
- We were at the Bellagio?


  
We were shooting craps.
You don't remember?


  
No. No, we don't remember.


  
Because some dick drug dealer sold him
Ruphylin and told him it was ecstasy.


  
Ruphylin. There you go with that word.
Ruphylin. What the hell is a Ruphylin?


  
Wow, you are
the world's shittiest drug dealer.


  
Ruphylin, for your information, is the
date rape drug. You sold Alan roofies.


  
Oh, shit. I must have mixed up the bags.
My fault, Alan.


  
Damn, Marshall gonna be
pissed off at me on that one.


  
- Whatever.
- It's funny, because just the other day...


  
...me and my boy, we was wondering
why they even call them roofies.


  
- You know what I'm talking about?
- No. Don't know.


  
Why not floories, right?
Because when you take them...


  
...you're more likely
to end up on the floor than the roof.


  
What about groundies?
That's a good new name for them.


  
Or, how about rapies?


  
- Wait, what did you just say?
- Rapies.


  
Not you. Doug,
what did you say before?


  
I said groundies.


  
No, before that.


  
You said, "You're more likely to wind up
on the floor than..."


  
- Phil.
- Listen, Trace, I'm really sorry. l...


  
- Phil? Hello?
- Tracy, it's Stu.


  
Stu. Talk to me. What's going on?


  
Uh, nothing. Don't listen to Phil.


  
He's completely out of his mind.
He's probably still drunk from last night.


  
Where's Doug?


  
He is paying the bill.
We just had a delicious brunch.


  
We're in a hurry to get back,
so we gotta get going.


  
- Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye.
- Stu.


  
Stu. Fuck.


  
- What the fuck, man?
- I know where Doug is.


  
I don't know, man. It just hit me.


  
You remember when we saw
Doug's mattress impaled on that statue?


  
- Yeah, we threw it out the window.
- No, impossible.


  
You can't open windows
in Vegas hotels.


  
Well, then how did it get...?


  
- Oh, my God!
- Ha, ha, ha.


  
- Whoa, wait. What's going on?
- Doug was trying to signal someone.


  
- Holy shit.
- Yes.


  
- Wait. How did you figure that out?
- Doug made me realize it.


  
- Doug?
- Uh, not our Doug. Black Doug.


  
- Hey, hey, easy with that shit. Come on.
- Sorry.


  
Can someone tell me
where white Doug is?


  
- He's on the roof, Alan.
- Yes.


  
He's on the roof. We must have
taken him up there as a prank...


  
...so he'd wake up on the roof.
- Like that time in summer camp.


  
We moved his sleeping bag
out in the jetty at the lake?


  
Ha, ha, ha. Which was hilarious.


  
It's not so funny now, though,
because we forgot where we put him.


  
You guys are retarded, you know that?


  
- Holy shit. You think he's still up there?
- There's only one way to find out.


  
Doug!


  
Doug!


  
- Doug!
- Doug, you up here, buddy?


  
Where you at, Doug?


  
Doug!


  
Hey, guys!


  
He's over here!


  
- Hey, I found him! He's over here!
- Oh, shit.


  
He's okay.


  
You're okay. Ha, ha, ha!


  
Oh, God. We gotta go, buddy. Come on.


  
Oh, we have been looking everywhere
for you.


  
- He's alive.
- What the fuck is going on?


  
We can explain everything,
but right now we gotta go.


  
- Hey, bud. You okay?
- No. Not okay.


  
You look good, you got some color.
I'm jealous.


  
- I'm getting married today.
- Yes, you are.


  
That's why you need to focus
and do everything we say.


  
Because, frankly, you're wasting
a little bit of time right now.


  
You fucking asshole!


  
Oh, my skin burns. My skin burns.


  
Oh, ow! God.


  
- It's okay. It's not your fault, Doug.
- Don't touch me. Shut up.


  
All of you, shut up.


  
Just get me home.


  
Mm-hm.


  
Just get me home.


  
What about the one after that?


  
You cannot be serious.


  
Oh, goddamn it.


  
- What?
- Every flight to L.A. is booked.


  
- What about Burbank?
- Sold out.


  
Oh, fuck! We can't drive there, the
wedding starts in three and a half hours.


  
- Alan, where's the car?
- It's on its way.


  
You know what?


  
We can drive there.
We can make it. Okay?


  
Hi.


  
- Just give me one second.
- We will leave without you.


  
- Is he missing a tooth?
- Yeah.


  
- Hey.
- Hey.


  
Hey, thanks for helping out last night.
That was so awesome.


  
Sure.


  
Listen, Jade, l...


  
Look, you don't have to say it.
I totally understand.


  
- This whole thing was stupid.
- Huh.


  
It was stupid, wasn't it?


  
- This is yours.
- Oh, thank you.


  
I can't believe I gave my grandmother's
Holocaust ring to someone I just met.


  
- What was I thinking?
- You were really fucked up.


  
Clearly.


  
- You did pull out your own tooth.
- l...?


  
I pulled out my tooth?


  
Why did I pull out my own tooth?


  
Alan bet you that you weren't
a good enough dentist...


  
...to pull out your own tooth.


  
Okay. Heh.


  
- Of course he did.
- You won.


  
Yeah. Clearly. Yeah.


  
That's victory, right there.


  
It needs to go down.


  
- It's good. Get in.
- No. Safety first.


  
- Alan, it's fine. It's down.
- No, I gotta get it down first.


  
- Jesus Christ. Look out.
- Don't mess the car up.


  
You're gonna mess the car up.


  
- Hey, what are you doing next weekend?
- I don't know. Working. Why?


  
I was thinking maybe I'd come back
and take you out to dinner.


  
Really? Like a date?


  
Yeah. Like a date.
Only, one that hopefully I'll remember.


  
Sounds good.


  
- Stu. Come on.
- Stu. Come on.


  
I gotta go. Okay. Bye.


  
- Bye.
- Bye.


  
All right, here we go.


  
- All right, let's go.
- Yeah.


  
Careful.


  
At least the trip
wasn't a total disaster.


  
- What makes you say that?
- When I woke up on the roof...


  
...I happened to find $80,worth of Bellagio chips in my pocket.


  
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!


  
Looks like we're going home
with some money, boys.


  
Here he comes. That's him.


  
- Hey, Neeco!
- Hey. What's up, Alan?


  
Whoo!


  
- Whoa, look out.
- Oh, shit.


  
Whoa! Whoa!


  
- Thanks, Neeco.
- You got it, man.


  
- Page me!
- Adiós.


  
- Who the hell was that guy?
- That's my buddy.


  
Hey. Sorry, MapQuest took us
on a really crazy route.


  
- How's my hair?
- It looks good.


  
- Is it cool like Phil's?
- It's classic Phil.


  
She looks beautiful, man.


  
Sorry I'm late.


  
Vegas.


  
Where were you?
And why are you so red?


  
Honey, it's a long story.


  
We are gathered here today...


  
...because of the strength of love
and of promises kept.


  
All I know is I am so sorry.


  
And I promise
for as long as we're married...


  
...to never, ever put you
through anything like this again.


  
Can you forgive me?


  
- Daddy.
- Hey, my man.


  
Excuse me, but I'm expecting
my husband any minute.


  
Oh, that's very funny. Come here.


  
How was your soccer game?


  
- Stu? You avoiding me?
- Hey. Melissa.


  
Oh, my God.
What happened to your tooth?


  
Have you met Alan? Tracy's brother.
Brother of the...


  
Okay. Ow.


  
That is disgusting.
Why haven't you returned my calls?


  
Well, there was a snafu
when we stopped...


  
I called that bed and breakfast in Napa.


  
They said they had no record
of you even checking in.


  
That's because we didn't go to Napa.


  
- Stu. What the fuck is going on?
- We went to Las Vegas.


  
Oh, really? Las Vegas?
Why would you go to Las Vegas?


  
My friend was getting married.
That's what guys do.


  
- Okay, that's not what you do.
- Really?


  
Well, then why did I do it, huh?
Because I did it. Riddle me that.


  
Why'd I do it?


  
All you want me to do
is what you want me to do.


  
I'm sick of doing what you want.


  
In a healthy relationship, a guy should
be able to do what he wants.


  
- That is not how this works!
- Oh, good.


  
Because whatever this is
ain't working for me!


  
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.


  
Since when?


  
Since you fucked that waiter
on your cruise last June. Boom!


  
- You told me it was a bartender.
- Oh, you're right. I stand corrected.


  
It was a bartender.
You fucked a bartender.


  
You're an idiot.


  
You're... You...


  
You're such a bad person.


  
Like, all the way through to your core.


  
Alan, shall we dance?


  
Let's do this.


  
- It was a real pleasure meeting you.
- Fuck off.


  
- I'm getting my bartender's license.
- Suck my dick.


  
No, thank you.


  
You guys are awesome.


  
Dougie...


  
...I gotta tell you, man,
this was a gorgeous wedding.


  
- I give it six months.
- You're a dick.


  
I don't know what to say.
Thanks for the bachelor party, I guess?


  
Yeah. I just wish
we could actually remember some of it.


  
- Hey, guys? Look what I found.
- Whoa, that's my camera.


  
- It was in the back seat of the car.
- Oh, Go... Are there photos on it?


  
Yeah. Some of it's even worse
than we thought.


  
- No fucking way. Give me that.
- Wa... Wa... Wait.


  
Wait, wait, wait.


  
We look at these
pictures together, okay?


  
One time.


  
- And then we delete the evidence.
- I say we delete it right now.


  
Are you nuts? I wanna find out
how I wound up in the hospital.


  
- Yeah, it's in there.
- Guys, one time.


  
- Deal?
- Deal.


  
- Deal.
- Okay.


  
Oh, dear Lord!


  
That's classic!

These violent delights
have violent ends...


  
And in their triumph die,
like fire and powder...


  
Which, as they kiss, consume...


  
Gran?


  
Edward, don't!
She will see you.


  
Okay.


  
Grandma, I would like
you to meet...


  
Happy birthday, Bella.


  
Happy birthday, Bells.


  
I thought we agreed,
no presents.


  
Well, the one from me
is not wrapped.


  
So, don't count.


  
It's actually great.
Thanks, Dad.


  
Uh, goes with this one
from your mom.


  
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.


  
It's to put your pictures in,
from senior year.


  
Senior year.


  
How'd you get so old so fast?
- I didn't.


  
It's not that old.
- I don't know.


  
Is that a grey hair?


  
No! No way!


  
Happy Birthday.


  
It's really funny.


  
Another missing hiker brings
the total to three presumed deaths.


  
The Rangers are searching
for the killer animal...


  
Oh, it's Bella.
Bella!


  
Today is the big day, Bella.


  
Uh, R and J essay due?
- Oh, yeah!


  
Wherefore art thou, Bella?


  
I wanna take a picture of you guys.
My Mom...


  
...wants me to put together, like...


  
...a scrapbook full of memories.
- Oh, of course, yeah.


  
I take them, I'm not in them.
- No, no, no, come here.


  
You'll photoshop my nose
if it looks big, right?


  
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.


  
It's good.


  
Oh, good.
Cullen's here.


  
Well, catch you later.


  
Happy birthday.
- Don't remind me.


  
Bella, your birth is definitely
something to celebrate.


  
But my aging is not.
- Your aging?


  
I think 18 is all youngster,
don't worry about that.


  
It's one year older than you.


  
No, it isn't.


  
I'm a hundred and nine.
- Wow!


  
Maybe I should not be dating
such an old man.


  
It's gross!


  
I should feel certainly repulse.


  
We have to go to class.
- Yeah.


  
Wait a second.


  
Someone wants you.


  
Bella.
- Jacob!


  
I'll leave you to talk.


  
Hello, biceps!


  
You know, anabolic steroids are
really bad for you.


  
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.


  
You know, wouldn't seem so drastic
if we hung out more.


  
We should switch schools.


  
Then you can come hang out
with the pale faces.


  
I'm alright.


  
I prefer the Res school's exclusivity.


  
They let any old rift raft into this place.


  
I see.
Why are you summing it?


  
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.


  
You should really come, take a ride,
when it's done.


  
Is it fast?
- Huh, it's decent.


  
Okay.
- Okay, good.


  
Hey, happy birthday.


  
Your Dad told my Dad.
So...


  
Yeah, of course, he did.


  
I saw this the other day and
thought of you.


  
It catches bad dreams.


  
It's perfect.


  
Thank you.
- No problem.


  
See you soon. Bye.
- Yeah, see you later.


  
So, how come Jacob Black gets to
give you a gift and I don't?


  
Because I have nothing
to give back to you.


  
Bella, you give me everything
just by breathing.


  
See? Thank you.
That's all I want.


  
Bella!


  
Happy Birthday!
- Shhh!


  
I thought, I said you,
no presents.


  
I've already seen you open it
and guess what?


  
You love it!


  
You're gonna wear it tonight,
our house.


  
Come on, please?
It will be fun.


  
Okay. alright.
- Great! Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.


  
Jasper, no fair
with the mood control thing.


  
Sorry, Bella.


  
Happy...


  
Never mind.


  
You can't trust vampires.


  
Trust me!


  
O, my love!
My wife!


  
Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath.


  
Hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.


  
Thou art not conquered.


  
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips
and in thy cheeks.


  
And death's pale flag
is not advanced there.


  
I hate being celebrated.


  
There are worse tragedies.


  
Hm, look at Romeo.


  
He kills his true love
out of sheer stupidity.


  
Yeah.


  
Though I do envy him,
one thing.


  
Juliet. She's like perfect.


  
If you like that obviously
beautiful sort of thing.


  
No, not the girl, dear.


  
The suicide.


  
It's nearly impossible for...


  
...some people.


  
For humans,
a little poison...


  
...a dagger to the heart...


  
So many different options.


  
Why would you say that?


  
Because I considered it once.


  
I didn't know,
if I'd get to you in time.


  
I had to come up with
some kind of...


  
...plan.


  
And what was the plan?


  
I would go to Italy,


  
...and provoke the Volturi.


  
The what?
- The Volturi...


  
Now, who would like to repeat
the last few lines...


  
just to show,
they were paying attention?


  
Mr. Cullen.


  
Oh, yes, Mr. Birdy.


  
O, here.


  
Will I set up my everlasting rest,


  
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.


  
Eyes, look your last!


  
Arms, take your last embrace!


  
And lips, O you,
the doors of breath,


  
...seal with a righteous kiss.


  
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!


  
Eyes on the screen, people.


  
Thus with a kiss I die.


  
The Volturi are a very old,
very powerful family.


  
I guess, the closest thing to royalty
my world has.


  
Is that Carlisle?
- Yeah.


  
He lived with them
for a few decades.


  
Described them as
very refined.


  
No respect for human life,
of course, but...


  
...respect for the arts
and science as at least.


  
And the law...


  
...above all of law.


  
And vampires have laws?


  
Not very many.


  
There's only one and
it's regularly enforced.


  
What is it?


  
To keep the existence
of our kind a secret.


  
We don't make spectacles
of ourselves,


  
And we don't kill conspicuously.


  
Unless, of course,
you want to die.


  
We have to talking about that.


  
I can't even think...


  
...about someone hurting you.


  
Bella, the only thing that
can hurt me is you.


  
And I don't have anything else
to be afraid of.


  
That's not true.


  
Victoria?
She will come for me one day.


  
Alice will see
what she decides and...


  
...we will be ready.
- I can protect you.


  
If you change me.


  
Bella, you already do protect me.


  
You're my only reason...


  
...to stay alive,
if that's what I am.


  
But it's my job to protect you.


  
From everyone except my sister.


  
It's time!


  
It's time! It's time!
It's time!


  
Sorry about all this.
We tried to rein Alice in.


  
Like it's even possible.


  
Happy big Birthday, Bella!
- Thanks.


  
I found it in your bag, mind?


  
Dating an older woman?
Hot!


  
What?


  
You first, Rosalie.


  
It's a necklace.


  
Alice picked it up.
- Thanks.


  
Show me the love!


  
This is from Emmett.


  
Already installed it in your truck.


  
Finally, a decent sound system
for that piece of...


  
Hey, don't... don't hate the truck.


  
Open Esme and Carlisle's.


  
Just a little something
to brighten your day.


  
We think, you looking
kind of pale lately.


  
Paper cut.


  
Jas... Jas!


  
It's okay.
It's just a little...


  
...blood.


  
Get Jasper out of here.


  
I'm sor...
I'm sorry, I can't.


  
I'll have to stitch this up
in my office.


  
Check on Jasper.


  
I'm sure, he's very upset with himself.


  
And I doubt he'll listen to anyone
but you right now.


  
Edward?


  
I never wanted that party.
- It's not your fault.


  
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood
as long as the rest of us.


  
How do you do it?


  
Years and years of practice.


  
Did you ever think it of...


  
...just doing it the easier way?


  
No.


  
I knew who I wanted to be.


  
I wanted to help people.


  
Brings me happiness.


  
Even if I'm damned about this.


  
Damned?


  
Like... like hell?


  
Carlisle, you can't be damned.


  
You couldn't, it's impossible.


  
Thank you, Bella.


  
You always been very...


  
...gracious about us.


  
So, that's it?


  
That's why he won't change me?


  
Imagine the situation in reverse.


  
If you believed as Edward does...


  
...would you take away his soul?


  
You can't protect me.


  
From everything.


  
At some point,
something's gonna separate us.


  
It's gonna be an accident,


  
...or illness,


  
...or old age.


  
As long as I'm human.


  
And the only solution
is to change me.


  
That's not a solution,
it's a tragedy.


  
You're not gonna love me
when I look like a grandmother.


  
Bella, do you not understand
my feelings for you? No?


  
Carlisle told me...


  
...how you feel about your soul.


  
I don't believe that.


  
So don't worry about mine.


  
You should go inside.


  
It's still my birthday.


  
Can I ask one thing?


  
Kiss me?


  
I love you.


  
I love you.


  
Hi.


  
Come for a walk with me.


  
We got to leave Forks.


  
Why?


  
Carlisle's supposed to be
ten years older than he looks.


  
People are starting to notice.


  
Okay, I...


  
I gotta think of something
to say to Charlie.


  
When you say "we"...


  
I mean to my family and myself.


  
Edward, what happened with Jasper,


  
...it's nothing.
- You're right.


  
It was nothing.


  
Nothing the way
I always expected.


  
And nothing compared to
what could have happened.


  
You just don't belong
to my world, Bella.


  
I belong with you.


  
No, you don't.


  
I'm coming.


  
Bella.


  
I don't want you to come.


  
You don't want me?


  
No.


  
This changes things.


  
alright.


  
But if it's not
too much to ask...


  
...can you at least
promise me something?


  
Don't do anything reckless.


  
For Charlie's sake.


  
And I'll promise something
to you in return.


  
This is the last time
you'll ever see me.


  
I won't come back.


  
And you can go on
with your life...


  
...without any interference from me.


  
It will be like...


  
I never existed,
I promise.


  
If this is about my soul, take it.


  
I don't want without you.
- It's not about your soul.


  
You're just not good for me.


  
I'm not good enough for you?


  
I'm just sorry,
I let this go on for so long.


  
Please...


  
...don't.


  
Goodbye.


  
Edward?


  
Edward!


  
Edward!


  
I'll try to call Cullens place again.


  
The Cullens left town, Charlie.
- Good riddance!


  
Where did they go?


  
We'll find her, Charlie.
- Thanks, Harry.


  
Charlie?


  
She's alright.


  
I got her.


  
Thank you, Sam.


  
Alice,


  
...you have disappeared.


  
Like everything else.


  
But who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.


  
When you left...


  
and he left...


  
You took everything with you.


  
But the absence of him
is everywhere I look...


  
It's like a huge hole...


  
...has been punched through my chest.


  
But in a way I'm glad.


  
The pain is my only reminder that
he was real...


  
...that you all were.


  
alright, that's it.


  
What?


  
You're going to Jacksonville
to live with your mother.


  
I'm not leaving Forks.


  
Bells...


  
...he's not coming back.


  
I know.


  
It's just not normal,
this behavior.


  
Quite frankly, it's scaring
the hell outta me,


  
...and you Mother.


  
Baby, I... I don't want you to leave.


  
I don't.


  
But... just go...


  
Go to Jacksonville,
make some new friends...


  
I like my old friends.
- Well, you never see them anymore.


  
I do, yeah.


  
I'm...


  
...gonna go shopping tomorrow,
with Jessica.


  
You hate shopping.


  
I...


  
I need a girl's night out.


  
alright.
Girl's night.


  
Shopping.


  
I like it, go.


  
Buy some good stuff.


  
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.


  
Oh, yeah, Bella Swan.


  
I don't know, why you wanna sit through
all those zombies eating people,


  
...and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.


  
Like why there are
so many zombie movies anyway?


  
Is it supposed to like
draw a parallel with leprosy?


  
My cousin had leprosy,
it's not funny, you know?


  
And like is it supposed to be
a metaphor for consumerism?


  
Because don't be so pleased with
your own like...


  
...self-reverential cleverness, you know?


  
Like, some girls like to shop.


  
Not all girls, apparently.


  
I was surprised
you called at all, you know?


  
Like, your depression thing.
I'm totally... totally worried.


  
After a while, it's like,
she's still bumming?


  
And I'm going through
stuff too, you know?


  
Like Mike deciding
he wanted to "I just be friends? "


  
That's hard, you know?


  
What's up, guys?


  
Where you going?


  
Keep walking.


  
This is dangerous.


  
Dude, come on.


  
I think, I know those guys.


  
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?


  
I just need to see something.


  
Hey, girlie!


  
alright, alright!
We got a taker.


  
Turn around.


  
Sorry, I thought
you were somebody else.


  
That's cool! I'll be whomever
you want to be, honey.


  
So, what do you say?


  
You promised me nothing reckless.


  
You promised, it would as
you never existed.


  
You lied.
- Say some, babe?


  
You know what?
Never mind.


  
Stop!


  
Stop! Stop!
Stop!


  
Hey, um, what the hell is
wrong with you?


  
Just curious.


  
I thought that I saw something.


  
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.


  
That homeboy
could have been a psycho.


  
I was about to end up
in a FBI interview room,


  
...like some lame TV show.


  
Oh, that was such a rush.


  
Awesome!


  
So, you're an adrenaline junky now?


  
That's cool!
You can go bungee jumping.


  
You don't get on the back of some
random loser's motorcycle!


  
Crazy!


  
Alice, I saw him.


  
Maybe I'm crazy now,
but I guess that's okay.


  
If the rush of danger is
what it takes to see him...


  
...then that's what I'll find.


  
Bella!


  
Where the hell have you been, crazy?


  
I... brought you something.
- Okay.


  
It's a little crazy.


  
Wow, scrap metal!


  
You shouldn't have.
- I saved them from the junkyard.


  
I think, they'll probably cost
more to fix than they're worth.


  
...but then I thought that...


  
if I had a mechanic-type friend
to help me out,


  
Huh, me?


  
Being the mechanic-type friend?
- That's right.


  
Since when are you into motorcycles?
- Since now.


  
I get it if you think this is
really stupid and reckless.


  
Yeah, it's completely
stupid and reckless.


  
When do we start?


  
Now. Please.
- alright.


  
Oh, hey, be careful.
These things are actually really...


  
...heavy. So,


  
Jacob, you're like buff.


  
How that can happen?
You're like 16, I don't get it.


  
Age is just a number, baby.
What, you're like 40, now?


  
Feels like that sometimes.


  
That song was good.
You don't like it?


  
I don't really like...


  
...music anymore kind of...


  
Okay.
No more music.


  
I was thinking,
if we're gonna do this everyday,


  
...and hopefully we will...


  
We have to, like, fit some homework
in there somewhere.


  
I don't want Billy thinking that
I'm a bad influence on you.


  
You influence me?
Please.


  
Are you...?
I'm older than you.


  
So that makes me the influencer
and you the influence.


  
No, no, no.


  
My size and knowledge base actually
makes me older than you.


  
Because of your gentle paleness
and lack of know-how.


  
I convinced you to build
two-wheeled death machines with me.


  
Don't you think that makes
you funny, young and naive?


  
Okay.
So, where do we stand?


  
I'm thirty five...


  
...and you might be like 32.
- Come on.


  
Yo, Jake, you in there?
- No, it's okay.


  
It's... It's just my boys.


  
Hey, Jake.
- Hey. Guys, this is Bella.


  
Bella, that's Quil and Embry.


  
I'm Quil Ateara.


  
So the bike building story is true.


  
Oh, yeah, yeah!
I taught him everything he knows.


  
What about the part
where you're his girlfriend?


  
Uh, we're friends, you know?
- Hmm. Burn!


  
Actually, I remember, I said
she's a girl and a friend.


  
Embry, do you remember him
making that distinction?


  
Nope!


  
So you guys have girlfriends.
It's awesome.


  
Yeah, right.


  
Quil's actually taken his cousin to prom.


  
Yeah, that's still a riot.


  
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.


  
Jesus!


  
I got five bucks on Quil.
- You're on.


  
Dear Alice, I wish,
I had your real address.


  
I wish, I could tell you
about Jake.


  
He makes me feel better.


  
I mean,
he makes me feel alive.


  
The hole in my chest...


  
...while when I'm with Jake,


  
It's like, it almost healed.
For a while.


  
Quil keeps asking to come over.


  
I think he likes you
a little too much.


  
Oh, I'm really not into
the whole cougar thing, you know?


  
What's up with you and age?


  
I mean, how old was that
Cullen guy anyway?


  
But even Jake can't keep
the dreams away.


  
Hey, Bella!


  
You're alright. You're okay?
- No.


  
I thought this thing was
starting to work,


  
...but I guess not.


  
Can I ask you something?


  
Hanging out with Jacob...


  
...does seems to take your mind
off things for a bit, doesn't it?


  
You know, sometimes...


  
...you gotta learn to love
what's good for you.


  
You know, what I mean?


  
Of course, what do I know?


  
I'm just a terminal bachelor.


  
Famous ladies man.


  
Okay...


  
Go to bed.


  
I love you.


  
If I told you,


  
...I couldn't have fixed these bikes,
what would you say?


  
Are you doubting your mad skills?


  
No, definitely not.
I mean, they're all fine.


  
It's just...


  
May be if I was smarter
would have dragged out to rebuild them.


  
If you told me,
you couldn't fix these bikes.


  
I would say that that's...


  
...really too bad but...


  
...he's gonna find something else to do.


  
Is that Sam Uley?


  
Yeah, and his cult.


  
Oh, my God!


  
Did you see that?


  
They're not really fighting, Bella.


  
They're cliff diving.


  
Scary as hell,
but a total rush.


  
Rush?
- Most of us jump from lower down.


  
We'll leave the showing off
to Sam and his disciples.


  
Is some kind of beef
with them or something?


  
Oh, no.


  
They just think they run this place.


  
Embry used to call them hall
monitors on steroids.


  
Now, look at him.
- That's Embry?


  
Yeah.
- What happened to him?


  
He missed some school...


  
...and all of a sudden started following
Sam around like a little puppy.


  
Same thing with Paul and Jared.


  
Sam keeps giving me this look,


  
...like he's waiting for me
or something.


  
It's kinda starting to freak me out.


  
Well, you should just avoid him.


  
I'll try.


  
Okay.


  
You look scared.
- I'm not.


  
Alright! Brake.


  
Clutch. Good.


  
Gas.


  
Ready?


  
Now slowly... release the clutch.


  
Bella.


  
Stop.


  
You alright?


  
I'm gonna go again.


  
Hit the brake!


  
I wanna go again.
- Are you trying to get yourself killed?


  
I'll try again.
- No, forget it.


  
No more bikes.


  
Man, your head.


  
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.


  
You're apologizing for bleeding?


  
Yeah, I guess, I am.


  
It's just blood, Bella.
No big deal.


  
What are you staring at?


  
You're sort of beautiful.


  
How hard did you hit your head?


  
I don't know.


  
Let's go.


  
I did see something in the woods.
- Sure, baby, I believe you.


  
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.


  
It was jet black and huge.


  
On all fours, it was still taller
than a person.


  
A bear, may be?


  
Or an alien.
You're lucky that you didn't get probed.


  
Oh, yeah.


  
Well, I saw it.


  
You're not the only one.


  
My Dad's been getting reports
at the station.


  
Like five hikers been killed by some bear.


  
But they can't find the bear.


  
Last time you clowns
doubt my girlfriend.


  
So, I mean...


  
Bella is back.


  
Yeah, I guess so.
- Huh, that's... Welcome.


  
So listen, not now that...
You know, you're talking and...


  
...eating again, you know?


  
You gotta get that protein in there.


  
I was just wondering,
if you wanted to go see a movie with me.


  
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, I do.


  
Cool, um, let me see...


  
We could check out
"Love spelled backwards is love. "


  
Yeah, it's a dumb title,
but, um, it's a romantic comedy.


  
I mean, it's supposed to be.
- No. No romance.


  
How about "Face Punch"?
You heard of that?


  
Well, it's an action movie.
- Yeah, it's perfect.


  
With guns... adrenaline...


  
...it's my thing
- Okay.


  
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys wanna go see...


  
..."Face Punch"?
- "Face Punch"? Yeah!


  
Mike, hey, we were supposed
to watch that?


  
Remember the trailer's like...
- Yeah?


  
Punch his face in.
- I don't remember that.


  
Movie night with Bella!


  
So, "Face Punch", huh?
You like action movies?


  
Not really.


  
I heard it sucks. Bad.


  
Hey, are you even old enough
to see this movie?


  
I mean, you know, without adult supervision?
- Right, yeah.


  
Well, she's buying my ticket for me.
- She's buying it, okay.


  
Jessica bailed
and Angela's got the stomach flu


  
...so Eric's taking care of her.


  
So, it's just us three.
- Great.


  
Great.
- Yeah.


  
Put the gun down.


  
Put your gun down or I'm gonna
blow your freaking head off.


  
Both of you!


  
Put both of your guns down or I'm gonna
blow both of your freaking heads off.


  
Alright, let's do this!


  
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up!


  
Jesus!
- What a marshmallow!


  
You should hold out for someone
with a stronger stomach.


  
Someone who laughs at the gore
that makes weaker men vomit.


  
Yeah, I'll keep my eye open for that.


  
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's...


  
...going around.


  
What? I can't hold your hand?
- No, of course, you can.


  
I just think it means
something really different to you.


  
So...


  
Okay, tell me something.
You like me, right?


  
And you think, I'm sorta beautiful?


  
Jake, please...
don't do this.


  
Why?


  
Because you are about
to ruin everything.


  
And I need you.


  
Well, I've got loads of time.


  
I'm not gonna give up.


  
I don't want you to.


  
But...


  
It's just because I don't want you
to go anywhere.


  
It's... it's really selfish.


  
You know, I'm not like a car
that you can fix up.


  
I'm never gonna run right.


  
So I should be fair to you.


  
It's because of him, right?


  
Look, I know what he did to you.


  
But, Bella, I would never,
ever do that.


  
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.


  
I won't let you down.


  
You can count on me.


  
Well...


  
I need to go home.


  
I'm... I was feeling sick
before the movie, okay?


  
What is your problem?
- Right now?


  
You are my problem.


  
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.


  
Do you want me
to put you in the hospital?


  
Jake... Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?


  
Jake, you're really hot.


  
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?


  
I don't know what's happening.


  
I gotta go.


  
That dude is weird.


  
Jake.


  
Uh, your Dad says you have mono.


  
He won't let me visit but...
would you call me?


  
Hey, uh, it's me again.
I just...


  
I'm sorry about what I said
at the movie theatre.


  
I just wanted to hear your voice.
So, no pressure.


  
Jacob, please call me.


  
Okay, we should be
back around three.


  
Hey!


  
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
- Yes, you do.


  
Yeah, you do. Go.
What are you talking about?


  
Just be careful.
- I always am.


  
Those bears won't get
the drop on me, Bella.


  
My kung foo is strong.


  
Jake!


  
You cut your hair?


  
And got a tattoo?


  
Bella...


  
I thought you were too sick
to come outside.


  
Or pick up the phone
when I'd call.


  
Go away.
- What?


  
Go away.


  
What happened to you?
What's wrong?


  
Hey, what happened?


  
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?


  
Sam's trying to help me,
don't blame him.


  
But if you want somebody to blame,


  
How about those
filthy bloodsuckers, you love?


  
The Cullens.


  
I don't know
what are you talking abØut.


  
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.


  
You been lying to everyone.
Charlie...


  
But you can't lie to me.


  
Not anymore, Bella.
- Come on! Jacob!


  
Look, Bella...


  
We can't be friends anymore.


  
Jake, I know that
I have been...


  
...hurting you.


  
It's... it's killing me.
It kills me.


  
If you, may be,
give me like some time.


  
Don't!


  
It's not you.


  
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?


  
It's true!
It is me.


  
I'm not good.


  
I used to be... a great kid.


  
Not anymore.


  
It doesn't even matter, alright?
This is over.


  
You can't break up with me.


  
I mean...


  
I mean, you're my best friend.


  
You promised me.


  
I know.


  
I promised that
I won't hurt you, Bella.


  
And this is me keeping that promise.


  
Go home.


  
And don't come back.
Ør you're gonna get hurt.


  
Alice...


  
Things are...


  
Things are bad again.


  
Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.


  
I don't see Edward anymore.


  
Now it really feels like
he never existed.


  
I will find a place
where I can see him again.


  
Bella.
- Laurent!


  
I didn't expect to find you here.


  
I went to visit the Cullens, but...
the house is empty.


  
I'm surprised they left you behind.


  
Weren't you sort of a, um,


  
...a pet of theirs?


  
Yeah. You could say that.


  
Do they Cullens visit often?


  
Lie.


  
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
- Lie better.


  
I'll tell them that you stopped by.


  
I probably shouldn't tell...


  
...to Edward.


  
Because he's pretty protective.
- But he's far away, isn't he?


  
Why are you here?


  
I came as a favor to Victoria.


  
Victoria?


  
She asked me to see
if you were still...


  
...under the protection
of the Cullens.


  
Victoria feels it's only fair
to kill Edwards mate...


  
...given he killed hers.


  
An eye for an eye.


  
Threaten him.
- Edward would know who did it!


  
And he'd come after you.


  
I don't think he will.


  
After all, how much could
you mean to him...


  
...if he left you here unprØtected?


  
Victoria won't be happy
about me killing you.


  
But I can't help myself.


  
You're so mouthwatering.
- Please, don't!


  
I mean, you'd helped us.
- Shhhh!


  
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.


  
Victoria plans on killing you
slowly, painfully,


  
...where as I'll make it quick.
I promise.


  
You will feel nothing.


  
Edward, I love you.


  
I don't believe it.


  
Dad, I saw them!


  
What's the matter?
- In the woods. They are not bears!


  
What you mean in the woods?


  
Bella, what the hell were you doing
out in the woods?


  
They are wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves!


  
Are you sure about that, Bella?
- Yeah, I just saw them.


  
They were after... something.


  
Wolves? You saw?


  
Alright.
Well, Harry,


  
...feel like going hunting?


  
Can you get some of
your guys together?


  
Sure, yeah. I'll...
I'll just...


  
I know that those wolves
will be dead.


  
And Laurent would have told her
I'm unprotected.


  
Victoria.


  
I should go to the station.


  
Dad, you should...
You should go.


  
You can just stay in the house?


  
Bella!


  
Oh, you scared me.


  
What the hell are you doing?
- Back up. I'm coming up.


  
Look, look, I'm sorry.


  
For what?
- I wish I could explain,


  
...but I literally... can't!


  
Have you ever had a secret
you couldn't tell anyone?


  
One that wasn't yours to share.


  
Well, that's what
it's like for me.


  
Or worse.


  
You have no idea,
how tight I'm bounded.


  
I hate this.


  
I hate what they have
done to you.


  
I mean, the killer part is
you already know!


  
Bella, do you remember,
when walked on the beach in La Push?


  
The sto...


  
The story...
The story about the cold ones.


  
I guees, I understand why that's
the only part you remember.


  
There must gotta be something
You can do...


  
No.
I'm in it for life.


  
May be we should just
get out of here for a while.


  
We'll just leave.
Just you and me.


  
You can do that?


  
I'll do it for you.


  
It's not something
I can just run away from, Bella.


  
But I would run away with you.


  
If I could.


  
I gotta go.
They'll certainly wonder where I am.


  
Come here.


  
Please...
Try to remember.


  
It would be so much easier
if you knew...


  
I tried, but...
Jake.


  
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.


  
Jake!


  
Edward, I'm scared.


  
You should be.


  
Really it's just like an old story...


  
That we're not supposed to
say anything about...


  
Did you know, the Quileute are
supposed to be descendants from wØlves?


  
Bella.


  
I need to see him.


  
He's not in.


  
I'm sorry, really need to see him.
- Bella?


  
What did you do?


  
Okay, what did you do?
- Hey!


  
What did you do to him?
- Easy!


  
He didn't want this!
- But we do.


  
What did he do? What did he tell you?
- Both of you calm...


  
Nothing! He told me nothing,
because he's scared of you!


  
Too late, now.
- Bella, get back.


  
Paul, calm down now.


  
Bella!


  
Run!


  
Jake, run!


  
Take Bella back to Emily's place.


  
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.


  
Alice...


  
Is it possible that everything is true?


  
The fairy tales and
horror stories?


  
Is it possible that there isn't anything
sane and normal at all?


  
Hey, I think, we should go back
and see if Jacob's okay.


  
I hope Paul gets some teeth in him.
Serve him right.


  
No way. Jake's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?


  
I gotta fiver says,
Paul doesn't touch him.


  
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.


  
Speak for yourself.


  
Oh, hey, about Emily...
Sam's fiance,


  
...don't stare.
It bugs him.


  
Why would I stare?


  
You guys hungry?
Like I have to ask...


  
Who's this?


  
Bella Swan.
Who else?


  
So, you’re the vampire girl.


  
So, you're the wolf girl.


  
Guess so.


  
Well, I'm engaged to one.


  
Save some for your brothers.


  
And the ladies first.


  
Muffin?
- Sure. Thanks.


  
Leave it to Jake upto find
a way around Sam's gag order.


  
He didn't say anything to me.
- That's a wolf thing.


  
Alpha's orders get obeyed
whether we want to or not.


  
Alright, check it out!
We can hear each other's thoughts.


  
Will you just shut up?
These are trade secrets.


  
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.


  
I can't really run with vampires.


  
Because they are fast.


  
Yeah? Oh, we are faster.


  
Freaked out yet?


  
You're not the first monsters, I met.


  
Jake's right.
You are good with the weird.


  
Sorry.


  
So you're a werewolf?


  
Yeah, last time I checked.


  
A few lucky members of the tribe
that have the gene.


  
If a bloodsucker moves into town,
and the fever sets in.


  
Mono?


  
Yeah, I wish.


  
You can't find a way to stop?


  
I mean it's wrong.


  
It's not a life-style choice, Bella.


  
I was born this way,
I can't help it.


  
You are such a hypocrite.


  
What, I'm not the
right kind of monster for you?


  
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.


  
They never hurt anybody.


  
You killed people, Jake.


  
Bella, we're not killing anyone.


  
Then, who is?


  
We're trying to protect
you people from them.


  
The only thing we do kill.


  
Vampires.


  
Jake, you can't...


  
Don't worry, we can't touch your
little precious Cullens.


  
Unless they violate the Treaty.


  
It's not what I'm saying.


  
You can't kill vampires, though.


  
They will kill you.
- Really?


  
We took out that leech with
the dreads easy enough.


  
Laurent?


  
And his redhead girlfriend is next.


  
Vic... Victoria is here?
- Was.


  
We chased her all the way to the
Canadian border the other night.


  
But she keeps coming back.


  
We don't know what she's after.
- I do.


  
Me.


  
Don't worry,
we've got this place covered.


  
She won’t get near you or Charlie.


  
But you gotta be careful.


  
She's fast, you don't know,
how fast she is.


  
You know, your lack of confidence
in us is a little insulting.


  
Alright, I better go.


  
And you gotta go.
- Yeah.


  
I got a vampire to kill.


  
Alice, I'm alright.


  
Until I'm alone.


  
And lately,
that's all the time.


  
Jacob's gone,
he's hunting for Victoria.


  
And Charlie is hunting Jacob.


  
And you're gone.


  
And so is Edward.


  
And I just have nothing now.


  
You got something, Harry?


  
Nope, nothing.


  
But I realize where I have to go,


  
What I have to do
to see him again.


  
Don't do this.


  
You wanted me to be human.


  
Watch me.


  
Please? For me?


  
You won't stay with me
any other way.


  
Bella. Please.


  
Breathe!


  
Breathe!


  
Come on, Bella.
Breathe.


  
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?


  
Jake.


  
What the hell were you thinking, huh?


  
I just needed to see something.


  
Take her home.


  
I'm gonna go help over at Harry's place.


  
What happened at Harry's?


  
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.


  
Charlie and my Dad are at Harry's place
with his family.


  
Is he okay?
- He's gone.


  
Come on, I'll give you sØmething to dry
and drive you home.


  
Hundred and eight degrees over here.


  
God!


  
My hands are freezing.


  
It must be nice, never getting cold.


  
It’s a wolf thing.
- It's not.


  
It’s a Jacob thing.
You’re just warm.


  
You're like, your own sun.


  
This is better.
Now that you know about me.


  
But...?


  
You saw what happened to Emily.


  
Sam got angry,


  
...lost it for a split second...


  
...Em was standing too close.


  
He will never be able
to take that back.


  
What if I get mad at you?


  
Sometimes...


  
I feel like, I'm gonna disappear.


  
You need not hear it from me.


  
But I always will.
You're not gonna loose yourself.


  
I won't let that happen.


  
How?


  
I'll tell you all the time.


  
How special you are.


  
Thank you...


  
...for everything.


  
Wait!


  
There's a vampire.
- How do you know?


  
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out.


  
That's Carlisle's car!


  
They’re here.


  
Bella, it's a trick. Stop!


  
You gotta come with me.


  
They won't hurt me.


  
If a Cullen is back here,
this is their territory.


  
The treaty says we can only
defend our own lands.


  
I can't protect you here.
- Okay, it's okay. You don't have to.


  
You’re about to cross a line.
- Then don't draw one.


  
Please.


  
Alice!
- You're dead!


  
Bella?
- What are you...?


  
I'm sorry, I just...
I can't believe you're here.


  
Is... Is...?


  
Would you like to explain to me
how you're alive?


  
What?
- I saw a vision of you.


  
You jumped off a cliff.


  
Why in the hell would you try
and kill yourself?


  
I mean, what about Charlie? What about...?
- I didn't try to kill myself.


  
I was cliff jumping.


  
Recreationally!


  
It was fun.


  
I have never met anyone more prone
to life-threatening idiocy.


  
Did you... did you tell him?
- No.


  
He only calls once in a few months.


  
He said he wants to be alone.


  
Aw, what is that
God awful wet dog smell?


  
That's probably me.


  
Or... it's Jacob.


  
Jacob who?


  
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.


  
Ugh! Bella! Werewolf's are not
good company to keep!


  
Speak for yourself.


  
I had to see if you were safe.


  
I thought you couldn't protect me here.


  
Guess, I don't care.


  
Well, I'm not gonna hurt her.


  
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.


  
We're talking about
the other bloodsucker...


  
...who tried to kill Bella
because of you.


  
Victoria?
- Yeah, Victoria has been around.


  
I didn't see her.


  
I didn't see you getting pulled out
of the water either.


  
I can't see past you
and your pack of mutts!


  
Don't get me upset.
- Hey, stop!


  
Things are gonna get very ugly!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!


  
I will give you a minute.


  
You're going anywhere,
you're gonna come back, right?


  
As soon as you put the dog out.


  
Is he...?


  
Are there others?


  
How many Cullens are here
and how long are they staying?


  
No.


  
It's just Alice.


  
And she can stay
as long as she like.


  
Are the rest coming back?


  
No.


  
Not that I know of.


  
Anything else?


  
That's it.


  
Well, if that's all, then you better go
run back to Sam.


  
I have done it again.


  
I keep breaking my promise.


  
We don't have to do this to each other.


  
Yes, we do.


  
Bella...


  
Stay with me forever.


  
Swan Residence.


  
He's not here right now.


  
He's arranging a funeral.


  
Who is that?


  
What?
- Always in the way.


  
Who was that?
- Bella, step back.


  
Jacob, who was that?
- Stop.


  
Bella, it's Edward.


  
He thinks you are dead.


  
Rosalie told him,
why I came here.


  
Why would you...?


  
Why didn't you let me speak to him?


  
He didn't ask for you.
- I don't care!


  
Bella, he's going to the Volturi.


  
He wants to die too.


  
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore, remember?


  
But I'm not gonna let him
kill himself out of guilt.


  
What about your Dad?


  
I'm eighteen,


  
I'm legally free to go.
And I left a note.


  
Please, Bella.


  
Just... stay here.


  
Not for Charlie.


  
For me...


  
I gotta go.


  
I'm begging you.


  
Please.


  
Bye, Jacob.


  
Okay.


  
So you made up your mind?


  
I'm afraid your particular gifts...


  
...are too valuable
to destroy.


  
But if you're unhappy
with your lot,


  
...join us.


  
We would be delighted
to utilize your skills.


  
Won't you consider
staying with us?


  
You know what will happen anyway.


  
Not without cause.


  
Such a waste.


  
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?


  
I figured, you wouldn't be
opposed to grand theft auto.


  
Not today.


  
What? What are you seeing?
- They refused him.


  
So...?
- He's gonna make a scene.


  
Show himself to the humans.
- No! When?


  
He's gonna wait until noon,
when the sun's at it's highest.


  
Alice, you gotta hurry up.
- There's Volterra.


  
Why are they all in red?
- San Marcos Day festival.


  
They're commemorating the expulsion
of the vampires from the city.


  
It's the perfect setting.


  
The Volturi will never let him
get far enough to reveal himself.


  
We have 5 minutes.
- You know, Bella? Breathe.


  
Alice?!


  
Bella, you're the only one
he can't see coming.


  
If I go, he will read my thoughts...


  
...he'll think I'm lying
and rush into it.


  
Where do I go?
- He'll be under the clock tower.


  
Go!


  
No!


  
Heaven.


  
You have to move!


  
Open your eyes, look at me.
I'm alive.


  
You have to move!


  
Bella?


  
You're here.
- Yeah.


  
You're alive!


  
Yes.


  
I needed you to see me once.


  
You had to know that I was alive.
You didn't have to feel guilty or anything.


  
I can let you go now.


  
You never had to let it go.


  
I just couldn't live in a world
where you don't exist.


  
But you said...
- I lied.


  
I had to lie
and you believe me so easily.


  
Because it doesn't make sense
for you to love me.


  
I'm nothing... human.
Nothing.


  
Bella, you're everything to me.


  
Everything.


  
I won't be needing your services
after all, gentlemen.


  
Aro wants to speak with you again.


  
No rules were broken.


  
Nevertheless, we should take this
conversation...


  
...to a more appropriate venue.


  
Fine.


  
Bella, why don't you go enjoy
the rest of the festival?


  
The girl comes with us.
- No. You can go to hell.


  
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.


  
We wouldn't want to make a scene.


  
We wouldn’t.


  
Enough!


  
Jane.


  
Aro send me to see
what's taking so long.


  
Just do as she says.


  
Go ahead.


  
Are you scared?


  
Are you?


  
No.


  
Good afternoon.


  
Is she human?
- Yes.


  
Does she know?
- Yes.


  
Then why would...


  
She wants to be...


  
And so she will be.
- Or dessert!


  
Sister, sent you out to get one
and you bring back two.


  
And a half.


  
Such a clever girl.


  
What a happy surprise!


  
Bella is alive after all.


  
Isn't that wonderful?


  
I love a happy ending.


  
They are so rare.


  
"La Tua Cantante. "
'Your Singer'


  
Your blood appeals to you
so much...


  
...it makes me thirsty.


  
How can you stand
to be so close to her?


  
It's not without difficulty.
- Yes, I can see that.


  
Aro can read every thought
I ever had.


  
With one touch.


  
And now you know everything.


  
So, get on with it.


  
You're quite soul reader yourself, Edward.


  
Though...


  
...you can't read Bella's thoughts.


  
Fascinating!


  
I would love to see if...


  
...you are an exception
to my gifts, as well.


  
Would you do me the honor?


  
Interesting.


  
I see nothing.


  
I wonder if...


  
Let's see if she is immune
to all our powers.


  
Shall we, Jane?


  
No!
- Pain.


  
Stop!


  
Stop, please!
Stop!


  
Stop!


  
Just stop hurting him, please!
Please!


  
Jane?


  
Master?


  
Go ahead, my dear.


  
This may hurt just a little.


  
Remarkable!


  
She confounds us all.


  
So, what we do with you now?


  
You already know
what you're going to do, Aro.


  
She knows too much,
she's a liability.


  
That's true.


  
Felix?


  
Please! No, no!
Please!


  
Kill me... kill me.


  
Not him.


  
How extraordinary.


  
You would give up your life...


  
...for someone like us.


  
A vampire.


  
A soulless monster.


  
Just get away from him!


  
You don't know a thing...


  
...about his soul.


  
Maybe it's one or the other.


  
This is a sadness.


  
If only it be your intention
to give her immortality.


  
Wait!


  
Bella will be one of us.


  
I've seen it.


  
I'll change her myself.


  
Mesmerizing!


  
To see, what you have seen.


  
Before it is happened.


  
Your gifts...


  
...will make for an intriguing...


  
...immortal.


  
Isabella.


  
Go now.


  
Make your preparations.


  
Let's be done with this.


  
Heidi will arrive, any moment.


  
Thank you...


  
...for the visit.
- We'll return the favØr.


  
I would advise...


  
...that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.


  
Goodbye...


  
...my young friends.


  
Nice fishing, Heidi.


  
Yes, they do look rather juicy.


  
Save some for me.


  
This way, please.
Stay together.


  
You're here.


  
You can sleep.


  
I'll still be here
when you wake up.


  
Bella, the only reason
that I left...


  
...was because I thought
I was protecting you.


  
I needed you to have a chance...


  
...at a normal, happy life.


  
It was so easy for you to leave.


  
Leaving you was the hardest thing
I've done in a 100 years.


  
I swear...


  
I will never fail you again.


  
I'm so sorry.


  
Charlie's coming.
- Hey!


  
You okay?


  
Fine.


  
Dad, you don't have to worry.


  
Yeah, last time you said that
you took off.


  
I didn't see you for three days.


  
I'm really sorry, Dad.


  
Bella, do not ever do that
to me again.


  
Ever.


  
And you're grounded...


  
...for the rest of your life.


  
Okay.


  
I'm not technically breaking
any of his rules.


  
He did say, I couldn't take a step
inside through the door.


  
I came in through the window.


  
He's not going to forgive me easily.


  
I know.


  
Can you?


  
I hope you can because...


  
I honestly don't know
how to live without you.


  
Come here.


  
Once Alice changes me,


  
...you can't get rid of me.


  
She won't need to change you.


  
There are always ways to keep
the Volturi in the dark.


  
No.


  
No!


  
You all know what I want.


  
And I know,
how much I'm asking for.


  
The only thing I can think of...
for...


  
...it to be fair is to just vote.


  
You don't know what you just...
- Just... shut up!


  
Alice?


  
I already consider you my sister.


  
Yes!
- Thank you.


  
I vote, yes.


  
It would be nice to not wanna
kill you all the time.


  
I'm sorry.


  
I'm really sorry, both of you,
for the way I've acted.


  
And I'm really grateful...


  
...that you were brave enough
to go and save my brother.


  
But this isn't a life
I would have chosen for myself.


  
And I wish that there had been
someone to vote no for me.


  
So... no.


  
I vote hell yeah!


  
We can pick a fight with
these Volturi's some other way.


  
I already consider you,
a part of the family.


  
Yes!


  
Why are you doing this to me?


  
You know what this means.
- You've chosen not to live without her,


  
...which leaves me no choice.


  
I won't lose my son.


  
I'll wait until after graduation...


  
...to make it easier on Charlie.


  
I want you to be the one
to do it.


  
He wants to talk to me.


  
See, you're still alive for now.


  
He thinks, it's me keeping you away.


  
You stay the hell out of my head.


  
Jacob...


  
...I know you have
something to say to me.


  
But I wanna say something to you first.
If that's alright?


  
Thank you.


  
Thank you for keeping
Bella alive when...


  
...I didn’t.


  
No, you didn't.


  
And it wasn't for your benefit,
trust me.


  
I'm still grateful.


  
But I'm here now.


  
And I'm not gonna leave her side
till she orders me away.


  
We'll see.


  
Hey, my turn to talk.


  
I'm here to remind you about
a key point in the Treaty.


  
I haven't forgotten.


  
What key point?


  
If any of them bites a human,
the truce is over.


  
But if I choose it,
it has nothing to do with you.


  
No... No, I won't let you.


  
You're not gonna be
one of them, Bella.


  
It's not up to you.


  
You know what we'll do to you.


  
I won't have choice.
- Bella, please come.


  
Wait.


  
Is he gonna hurt me?
Read his mind.


  
Jake...


  
I love you.


  
So, please...


  
DØn't make me choose.


  
Because it'll be him.


  
It's always been him.


  
Bella...


  
Goodbye, Jacob.
- No, you don't speak for her!


  
Bella, get out of here.


  
Stop!


  
Stop!


  
You can't hurt each other
without hurting me.


  
Jake?


  
He's right.


  
You shouldn't become one of us.


  
I can't do this alone.


  
Then please just wait.


  
Just give me... five years.


  
It's too long.


  
Then, three?


  
You're so stubborn.


  
What are you waiting for?


  
I have one condition...


  
...if you want me
to do it myself.


  
What's the condition?


  
And then, forever.


  
That's what I'm asking.


  
Marry me, Bella.


A 1930's NEWSREEL. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) "Movietown News" presents... Spotlight on Adventure! The mysterious SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLE. A massive waterfall cascades down a gigantic, flat-topped mountain. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) What you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity: a lost world in South America! Lurking in the shadow of majestic Paradise Falls, it sports plants and animals undiscovered by science. Who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit? A painted portrait of a dashing young adventurer. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Why, our subject today: Charles Muntz! A massive DIRIGIBLE descends on an airfield. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The beloved explorer lands his dirigible, the "Spirit of Adventure," in New Hampshire this week, completing a year long expedition to the lost world! INT. MOVIE THEATRE - CONTINUOUS Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (O.S.) This lighter-than-air craft was designed by Muntz himself, and is longer than 22 Prohibition paddy- wagons placed end to end. Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And here comes the adventurer now! 2. NEWSREEL FOOTAGE: the dashing Muntz descends down the gangplank to the delight of the crowd. His dogs trail him. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Never apart from his faithful dogs, Muntz conceived the craft for canine comfort! It's a veritable floating palace in the sky... An opulent dining room. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...complete with doggie bath and mechanical canine walker. One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals consider Muntz the bee's knees! And how! Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature "thumbs up" stance. MUNTZ "Adventure is out there!" In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) But what has Muntz brought back this time? Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a curtained object. MUNTZ Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster of Paradise Falls! He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON. CROWD Ooh! Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And golly, what a swell monster this is. But what's this? Skeptical scientists analyze the bones. 3. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Scientists cry foul! The National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton! YOUNG CARL No! Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other famous explorers. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The organization strips Muntz of his membership. Muntz's "Explorer's Society" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED from his jacket. Carl GASPS. Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield. He grimly addresses the crowd. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast... alive! MUNTZ I promise to capture the beast... alive! In the theater, young Carl smiles. MUNTZ And I will not come back until I do! The crowd CHEERS. Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible lifts off. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And so the explorer is off to clear his name. Bon voyage Charles Muntz, and good luck capturing the Monster of Paradise Falls! Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle. DISSOLVE TO: 4. EXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD, 1930'S - DAY - CONTINUOUS Young Carl "flies" his blue balloon ("The Spirit of Adventure" hand-written on it) as he runs along the sidewalk. He still wears helmet and goggles. TITLE CARD: WALT DISNEY PICTURES PRESENTS NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Here's Charles Muntz piloting his famous dirigible!! TITLE CARD: A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) He hurdles Pike's Peak! Carl jumps over a small rock. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) He hurdles the Grand Canyon! Carl jumps over a crack in the sidewalk. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) He hurdles Mount Everest! Carl jumps over a tree stump... and smacks into it instead. NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) He... goes around Mount Everest! Is there nothing he cannot do? TITLE CARD: UP NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Yes, as Muntz himself says: "Adventure is--" GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) "Adventure is out there!" Carl stops. Who said that? The voice comes from a dilapidated HOUSE, windows boarded up and lawn overgrown with weeds. The weather vane atop the house turns, pulled by ropes. GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) Look out! Mount Rushmore! Hard to starboard. Must get the Spirit of Adventure over Mount Rushmore... 5. Carl walks toward the voice. GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) Hold together old girl. How're my dogs doing? Ruff ruff! INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Carl squeezes through the broken door into the foyer. He follows the voice toward the living room. GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) All engines ahead full! Let's take her up to 26,000 feet! Rudders eighteen degrees towards the south. INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Carl rounds the corner to see... ELLIE, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles. Bare footed, her overalls are patched and dirty. The old house has been transformed into a make-believe dirigible cockpit. Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty old bicycle. YOUNG ELLIE It's a beautiful day, winds out of the east at ten knots. Visibility... unlimited. (yells a command) Enter the weather in the logbook! The navigator (her hamster) skitters in its cage. Ellie uses two tied-together Coke bottles as binoculars. YOUNG ELLIE Oh! There's something down there! I will bring it back for science. Awwww, it's a puppy! Carl is distracted by the Muntz newspaper clippings taped to the wall. YOUNG ELLIE (O.S.) No time! A storm! Lightning! Hail! Ellie pops up in front of Carl. 6. YOUNG ELLIE What are you doing!?! Carl screams. He lets go of his balloon. It floats through a broken part of the ceiling and disappears. Ellie circles Carl accusingly. YOUNG ELLIE Don't you know this is an exclusive club? Only explorers get in here. Not just any kid off the street with a helmet and a pair of goggles. Do you think you got what it takes? Well, do you?!? Carl FUMPHERS. YOUNG ELLIE Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard. She offers her hand. Carl looks down, embarrassed. YOUNG ELLIE What's wrong? Can't you talk? Carl is frozen. Ellie softens. YOUNG ELLIE Hey, I don't bite. She takes off her helmet. Her hair frizzes out in all directions. She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and pins it on Carl. YOUNG ELLIE You and me, we're in a club now. Carl smiles. YOUNG ELLIE I saw where your balloon went. Come on, let's go get it! Carl watches her stride out of the room. She pops back in. YOUNG ELLIE My name's Ellie. She grabs his hand. Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room. 7. INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, UPSTAIRS YOUNG ELLIE There it is. Carl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon. Between them the floor has collapsed, save one rickety beam. Carl GULPS. YOUNG ELLIE Well, go ahead. She pushes him out onto the beam. YOUNG ELLIE Go on. Carl steels his courage. He puts on his goggles, starts forward... and FALLS through the floor. CUT TO: EXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY Ambulance. SIREN blaring. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT One lone light on upstairs. INT. CARL'S ROOM Carl in bed, reading a book by flashlight, his arm in a CAST. Into the room floats Carl's lost BLUE BALLOON. Carl jumps and CALLS OUT in fright. YOUNG CARL (re: arm) Ow! A head pops up from outside the open window. YOUNG ELLIE Hey kid!! Carl SCREAMS, hitting himself in the face with the cast. YOUNG CARL Ow!! 8. Ellie climbs in the window. YOUNG ELLIE Thought you might need a little cheerin' up. I got somethin' to show ya! INT. CARL'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight. Ellie whispers, as if to protect a National Secret. YOUNG ELLIE I am about to let you see something I have never shown to another human being. Ever. In my life. Carl's eyes widen in alarm. YOUNG ELLIE You'll have to swear you will not tell anyone. Carl nods. YOUNG ELLIE Cross your heart. Do it! Carl crosses. Ellie unveils... YOUNG ELLIE My Adventure Book! It's a reused photo album with the words "My Adventure Book" written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz. YOUNG ELLIE You know him. Carl smiles excitedly. YOUNG ELLIE Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get big, I'm going where he's going: South America. She turns the page to a map. YOUNG ELLIE It's like America... but south. Wanna know where I'm gonna live? 9. She turns to an engraving of a large waterfall. A small hand- drawn picture of Ellie's clubhouse is glued to the top. YOUNG ELLIE (reading caption) "Paradise Falls, a land lost in time." I ripped this right out of a library book. Carl GASPS in horror. YOUNG ELLIE I'm gonna move my clubhouse there, and park it right next to the falls. Who knows what lives up there? And once I get there... She flips through her book, revealing a page marked, "STUFF I'M GOING TO DO." Past that, the pages are blank. YOUNG ELLIE Well, I'm saving these pages for all the adventures I'm gonna have. Only... I just don't know how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls. Ellie closes the book, disappointed. Carl has a thought. He looks at his toy dirigible. YOUNG ELLIE That's it! You can take us there in a blimp! Swear you'll take us. Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross your heart. Carl does. YOUNG ELLIE Good. You promised. No backing out. Carl shakes his head "no." YOUNG ELLIE Well, see you tomorrow kid! Bye. Ellie hops up and jumps out the window. YOUNG ELLIE "Adventure is out there!!" She pops back in. 10. YOUNG ELLIE You know, you don't talk very much. I like you. Carl looks out the window after her in amazement. He rests his head on his balloon. YOUNG CARL Wow. The balloon pops. CUT TO: INT. CHURCH - DAY FLASH! A photo is taken of the wedding couple: Carl and Ellie, now 19. She jumps at him and gives him a big kiss. Ellie's side of the church erupts like wild frontiersmen. A gun shot is fired in the air. Carl's side, rigid puritans in black, clap politely. EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY Carl carries her past a "SOLD" sign. It's the same house where they met as kids. EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY Still in their wedding clothes: She saws as he hammers. INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY They push two chairs into place side by side in the living room. EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY Ellie finishes painting "Carl & Ellie" on their MAILBOX. Carl leans in to admire her work but leaves a messy paint handprint on the mailbox! Oh well; Ellie adds her handprint as well. They smile. EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY Their house now matches Ellie's colorful CLUB HOUSE DRAWING from her childhood Adventure Book. 11. EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - DAY They run up a hillside together. They lie side by side on a picnic blanket. She describes the clouds. He watches as a cloud transforms into a turtle. Carl closes his eyes and smiles. He's lucky to be with her. EXT. ZOO - DAY Ellie emerges from the South America House, dressed in her Zookeeper's uniform.

CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON Carl sets A JAR on a table, "PARADISE FALLS" written on it. Ellie drops in a few coins. She looks at Carl and crosses her heart. Carl crosses his. A SERIES OF SHOTS The jar slowly fills as Carl and Ellie toss in spare change. Their car blows a tire. The two stand by the jar, reluctant. Carl BREAKS the jar. New tire. Carl in the hospital with a broken leg. Breaking jar. A storm rages. A tree falls, crushing the roof. Breaking jar. INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - MORNING Carl struggles to tie his tie. Ellie helps. They walk out the front door arm in arm. INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 3 YEARS LATER Ellie struggles to tie Carl's tie as they rush out the door. A SERIES OF SHOTS as Ellie straightens Carl's ties. Stylish 1950's ties. Wide 60's ties. Paisley 70's ties. 13. INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 30 YEARS LATER Older Carl and Ellie smile at themselves in the hall mirror. EXT. ZOO - DAY Carl in his 60's. They still work happily side by side at the zoo.

TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY Carl buys two tickets to South America. EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON Carl hurries excitedly up picnic hill. He hides the airline tickets in his basket. Behind him, Ellie falters and falls. She tries to get up but falls again. Something is wrong. He runs to her. 14. INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY Ellie lies in a hospital bed. She looks through her ADVENTURE BOOK. A BLUE BALLOON floats in to the room. Carl stands at the door. He smiles and walks to her bedside. Ellie pushes her Adventure Book toward him.

CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK Carl walks into the house, holding a single blue balloon. FADE TO BLACK. INT. CARL'S BEDROOM - MORNING - SEVERAL YEARS LATER An ALARM CLOCK BUZZES. An aged hand shuts it off and picks up the nearby glasses. CARL sits alone in his double bed. He rubs his face. GRUNTS. He gets out of bed, STRETCHING, GRUNTING and CRACKING BONES. He grabs his cane, with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom spokes. INT. CARL'S STAIRCASE - LATER Now dressed, Carl rides his ELDERLY ASSISTANCE CHAIR down the staircase.

CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS Many LOCKS are heard unlocking from inside. The door opens, but bangs against the safety chain. Carl GRUMBLES in frustration. Carl opens the door, walks out onto his porch, pulls the door shut, and looks as if he's about to go somewhere. He sits in his porch chair. EXT. CARL'S NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS Carl's house is the lone surviving square on the block not under construction. Machinery and workers circle busily. High rise buildings are being erected all around. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - MORNING Carl looks at the activity around him. CARL Quite a sight, huh Ellie? (noticing mailbox) Uhp, mail's here. Carl walks to the mailbox. He touches Ellie's faded HANDPRINT and smiles. He looks through the mail. He sees a SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE pamphlet full of images of happy old people. Carl scoffs. 16. CARL Shady Oaks Retirement. Oh brother. Carl notices DUST on his mailbox. CARL Hm. He pulls up a LEAF BLOWER. He revs it and blasts off the dust. TOM, the CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, notices. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM Hey! `Morning, Mr. Fredricksen! Need any help there? CARL No. Yes. Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house. He points across the lot to a business man in a suit talking on a cell phone - the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM Well just to let you know, my boss would be happy to take this old place off your hands, and for double his last offer. Whaddya say to that? The leaf blower blasts off his hat. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM Uh, I take that as a no, then. CARL I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM You poured prune juice in his gas tank. CARL Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let me talk to him. Tom hands Carl his MEGAPHONE. CARL (in megaphone) You in the suit. Yes, you. Take a bath, hippy! Tom grabs the megaphone. 17. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM (to Boss, re Carl) I am not with him! (to Carl) This is serious. He's out to get your house! Carl walks to his front door. CARL Tell your boss he can have our house. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM Really? CARL When I'm dead! Carl SLAMS the door. CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM I'll take that as a maybe! INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER Carl sits in his chair watching TV. A KNOCK at the door. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY The door opens. A Wilderness Explorer stands, reading from a Wilderness Explorer Manual. He is in uniform, complete with sash, neckerchief, hat, and an enormous backpack stuffed with every piece of equipment there is. This is RUSSELL, age 8. Russell, nose buried in his MANUAL, reads to Carl. RUSSELL "Good afternoon. My name is Russell. And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12. Are you in need of any assistance today, sir?" As he finishes the script, Russell smiles up at Carl. CARL No. 18. RUSSELL I could help you cross the street. CARL No. RUSSELL I could help you cross your yard. CARL No. RUSSELL I could help you cross your... porch? CARL No. RUSSELL Well, I gotta help you cross something. CARL Uh, no. I'm doing fine. Carl closes the door in Russell's face. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS Carl listens through the door. Is the kid gone? He opens it. RUSSELL "Good afternoon. My name is Russell." CARL Uh... kid... RUSSELL "And I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12." CARL Kid. KID!! Russell stops... but goes back to reading. RUSSELL "Are you in need of any assistance today Sir?" CARL Thank you, but I don't need any help! 19. Carl swings the door shut, but a small camping boot stops it. RUSSELL Ow. Carl opens the door. Russell stands at attention. CARL (RESIGNED) Proceed. RUSSELL "Good afternoon. My-" CARL But skip to the end! Russell points to his SASH. It is covered with badges except for one glaringly empty space. RUSSELL See these? These are my Wilderness Explorer badges. You may notice one is missing. It's my Assisting the Elderly badge. If I get it I will become a Senior Wilderness Explorer! Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a "W", his fingers the "wings" of a bird, then the "claws" of a bear. RUSSELL "The wilderness must be explored! CAW-CAW! RAAAR!" This sets Carl's hearing aid off. Carl GRUMBLES in pain. RUSSELL It's gonna be great! There's a big ceremony, and all the dads come, and they pin on our badges... CARL So you want to assist an old person? RUSSELL Yep! Then I will be a Senior Wilderness Explorer! Carl leans in close to Russell. 20. CARL (CONSPIRATORIALLY) You ever heard of a snipe? RUSSELL Snipe? CARL Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it sneaks in my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. I'm elderly and infirm. I can't catch it. If only someone could help me... RUSSELL Me! Me! I'll do it! CARL Oh, I don't know, it's awfully crafty. You'd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in. RUSSELL I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen! CARL I think its burrow is two blocks down. If you go past -- RUSSELL Two blocks down! Got it! Russell runs down the block clapping and calling. RUSSELL Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey... CARL (calls after Russell) Bring it back here when you find it! Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door. He stops short. A large truck is backing up, getting dangerously close to ELLIE'S MAILBOX. CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE Okay, keep her coming... And... stop. Stop! STOP!! The truck hits Ellie's mailbox, crushing the front. 21. Carl is shocked. He runs to the box. CARL What? Hey! Hey you! What do you think you're doing? CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE I am so sorry, sir... The worker bangs on the mailbox, trying to fix it. CARL Don't touch that! CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE No no, let me take care of that for you. Carl grabs the mailbox, trying to wrestle it from the worker. CARL (STRUGGLING) Get away from our mailbox! CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE Hey sir, I... CARL I don't want you to touch it! Carl HITS the worker with his cane. He falls to the sidewalk. The worker rubs his head. Blood. Carl backs up toward his door, cradling his mailbox. What has he done? Passerbys stare. Workers gather, as does the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER. Carl backs into his house. INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM Carl shuts his door. He closes the curtains. He peeks out the window. The injured worker is helped to his feet. A police car pulls up. The Real Estate Developer looks toward Carl's house. His hand rests on Carl's fence. 22. INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY Carl sits alone on a bench holding a Court Summons. INT. COURTROOM - DAY A GUARD opens the door. Carl enters. The REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER watches him enter. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - LATE EVENING A Police Officer drops Carl at his front gate. OFFICER EDITH Sorry Mr. Fredricksen. You don't seem like a public menace to me. Take this. She hands him a pamphlet for SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE. OFFICER EDITH The guys from Shady Oaks will be by to pick you up in the morning, okay? The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone. Carl faces the house. He touches Ellie's dented mailbox. CARL What do I do now, Ellie? INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT All is quiet but the slow ticking of the clock. The empty hall. The front hall mirror. The kitchen. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, CLOSET Carl pulls out a suitcase. A book tips over. Ellie's Adventure Book. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl sits in his chair slowly paging through the book. 23. He turns to the page marked "STUFF I'M GOING TO DO." He closes the book and sighs. Carl looks at the Adventure Shrine, and the PAINTING of their house by Paradise Falls. He holds the Shady Oaks pamphlet. Carl's brows furrow. He looks up at the shrine, and crosses his heart. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT Lights are on inside the house. MATCH DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MORNING A SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE van pulls up. Nurses GEORGE and A.J. walk to Carl's door and KNOCK. Carl answers, holding a suitcase. CARL Morning gentlemen. NURSE GEORGE Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen. You ready to go? CARL Ready as I'll ever be. Would you do me a favor and take this? Carl hands over his suitcase. CARL I'll meet you at the van in just a minute. I... want to say one last goodbye to the old place. NURSE GEORGE Sure. Take all the time you need, sir. Carl closes the door. Rather sharply. The nurses head back to the van. 24. NURSE A.J. Typical. He's probably going to the bathroom for the eightieth time. Empty helium tanks are strewn on the front lawn. NURSE GEORGE You'd think he'd take better care of his house. A SHADOW falls over the nurses. They turn to look. A giant tarp rises behind Carl's house. It unfolds to reveal THOUSANDS OF BALLOONS. The balloons rise up like some massive multi-colored cumulus cloud forming a thunderhead above the house. Strings tug at the chimney. The house strains. Pipes bend, then break. Electrical wires spark and snap. The house rips away from its foundation. The nurses duck and YELL as the house soars over them. Carl looks out the window and LAUGHS. CARL So long boys! I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls! INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Balloons spill colored light into a little girl's room as the house floats past. EXT. TOWN The shadow of the house drifts through an intersection. EXT. SHOP WINDOW A family watches the house float down the street. EXT. ABOVE THE TOWN Carl waves at a high-rise window washer, who tentatively waves back. The house crests the top of a building, drifting over and away from the city. Carl looks out his window. Good riddance. 25. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl sets a compass next to the map of South America. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM WINDOW Sails made from stitched-together curtains emerge from the windows and billow in the wind. Carl steers using ropes attached to the weather vane. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM The compass needle rotates to point SOUTH. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE The house turns. Carl looks out the window, satisfied. He checks the balloons. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl kisses a photo of Ellie. CARL We're on our way, Ellie. Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings tied to the grate. He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair. He closes his eyes and smiles. SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING The house drifts through the clouds. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl relaxes in his chair. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. CARL Huh? 26. He stares at the front door. Nothing. CARL Hm. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. He bolts up and approaches the door. He looks out the peep hole. Nothing but the porch and clouds. He throws it open. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS Nothing. He looks left. Nothing. He looks right. Russell. He looks... Russell?!! RUSSELL Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. It's me, Russell. CARL What are you doing out here, kid? Russell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and holding on for dear life. RUSSELL I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse. The flag on Russell's backpack blows off and falls through the clouds. RUSSELL Please let me in? CARL No. Carl slams the door, leaving Russell alone. Beat. The door opens again. CARL Oh, alright, you can come... Russell runs into the house past Carl. CARL ...in. 27. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Russell PANTS, panicked. He looks into living room. RUSSELL Huh. I've never been in a floating house before. Carl follows Russell into the living room. Russell chuckles and points at the photo of young Ellie. RUSSELL Goggles. Look at this stuff! Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of the open atlas. RUSSELL Wow, you going on a trip? (reads from the engraving) "Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in Time." You going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen? Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket. CARL Don't touch that. You'll soil it. RUSSELL You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff. Russell runs over to the steering rig. RUSSELL Whoah. Is this how you steer your house? Does it really work? CARL Kid, would you stop with the -- Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and forth. RUSSELL Oh, this makes it go right, and that way's left. CARL Let go of the -- knock it off! Russell looks out the window in front of him. 28. RUSSELL Hey look, buildings! EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW - CONTINUOUS Russell and Carl arrive at the window. RUSSELL That building's so close I could almost touch it. That gives Carl an idea. CUT TO: Carl lowers Russell on a rope below the floating house. RUSSELL Wow! This is great! You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away! (looking up) Hey, I can see your house from here! CARL (struggling to hold on) Don't jerk around so much, kid! The rope slips through Carl's hands. Russell FALLS. CUT TO: Carl stands beside Russell at the window. Russell's fall had been a daydream. CARL Well, that's not gonna work. Carl leaves Russell at the window. RUSSELL I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo Nimbus. Did you know that the Cumulo Nimbus... INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS GRUMBLING, Carl kneels at the fireplace to cut a few balloon strings with his housekeys. 29. CARL Stayed up all night blowing up balloons, for what? RUSSELL ...warm air goes by cool air, and the airs go by each other and that's how we get lightning. CARL That's nice, kid. Carl turns off his hearing aid. Silence. He smiles. Russell tries to get Carl's attention. A storm is brewing in the distance. RUSSELL (nearly silent) Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big storm coming. It's starting to get scary. We're gonna get blown to bits! We're in big trouble, Mr. Fredricksen! A huge lightning bolt flash lights up the room. Carl turns on his hearing aid. CARL What are you doing over there? RUSSELL Look! EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW - CONTINUOUS Carl joins Russell at the window. RUSSELL See? Cumulo Nimbus. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS The tiny house is heading for a MASSIVE STORM. Carl STRUGGLES to steer the house away but is blown into the storm. The steering mechanism recoils and sends Carl flying. Plates fall from the walls and furniture slides as the house is rocked in the storm. Russell's backpack slides toward the front door. 30. RUSSELL My pack! Russell HOPS on top of the backpack. RUSSELL Got ya! The pack slides toward the OPEN FRONT DOOR. Russell screams. He's about to slide out when the house tilts and the door swings shut. The Paradise Falls jar rolls past Carl. He chases after it. Ellie's chair slides across the room. Carl gasps and runs to protect it. The photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall. Carl lunges to catch it. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING The storm rages. The house is tossed into the storm clouds. All goes black. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MORNING Carl is asleep. A finger pokes Carl's face. Nothing. The finger pokes Carl's face again. Carl WAKES UP. RUSSELL Whew! I thought you were dead. CARL Wha... what happened? Carl STRUGGLES to rise from the pile of Ellie's things he'd been protecting. RUSSELL I steered us. I did! I steered the house! CARL Steered us? 31. RUSSELL After you tied your stuff down you took a nap, so I went ahead and steered us down here. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW Carl opens the window and looks out. CARL Huh? EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING The house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW CARL Can't tell where we are. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM RUSSELL Oh we're in South America all right. It was a cinch, with my Wilderness Explorer GPS. Russell holds up his WILDERNESS EXPLORER GPS UNIT. CARL GP-what? RUSSELL My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby, we'll never be lost! Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING Carl and Russell watch the tiny GPS unit descend into the clouds. RUSSELL Oops. 32. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl kneels by the fireplace and cuts at the balloon strings. CARL We'll get you down, find a bus stop. You just tell the man you want to go back to your mother. RUSSELL Sure, but I don't think they have busses in Paradise Falls. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING A small cluster of balloons fly up and away from the house. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM CARL There. That ought to do it. Here, I'll give you some change for bus fare. Russell follows Carl toward the front door. RUSSELL Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING The house lowers into the fog. RUSSELL (O.S.) Whoah, that's gonna be like a billion transfers to get back to my house. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH Carl and Russell stand on the porch as the house moves down into and through the thick, dark clouds. RUSSELL Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer? CARL Well, we're up pretty high. Could take hours to get down. Something flashes by them in the fog. Carl leans forward. 33. CARL (MUMBLING) ...that thing was...building or something. Another dark object whooshes past them. Carl ducks. RUSSELL What was that, Mr. Fredricksen? CARL We can't be close to the ground yet. A brief view of rocks directly below them. Carl GASPS. EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE BAM!!! The house CRASHES into the ground. Russell and Carl fly off the porch and onto the ground. They land hard. Carl's house is floating away! Carl runs after the GARDEN HOSE dragging across the ground. CARL Wait, wait! No don't, don't, don't! Carl grabs the hose and is PULLED UP in the air. CARL Whoah! Hey, hey! Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them to the ground. CARL Russell, hang on! Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE. RUSSELL Whoah! They slide toward the edge... and stop. The drop is thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED. CARL Walk back! Walk back! 34. RUSSELL Okay! Russell PULLS Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge. Carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around. Fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only scattered rocks. CARL (out of breath) Where... where are we? RUSSELL This doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen. The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it. CARL (to house) Don't worry, Ellie. I got it. The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped, flat-topped mountain on which they stand. Across it, some ten miles away, is PARADISE FALLS. Carl stares. He can't believe it. CARL There it is. Ellie, it's so beautiful. The landscape is stunning. Carl shows Russell the engraving with the Ellie drawing of the house atop the falls. CARL We made it. We made it! Russell, we could float right over there. Climb up. Climb up! RUSSELL You mean assist you? CARL Yeah, yeah. Whatever. RUSSELL Okay, I'll climb up! Russell CLIMBS Carl, stepping on his leg, arms, and face. 35. CARL Watch it. RUSSELL Sorry. The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame. CARL Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up! Got it?! Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen. CARL You on the porch yet?! Russell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb. He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted. CARL What? That's it?! I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? Aw, great! Carl paces. RUSSELL Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge? CARL What are you talking about? RUSSELL We could walk your house to the falls! CARL Walk it? RUSSELL Yeah, after all, we weigh it down. We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon. Carl considers this. 36. EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE, DAY - LATER The house floats against the sky. The hose descends from the house and "Y"s to tie to both Carl and Russell. They wear the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk. CARL Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing. Russell inspects his surroundings. RUSSELL (DISTRACTED) Uh-huh. CARL We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens... RUSSELL Sand! CARL ...we're not getting to the falls! RUSSELL I found sand! Carl ROLLS HIS EYES. He looks up at the house. CARL Don't you worry, Ellie. We'll get our house over there. Russell looks up at the house. Who's Carl talking to? RUSSELL Huh. (shrugs it off) This is fun already, isn't it? By the time we get there, you're gonna feel so assisted... Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!! The WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL sets off Carl's hearing aid. 37. RUSSELL Wait. Why are we going to Paradise Falls again? CARL Hey, let's play a game. It's called: "See who can be quiet the longest." RUSSELL Cool! My mom loves that game! They head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape. Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks. Two dark shapes are chasing the prey. Each has a light. Hunters. EXT. MOUNTAIN, GROVE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire. The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end. EXT. MOUNTAIN, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS. They surround the prey. Escape looks impossible. WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the three dogs and escaping in a flash. The dogs head off in pursuit. A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears wincing in pain. They whimper and run off. 38. EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - DAY - CONTINUOUS Carl steps out from behind a shrub. The SQUEALING is in fact his HEARING AID. CARL Darn thing. (calling back) C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up? Russell plods forward, dragging his feet. RUSSELL I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts. CARL Which knee? RUSSELL My elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom. CARL I asked you about that five minutes ago! RUSSELL Well, I didn't have to go then! Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt. RUSSELL I don't want to walk anymore. Can we stop? CARL Russell! If you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you. RUSSELL There's no tigers in South America. Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge. RUSSELL Zoology. CARL Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into the bushes and do your business. RUSSELL Okay! Here, hold my stuff. 39. Somehow energized, Russell jams his pack into Carl's hands, secures his rope to a tree and tromps off into the shrubs. He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand and a pile of leaves in another. RUSSELL I've always wanted to try this! Carl waits, standing by the tree his house is tied to. RUSSELL (O.S.) Mr. Fredricksen? Am I supposed to dig the hole before or after? CARL Eugh! None of my concern! Beat. RUSSELL (O.S.) Oh. It's before! Carl covers his ears. EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS Russell pats down a mound and SIGHS in satisfaction. He is about to return to Carl when he spots some TRACKS. RUSSELL Huh? Tracks?! (REALIZING) Snipe! Russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle, clapping. RUSSELL Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe. Snipe! The footprints continue for a time, then stop. RUSSELL Huh. Russell munches on a chocolate bar. Something RUSTLES in the bushes behind him. He turns to look. Behind him, A BEAK takes a nibble of the chocolate and zips out. 40. Russell turns. Nothing there. Another nibble! Zip! RUSSELL Ha! Gotcha! Russell peers into the shrub. RUSSELL Don't be afraid, little snipe. I am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a friend to all of nature. Want some more? Russell holds out the chocolate. The beak pokes out and nibbles. RUSSELL Hi boy. Don't eat it all. Come on out. The beak zips back into the bushes. RUSSELL Come on. Don't be afraid little snipe. Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice... A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell. RUSSELL ...giant snipe! EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING Carl checks the knot on his hose harness. Russell and the massive creature step up behind him. RUSSELL I found the snipe! CARL (humoring him) Oh, did you? RUSSELL Are they tall? CARL Oh yes, they're very tall. 41. RUSSELL Do they have a lot of colors? CARL They do indeed. RUSSELL Do they like chocolate? CARL Oh ye- Chocolate? Carl turns to look. Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall, multicolored BIRD. Carl SCREAMS. CARL What is that thing?! RUSSELL It's a snipe! CARL There's no such thing as a snipe! RUSSELL But you said snipes eat-- Carl grabs Russell, pulling him away from the bird. The bird HISSES at Carl and grabs Russell back. It cradles Russell like a baby. RUSSELL Whoah! Russell GIGGLES. Carl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off. CARL Go on, get out of here. Go on! Shoo! The bird HISSES. It takes Russell up into a tree, swinging him around playfully. It looks scary and fun. RUSSELL (LAUGHING) Whoah! Whoah! 42. CARL Careful, Russell! RUSSELL (LAUGHING) Hey, look Mr. Fredricksen, it likes me! CARL Russell! The bird grooms Russell. RUSSELL (LAUGHING) No stop, that tickles! Carl pokes the bird with his cane. CARL Get out of here. Go on, git! The bird sets Russell down. It stalks Carl, HISSING and ruffling its feathers. CARL Aaaah! RUSSELL Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice! Russell pats Carl on the head. CARL "Kevin"? RUSSELL Yeah, that's his name I just gave him. The bird pats Carl on the head with its beak. CARL Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram! Carl waves his cane. The bird eats it. CARL Hey! That's mine! The bird chokes and the cane comes back up. 43. CARL Aaah! Shoo, shoo! Get out of here. Carl shoos the bird away. The bird mimics him. CARL Go on, beat it. GRUMBLING, Carl gives up and throws his hands in the air. The bird mimics this as well. RUSSELL Can we keep him? Please?? I'll get the food for him, I'll walk him, I'll change his newspapers... CARL No. RUSSELL (RECITING) "An Explorer is a friend to all, be it plants or fish or tiny mole." CARL That doesn't even rhyme. RUSSELL Yeah it does. Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house. RUSSELL Hey, look! Kevin! CARL What? Get down! You're not allowed up there! The bird is on Carl's roof. It swallows a balloon. It POPS. The bird coughs up the deflated balloon. Russell GIGGLES. CARL You come down here right now! The bird jumps down and hides behind Russell. CARL Sheesh! Can you believe this, Ellie? RUSSELL Ellie? (gets idea) (MORE) 44. RUSSELL (cont'd) Uh, hey Ellie, could I keep the bird? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (to Carl) She said for you to let me. CARL (to Ellie) But I told him no -- (catches himself) I told you no! N-O. The bird HISSES at Carl. EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE - DAY Carl and Russell pull the house through the mist. Russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail. The bird follows, eating. CARL I see you back there! It "hides" behind a rock, still totally visible. CARL Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while. VOICE (O.S.) Hey, are you okay over there? The bird dashes away. CARL Uh, hello? Carl and Russell look around. In the midst, some 100 feet away, they see the FIGURE OF A MAN. CARL Oh! Hello sir! Thank goodness. Carl walks toward the man. CARL It's nice to know someone else is up here! VOICE I can smell you. 45. Carl stops. CARL What? You can smell us? VOICE I can smell you. As they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a ROCK. CARL Hey. Russell GIGGLES. RUSSELL You were talking to a rock. Russell points to another rock shape. RUSSELL Hey, that one looks like a turtle! Sure enough. RUSSELL Look at that one! That one looks like a dog! The "rock" walks forward. RUSSELL It is a dog! CARL What? RUSSELL Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment. The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it. RUSSELL Hey, I like dogs! CARL (calls out) We have your dog! (to self) Wonder who he belongs to? RUSSELL Sit boy. 46. The dog sits. RUSSELL Hey look, he's trained! Shake! The dog raises his paw and Russell shakes it. RUSSELL Uh-huh. Speak. DUG Hi there. Carl and Russell freeze. CARL Did that dog just say "Hi there?" DUG Oh yes. Carl JUMPS back. DUG My name is Dug. I have just met you and I love you. Dug jumps up on to Carl. CARL Uh..wha? Dug wears a high-tech collar. The dog's thoughts come out of it as words through a speaker. It can talk. Unfortunately, it talks non-stop. DUG My master made me this collar. He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk -- SQUIRREL!! Dug stares transfixed at a tree. False alarm. DUG My master is good and smart. CARL It's not possible. DUG Oh it is, because my master is smart. 47. RUSSELL Cool! What do these do, boy? He inspects the collar and twists a dial. DUG Hey would you- (CLICK) -cuerdo con tigo- (CLICK) I use that collar- (CLICK) -watashi wa hanashi ma- (CLICK) -to talk with, I would be happy if you stopped. CARL Russell, don't touch that. It could be radioactive or something. Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell. DUG I am a great tracker. My pack sent me on a special mission all by myself. Have you seen a bird? I want to find one and I have been on the scent. I am a great tracker, did I mention that? BAM! The bird tackles Dug and HISSES. DUG Hey, that is the bird! I have never seen one up close but this is the bird. (to Carl) May I take your bird back to camp as my prisoner? CARL Yes! Take it! And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog! DUG Oh I can bark! Dug BARKS. DUG And here's howling! Dug HOWLS. The bird HISSES at Dug. 48. RUSSELL Can we keep him? Please please please? CARL No. Russell falls to his knees, pleading. RUSSELL But it's a talking dog! CARL It's just a weird trick or something. Let's get to the falls. Carl grabs Russell. The bird follows, as does Dug. DUG Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh please be my prisoner. EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY Footprints. A dog's nose follows the tracks. This is GAMMA, a bulldog. GAMMA Oh, here it is. I picked up the bird's scent! A second dog: BETA, a Rottweiler. BETA Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is this? Chocolate. I smell chocolate. GAMMA I'm getting prunes and denture cream! Who are they? BETA Ah man, Master will not be pleased. We'd better tell him someone took the bird, right Alpha? ALPHA, a Doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them. ALPHA (high-pitched voice) No. Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again. 49. Alpha's voice is high and squeaky, as if he's breathed in helium. ALPHA (CONT'D) Find the scent, my compadres and you two shall have much rewardings from Master for the toil factor you wage. Beta and Gamma look at each other. BETA Hey Alpha, I think there's something wrong with your collar. You must have bumped it. GAMMA Yeah, your voice sounds funny! Beta and Gamma LAUGH. Alpha turns. They stop laughing. ALPHA Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire to -- SQUIRREL! All three dogs look for the squirrel. False alarm. ALPHA (CONT'D) Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning? BETA No no. But maybe Dug would. You might want to ask him. Beta and Gamma SNICKER derisively. GAMMA Yeah, I wonder if he's found the bird on his very special mission. ALPHA Do not mention Dug to me at this time. His fool's errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied indeed. Ha ha ha. Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now? BETA Sure, but the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat. 50. ALPHA You are wise, my trusted Lieutenant. Alpha powers up a video screen on Beta's collar. ALPHA (CONT'D) This is Alpha calling Dug. Come in, Dug. The screen shows ground moving past: the view from Dug's collar. DUG Hi Alpha. Hey, your voice sounds funny. ALPHA I know, I know! Have you seen the bird? DUG Why yes, the bird is my prisoner now. GAMMA Yeah, right. The screen view adjusts to see the bird. It hisses. ALPHA Impossible! Where are you?! DUG I am here with the bird and I will bring it back and then you will like me. Oh, gotta go. On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a boy's face. It's Russell. RUSSELL (on video screen) Hey Dug! Who you talking to? The video screen goes blank. The dogs BARK excitedly. BETA What's Dug doing? GAMMA Why's he with that small mailman? 51. BETA Where are they? Alpha pushes a button on Beta's collar. A TRACKING DEVICE locates Dug. ALPHA There he is. Come on! The dogs sprint off into the jungle. EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE - DAY The bird drags Dug, still clamped onto it's leg. DUG Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my prisoner! RUSSELL Dug, stop bothering Kevin! DUG That man there says I can take the bird and I love that man there like he is my master. The bird HISSES. CARL I am not your master! The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg. Dug jumps up on it. DUG I am warning you, once again, bird! RUSSELL Hey! Quit it! DUG I am jumping on you now, bird. Russell tries to separate them, which pulls on Carl's tether. CARL Russell! At this rate we'll never get to the falls! Carl pulls on the tether, knocking Russell over. Carl falls, pulling the house into a tall rock. SMASH! Carl GASPS. He turns his anger to the group. 52. CARL I am nobody's master, got it? (points to bird) I don't want you here, (points to Dug) ...and I don't want you here. (points to Russell) I'm stuck with you. And if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three- Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane. DUG A ball! Oh boy oh boy! A ball! CARL Ball? Carl pops off one of the tennis balls. CARL You want it boy? Huh? Huh? Yeah? DUG Oh oh oh! Yes, I do. I do ever so want the ball! CARL Go get it!! Carl throws the ball far away. Dug chases after it. DUG Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and then bring it back! CARL (WHISPERS) Quick Russell, give me some chocolate. RUSSELL Why? CARL Just give it to me! Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird. CARL Bird. Bird! Carl THROWS the chocolate. The bird runs after it. 53. Carl grabs Russell and runs. CARL C'mon Russell! RUSSELL Wait. Wait, Mr. Fredricksen. EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE Carl pulls them down a slope. He slips. EXT. MOUNTAIN TREETOPS Above the tree line, the house SMASHES into a tree. CARL Daah! EXT. MOUNTAIN STREAM Carl and Russell crossing the river balance on rocks. Carl slips and his foot goes into the water. CARL Aaahh... EXT. MOUNTAIN JUNGLE RUSSELL What are we doing? Carl pushes through thick jungle leaves. BUGS buzz around him. EXT. MOUNTAIN STEEP HILLSIDE Carl climbs up the hill. He FALLS over a dead branch. RUSSELL Hey, uh, we're pretty far now. Kevin's gonna miss me. EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS They climb over a ridge. Dug and the bird are nowhere in sight. Carl sits down on a rock, BREATHING HARD. 54. CARL I think that did the trick. He turns. Dug. With the ball in his mouth. DUG Hi, Master. CARL Afternoon. Carl turns the other way. The bird. It HONKS at him. Dug drops the slobbery ball on Carl's lap. EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - NIGHT A clap of thunder. Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring down on the house. Beneath it, Carl and Russell are kept dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire. Carl looks at Dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird's leg. He rolls his eyes and looks up at the house. CARL Well, thanks for keeping us dry anyway, Ellie. RUSSELL (O.S.) Which one's the front? Russell struggles to set up the tent. He reads his manual. RUSSELL Is this step three, or step five? Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness. RUSSELL There! Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into place. Carl can't watch. An off screen SMACK! Russell walks to Carl. Miraculously, he looks unscathed. RUSSELL All done. Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face. 55. RUSSELL (pointing to tent) That's for you! The tent pole springs loose, catapulting the tent over the cliff. RUSSELL Awh. Tents are hard. CARL Wait, aren't you "Super Wilderness Guy?" With the GPM's and the badges? RUSSELL Yeah, but... can I tell you a secret? CARL No. RUSSELL Alright, here goes. I never actually built a tent before. There. I said it. CARL You've been camping before, haven't you? RUSSELL Well, never outside. CARL Well, why didn't you ask your Dad how to build a tent? RUSSELL I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff. CARL Why don't you try him sometime? Maybe he'll surprise you. RUSSELL Well, he's away a lot. I don't see him much. CARL He's got to be home sometime. 56. RUSSELL Well, I called, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much. CARL Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name? RUSSELL Phyllis isn't my mom. Carl realizes he put his foot in it. CARL Oh. The two sit silently together, watching the fire. RUSSELL But he promised he'd come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge, so he can show me about tents then, right? Carl studies Russell's sad optimism. He looks at the missing badge on Russell's sash. CARL Hey, uh, why don't you get some sleep. Don't want to wake up the traveling flea circus. Dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird's leg. RUSSELL Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him! Russell YAWNS and lies down on the rock next to Carl. RUSSELL Can Kevin go with us? CARL Alright. He can come. RUSSELL Promise you won't leave him? CARL Yeah. 57. RUSSELL Cross your heart? Carl looks down at Russell. CARL Cross my heart. Carl sits at the campfire, the others asleep. He shakes his head and looks up at the house. CARL What have I got myself into, Ellie? DISSOLVE TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - MORNING A frog sits next to Carl's glasses. It CROAKS. Carl's hand smacks it like an alarm clock. The frog hops away. Carl rises, looking up at the house. CARL Morning Sweetheart. The balloons on the house are wilting. CARL We better get moving. He scans the camp. The bird is gone. CARL Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell won't notice. (calls out) Alright, everybody up! Russell sits up with a SNORT. RUSSELL Where's Kevin? He's wandered off! Kevin! Dug, find Kevin! Dug crazily searches and sniffs, looking for the bird. DUG Find the bird. Find the bird... POINT! Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left. 58. RUSSELL Oh, look! There he is. Russell points to the right. The bird is on top of Carl's house. Dug turns around. DUG POINT! The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof. CARL Hey, that's my food! Get off my roof! DUG Yeah, get off of his <>! In the distance, BABY BIRDS call out. The bird CALLS back. CARL What is it doing? DUG The bird is calling to her babies. RUSSELL Her babies! Kevin's a girl? The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof. DUG Her house is over there in those twisty rocks. Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the LABYRINTH. The baby birds call from somewhere inside. DUG She has been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them. The bird "hugs" Russell goodbye and pats Carl on the head with her beak. She HISSES at Dug. RUSSELL Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But you promised to protect her! RUSSELL Her babies need her, we gotta make sure they're together. 59. The bird hurries off toward the labyrinth. Carl gathers up the hose tether. CARL Sorry Russell. We've lost enough time already. RUSSELL Yeah... EXT. MOUNTAIN, EDGE OF JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER The bird rounds a corner and hears rustling in the bushes ahead. She scampers back toward the house. EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA Russell chews on some chocolate. RUSSELL This was her favorite chocolate. Because you sent her away, there's more for you. Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS. They hear rustling from the bushes behind them. CARL Huh? RUSSELL Kevin? Beta and Gamma, run toward Carl and Russell, viciously barking and growling. Carl protects Russell with his cane. Dug is conflicted. Alpha walks forward and stares menacingly at Carl. He turns toward Dug. ALPHA (high-pitched voice) Where's the bird? You said you had the bird. DUG Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have said that, I can see how you would think that. 60. ALPHA Where is it? DUG Uh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow and then I will again have the bird. Yes. Alpha BARKS angrily. ALPHA You lost it. Why do I not have a surprised feeling? Well, at least you now have lead us to the small mailman and The One Who Smells of Prunes. Carl and Russell look at Dug. He turned on them! Dug shamefully lowers his head. ALPHA Master will be most pleased we have found them, and will ask of them many questions. (commanding, to Carl) Come! CARL Wait, we're not going with you. We're going to the falls! Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl. CARL Get away from me! Get down! The dogs lead Carl and Russell like prisoners. Dug follows. The house is pulled after them, and on the roof: THE BIRD. EXT. MOUNTAIN, DESOLATE ROCKY AREA - DAY Alpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon. Dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls. Four more large dogs join the group. Carl and Russell watch warily and continue their march. They round a bend. Before them is a MASSIVE CAVE OPENING. 61. EXT. MOUNTAIN, CAVE ENTRANCE The house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group approaches the huge cave opening. DOZENS OF DOGS step out of the cave. Carl and Russell stop. More dogs approach from the side. Every way Carl turns there are more dogs! Growling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell. Closer... closer... From the darkness a voice: VOICE (O.S.) Stay! The dogs stop. A figure peers out from the darkness. It examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house. VOICE You came here in that? CARL Uh... yeah. VOICE In a house? A floating house? The man laughs. Carl and Russell laugh along nervously. VOICE That is the darndest thing I've ever seen! You're not after my bird, are you? But if you need to borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige! The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man's joke. VOICE Well, this is all a misunderstanding. My dogs made a mistake. The figure walks out toward Carl into the light. Carl recognizes him! CARL Wait, are you Charles Muntz?! MUNTZ Well... Yes. 62. CARL The Charles Muntz? Muntz gives him the "thumbs up." MUNTZ "Adventure is out there!" Carl GIGGLES with glee. CARL It's really him! (to Russell) That's Charles Muntz! RUSSELL (EXCITED) It is?!? (CONSIDERS) Who's Charles Muntz? CARL Him! DOG WALLA Yes! It is him! He is! CARL I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans! Carl rushes to shake Muntz's hand. Muntz is charmed. MUNTZ Well, you're a man of good taste! Muntz LAUGHS at his joke. Carl joins in. MUNTZ You must be tired. Hungry? RUSSELL Uh-huh. MUNTZ (to dogs) Attention everyone! These people are no longer intruders. They are our guests. The dogs CHEER. 63. DOG WALLA Follow me! I like you temporarily. You do smell like prunes. I will not bite you. Muntz walks into the cave. Carl and Russell excitedly follow. INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS CARL Wow. Carl's eyes adjust to the dark. Muntz's dirigible the "Spirit of Adventure" is tethered in the cave. MUNTZ (O.S.) I'm sorry about the dogs -- hope they weren't too rough on you. GAMMA (O.S.) We weren't! MUNTZ Go ahead and moor your airship right next to mine. Muntz gestures to a pylon, where Carl ties off the house. Muntz and the dogs walk up the gangplank of the dirigible. CARL We're not actually going inside the "Spirit of Adventure" itself?! MUNTZ Oh. Would you like to? CARL Would I?!?! Carl GIGGLES like a little boy. CARL Wait up, Mr. Muntz! Carl and Russell follow up the ramp. CARL Jiminy Cricket. Dug follows, but is blocked by Alpha and Beta. BETA Not you. 64. GAMMA What do we do with Dug? ALPHA He has lost the bird. Put him in the Cone of Shame. Dug WHIMPERS. EXT. DIRIGIBLE GANGPLANK - MOMENTS LATER Alpha, Gamma and Beta walk into the dirigible. Dug sits forlornly with a PLASTIC CONE around his neck. DUG I do not like the Cone of Shame. INT. DIRIGIBLE - TROPHY ROOM Carl and Russell are speechless as they walk into the room. It's a treasure trove of giant skeletons, stuffed creatures, and rare cultural artifacts. Various servant dogs dust and polish as Muntz leads Carl and Russell through the room. MUNTZ Most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums: New York, Munich, London... `Course I kept the best for myself. CARL Did you ever! Will you look at that? MUNTZ Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast charged while I was brushing my teeth. Used my shaving kit to bring him down. A dog approaches carrying a menu. Muntz waves it off. MUNTZ Oh, surprise me. (to Carl) Only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared as "dental equipment!" Muntz LAUGHS. Behind him, a dog can't resist gnawing at one of the bones. 65. CARL Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian Leopard Tortoise! MUNTZ Oh, you recognize it? I'm impressed! That's an interesting story there... A dog approaches with a bottle of champagne in his mouth. Muntz glances at the bottle. MUNTZ Hm, excellent choice. (to Carl) I found it on safari with Roosevelt. Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle. POP! They sloppily pour two glasses. MUNTZ He and I fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings. And did he cheat? Oh, he was horrible! Muntz and Carl LAUGH. Alpha interrupts. ALPHA (high-pitched voice) Master, dinner is ready. MUNTZ Oh dear, broken translator. It's that loose wire again. (leans down, fixes it) There you go big fella. ALPHA (deep scary voice) Thank you Master. Russell reacts. RUSSELL I liked his other voice. Muntz LAUGHS. MUNTZ Well, dinner is served! Right this way. 66. INT. DIRIGIBLE, DINING ROOM Muntz leads Carl and Russell into the dining room and up to a large table. MUNTZ So how are things stateside? Almost tempted to go back a few times, but I have unfinished work here... Please. Dogs pull back chairs for them. They sit. Dog waiters place napkins on their laps. MUNTZ I hope you're hungry because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had. Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look delicious. MUNTZ Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again! RUSSELL Yes!! Russell is served a hot dog. His waiter can't resist and eats a bite. RUSSELL Hey! Another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his glass. RUSSELL Hey! Carl looks around, still enthralled. CARL Oh my Ellie would have loved all this. You know, it's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls. He gestures toward HIS HOUSE, tethered outside the porthole window. 67. MUNTZ I'm honored. And now you've made it! CARL You're sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose. MUNTZ No no! It's a pleasure to have guests -- a real treat. The dogs erupt into excited barking. DOG WALLA Treat?! Treat! I want a treat! MUNTZ No no, quiet! Calm down. Calm down... In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog. RUSSELL Hey! MUNTZ (CONT'D) Shouldn't've used that word... Having guests is a delight. More often I get thieves, come to steal what's rightfully mine. CARL No! Muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room. MUNTZ They called me a fraud, those... dah! But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared. The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples, feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin. This is Muntz's obsession. He looks over to a full size skeleton. MUNTZ Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a lifetime tracking it. Sometimes years go by between sightings... (MORE) 68. MUNTZ (cont'd) I've tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives... Can't go in after it. Once in, there's no way out. Lost so many dogs... Muntz is lost in reverie. MUNTZ And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take! But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place. Distracted Russell finally notices the skeleton. RUSSELL Hey, that looks like Kevin! MUNTZ "Kevin?" RUSSELL Yeah! That's my new giant bird pet. I trained it to follow us. Muntz and Alpha exchange glances. MUNTZ Follow you? Impossible. How? RUSSELL She likes chocolate. Russell holds up a chocolate bar to show Muntz. MUNTZ Chocolate? RUSSELL Yeah, I gave her some of my chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it. Carl swipes the chocolate from Russell and pockets it. CARL But it ran off! It's gone now. Muntz stares. He walks to a table full of flight helmets. 69. MUNTZ You know, Carl. These people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories. A "Surveyor" making a map. Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table. It rolls across the floor. MUNTZ A "Botanist" cataloguing plants. Muntz topples another helmet. He lifts a third to show Carl. MUNTZ An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls. He drops the helmet. It rolls to Carl's feet. MUNTZ That's the best one yet. I can't wait to hear how it ends. Carl glances around nervously. Out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits THE BIRD! CARL Well! It's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going. Carl gets up and pulls Russell from the table. MUNTZ Oh, you're not leaving? CARL We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. Come on Russell. Carl leads Russell toward the door. RUSSELL But we haven't even had dessert yet. Muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly. 70. MUNTZ No, the boy's right. You haven't had dessert. Epsilon here makes a delicious Cherries Jubilee. Carl pulls Russell along, Muntz following behind like something out of a bad dream. MUNTZ Oh, you really must stay. I insist! We have so much more to talk about! A distant HAUNTED WAIL. Everyone stops. RUSSELL Kevin? Muntz walks to the window and looks out. Atop the roof he sees THE BIRD. MUNTZ It's here. He turns back to Carl... but they're gone. MUNTZ (to dogs) Get them! INT. CAVE Carl and Russell untie Carl's house from the pylon. CARL Hurry! RUSSELL I am hurrying! Dogs descend down the ramp behind them. RUSSELL They're coming! Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening. Dogs block the cave opening. Carl stops short. DUG (O.S.) Master, over here! 71. Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave. Carl and Russell run toward him. The cave leads to a steep incline. The dogs are getting closer. There's no choice but to JUMP. The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell to leap down the incline, like astronauts. DUG Go toward the light, master! Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell. The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts Carl and Russell on her back. She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her. Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life. BANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the ceiling. The house lowers. Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto the ground. CARL Russell! Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly. EXT. MOUNTAIN, CANYON - CONTINUOUS The dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels. Carl fends off Alpha with his cane. CARL Get back!! Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down! The dogs stop short. Carl looks back as the bird keeps running. Dug is up on the canyon wall. He caused the avalanche! DUG Go on Master! I will stop the dogs! Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs. 72. DUG Stop you dogs!! The dogs run around Dug. Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path. The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind. She rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss. The bird jumps from rock spire to spire. Russell swings back and forth wildly in the air. RUSSELL Help! Help! Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL. CARL Gimme your hand! Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl PULLS him back onto the bird. Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE. A river winds 100 feet below. Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward. RUSSELL Hang on to Kevin! Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar. Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but is kicked loose and falls into the river below. Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm. The dogs are stuck on the other side. Carl painfully gets up. He looks up at his house. It's still intact. He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF. RUSSELL (O.S.) Kevin! The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back to the ground. Russell rushes to her side. 73. The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite. She can't stand. Russell applies a bandage. From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call. Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can't. Russell runs to her side. RUSSELL No no no! Kevin! Stay down. (to Carl) She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home? Carl looks at the bird's wounds. He looks to the rock maze, then to his house. He knows the right thing to do. And he hates himself for it. CARL Alright. But we've got to hurry. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT Dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing Muntz. MUNTZ You lost them? BETA Uh, it was Dug. GAMMA Yeah, he's with them. He helped them escape! Muntz snarls in anger. MUNTZ Wait. Wait a minute. Dug... He leans over a RADAR TRACKING DEVICE. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS DUG'S COLLAR SCREEN powers on, and a signal zeroes in on Dug's location. 74. Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing. Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree. CARL See anything? DUG No, my pack is not following us! Boy they are dumb. Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house from behind a tree canopy. CARL This is crazy. I finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us! What a joke. DUG Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel walks up to a tree and says I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny because the squirrel gets dead. They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees. CARL Careful Russell. The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the porch. RUSSELL You okay, Kevin? Kevin goes back to sleep. Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG. RUSSELL You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? The wilderness isn't quite what I expected. CARL Yeah? How so? RUSSELL It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book. CARL Hmm, get used to that, kid. 75. RUSSELL My dad made it sound so easy. He's really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff. He used to come to all my Sweatlodge meetings. Russell smiles at the thought. RUSSELL And afterwards we'd go get ice cream at Fentons. I always get chocolate and he gets butter- brickle. Then we'd sit on this one curb, right outside, and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins. I like that curb. He looks up at Carl. RUSSELL That might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most. They walk in silence. Carl understands. The bird babies CALL OUT in the distance. Kevin CALLS BACK. RUSSELL Look, there it is! Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by. He tries to run but is pulled back by his tether. LAUGHING, Carl unclips Russell's tether. CARL Hold on Russell, stand still! Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house. Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward the labyrinth entrance. Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies. She runs off ahead. Carl and Russell LAUGH. CARL Look at that bird go! CARL Wait up, you overgrown chicken! 76. RUSSELL That's it, go Kevin! Go find your babies! Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce spotlight hits them. MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE lowers overhead. RUSSELL Run Kevin! Run! A net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT. RUSSELL Oh no! The net catches on a rock. Carl and Russell run to her aid. CARL Russell, give me your knife! Carl saws frantically at the net. MUNTZ (O.S.) Get away from my bird! Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible. Beside them, a group of dogs drag forward CARL'S HOUSE. Muntz hurls a lit lantern. Flames burst up beneath the house. Heat waves ripple up. Balloons POP. Carl's house LOWERS into the fire. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Inside the living room, Ellie's photo crashes to the floor. EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - CONTINUOUS CARL No! Carl panics. He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife. Muntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking him down and grabbing the bird in the net. RUSSELL No! Carl pulls his house away from the flames. 77. The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the dirigible. Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible. MUNTZ Careful. We want her in good shape for my return. RUSSELL Let her go! Stop! Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes. The dirigible flies off. RUSSELL Kevin! Carl beats out the flames with his jacket. He extinguishes the flames. Carl collapses on the side of his house. RUSSELL You gave away Kevin. You just gave her away. CARL This is none of my concern. I didn't ask for any of this! DUG Master. It's alright. CARL I am not your master! And if you hadn't a shown up, none of this would have happened! Bad dog! Bad dog! Dug slinks off, tail between his legs. Carl angrily puts on the harness. CARL Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me. He walks off. Russell falls in behind. An angry dawn breaks. 78. EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky landscape. Russell's harness drags along side, empty. Russell walks behind. EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE - MORNING With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place. The house groans as it comes to rest. Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff. EXT. PARADISE FALLS - MORNING He looks over. He's finally made it: Paradise Falls. Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge. Carl takes out Ellie's childhood drawing. Next to him stands the real house, just like Ellie wanted. RUSSELL (O.S.) Here. Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground. RUSSELL I don't want this anymore. Russell walks away. He sits on a rock, alone. Carl picks up the sash. He walks up the steps of his house. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS The door opens. Carl steps in. He's back in his house for the first time in days. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Carl and Ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess from the rough journey. Carl rights Ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the table into position. He pushes their two chairs back into their place. 79. Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits. Quiet. Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside. Carl surveys the room. The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him. He opens it and puts Ellie's drawing back. He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie. He turns to the page marked: STUFF I'M GOING TO DO. Carl sighs. He managed to bring the house to the falls, but Ellie never made it. He closes the book. But as he does, Carl sees something he hadn't before. The blank pages at the end are no longer blank. A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them. On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another... photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs. Carl's face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw adventure in everyday life. A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in their chairs. Beneath it, Ellie has written: "THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE! LOVE, ELLIE." Carl smiles. He looks over to Ellie's empty chair. On the arm is Russell's sash. Carl picks it up. He looks to Ellie's chair. He crosses his heart. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Carl walks from the house and calls from the porch. CARL Russell? 80. But Russell is nowhere to be seen. A shadow crosses Carl. He looks up to see Russell floating off, hanging from a BUNCH OF BALLOONS. CARL Russell! RUSSELL I'm gonna help Kevin even if you won't! Russell fires up a LEAF BLOWER and steers himself off into the sky. CARL No, Russell! No! Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons have lost too much helium. Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch. It lands atop the mountain rocks with a thud. This gives him an idea. CUT TO: The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground. Chairs, dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house. Slowly, one corner of the house lifts. Then another. Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch. It teeters... and falls. The house lifts off! CARL Wahhoo! The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of things. Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side atop Paradise Falls. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING The house soars into the air, sails billowing. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Inside the house, Carl adjusts his steering, scans the skies. 81. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Carl's eyes go wide. CARL Russell? INT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS The door swings open. CARL Dug! DUG I was hiding under your porch because I love you. Can I stay? CARL Can you stay? Well, you're my dog aren't you? And I'm your master! DUG You are my master?! Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses. DUG Oh boy. Oh boy! EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING - CONTINUOUS The house flies off into the sky. CARL (O.S.) Good boy, Dug. You're a good boy! EXT. OPEN SKY - DAY Russell steers through the clouds toward the DIRIGIBLE. INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS Dogs play poker. Behind them, Russell flies past with the leaf blower. They turn to look. EXT. DIRIGIBLE Russell steers wobbly toward an open dirigible window. He smashes into the wall. 82. RUSSELL Ooph! He tries again and TUMBLES through the window. INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS Russell releases the balloons and picks up the leaf blower, ready for action. RUSSELL Yes! Don't worry Kevin! I'll save - Growling dogs move toward him. Russell blows the leaf blower at the dogs. INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM Muntz stares into the bird's cage, mesmerized. She's miserable and scared. MUNTZ And they wouldn't believe me. Just wait till they get a look at you. Alpha enters. ALPHA Master! The small mailman has returned. MUNTZ What? INT. DIRIGIBLE Dogs tie Russell to a chair. RUSSELL Let me go! Muntz enters. MUNTZ Where's your elderly friend? Russell blows the leaf blower in Muntz's face. RUSSELL He's not my friend anymore. 83. Muntz grabs the leaf blower and drags Russell out. MUNTZ Well, if you're here, Fredricksen can't be far behind. INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM Muntz drags Russell through the trophy room. RUSSELL Where are you keeping Kevin!? INT. DIRIGIBLE, RAMP ROOM - CONTINUOUS Muntz sets Russell down and walks to a control panel. RUSSELL Let me go! BETA Scream all you want, small mailman. GAMMA None of your mailman friends can hear you. RUSSELL I'll unleash all my Wilderness Explorer training! Muntz is about to throw a switch when he looks out the porthole. Flying toward him is CARL'S HOUSE! MUNTZ Alpha! Fredricksen's coming back. Guard that bird. If you see the old man, you know what to do. Muntz pulls the switch and walks out of the room. RUSSELL Hey, where are you going? I'm not finished with you! MUNTZ Nice talking with you. Muntz slams the door. Light emerges from the floor. Russell is on the ramp, which is opening. Russell REACTS. 84. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT Muntz enters the cockpit and takes the wheel. MUNTZ Where are you, Fredricksen? EXT. DIRIGIBLE The dirigible turns, revealing Carl's house sneaking up behind. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Carl steers toward the cockpit. He dons Russell's sash, then hooks his cane onto his back. He's fighting for a cause. He hears SCREAMING. It's Russell! Tied to his chair, he slides down the ramp as it lowers, closer and closer to the edge. CARL Russell! Carl steers his house to the dirigible. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, RAMP - CONTINUOUS Carl flings the hose, HOOKING it to the ramp railing. Using his cane as a zip line, Carl slides to Russell, catching him just as Russell slides off the ramp edge. They land safely together. RUSSELL Mr. Fredricksen! CARL Dug! Bring `er over! Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to the dirigible ramp. Carl carries Russell into the house. INT. CARL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Carl sets Russell, still bound, down in the front hall. 85. RUSSELL You came back for Kevin! Let's go get her. CARL I'm getting Kevin. You stay here! RUSSELL But I want to help! CARL I don't want your help. I want you safe! Carl leaps back into the dirigible. Dug follows. Russell STRUGGLES against his bonds. INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY Carl and Dug sneak down a hall. They see dogs ahead and hide. CARL How do we get past these dogs? DUG Uh... POINT! Dug points to a grate in the wall. INT. DIRIGIBLE, GAS CELL AREA Dug leads Carl "backstage" through a vent shaft into the dirigible. They sneak past two biplanes. INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM They emerge through a grate near the ceiling. They look down into the room where the bird is kept in a cage. CARL Kevin! The bird recognizes Carl and CRIES OUT. CARL Don't worry Kevin, we're on our way! Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above. 86. ALPHA Allow no one to be entering through these doors. Guard well that bird, my minions. CARL (WHISPERS) What do we do now, Dug? Dug is lost in ecstacy, chomping on a tennis ball on the end of Carl's cane. INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Carl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage. He bangs his cane. All the dogs turn. He grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air. CARL Who wants the ball? DOGS Me! I do! I want the ball! CARL Then go get it! Carl throws the ball. The dogs scramble after it. INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit. DOGS I'm gonna get there first! Oh gonna get the ball! I'm gonna get it! Gamma catches it.. GAMMA I got it!! Behind them Carl shuts the door. The dogs realize their mistake. GAMMA Uh-oh. 87. INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM Carl opens the cage door. CARL I'm sorry Kevin. Let's get you out of here. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT Muntz scans the horizon. Suddenly the in-ship communicator comes to life. DOG WALLA (on radio) Master! He's gone! The old man! He's here! He's got the bird! The bird's gone! MUNTZ What? Calm down! One at a time! EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT PORCH Russell STRUGGLES to break free of the chair. RUSSELL I want to help! He manages to get his arms free. RUSSELL Ha ha! Except that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on the porch and fall off. Russell SCREAMS as he falls. The hose unspools. Russell reaches the end of the hose. Russell grabs onto it and the chair jostles free, falling thousands of feet down. The house drifts away from the dirigible. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT The melee of conflicting reports from the dogs continues. DOG WALLA He's in Hall D! He's in Hall B! It's the old man! 88. MUNTZ Does anyone know where they are?!?! On cue, Russell SPLATS into the dashboard window of the control room and SQUEEGEES across, dangling from the hose. Muntz stares, slack-jawed. RUSSELL Whoooaaah! The house floats off. MUNTZ (into radio) Grey leader! Take down the house! EXT. CARL'S HOUSE Russell clings to the end of the hose, swaying in the wind. What's that noise? From beneath the dirigible emerges... EXT. OPEN SKY - CONTINUOUS From beneath the dirigible, three spitfire airplanes emerge. As they get closer, it is clear they are being flown by DOGS. BETA (into radio) Grey leader, checking in. GAMMA Grey 2, checking in. OMEGA Grey 3, checking in. The planes fall into formation and fly toward the house. BETA Target sighted. The Dog Squadron Leader bites down on a squeaky bone chew toy that fires poison darts. The biplanes fire and strafe Carl's house with darts. Russell SCREAMS, swaying beneath it on the hose. INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM Carl, Dug and the bird escape through the trophy room. 89. CARL Come on, Kevin. Behind the door, Muntz is waiting for them. He grabs a sword from the wall display and attacks. Dug hears and BITES Muntz on the leg. Muntz kicks Dug loose and out the door. He slams it shut. INT. DIRIGIBLE, OUTSIDE OF TROPHY ROOM - CONTINUOUS Locked out, Dug jumps on the door and barks. He hears growling and turns around. There stands Alpha and the other dogs. DUG Hi. INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY Dug runs. The dogs give chase. INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM Muntz swings his sword at Carl but misses. Carl uses his cane to defend himself. OLD MAN SWORD FIGHT! Muntz smashes his trophy collection as he swings for Carl. His sword gets stuck in a mounted skeleton. Carl swings his cane and hits Muntz on the head. The tennis balls bounce the cane off Muntz and smack Carl in the face. Muntz pulls the sword free. He raises the sword over his head to strike and his back CRACKS loudly. He's stuck! Carl raises his cane over his head and his back CRACKS too. Carl and Muntz STRUGGLE to move. Muntz CRACKS his back free and kicks Carl in the chest, knocking him against a trophy. He has the upper hand now. He throttles him with his arm and lifts his sword. MUNTZ Any last words, Fredricksen? Come on, spit it out! Carl spits his FALSE TEETH at Muntz. He falls backwards. 90. Carl collects his teeth and motions for Kevin. CARL Come on! Muntz advances on Carl, who struggles to protect the bird. Muntz is a wild man now, smashing and destroying anything that gets in his way. MUNTZ Enough! I'm taking that bird back with me alive or dead! Carl trips and falls to the floor. Muntz is about to deal the final blow. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT Meanwhile Alpha backs Dug into the control panel. He bumps a a LEVER. EXT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS The entire dirigible rocks wildly to the side. INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM Muntz is knocked off balance. He slides to one side. Trophy cases slide after him. The dirigible tilts to the other side. The broken trophy cases barrel straight toward Carl! Carl is thrown into a window which bursts open. Carl falls through but manages to grab the frame with his cane. He dangles out over open air. He sees the biplanes circling the house, Russell hanging beneath it. The ship corrects again. Carl climbs back inside. Muntz comes at Carl. CARL Come on, Kevin! 91. EXT. SIDE OF DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS Carl climbs the work ladder up the side of the dirigible. He pushes the bird along as he goes. Muntz follows up. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT Alpha throws Dug viciously across the room. Alpha throws him again and Dug crashes into the steering wheel, knocking a radar shade off the control panel. Alpha moves in. Dug hides behind the steering wheel. ALPHA I will have many enjoyments for what I am about to do, Dug. Alpha lunges at Dug through the steering wheel. Dug cowers, but then notices the RADAR SHADE. As Alpha lunges again, Dug jams the shade over Alpha's head. Alpha's head is stuck, trapped by the cone. The dogs all GASP. MISC DOG He wears the Cone of Shame! ALPHA (high-pitched voice) What? Do not just continue sitting! Attack! The bump caused his collar to go funny again. The dogs all howl with laughter. ALPHA (high pitched voice) No! No! Stop your laughing! Get this off of me! DUG Listen you dog! Sit! Surprised at Dug's moxy, Alpha sits. All other dogs sit too. DOG WALLA Yes, Alpha. 92. DUG Alpha? I am not Alpha, he is- (REALIZING) Oohhhh! EXT. CARL'S HOUSE Russell TRIES TO CLIMB the hose. His hands are about to give out. The biplanes head straight at Russell. RUSSELL (out of breath) I can't do it! Behind him, Carl is climbing the side of the dirigible for dear life, Muntz closing in. CARL (far in the distance) Russell! RUSSELL Huh? Carl calls for help: the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL. RUSSELL You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone! Russell CLIMBS! He's more machine than boy now. Biplanes shooting the whole way, he climbs up onto the porch. The biplanes close in. Russell yells to them. RUSSELL Hey! (pointing down) Squirrel! All the dog pilots snap to attention. GAMMA Squirrel? OMEGA Where's the squirrel?! 93. The planes dive, crash into each other. The dog pilots parachute out. GAMMA I hate squirrels. EXT. SIDE OF DIRIGIBLE Carl climbs. Muntz grabs Carl's foot. Carl defends himself with his cane, knocking Muntz off the ladder. Muntz catches on to a rung of the ladder. He watches Carl and the bird climb. Muntz descends the ladder. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP - DAY Carl and the bird make it to the top of the dirigible. Suddenly, a trap door opens. Carl GASPS... but it's Dug! CARL Dug! Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face. DUG Master! The house bears down on them. They run to meet it. CARL Russell!! Over here!! Let's go! Russell steers the house toward Carl. RUSSELL Mr. Fredricksen! The house slows and lowers atop the airship. Carl HOISTS the bird up onto the porch. CARL Come on, Kevin! Carl helps Dug onto the porch. He climbs up himself... BLAM! Muntz appears on top of the dirigible with a rifle! A bullet blasts through Carl's balloon strings. A third of them break or shoot skyward. The house plummets, crashing onto the dirigible. 94. Carl is THROWN from the house onto the airship. The house slides toward the edge, Russell, Dug and Kevin still inside. CARL No! Carl SCRAMBLES to grab the hose trailing from the sliding house. The house slides on to the dirigible's tail fin. Holding the hose, Carl digs in his heels and is just able to stop it. The house teeters on the very edge of the tail fin. CARL Russell! Get out of there! Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch. BLAM! A bullet smashes the door jam next to them. Muntz storms toward the house. Carl holds desperately to the hose. CARL No! Leave them alone! Russell and others duck inside and slam the door. The house tilts, threatening to tip off at any second. Carl holds on for his life. Muntz POUNDS on the door with the butt of the rifle. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY Russell, Dug and Kevin back away from the door. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP The house slides farther over the edge. Carl struggles to hold on. The hose caddy is ripping free from the house! The bolts pop from the wooden siding... it's about to go! INT. CARL'S HOUSE Russell, Dug and Kevin run into the living room. 95. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP Muntz KICKS the door. Suddenly, Carl has an idea. CARL Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't let go of her! INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Confused, Russell follows Carl's directions. He Dug and the bird huddle together. Muntz breaks through the door. He lifts his rifle and sights the bird... Through the window, Carl yells out. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP CARL Kevin! Chocolate! Carl holds aloft a bar of chocolate. INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM Kevin lunges, pushing past Muntz and knocking the rifle from his hands. Muntz lunges after them. EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS The hose caddy breaks free. Kevin leaps through the window, Russell and Dug hanging from her side. Muntz leaps after them. But balloon strings tangle around his leg and pull him back. Muntz hangs for a moment... It's thousands of feet from the ground.... He falls. 96. EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP PANTING, Carl is left holding the hose. He PULLS himself toward the edge. The hose curves beneath the tail fin. Finally it swings out... RUSSELL That was cool! Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin. The bird holds on to the hose with her beak. Carl LAUGHS, relieved. CARL Don't jerk around so much, kid! Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug. DUG Oh I am ready to not be up high. Carl LAUGHS heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face. Carl looks into the distance. His house, now empty, floats softly down into the clouds, and disappears. RUSSELL Sorry about your house, Mr. Fredricksen. Carl smiles. He puts his arm around Russell. CARL You know, it's just a house. Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship floating off over the clouds. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - AFTERNOON Carl and Russell hold and cuddle the baby birds. The babies peck at Carl's head. Carl and Russell LAUGH. CARL Ow! Ow! Ow! RUSSELL Look at you. You're so soft. 97. Kevin CALLS OUT, waiting for the babies at the gate to the LABYRINTH. Time to go. CARL/RUSSELL (DISAPPOINTED) Awwww! RUSSELL I wish I could keep one. The babies run to the bird. One stops to HISS at Dug. Carl has misplaced something. CARL Huh, where's my cane? I just had it here... Kevin starts HACKING. She COUGHS up the cane. Babies start HACKING too. They COUGH up tennis balls. CARL You know what? Keep `em. A little gift from me to you. The bird family enters the labyrinth. Carl and Russell wave. RUSSELL Bye Kevin! The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one last time before disappearing into the mist. INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT - LATER Carl and Russell both wear matching leather flight helmets and goggles. RUSSELL Ready? Carl gives a thumbs up. CARL Ready! 98. EXT. DIRIGIBLE Muntz's dirigible ascends into the sky. Dug and all of MUNTZ'S DOGS stick their heads out the dirigible windows, barking as they fly into the sunset. DISSOLVE TO: INT. AUDITORIUM CAMP MASTER STRAUCH ...and by receiving their badges, the following Explorers will graduate to Senior Explorers. Each Junior Wilderness Explorer stands next to his father. As the Camp Master announces the achievement he hands the father a badge, who pins it to his son's sash. CAMP MASTER STRAUCH For Extreme Mountaineering Lore... Congratulations, Jimmy. (hands badge to dad) For Wild Animal Defensive Arts... Congratulations, Brandon. (hands badge) For Assisting the Elderly... Russell is tanned and dirty. And alone. CAMP MASTER STRAUCH Uh, Russell? Is there... someone that... uh... The Camp Master CLEARS HIS THROAT uncomfortably. Russell looks for his dad in the audience. CARL (O.S.) Excuse me. Pardon me. Old man coming through. Carl takes his place next to Russell. CARL (to Camp Master) I'm here for him. CAMP MASTER STRAUCH Congratulations, Russell. Sir... The Camp Master hands Carl the badge and continues down the line. 99. CARL Russell, for assisting the elderly, and for performing above and beyond the call of duty, I would like to award you the highest honor I can bestow: The Ellie Badge. Carl pins the badge onto the missing spot on Russell's sash. It's Ellie's GRAPE SODA PIN. RUSSELL Wow. Carl smiles. They salute each other. Russell gives Carl a hug. Carl returns it. Russell's mom sits in the audience with Dug. Russell proudly shows her the badge. CAMP MASTER STRAUCH Alright, I think that covers everybody... So let's give a big Explorer Call to our brand new Senior Wilderness Explorers! Ready everybody? The Camp Master leads the audience in the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.

Overhead, MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE is parked, its ladder in the handicapped parking spot. DISSOLVE TO: EXT.

THE SOUND OF DRUMS, from a great distance, growing louder.
FADE IN:
WE ARE FLYING through mist, a dimly glimpsed forest below.
VOICE (V.O.)
When I was lying there in the VA
hospital, with a big hole blown through
the middle of my life, I started having
these dreams of flying.
We are very low over the forest now, gliding fast, the drums
BUILDING to a PEAK -VOICE (V.O.)
Sooner or later though, you always have
to wake up...

CUT TO:

EXT. CITY - NIGHT
A SCREECH OF BRAKES as a vehicle WIPES FRAME, revealing -JAKE SULLY, a scarred and scruffy combat vet, sitting in a
beat up carbon-fiber wheelchair. At 22, his eyes are
hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured
pain beyond his years.
Jake stares upward at the levels of the city. MAGLEV TRAINS
WHOOSH overhead on elevated tracks, against a sky of garish
advertizing.
JAKE (V.O.)
They can fix a spinal, if you’ve got the
money. But not on vet benefits, not in
this economy.
The traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the
crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair. Most of the people
wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air. In a
LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous,
isolated souls.
INT. JAKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The room is a tiny CUBICLE, prison cell meets 747 bathroom.
Narrow cot, wall-screen droning away in the B.G. -PERKY NEWSCASTER
The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a
century, is making a comeback. These
cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo
are...

2.

Jake laboriously pulls his pants off -- rocking to one side,
pushing the fabric down past his hip, then rocking to the
other, and so on.
His legs are white and atrophied. Utterly useless. But his
arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled. A “Born Loser”
tattoo prominent on his shoulder.
JAKE (V.O.)
I became a Marine for the hardship. To
be hammered on the anvil of life. I told
myself I could pass any test a man can
pass.
Jake struggles with his pants a long time.

CUT TO:

INT. ROWDY BAR -- NIGHT
Not the kind of place you’d bring your mom.
We find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front
wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his
forehead. ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets,
CLAP and WHOOP.
Jake grabs the glass, SLAMS down the shot as they cheer.
A WALL-SIZED SCREEN filled with the World Cup game -- men
RUNNING on antelope legs.
CU JAKE, watching what he can’t have.

Expression stony.

JAKE (V.O.)
Let’s get it straight up front. I don’t
want your pity. I know the world’s a
cold-ass bitch.
Jake’s eyes shift -- HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in
the crowd. A MAN on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN he’s with.
Hard. She cowers but he’s got her arm, shouting, raising his
fist. An eternal tableau. People look away.
CU JAKE -- not looking away.
JAKE (V.O.)
You want a fair deal, you’re on the wrong
planet. The strong prey on the weak.
TIGHT ON JAKE’S HAND as he starts pushing the wheel of his
chair.
TRACKING WITH HIM as he rolls forward.

3.

JAKE (V.O.)
It’s just the way things are.
does a damn thing.

And nobody

Jake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans
down and grabs one leg of the man’s barstool -- and YANKS.
The chair flips.

The guy goes down HARD and --

JAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy,
getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap
out of him, right there on the floor.
THE BOUNCER jumps in, trying to drag him off and it goes into
SLOW MOTION, everybody yelling and pulling...
JAKE (V.O.)
All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life
was a single thing worth fighting for.

CUT TO:

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR -- NIGHT
THE BOUNCER hurls Jake out the door, sending him SPRAWLING on
the pavement. A moment later, his chair CRASHES down on him,
banging across the alley, landing in the trash.
Jake struggles to rise on one elbow. He’s bleeding and
bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight.
JAKE
I hope you realize you’ve just lost a
customer!
He collapses onto his back, panting.
JAKE
(to himself)
Candy ass bitch.
He stares upwards at the levels of the city. MAGTRAINS ROAR
overhead. It starts to RAIN. He just lies there, blinking -then shouts jauntily to no one in particular -JAKE
If it ain’t rainin’ we ain’t trainin’!
CAMERA PULLS BACK high and wide, as Jake lies spread-eagled
amongst the trash, getting drenched.
TWO LONG SHADOWS enter FRAME, coming to rest across him.

4.

Jake sees two pairs of SHINY SHOES stop next to him.
squints up at --

He

TWO MEN. Matching suits. Their features unremarkable and
blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors.
AGENT 1
Are you Jake Sully?
Step off.

JAKE
You’re ruinin’ my good mood.

AGENT 2
It’s about your brother.

CUT TO:

INT. MUNICIPAL CREMATORIUM - NIGHT
DOWN-ANGLE on a large rectangular cardboard box. HANDS ENTER
FRAME, pulling open the top to reveal a DEAD MAN’S FACE. He
looks EXACTLY like a clean-shaven version of Jake. His
IDENTICAL TWIN -- TOMMY.
JAKE (V.O.)
The strong prey on the weak. A guy with
a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for
the paper in his wallet.
WIDER, showing Jake and the two agents in a high tech
CREMATORIUM -- a row of stainless steel furnaces. Jake
stares down at his own face.
JAKE
Jesus, Tommy.
JAKE (V.O.)
The Suits’ concern was touching.
AGENT 1
Your brother represented a significant
investment. We’d like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.
The ATTENDANT closes the box and seals it with a tape
dispenser, like it’s a package for shipping. The cardboard
coffin is rolled into the furnace.
JAKE (V.O.)
The egghead and the jarhead.
Tommy was
the scientist, not me. He was the one
who wanted to get shot light years out
into space to find the answers.

5.

PUSHING IN ON JAKE as he watches, bathed in orange light.
JAKE (V.O.)
Me -- I was just another dumb grunt

EXT. SPACE
Against the cold infinity of stars glides an INTERSTELLAR
SPACECRAFT -- ISV VENTURE STAR. As it moves past like an
endless train, we realize this thing is ENORMOUS -- over half
a mile long. PAN WITH IT 180 to REVEAL -A GAS-GIANT PLANET called POLYPHEMUS, ringed with dozens of
moons which cast beauty-mark shadows on its vast face.
The ISV diminishes away from us toward the largest MOON-- a

ship dwindles to a speck against the BLUE MOON.

ISV Venture Star drifts above a spectacular vista -- the
sapphire seas and unfamiliar continents of Pandora.
CLOSE ON ISV -- two massive “VALKYRIE” SHUTTLES are mated to
a DOCKING NODE. One of them separates from the starship and
moves away, its thrusters FIRING in short bursts.
As the shuttle moves away, descending toward Pandora, we hear
the sound of DRUMS, building, louder and louder until we-CUT TO:

FLYING OVER A LANDSCAPE of massive cliffs and towering mesas
carpeted in rainforest. Great scarves of cloud swirl around
the mesa tops. A primeval landscape, vast and forbidding.
The trees are alien, the color too cyan. There are
waterfalls, rivers, and distant flocks of WINGED CREATURES.
Suddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to -AN OPEN-PIT MINE. A lifeless crater -- as if a giant cookiecutter took a chunk out of the world. Down among the
terraces are EXCAVATORS and TRUCKS the size of three story
buildings.
And beyond the mine is the HUMAN COLONY --

HELL’S GATE is a cluster of squat concrete and steel
structures surrounded by chain-link FENCE 10 meters high,
topped with razor wire.
At the corners are towers with automated SENTRY GUNS
swiveling on servo mounts.
Visible beyond the gun towers, the VALKYRIE SHUTTLE roars in
across the treetops. VECTORING NOZZLES change angle,
bringing the ship to a SLOW HOVER.

Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as -A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy

advanced technology.
Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and
heavily armed, they are AT-99 “SCORPION” GUNSHIPS.
MITSUBISHI MK-6 AMPSUITS -- human operated walking machines 4
meters tall -- patrol the perimeter. They are heavily
armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU-90.
Beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds
of feet high.
A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS

Without his mask, we see that Quaritch’s features are rugged

Me and Norm were out here to drive these
remotely controlled bodies called

mixed with DNA from the natives here.
A scientist, DOCTOR MAX CULLIMORE, is supervising the
uncrating of two SHIPPING CONTAINERS. The nearer has the
sides removed, revealing -- a ceiling-height acrylic TANK.
Norm stops to stare, and Jake rolls past him as if drawn by
some unseen force, toward -THE AMNIO TANK. There is a FIGURE floating lanquidly inside,
which looks like a man. A very large, very blue, man.
Blood circulates through a synthetic UMBILICAL in the
abdomen. As the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see
that it has a lemur-like TAIL. The skin is cyan-blue. Long
black hair drifts, graceful as seaweed.

This is what pays for the party. And
it’s what pays for your science.

Quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one
huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic -QUARITCH
Looks good.

I need you to learn about these savages,
gain their trust. Find out how I can
force their cooperation, or hit ‘em hard
if they don’t. Maybe you can keep some
of my boys from going home like you. Or

On paper. You walk like one of her

Jake nods. Quaritch brings the ‘suit to life. He steps
forward and pivots smoothly.
He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping
the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing
a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control.
He’s impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind
of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined.
QUARITCH
Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get
me what I need, I’ll see you get your
legs back when you rotate home. Your real
legs.
He raises the ‘suit’s hand, and slams the canopy shut like
the visor of a helmet. Jake watches Quaritch walk past, huge
feet CLANGING -- KUNG! KUNG! KUNG!

JAKE
Then how’s this supposed to work?

GRACE
We have a new face.

You’re fluent, you’ve studied the

them back to the table before things go
tits-up for good.
NORM
This is failing as a pep talk.
Jake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link.
JAKE
How do we contact them?
GRACE
We don’t. They contact us. If they see
us taking our samples, treating the
forest with respect -(pointedly to Jake)
Not trampling everything in sight -they may reach out to us.
JAKE
Or they may skin us and make a drum.
Jake lies back, lowering the sensor array over his body.

Norm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see-A herd of STURMBEEST -- massive six-legged creatures
reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river.
GRACE
Looks like a bull, six cows and some
juveniles.
NORM
The bull has the red on the dorsal armor?
Grace nods approvingly.
TIME CUT -- Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight
from a lake, startled by the Samson. They skim the water
above their own reflections. TETRAPTERONS.

He and Wainfleet leap out to secure the LZ, scanning the treeline warily, weapons aimed.

This forest is more alive than any on Earth, with plants that

as if every shadow conceals razor-fanged death.

It STOPS abruptly, with an oversized BLEAT.

sheltered inside one of the GREAT TREES. HOMETREE is 250
meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the
largest Sequoia, and a base of massive mangrove-pillars.

45.

TSU’TEY rides inside the columns at the base of Hometree,
shouting an ululating WARNING.
Jake is force-marched through the pillars into -INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE - NIGHT
An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the
arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe -mothers with babies, old women, young hunters.
They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to
outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow
him.
Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light
of the COOK-FIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical
gallery -- a living cathedral.
Clear membranes -- sturmbeest bladders -- filled with
fluttering bio-luminescent insects, act as area lighting.
The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous
creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM.
Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is -EYTUKAN (AY-too-kahn), the Clan Leader. Eytukan has deeply
chiselled features and a long chest mantle of THANATOR CLAWS.
His normally stern features are clouded further by anger.
EYTUKAN
(subtitled)
Why do you bring this creature here?
Neytiri addresses Eytukan in Na’vi.
NEYTIRI
(subtitled)
I was going to kill him, but there was a
sign from Eywa.
He glowers at her as he responds, pointing at Jake.
EYTUKAN
(subtitled)
I have said no dreamwalker will come
here, to offend our home! His alien
smell fills my nose
Neytiri stands her ground, answering in a respectful but not
submissive tone.

46.

NEYTIRI
(subtitled)
Father, many atokirina came to this
alien.
JAKE
What’s going on?
NEYTIRI
My father is deciding whether to kill
you.
JAKE
Your father!?
(to Eytukan)
Uh, good to meet you, sir.
Jake steps forward, offering his hand, and the hunters JUMP
to restrain him, shouting. But they all FREEZE as -A commanding FEMALE VOICE echoes through the chamber.
MO’AT
(Na’vi)
Step back!
Everybody looks up.
MO’AT (MOH-aht) stands on the second level, looking down.
She is a severe woman in her 50’s. Her bearing is haughty,
her expression friendly as a hanging-judge. Her outfit is
elaborate, denoting her rank as CLAN MATRIARCH.
MO’AT
(subtitled)
I will look at this alien.
There is an expectant hush as Mo'at descends the helical core
of Hometree, a kind of natural spiral staircase.
NEYTIRI
That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the one
who interprets the will of Eywa.
JAKE
Who’s Eywa?
Neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as Mo’at passes.
The villagers stare silently as the Matriarch circles slowly
around Jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue.

47.

MO’AT
(thick accent)
What are you called?
JAKE
Jake Sully.
She produces a long THORN between her fingertips. With a
flourish she strikes his chest.
Jake flinches. RED BLOOD wells up and Mo'at rubs some
between her fingertips. She tastes it.
MO'AT
Why did you come to us?
JAKE
I came to learn.
MO'AT
We have tried to teach other Sky People.
It is hard to fill a cup which is already
full.
JAKE
My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask
Doctor Augustine. I’m no scientist.
MO'AT
What are you?
JAKE
I don’t know. I was a Marine -- uh, a
warrior. Of the Jarhead clan.
TSU’TEY
(subtitled)
A warrior! I could kill him easily!
EYTUKAN
(subtitled)
No! This is the first warrior
dreamwalker we have seen. We need to
learn more about him.
JAKE
What’s going on?

What are they saying?

MO’AT
(to Neytiri, subtitled)
Daughter. You will teach him our way, to
speak and walk as we do.

NEYTIRI looks shocked, then angry.
NEYTIRI
(subtitled)
Why me? That's not fair!

I only--

MO’AT
(subtitled)
It is decided!
Neytiri subsides, turning to glare at Jake.
MO'AT
(to Jake)
My daughter will teach you our ways.
Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if
your insanity can be cured.
She turns to Neytiri, her expression stern -MO'AT

He is your responsibility.
Neytiri nods, accepting, but she’s not a happy camper.

NEYTIRI
Do not speak.

CUT TO:

INT. SECOND LEVEL/HOMETREE
LATER, Neytiri leads Jake up the spiral to the SECOND LEVEL.
He now wears only a ratty LOINCLOTH. His wounds are bound
with plant-fiber bandages.
THE ENTIRE CLAN is squatting at dinner in a huge circle. They
stop talking and turn to gaze at Jake as he enters the
circle.
JAKE
Don’t get up.
Neytiri crosses the circle to the cook pit and returns with
several large leaves heaped with food. She kneels next to
Jake, placing the food in front of him almost DEFIANTLY.
JAKE
You never told me your name.

NEYTIRI

JAKE
Okay, again, a whole lot slower.
NEYTIRI
(exaggerated slowness)
Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.
Jake knows she’s baiting him.

He smiles in response.

JAKE
Nay-TEE-ree. That’s nice. Nay-TEE-ree.
ACROSS THE CIRCLE, Tsu’tey, Mo'at and Eytukan sit together,
glancing up occasionally from their food to the stranger.
TSU’TEY

These aliens try to look like people, but
they can’t.
MO'AT

He seems dim to me.

NEYTIRI motions for Jake to take portions from the serving
leaves onto his own leaf.
JAKE
Your mom likes me.

I can tell.

MO’AT, watching Jake and Neytiri, leans over to Eytukan.
MO'AT
(subtitled)
Neytiri will test this “warrior.” Hey may
learn nothing -- but we will learn much.
EYTUKAN
You speak truth. We must understand
these Sky People if we are to drive them
out.
Jake munches on a white shrimp-like thing.
JAKE
These rock. What are they?
NEYTIRI
Teylu. You call beetle larvae.

50.

Jake blanches. She heaps some more onto his leaf -- a
CHALLENGE -- and Jake meets her eyes, takes a handful, and
starts munching enthusiastically.
JAKE
That’s some damn fine teylu. That’s like
grandma’s teylu.
CU TSU’TEY, warily eyeing Jake -TSU’TEY

I say she will kill him.

CUT TO:

INT. THIRD LEVEL - NIGHT
The sleeping level -- families nesting in groups on woven
hammocks the size of trampolines. The hunters sleep along
SPOKES joining the inner trunk to the tree’s outer shell.
Jake lies awake in a hammock, people rustling in the darkness
around him. Neytiri is nearby, curled up like a little girl.
She stares at him for a moment, then closes her eyes.
Jake watches the glowing bugs fluttering inside a nightlight, a pulse of life energy. A strange peace spreads
through him. He closes his eyes and -CUT TO:

Unbelievable.

It’s not something you can teach.
Some of the other scientists clap Jake on the shoulders in
congratulation.

road runs from Hell’s Gate to a proposed new mine miles away.
SELFRIDGE
Their damn village is sitting right over
the richest unobtanium deposit for a
hundred klicks in any direction. Which
sucks -- for them -- because they need to
relocate.
JAKE
(taking that in)
Does Augustine know about this?
SELFRIDGE
Yeah, she does, and she’s on the next
ship back if she tries to cock-block me
on it.
JAKE
So -- who talks them into moving?
QUARITCH

Guess.
JAKE
What if they won’t go?
QUARITCH
(icy)
I’m betting they will.
SELFRIDGE
Killing the indigenous looks bad, but
there’s one thing shareholders hate more
than bad press -- and that’s a bad

had any training whatsoever.
He hauls himself from wheelchair to Link.
JAKE
Who’s got a date with the chief’s
daughter?
GRACE
Knock it off. Jesus, it’s like

As Jake settles into the soft embrace of the link, Grace

with laughter as she runs back to her playmates.
GRINNING, Jake turns to see NEYTIRI cantering toward him on a
DIREHORSE. She leads a second horse, an old sway-backed
MARE. His grin drops.
EXT. RIVER NEAR HOMETREE - DAY
JAKE nervously grips the surcingle of the mare. Neytiri holds
its nose-ring while Jake clumsily mounts.
Jake bends one of its ANTENNAE down to the tip of his queue.
He hesitantly touches them together and --

TIGHT SHOT -- the tendrils INTERWEAVE.
Jake’s PUPILS DILATE and his mouth drops open. The horse’s
eyes also go wide and it HONKS nervously. Neytiri touches her
fingertips to the neural interface.
NEYTIRI
This is shahaylu -- the bond. Feel her
heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong
legs.
Jake closes his eyes, nodding.

One with the horse.

TSU’TEY and another young hunter come out of the forest
leading TWO DIREHORSES. The magnificent animals drink from
the edge of the pool. Tsu’tey watches Jake’s riding lesson
with disdain.
NEYTIRI
You may tell her what to do -(she touches her head)
-- inside. For now, say where to go.
Forward.

JAKE

The horse LAUNCHES into a GALLOP. Jake flops around, with no
idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly THROWN OFF. He
lands painfully in the mud.
He gets up, brushing mud off knees and ass, as Neytiri leads
the horse back to him.
Again.

NEYTIRI

SERIES OF JUMP CUTS -- Jake falls off the horse in various
ways, seemingly landing harder each time.
ON JAKE, face down in the mud of the riverbank. He painfully
rises to hands and knees. Which is when he sees -TSU’TEY and another HUNTER thundering across the shallow
river on their direhorses. Spray blasts up from their
hooves.
Jake stands, covered in mud, as Tsu’tey stops his horse next
to him, looking down with disdain.
TSU’TEY
You should go away.

LOOKING DOWN the central shaft of Hometree, 80 meters to the
ground. Villagers are ant-like.
Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core
trunk like a lemur. He climbs the last section, arriving out
of breath beside her. She leads him OUTSIDE, onto -A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see
other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like
enormous umbrellas above the rainforest.
NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of
STRUCTURE -- a WEB made of thick woven fiber. DARK SHAPES
clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND.
Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS. One of the
shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight.
A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE. Much larger than the forest
banshees, this thing is taller than a Na’vi with a 10 meter
wingspan. A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it
alights on the branch right in front of her.
Holy shit.

JAKE

NEYTIRI
Do not look in her eye.
Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it SNATCHES and
gulps down. She murmurs to it and strokes its NECK.
It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the
shadows nearby answer.
Neytiri flip-catches her queue and gently connects it to the
Banshee’s ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the
neural connection is made.
NEYTIRI
Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is
made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter
in the whole life.
She climbs smoothly onto the animal’s back.

When you are ready.
The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation.
Heeyaaahh!

NEYTIRI

Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee
DROPS off the branch. It swoops down across the forest
canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a
power climb.
Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close

Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until -She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows
its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and
catches another.
JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with

rush.
He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a
game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive.
Neytiri is surprised -- that he followed.

That he lived.

the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the
plants around her, and sniffs the air.

JAKE (V.O.)
I’m learning to read the trails, the
tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest
scents and sounds.
JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as -A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows
of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are
sheltered from predators among their parents' legs.
One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes
flight, an explosion of purple wings.
Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau.
ANOTHER PLACE -- NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her
ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are
closed. She speaks very softly to Jake -NEYTIRI
When you hear nothing, you will hear
everything. When you see nothing, you
will See everything.
JAKE (V.O.)
Sometimes I have no idea what she’s
talking about.
Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male
HEXAPEDE -- a six legged deer-like creature.
Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri
watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede -- tracks it for a
beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery.

NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by
galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move

A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow.
Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly.

Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature
on one of the ferns. An ugly, stick-like LIZARD-THING
perched on a frond. As he approaches -SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a
bioluminescent membrane -- a disk a meter across, opening
like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee.
THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing.

Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY. An
EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight.
Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until
they are all flying. And for the first time, she is
unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him.

misty canyon.
JAKE (V.O.)
Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway
to heaven. It’s the test every young
hunter has to pass.
TSU’TEY signals a stop.
UP-SLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation. Thick vine-like
trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in
their gnarled grip.
A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the
twisted vine-trunks. This is some sort of freak natural
occurrence -- like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the
clouds.
There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and
the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at -One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a
nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is
drifting toward them, filling half the sky.
The Hunters dismount.
JAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds. He
turns to Tsu’tey, who is checking the young hunters’ gear.

EXT. BEANSTALK - DAY
200 METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along
the vine-trunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium
BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree.
JAKE looks down -- the massive trunk dwindles to the size of
a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs
over it -- it floats upward.
They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them,
the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from
one of the waterfalls hits them.
Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper
branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss.
One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass.
Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling
over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands
above.

TINY FIGURES cross a causeway of vines connecting a small
island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis.

Banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of

A waterfall THUNDERS down into the void like a faucet of the
gods. Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below
-- a view from Olympus.
A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings -- NEYTIRI’S
BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She
dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven
HOOD. It waits, docile, as -She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsu’tey leads them
through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And
Jake sees -The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock outcroppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls
with the fore-claws on their wings, or perch on ledges.

Tsu’tey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two
teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough.
Tsu’tey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge.

NEYTIRI
He will try to kill you.
JAKE
Outstanding.
Out of sight of Tsu’tey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes
it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like
it didn’t happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with -The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK

They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines.
Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the

the spiral. She tries to follow, but is barred by a hunter.
BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly
into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and
hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM.
TIME CUT -- MO’AT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs,
CHANTING in a low monotone. Jake, squatting, washes the
smoke over himself with his palms.
MACRO - MO’AT’S FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with
holes. She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and
draws it out of the wood.
MO'AT
(subtitled)
Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree -bless this worthy Hunter with a true
vision.

86.

MO’AT places the worm on Jake’s out-stretched TONGUE. It
twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She
indicates he should chew. He does.
MACRO -- AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a
writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a
scorpion.
He places it against the back of Jake’s neck and presses. The
insect drives its stinger into Jake’s skin and -Jake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake
alone in the circle.
Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant.
SLOW DOLLY IN on Jake. His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the
faces -- they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening.
Jake looks down at the palms of his hands.
JAKE’S POV -- his hands recede, his whole body, the ground
and -INSTANTLY the circle of Na’vi recedes, as if to a distant
horizon, leaving vast ground in between. SPACE is utterly
distorted, and SOUND as well -- echoing, THUNDEROUS.
ECU JAKE -- pupils DILATED black. He looks around and -The onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees,
which seem miles high. The whole image is bathed in spectral
radiance. Jake looks down -JAKE’S POV -- his body and hands transforming -- fingers
stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread
outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which
connect to the roots of the trees and -CUT TO REALITY -- Jake is on his hands and knees, PUKING in
the dirt. He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom
contracts his muscles but -IN HIS VISION Jake stands serene on a FLOATING MOUNTAIN
CLIFF. A GREAT BLACK SHADOW covers him, the unmistakable X
silhouette of a diving LEONOPTERYX. The LAST SHADOW.
CAMERA SCREAMS down on him as the shadow grows larger -- WE
RUSH into his face, into the blackness of his pupil which
FILLS THE UNIVERSE and --

REAL JAKE writhes in the dirt, his back arched as his muscles
seize. He foams and thrashes, his eyes rolled back in his
head, while inside -TIME ITSELF HAS ACCELERATED -- clouds scream around the
mountain tops, mist boils through the forest. He feels the
wind of time blowing through him as -REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while -INSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora ---but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that
are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight.
A great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the
devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow.
Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and -PULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly
and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK
which seems to echo to eternity and -SLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING -- back in his body.
He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room.
MO'AT
It is finished.
Neytiri’s face is flooded with relief.
elders look at Jake expectantly.

The faces of the clan

EYTUKAN
(subtitled)
Did your Spirit Animal come?
Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsu’tey and the elders. How
can he tell them what he has seen?
Mo’at puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to
peer into his troubled soul.
MO'AT
(to Jake)
Something has come.
(to the others, subtitled)
It will take time for the meaning to be
clear.
She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He
gets up, weakly.

88.

OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE -- Eytukan emerges with Jake and the
others. The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what
has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem,
which seems to stare down at him.
GRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed.
Eytukan places both hands on Jake’s chest and holds them
there.
EYTUKAN

You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around
and putting their hands on Jake’s shoulders, back, chest -hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. RAINFOREST - NIGHT
JAKE and NEYTIRI run silhouetted in the night. Behind them
waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light. POLYPHEMUS
RISES behind the trees.
NEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water.
Jake follows her and -UNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES.
They seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden
of waving shapes. Tiny purple fish swirl around them.
Their hands come together, fingers twining, as they float
weightlessly, as if between worlds.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. WILLOW GLADE
Laughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their
trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing
tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains.
Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their
footsteps with expanding rings of light.
It is an exquisitely beautiful spot.
The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up
her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her.

89.

NEYTIRI
This is a place for prayers to be heard.
And sometimes answered.
Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his
fingers, his palms, his forearms. His eyes go wide. We hear
the WHISPERING of ancient Na’vi VOICES.
JAKE
It’s like -- a sound you feel.
NEYTIRI
We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of
Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who
live within Eywa.
A few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their
shoulders and arms.
They stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense,
almost luminous. He feels drawn into them.
But she pulls back a little.
NEYTIRI
You are Omaticaya now. You may make your
own bow from the wood of Hometree.
(she looks away)
And you may choose a woman.
The Amazon warrior trying so hard to sound casual.

Jake

NEYTIRI
We have many fine women. Ninat is the
best singer -JAKE
I don’t want Ninat.
NEYTIRI
There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter -Jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her.
JAKE
I’ve already chosen. But this woman must
also choose me.
She takes his hands and their fingers intertwine, moving
gently over each other.

90.

NEYTIRI
She already has.
He puts his face close to hers. She rubs her cheek against
his. He kisses her on the mouth. They explore each other.
Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling.
NEYTIRI
Kissing is very good. But we have
something better.
She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other
on the faintly glowing moss.
Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it. Jake does
the same, with trembling anticipation. The tendrils at the
ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined.
MACRO SHOT -- The tendrils INTERTWINE with gentle
undulations.
JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system
and hers. The ultimate intimacy.
They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of
moss, and ripples of light spread out around them.
THE WILLOWS sway, without wind, and the night is alive with
pulsing energy as we DISSOLVE TO -LATER. She is collapsed across his chest.

JAKE
Neytiri, you know my real body is far
away, sleeping.
She raises up, placing her fingertips to his chest -NEYTIRI
This body is real.
(she touches his forehead)
This spirit is real.
Her eyes are luminous, honest, infinitely deep.
NEYTIRI
When I was first your teacher, I hated
all Sky People. But you have also taught
me.
(whispering)
Spirit is all that matters.

91.

She lays her head down, against his chest, listening to his
heartbeat.
NEYTIRI
I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for
life.
We are?

JAKE

NEYTIRI
Yes. It is our way.
(innocently)
Oh. I forgot to tell?
He rouses up, making her look at him.
JAKE
Really, we are?
We are.

NEYTIRI

Jake considers this.
JAKE
It’s cool. I’m there.
He lays his head down, and her arms enfold him, sheltering
him as he sleeps.
INT. SHACK - NIGHT
Jake’s eyes open in the darkness. He just lies there,
thinking. In his coffin. In another world.

CUT TO:

EXT. WILLOW GLADE - DAWN
DAWN BREAKS in the sacred glade. Shafts of orange morning
light. Jake and Neytiri asleep in each others' arms. Maxfield
Parrish painting. But then -THE ROAR OF ENGINES. Neytiri awakens with a start. The
SPLINTERING, CRACKLING of forest being crushed under enormous
treads gets louder.
SHE WATCHES in growing horror as the BLADE of a bulldozer
becomes a dark wall behind the sheltering ring of willows.
She shakes Jake, shouting at him in Na’vi to wake up.

92.

NEYTIRI
Jake! Wake up! Where ever you are, come
back to me now. Jake!
INT. SHACK - DAWN
HUMAN JAKE is in a hurry to get back to the link. GRACE,
still groggy, chases him with coffee and microwaved eggs.
GRACE
Here -- eat this. I’d hate to have to
force-feed a cripple.
She slams the lid shut before he can enter and sticks the
plate under his nose.
GRACE
(grinning)
She’s not going anywhere.
He sighs heavily and starts wolfing the eggs.
EXT. WILLOW GLADE - DAWN
Neytiri SCREAMS as -The willows begin to fall before the blade, to be ground
under the treads. AVATAR JAKE is directly in the path. She
tries to lift him, but he is too heavy. She is screaming at
him, frantically trying to wake him, as -INT. SHACK - DAWN
Jake adjusts himself in the link chair. He hands Grace the
empty plate.
GRACE
And when was the last time you took a
shower? Jesus, Marine.
Jake pushes her hands away and pulls the lid down.
EXT. WILLOW GLADE
AVATAR JAKE wakes up to see -NEYTIRI dragging him, screaming.

He leaps up as --

THE DOZER pushes inexorably into the glade, splintering the
trees, plowing the earth before it.
JAKE RUNS into the path of the bulldozer, waving his arms.

93.

Hey!

JAKE
Heeeey! Stop! Stop!

He positions himself where the camera-eyes of the robotic
juggernaut will see him.
INT. OPS CENTER - DAY
CLOSE ON MONITOR -- Jake shouts but there’s no sound feed.
WIDER as the TRACTOR OPERATOR sees him and pulls back on the
remote throttles. He yells to his SUPERVISOR.
OPERATOR
Hey, I got one of the natives blockin’ my
blade here.
This attracts the attention of Selfridge, who comes over to
the workstation.
ON THE SCREEN -- Jake, in his Omaticaya loincloth and
ceremonial body paint, is unrecognizable.
SUPERVISOR
(to Selfridge)
What do we do?
SELFRIDGE
Roll on. He’ll move. These people have
to learn that we don’t stop.
TIGHT ON THROTTLES as the operator pushes them forward.
ON THE SCREEN Jake stumbles back, tripping, disappears below
the blade for a second -- reappears, running to the side.

He pulls back on the throttles.

EXT. WILLOW GLADE
THE JUGGERNAUT grinds to a stop. But the ROAR of engines
continues because -MORE DOZERS and TRACTORS advance nearby, crushing the forest
before them. Trees are slashed down by the PLASMA CUTTERS.
Terrified animals flee before the onslaught.
POWERSUITS and TROOPERS stride through the ravaged forest,
blasting anything that moves. A trooper sees Jake on the
dozer. He rips off a BURST and -Rounds CLANG into metal as Jake dives off the machine. He
grabs Neytiri and they run into concealing foliage. From
behind a screen of leaves, they watch as -THE DOZERS advance, obliterating the sacred site, leaving
only mud and wood splinters in their path.
CU NEYTIRI, stunned by the nightmarish, unfathomable
wrongness of it. She sobs as the willows die.
INT. OPS CENTER
MINUTES LATER, the operator is playing back the CAMERA’S FEED
for Quaritch and the others.
QUARITCH
Freeze it, right -- there.
ON MONITOR -- the image expands, until Jake’s face is clear,
frozen in an animal snarl.
SELFRIDGE
Son of a bitch!
PUSH IN ON QUARITCH as his jaw clenches in cold fury.
He turns and strides toward the door, shouting to his WATCH
COMMANDER as he passes.
QUARITCH

A RAIDING PARTY of hunters, their bodies painted, raise

Tsu’tey steps forward, face full of hate, raising a war cry
among the hunters.
GRACE

Please -- this will only make it worse -TSU’TEY
You do not speak here!
JAKE and NEYTIRI cross the commons toward them. Jake feels
all eyes turn toward him. He takes her arm, stopping her.
JAKE
(to Neytiri, low)
Okay, listen. There’s something I have to
tell you. It’s gonna be hard. I just
need you to -He sees TSU’TEY striding toward them, his face a mask of
fury.
You!

TSU’TEY

Tsu’tey walks right up and SLAMS Jake in the chest with both
hands. It is so unexpected, that Jake topples on his ass.
TSU’TEY
You mated with this woman?!
Oh shit.

Jake stands. He reaches out for Neytiri.

She goes to him,

We are mated before Eywa. It is done.
Tsu’tey turns to Mo'at and Eytukan, his face anguished.

Neytiri was promised to me! Everything is

Tsu’tey points at Jake, his pain shifting to rage.
TSU’TEY

These aliens kill everything they touch,
like poison.
MO'AT
Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can
never be Tsahik. Your life will be
wasted.
Neytiri looks at her mother -- sees the grief in her eyes.
NEYTIRI
I have chosen.
Tsu’tey draws his knife and -Yeeeeeaaa!

TSU’TEY

LUNGES AT JAKE, who’s ready this time -- he sidesteps,
blocking the knife, and elbows Tsu’tey HARD in the face.
Tsu’tey reels back, nose bleeding. He starts forward on a
second attack but -Eytukan grabs his arm and spins him around.
EYTUKAN

Stop! This is not a proper challenge.
Tsu’tey glares at Jake while sheathing his knife.

He looks helplessly at Jake and Grace’s link units -- no way

INT. HOMETREE - DAY
TSU’TEY AND JAKE square off. Each holds a long, solid staff.
The entire clan crowds around them in a circle.
GRACE
What the hell are you doing?
JAKE
It’s the only way to get him to goddamn
listen.
TSU’TEY LEAPS at Jake with a sharp cry and Jake parries with
his staff. The staves CLACK off each other as the two
combatants LEAP, DUCK and STRIKE furiously.
Tsu’tey sweeps Jake off his feet with a roundhouse hit to the
ankles, but -Jake ROLLS out of it and catches Tsu’tey in the belly with
the blunt end.

TRUDY’S SAMSON lands. QUARITCH and a posse of troopers jump
down and rush the Shack.
INT. COMMONS
TSU’TEY wades in with a series of short, sharp blows. Jake
swings with equal fury. Both fighting from the heart.

JAKE parries as Tsu’tey swings but then -Jake's eyes go blank just as -- K-RACK! Tsu’tey puts one
alongside his head. Jake sprawls, completely inert. Tsu’tey
pokes him with his staff, then raises it and lets out a
piercing VICTORY CRY.
INT. SHACK - DAY
JAKE SLAMS OPEN the Link, amped from the fight, furious -JAKE
Are you out of your goddamn mind?!

Quaritch PUNCHES HIM HARD. Jake flops back, dazed. The
troopers yank him out and ZIP-TIE his wrists.

TSU’TEY draws his KNIFE, and bends down, grabbing Jake by the
hair.
TSU’TEY

This is a demon in a false body. It

He puts his knife to Jake’s throat but -NEYTIRI BLIND-SIDES him at full tilt. Tsu’tey sprawls, rolls,
comes up to see -Neytiri crouched like a lioness over Jake, her KNIFE and
teeth bared, her ears flattened. She SNARLS with primal
fury.
Tsu’tey stands panting. He pushes through the crowd and walks
away, calling for his hunters.

himself on the monitor. GRACE and NORM stand nearby, rubbing
their wrists where the zip-ties bit in. SELFRIDGE and
QUARITCH watch with disdain.
QUARITCH
You let me down, son. You got a little
local pussy and completely forgot what
team you play for.
Jake meets his gaze with a defiant glare.
GRACE
Parker, listen, there may still be time

Shut your fucking hole!
Grace is momentarily stunned by Quaritch’s fury. But she
meets it with her own intensity, not backing down an inch.

You need to muzzle your dog!
SELFRIDGE
Can we just take this down a couple
notches, please.
JAKE

You say you want to keep your people
alive. Start by listening to her.
Jake nods to Grace to continue.
GRACE

This is bad, Parker. Those trees were
sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you
can’t imagine.
SELFRIDGE
You know what? You throw a stick in the
air around here it falls on some sacred
fern.
GRACE
I’m not talking about pagan voodoo here -I’m talking about something real and
measurable in the biology of the forest.
SELFRIDGE
(frustrated)
Which is what exactly?
Grace’s nerve fails. A rush of conflicting emotions -- the
need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific
rigor.
GRACE
(to Jake)
I can’t do this. How am I supposed to
reduce years of work to a sound bite for
the illiterate?
JAKE
Just tell him what you know in your
heart.
She turns to Parker, steeling herself.

101.

GRACE
Alright, look -- I don’t have the answers
yet, I’m just now starting to even frame
the questions. What we think we know -is that there’s some kind of
electrochemical communication between the
roots of the trees. Like the synapses
between neurons. Each tree has ten to the
fourth connections to the trees around
it, and there are ten to the twelfth
trees on Pandora -SELFRIDGE
That’s a lot I’m guessing.
GRACE
That’s more connections than the human
brain. You get it? It’s a network -- a
global network. And the Na’vi can access
it -- they can upload and download data -memories -- at sites like the one you
destroyed.
SELFRIDGE
What the hell have you people been
smoking out there? They’re just.
Goddamn. Trees.
GRACE
You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth
of this world isn’t in the ground -- it’s
all around us. The Na’vi know that, and
they’re fighting to defend it. If you
want to share this world with them, you
need to understand them.
QUARITCH
We understand them just fine.

A murmur of fear and anger goes through the crowd.
JAKE

You have to leave, or you will die.
MO'AT
Are you certain of this?
JAKE
They sent me here to learn your ways. So
one day I could bring this message, and
you would believe it.
NEYTIRI
What are you saying, Jake? You knew this
would happen?
He is unable to meet her eyes.
Yes.

JAKE

(anguished)
At first it was just orders. Then
everything changed. I fell in love-with the forest, with the Omaticaya
People -(he looks at her)
-- with you. And by then, how could I
tell you?
Neytiri can barely breathe. She is shaking with the enormity
of it, her voice cracking with rage and pain -NEYTIRI
I trusted you, Jake!

JAKE
Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to -NEYTIRI
You will never be one of the People!

Well, I’d say diplomacy has failed.
TSU’TEY and another HUNTER hold knives to the throats of the

QUARITCH
I think they mean to cut their throats if
we don’t back off. Make sure you get a

JAKE YELLS to Neytiri, Tsu’tey, the others gathered nearby --

JAKE
You have to get out of Hometree! Run to
the forest! Please, I’m begging you!
EYTUKAN scowls at Jake, then GRABS TSU’TEY and yells -EYTUKAN

Take the ikran! Attack from above!
Tsu’tey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of Hometree.

On the Dragon’s stub-wings the 40mm ROCKET LAUNCHERS open up
with a BARRAGE of leaping fire which FLASHES down and -K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM!K-WHOOM! -- the inside of Hometree ERUPTS
with multiple EXPLOSIONS of TEARGAS.
THE GAS rolls across the confused villagers. They begin to
cough and gag.
Eytukan and the remaining HUNTERS bravely fire at the
gunships with their longbows.
IN THE DRAGON’S COCKPIT, Quaritch laughs as arrows CLINK
against the armored windows.
AMID CLOUDS of teargas, the Omaticaya run, stumble, collapse.
EYTUKAN

Everybody outside! Go to the Forest.
The villagers pour out of Hometree. Everyone is yelling.
Piercing SCREAMS in the boiling gas.
JAKE, eyes streaming, struggles with his bindings.
KA-WHOOM! An INCENDIARY ROUND explodes inside the Commons.
FLAMES ROAR through the base of Hometree.

INSIDE HOMETREE it is a burning smoky HELL. Flames roar up
the inside like a chimney. STRAGGLERS scramble outside,
coughing and dragging wounded with them.
High up in the trunk, TSU’TEY and his hunters leap rapidly
from spoke to spoke, climbing barely ahead of the fireball.
OUTSIDE the fire is driven by the rotor-wash toward JAKE and
GRACE who are still bound tightly to the posts.

QUARITCH
Bring it down.
MISSILES stream down from the DRAGON and the other gunships
and -The base of Hometree VANISHES in a chain of HIGH-EXPLOSIVE
BLASTS. The massive PILLARS fragment into matchsticks, and -The Omaticaya watch in horror as -HOMETREE GROANS and starts to MOVE.
In a cacophony of cracking, splintering roots, the mighty
tree TOPPLES with agonizing slowness.
AT THE BANSHEE EYRIE, TSU’TEY and the other hunters spur
their mounts into flight. They swoop among the branches as
the tree, the one fixed thing in their lives, MOVES.
It CRASHES DOWN through the forest canopy, crushing the
lesser trees in its path, FALLING PONDEROUSLY.
HOMETREE hits the ground like the end of the world, raising a
great cloud of dust and pulverized debris.
IN THE DRAGON cockpit, Quaritch surveys the destruction.
QUARITCH
Nice work people. Alright, let’s light
it up.
INCENDIARIES launch from the gunships, EXPLODING into gouts
of FIRE in the debris of Hometree.
THE GUNSHIPS fan the flames through the trees like a firestorm. The Omaticaya retreat as a WALL OF FIRE advances.
JAKE SEARCHES for Neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks.
Neytiri!

JAKE
Neytiri!

GRACE is gathering crying CHILDREN, and herding them away
from the fire-storm.
NEYTIRI stumbles through the burning wreckage at the edge of
the INFERNO. She sees -EYTUKAN. A large shard of wood is driven through him like a
spear. He recognizes her as she kneels over him.

EYTUKAN

Daughter -- take my bow. Protect the
People.
In his last living moment he places his bow in her hands.
She collapses over him, her face crumpling in grief.
JAKE reels out of the smoke.

Kneels next to her.

JAKE
I’m sorry -She shoves him away and stands, screaming at him as tears
stream down her face.
NEYTIRI
Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never
come back!
Jake stumbles back as she slumps down by her father’s body.
Sparks and smoke swirl around him. He watches as -NETYIRI kneels, grieving. Slumped over, clutching her
stomach. Keening like an animal.
SLOW MOTION -- Jake staggers lost and alone through the
burning forest. Utterly shattered. Eyes vacant.
JAKE (V.O.)
I was a warrior who dreamed he could
bring peace. Sooner or later though, you
always have to wake up...

Trudy binds the guard with one of his own zip-ties as Max

The door is rolling open when -ANOTHER TROOPER rounds the corner. Trudy takes him down with
a sharp BLOW to the windpipe and a THAI KNEE to the ribs.
Meanwhile the first TROOPER is getting up, but Max CLOCKS him
heartily with a coffee urn. He goes down and stays down.

That was unexpectedly satisfying.
Trudy plants a kiss on Norm as he runs out of the cell.

Jake wheels out, grabbing the sidearm from the fallen trooper

JAKE rolls up behind him, aiming his pistol.

The trooper turns, sees the gun.

The trooper hesitates.

The Well of Souls. The heart of the

EXT. WELL OF SOULS - DAWN
The WELL OF SOULS is a deep caldera 100 meters across. It is
ringed with enormous WILLOWS whose roots seem to pour down
the sheer rock walls like candle wax.
AT THE BOTTOM, in a natural amphitheater, the Omaticaya
refugees are clustered around a central rock outcropping
which forms a kind of dais and altar.
Shafts of dawn light reach to the bottom of the grotto,
lighting a single willow -- the MOTHER TREE. Ancient and
gnarled, it grows in the center of the rock.
Its ROOTS spread down to the grotto floor, where they merge
with the roots of the willows ringing the Well -- forming a
braided mat resembling the surface of a brain.
Mo'at stands on the dais, leading them in a CHANT.

beyond is utterly DEVASTATED. The trees burned and fallen.
Small fires still flicker across a landscape in Hell.
JAKE stares. It is his vision, made real. He stumbles
through the dark wasteland, sparks and ash swirling around
him.
A SCREECH.

Jake looks up as --

HIS BANSHEE -- bonded for life -- flaps down to a landing in
front of him. He steps to it, and strokes its head. It
nudges his chest like a horse.

Sometimes your whole life boils down to

TORUK comes out of the sun, beating its huge wings to slow
its descent. Its crimson and black wings, backlit by the
sun, seem to glow from within.
The People CRY OUT in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast
alights in their midst. And that’s when they see -JAKE, riding high on its shoulders, plugged-in to its
antenna. It folds its wings and stands calmly amid the
paralyzed Na’vi.
Toruk lowers its body. They stare in awe as Jake dismounts
and strokes the magnificent animal’s flank.
NEYTIRI, TSU’TEY and MO’AT watch in stunned amazement as the
legendary Rider of Last Shadow walks toward them.

Neytiri raises her arms.

of the dais. He looks into her enormous eyes, and the
emotion between them is powerful and pure.
I See you.

Neytiri’s eyes brim with tears.

GRACE’S AVATAR is gently connected by the same questing ROOTCILIA-- they entwine with the QUEUE and spread over the body.
The grotto is dark except for the spectral GLOW of the
willows. The CHANT continues, hypnotically. MO’AT, on her
knees beneath the Mother Tree, writhes her arms in the trance
state. Her eyes are rolled back, showing only WHITE.
GRACE GASPS and her eyes SNAP OPEN. Her expression is AMAZED,

EXT. WELL OF SOULS - NIGHT
The cook-fires of the battle camp FLICKER like a
constellation around the edge of the Well of Souls as -JAKE slips down into the darkened, empty amphitheater.
He moves to the MOTHER TREE -- gnarled, ancient, MAJESTIC.
The roots spread in all directions, like the center of the
world.
Jake steps forward. The willow-like tendrils SWAY toward
him, moving in a breeze that isn’t there.
JAKE
I’ve never done this in my life.
He squats at the base of the tree.
JAKE
And I’m probably just talking to a tree
right now. But if you’re there -- I need
to give you a heads up.
He looks up into the tree. The hanging tendrils undulate
softly. It’s easy to imagine a presence.
JAKE
If Grace is there with you -- look in her
memories -- she can show you the world we
come from. There’s no green there. They
killed their Mother, and they’re gonna do
the same thing here.

NEYTIRI
Our Great Mother does not take sides.
She protects only the balance of life.
She comes to him, intertwining her long fingers with his.

TWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them
like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit,

is short lived as the two riders are cut down.
NORM’S HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the
creature cartwheels. He hits hard, scrambling for cover as -A WARRIOR HURLS his spear a moment before his horse is cut

Led by the Dragon, the gunships FIRE streamers of 40mm
ROCKETS ahead of them. The jungle EXPLODES with HE bursts.
Circular SHOCK WAVES flash outward through the jungle -STROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Na’vi
leaping, as the jungle rocks with the concussive onslaught.
HUNTERS LOOK UP as a dark shape hovers overhead. The
downblast of the VALKYRIE’S lift jets shreds the forest.
INSIDE THE SHUTTLE’S cargo bay, a row of DAISYCUTTERS are
lined up. Troopers roll the first pallet down the ramp.
THE PALLET falls into the jungle below and -BA-WHOOOOOM! -- an enormous high-explosive blast rips a huge
hole in the forest. A white concussion wave flashes out
across the ground for hundreds of meters in all directions.
AT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Na’vi are
blasted out of existence by fire and shock waves.
IN THE CARGO BAY the troopers WHOOP and high-five.
Yeah baby!

TROOPERS

GROUND TROOPS ADVANCE, firing flamethrowers, AR’s and GAU90’s.

Quaritch’s fleet flies into the shadow of the Mountain of
Truth.
QUARITCH
Blue team, stay with the ground units.
Red team, with me. We’re punching for
the main target.
Quaritch glances up to see -A squadron of WINGED SHAPES, diving out of the morning glare
like birds of prey.
CLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as
he leads the charge and -SCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like
falcons hitting fat turkeys. The air battle is joined.

133.

JAKE’S GREAT LEONOPTERYX flairs into its signature crimson X
shape just before -K-WHAM!! -- it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around
the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE
can barely hang onto the gyrating creature.
The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into
his canopy.
Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a
CLIFF, tearing off one rotor -- then plummets into the trees.
There is a satisfying FIREBALL.
SCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee
riders, FIRING cannons and rockets.
JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with
cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion.
JAKE tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds
splitting the air around him and -The Scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as
they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive
down into the trees.
DOOR GUNNERS in a SAMSON are shooting down banshees like
Messerschmidts from a B-17 as -WE FOLLOW TSU’TEY’S BANSHEE in a full delta dive. He swoops
in from its blind spot and -THE GUNNERS SWIVEL too late as Tsu’tey flashes past them,
SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy.
A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an air-toair missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION.
WIDE SHOT as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and
dive, like the Battle of Britain. Banshees are hit by guns
and missiles, falling out of the sky. The occasional trail of
smoke and fire marks the demise of a tilt-rotor.

THE GUNSHIP stays on her. It rips through the vines, and
tracers FLASH toward us as -SHE JINKS the banshee around a thundering waterfall but -HER PURSUER explodes right through the curtain of water. It
launches an air-to-air missile. NEYTIRI jinks hard, diving.
The missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the
shock wave.
THE GUNSHIP follows her through a narrow slit between Mons
Veritatis and a smaller floating island. They run this slot
rolled up on their sides and -THE SCORPION GUNNER locks up Neytiri for a missile shot but -A SHADOW crosses his canopy. Out of the sun comes a crimson
demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and -K-WHAMMM!! The leonopteryx SLAMS the gunship, driving it
downward in a dive. The leonopteryx lashes at it with claws
and teeth as they fall together out of control.
Jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick,
breaking its back on a rocky promontory and EXPLODING.
FLYING WITH A SAMSON as a SECOND SAMSON falls in beside it.
This one has its pilot door off, and the PILOT is wearing a
breathing mask. The door gunners wave at -TRUDY, her expression grim behind her mask. She holds the
cyclic stick between her knees while she RAKES the other ship
with BURSTS from an AR in her lap.
The pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control.
TRUDY
You’re not the only ones with guns, you
pricks.
NEYTIRI JINKS her banshee hard, an enemy Samson right behind
her. The pilot is a hotdog, following her down into the
trees, under the canopy.
They slalom among the trunks at high speed. The gunners hang
half out the doors, firing. Bark and leaves explode around
Neytiri as she zig-zags through the jungle.
THE BANSHEE dives under a huge tree limb, and the pilot
follows. He looks up at the last second, catching a glimpse
of blue-skinned figures.
THE HUNTERS drop a net of woven vines behind Neytiri and --

135.

The SAMSON hits it hard. The net fouls the ship, FLIPPING IT
backwards. It crashes upside down to the forest floor.
KABOOM!!
NEYTIRI’S BANSHEE is hit by GROUND-FIRE. It folds up like a
broken kite, crashing down through branches and -SHE SLAMS into the ground, stunned.
IN THE DRAGON Quaritch looks ahead, seeing the WELL OF SOULS.
He taps the pilot and points -QUARITCH

IN THE CARGO BAY of Valkyrie One, the troopers ready their
deadly loads.
TROOPER

CIRCLING ABOVE, Tsu’tey falls in beside Jake, who talks to
him by AIRCOM HEADSET.
JAKE
We have to stop the shuttles, no matter
what it takes.
TSU’TEY nods. He signals, gathering other hunters, who fall
in with him as he dives. Jake rolls in after them but -A GUNSHIP drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as -TSU’TEY LEADS the attack on the first shuttle. Hunters jink
and weave through WITHERING FIRE from the escort ships.
GUNNERS with jerry-rigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of
the shuttles, picking off banshees who get past the escort.
TSU’TEY is RAKED by a burst from the dorsal gunners. His
mount crumples, plummeting with a dying scream and -WE SPIRAL DOWN with him, the forest rushing up and -A BLINDING BLIZZARD of green as he tears downward, catching
at leaves and vines. He SLAMS to the ground, badly injured.
NEARBY, ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest
floor, firing their cannons and flamethrowers. The GAU-90s
rip the forest to shreds.

136.

Norm, firing as he retreats, is HIT. He collapses, his avatar
body mortally wounded as -HYDRAULIC FEET approach, passing the bodies of direhorses and
Na'vi hunters. Norm painfully tries to load another
magazine, panting in fear and pain as -AN AMPSUIT stomps up.

Aims its cannon point blank. B-BLAM!

INT. SHACK
The top of Norm’s LINK bangs open. He reels out, collapsing
onto the floor, clutching himself as if he can still feel the
pain of death.
He sits, huddled, shivering -- crazed.
EXT. RAINFOREST
TSU’TEY lies gasping, mortally injured. He looks up,
grimacing, as an ampsuit looms over him.
LYLE WAINFLEET reaches down and grabs Tsu’tey by his queue,
lifting him painfully.
WAINFLEET
I hear this is worse than death for you,
chief.
WAINFLEET cuts Tsu’tey's queue off near the base. TSU’TEY
SCREAMS in agony, his nervous system exploding on overload.
Grinning, Lyle holds up the queue -- Tsu’tey's only
connection to the world-consciousness which is his life.
NEYTIRI -- bleeding, bruised -- staggers amid burning
wreckage. AMPSUIT footsteps approach and she crouches behind
a tree. Troopers are seconds from seeing her as -NEYTIRI knocks an arrow to HER FATHER’S BOW, and readies
herself for a last kamikaze shot when -THE TROOPER on the far right of the firing line sees

a shower of broken branches as -THE TROOPERS open fire but -- the stampede drives over them
like a wave. Tree-trunk feet shatter the ampsuit cockpits.
Troopers are crushed or asphyxiated.
NEARBY the foot-soldiers see LIVING SHADOWS flow out of the
gloom as -VIPERWOLVES race among them with flashing jaws. The troopers
FIRE wildly as they go down, hitting each other as much as
their attackers.
The survivors break and run as more viperwolves bound out of
the shadows.
JAKE BANKS, watching as HUNDREDS of rider-less WILD BANSHEES
converge on Quaritch’s ships. They literally darken the sky.
JAKE
What the hell -- ?
The wild banshees wheel among the ships, ripping into them.
ON JAKE -- slowly getting it.

EYWA is in the fight.

JAKE
WHOO-HOOOO!
A GUNNER fires from the door of a Samson. There is a CRASH
and the head of a BANSHEE lunges in the open door, jerking
him out. Other banshees tear at the pilot’s windshield.
NEYTIRI watches in awe as the ground troops scatter in
disarray. The viperwolves flash past her, ignoring her.
She senses something and turns slowly to see -A THANATOR emerging from the smoke behind her. A glistening
black demon. She stands paralyzed before its stygian gaze--- and the thanator lowers itself, until its head is just
above the ground. It holds that position -- waiting.

moves through a screen of foliage to reveal -The AMPSUIT -- ripped open. Driver gone. Blood inside the
cockpit. He WHIRLS at a sound in time to see -A THANATOR LEAPING straight at him -- WAINFLEET raises his
cannon but-WHAM!! It’s on him, slamming him to the ground. The cannon
goes flying. He’s face to face with its nightmare jaws,
right outside his canopy-On its back is NEYTIRI, and it’s a toss up which one looks
more pissed off. The thanator rears back, muscles rippling
as it poises to strike and -K-KRAAACKK! Slams its teeth right through his canopy.
Wainfleet’s SCREAM is brief.

EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL
JAKE SIGNALS and a formation of hunters rolls in, diving at
the lead shuttle, which is already besieged by winged
creatures.
THE CARGO RAMP is the scene of a pitched battle. Na’vi
hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves,
overwhelming the troopers.
HUNTERS are shot, falling out of the ship, as others fly in.
They shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp, and
troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage.
The panicked CREW CHIEF slams a switch and the ramp begins to
close, a second before he is cut down by a spear.
JAKE’S LEONOPTERYX plummets at the shuttle from behind. He
swoops down, flairs to reduce speed, rolls off his mount and
lands, tumbling on the shuttle’s broad back as -GUNNERS try to swing their guns toward him but he RAKES them
with his AR, still running forward and -JAKE PULLS two grenades from his battle harness, yanking the
pins out with his teeth. He hurls them down the intakes of

grenades from his battle-harness, pulling the pins with his
teeth, then -QUARITCH’s hand shoots out and SLAMS the pilot’s CYCLIC STICK
hard over. THE DRAGON lurches sideways, rolling sharply with
a ROAR of protesting rotors and -JAKE IS FLUNG off his feet. The grenades miss the TURBINE

QUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to
the firing button-WHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him.
Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses
Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its
razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor.
THE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long
burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which

tearing it loose from the ‘suit’s hand but -Quaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost
crushing Neytiri.

INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and -P-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air.
Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to
pick up his KNIFE.
NEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs
free from underneath three tons of thanator.
QUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake.
QUARITCH
How does it feel to betray your own race?
Then, inexplicably, he TURNS.

Walks away.

FROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us
and -CRASH! -- he puts his hydraulic fist right through the
window. He is reaching inside for the Link when -JAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he
has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and --

147.

JAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritch’s shoulder
and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge
of the cockpit but -QUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake
slams to the ground.
INSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic
Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK.
NEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull
her other leg out.
THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and -JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of
the attack drives him to his knees as -QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is
pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat.
INSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay
connected as -THE KNIFE reaches his throat as -THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritch’s chest.

He looks up.

NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure,
she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly.
TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still.
QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches
the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic
laugh -- he dies.
NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing
Quaritch, she lowers her father’s bow.
JAKE sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and -INT. SHACK
HUMAN JAKE EXPLODES out of the Link, slamming to the floor
where he gags for breath. With his last strength, he claws
toward an emergency breathing mask -- across the room.
He scrambles toward it, on the edge of unconsciousness.
NEYTIRI VAULTS through the shattered window, landing in the
debris like a cat. She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jake’s
side -- puts the mask over his face and --

148.

JAKE drags in breath after breath. He looks up at Neytiri,
studying him as she holds him -- seeing his human body for
the first time.
Jake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue
of her skin. There eyes meet across the glass of the mask -together, separate. Worldless.

I See you, Jakesully.
JAKE
I See you, Tsu’tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.
TSU’TEY
Are the people safe?
JAKE
They’re safe.
Tsu’tey weakly clutches his severed queue.
TSU’TEY
I can never ride again, or bond with my
woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa. I can
not lead the People. You will lead them,
Jakesully.
JAKE
No. I’m not officer material.
TSU’TEY
It is decided. Now do the duty of
Olo’eyctan. Set my spirit free.
JAKE
I’m not killing you.
TSU’TEY
I am already dead.

149.

No.

JAKE

TSU’TEY
It is the way. And it is good. I will be
remembered -Tsu’tey’s voice is weak, but thick with emotion.
TSU’TEY
-- I fought with Toruk Macto, we were
brothers -- and he was my last shadow.
TSU’TEY’S HAND clasps with Jake’s in a fierce grip. Jake
draws his knife.
TSU’TEY’S POV -- Jake leans forward, blocking the sun.
HIS SHADOW falls across Tsu’tey.
JAKE
(Na’vi)
Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the
Mother Spirit.
By his movement, we know that he has ended Tsu’tey’s pain.
Jake’s eyes well with tears as he continues reciting the
prayer for the dead, and his Na’vi words carry over as we -DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. HELL’S GATE -DAY
Na’vi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of Hell’s
Gate.
Banshees roost on the roofs of the modules, and stingbats
flutter about, unimpeded. The SENTRY GUNS are silent, and
the GATES are open to the forest.
JAKE (V.O.)
A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen.
Max, Norm, and a few of the avatars hold AR’s as the
personnel of Hell’s Gate file up the cargo ramp of the
remaining shuttle. The evicted humans are sullen and angry,
like POW’s.
JAKE and NEYTIRI stand together, watching the departure of
the Sky People.
PARKER SELFRIDGE shuffles up the ramp. His eyes -- the eyes
of a lost soul -- meet JAKE’S. He disappears into the ship.

Children jump and squeal with laughter in the river.

THE WILLOWS glow softly. The entire Omaticaya clan is
gathered, seated in a prayer circle around the Mother Tree.
JAKE (V.O.)
I better wrap this up. There’s a funeral

was someone very close to me.

Earth, birthplace of the human race,


  
a species much like our own,


  
capable of great compassion


  
and great violence.


  
For in our quest to protect the humans,


  
a deeper revelation dawns.


  
Our worlds have met before.


  
- Newsflash from the BBC.
- Breaking news out of Shanghai.


  
There's been a major toxic spill
in the Shanghai factory district.


  
We're staying
on top of this developing story for you.


  
We will bring you
any new information as we get it.


  
NEST Seahawks approaching target.


  
Three minutes
until evacuation is complete, sir.


  
Chinese airspace has been locked
and sealed, one-mile radius.


  
All right, give NEST team the go.


  
Black Hawks, you're clear to land.


  
Ding-a-ling!
Come out and get your ice cream.


  
Any bad robot out there
better get ready for an ass-whupping.


  
For the last two years,
an advance team of new Autobots


  
has taken refuge here
under my command.


  
Arcees, get ready to launch.


  
We're locked and loaded.


  
Together, we form an alliance
with the humans,


  
a secret but brave squad of soldiers.


  
All right, listen up. China's cover story
on this one is "toxic spill."


  
They had to evac the area
for search and rescue.


  
This makes six enemy contacts
in eight months.


  
We gotta make sure this one does not
get out in the public eye, so keep it tight.


  
A classified strike team called NEST.


  
We hunt for what remains
of our Decepticon foes


  
hiding in different countries
around the globe.


  
Roll in Alpha through Echo now.


  
Move out! Let's go!


  
All right, Ironhide.
We got echoes. Vamos.


  
Steel stacks at 2 o'clock.


  
He's here. I smell him.


  
It's close. It's getting closer.


  
- Oh, no.
- What have you got?


  
Thermal ripple.


  
Right, everybody, be steady.
We're right on top of it.


  
Eagle niner!


  
I need an energy proton.


  
Panther 1, requesting fire mission now!


  
Gunships on station. Roll in hot!


  
Dog 1, now we are engaging.


  
We got a second Decepticon.


  
Arcee twins! Target coming your way!


  
I got him, I got him!


  
I screwed that up. I'm okay. I'm all right.


  
- This is combat, man.
- Total brain freeze, man.


  
What's wrong with you?


  
Bring in Sideswipe!


  
Clear a path!


  
Damn, I'm good!


  
Air support, we need Big Buddha
to deliver the drop now!


  
Cyclone 98, final attack hitting in 120.


  
Clear to drop in
five, four, three, two, one.


  
Autobots, I'm in pursuit!


  
Pull over!


  
Punk-ass Decepticon!


  
Any last words?


  
This is not your planet to rule!


  
The Fallen shall rise again.


  
That doesn't sound good.


  
Not today.


  
Come on, let's go! All hands on deck!


  
Frankie, Mojo, out!
Come on, kiddo, we're on a schedule.


  
Slow down, Dad. Why are you
in such a hurry to get rid of me?


  
- Did you rent the room out?
- No, I got other ideas for your room


  
and it rhymes with "home theater."


  
Look what I found.
It's your little baby booties.


  
- Ma.
- My little baby-bootie boy.


  
- You can't go.
- You see this, Dad? This is how


  
you're supposed to react
when the fruit of your loins


  
goes out into the cruel world
to fend for himself, okay?


  
Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal.
College, bummer!


  
You have to come home every holiday,
not just big ones.


  
You have to come home for Halloween.


  
Well, I can't
come home for Halloween, Mom.


  
- Well, then we'll come to you.
- You're not coming.


  
- No, we're not going anywhere.
- We'll dress up.


  
We'll be in costumes.
You'll never know it's us.


  
- You can't do that, Mom.
- Would you let the kid breathe,


  
for crying out loud? Come on. Go pack.


  
There's no way you're packed
for a month-long trip.


  
Come on, chop, chop!
Let's go. March, young lady.


  
- Dad.
- I love it when you call me "young lady,"


  
- you dirty old man.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.


  
- Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa!
- What?


  
I'm watching what you're doing, Dad.
It's not a rap video.


  
It's just like a coach thing.


  
That was
a really creepy move just now, Dad.


  
Look. You know, your mother and me
are really proud of you.


  
You're the first Witwicky
ever to go to college.


  
Now I'm crying again! This sucks!


  
You're gonna be okay, Ma.


  
You know, it's just going to be,


  
you know, hard for her to accept
that her boy's all grown up, you know,


  
going out to handle the world
on his own.


  
- You okay, Pop?
- Yeah.


  
Mojo, no dominating Frankie!


  
Get the hell off the couch,
you filthy beasts!


  
You'll see a lot of that in college, too.


  
- What are you talking about, Dad?
- There's gonna be a lot of women there.


  
Yeah, well,
I'm a one-woman kind of guy.


  
Look, Mikaela's the greatest,


  
but you gotta give each other
room to grow, okay?


  
You're no different
than any other couple your age.


  
Except we discovered
an alien race together.


  
How long you gonna be riding
that scooter?


  
Dad, listen, I know what the odds are.
We're the exception, okay?


  
Wait a second. Who could that be?


  
In two weeks, it could be Muffy.


  
Hey, beautiful.


  
- I'm breaking up with you, Sam.
- Really?


  
You sure?
I'm not hearing a lot of conviction.


  
Well, I am, okay? So, there's no reason
for me to come say good-bye to you.


  
Wow, you almost sounded serious
that time.


  
Guess what? I made you
a long-distance relationship kit.


  
Yeah, I got you a webcam,
so we can chat 24/7.


  
All Witwicky, all the time.


  
And I got you a couple souvenirs
from the event


  
that cannot be mentioned
on cell phones.


  
- Some mixes and candles and stuff.
- Sounds cute. I can't wait.


  
Hey! You want
the infamous D-Day shirt?


  
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?


  
Yeah. Of course, I kept it, Mikaela.


  
It's like my Super Bowl jersey.
I bled in this thing.


  
- Wow. You're pretty confident, huh?
- No, it's not that.


  
It's just that my low self-esteem's
at an all-time high.


  
You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?


  
You really should come with me.


  
They got cheap apartments
near campus.


  
Well, that's not gonna happen
until I get my man-child father,


  
fresh out of prison, back on his feet.


  
I heard that.
Where'd you put the clutch covers?


  
- Next to the camshafts.
- I love it when you say "camshafts."


  
Whisper it to me.


  
Camshafts.


  
Why can't I hate you?


  
It's my Witwicky charm.


  
Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.


  
I guess we're not breaking up.
I'll be over in 20.


  
Mikaela, I think a sliver of the Cube
got stuck on my shirt.


  
Sam?


  
There's a fire!


  
Dad, we got a fire!


  
Fire!


  
Ron, did you know
it was gonna be this hard?


  
Can you just stop?


  
Yeah, okay, I'll stop. You carry this shit!


  
- Wow.
- Do you know what?


  
- What?
- I don't want to go anywhere with you.


  
I don't wanna go to France with you.


  
I don't wanna go
around the corner with you.


  
- I'm going back inside.
- All right, fine.


  
I'll call you from Paris.


  
What is all the racket?


  
Sam?


  
Dad!


  
- What was that?
- That's the whole kitchen!


  
- Bumblebee... Oh, my...
- Bumblebee!


  
- 911.
- Bumblebee!


  
- Get in the garage. Go!
- What the freak just happened?


  
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Just go in the garage quietly, please.


  
Holy Mother!


  
- Oh, my God!
- Whatever.


  
Get in the garage now!


  
- Firemen! Fire fighters, over here!
- Dogs out! Get the dogs out!


  
This is it! Come on, you guys.
What are you waiting for?


  
My house is on fire!


  
...very important.
- What happened?


  
Come here. Listen, I need you to take
the Cube sliver and put it in your purse.


  
- What's going on?
- Just take it.


  
- Sam Witwicky? A word with you.
- Yes, Mom. Yeah.


  
- Hi, Mikaela. I have a bald spot.
- Hi.


  
- An old furnace, I think.
- From a waffle iron.


  
When you go, he goes. I cannot live
with a psychotic alien in my garage!


  
Judy... National security.


  
Look, if we stay quiet,
they're gonna take care of everything.


  
Just consider this
the official start of our remodel, okay?


  
Fine. If the government's paying,
I want a pool and a hot tub!


  
And I'm gonna skinny-dip
and you can't say shit about it!


  
- Yeah, you know you're in trouble.
- He still having voice problems?


  
He's playing it up.


  
Bee, I want to talk to you
about the college thing, okay?


  
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it


  
Hey, I'm not taking you with me.


  
I'm gonna wait outside, okay?


  
I meant to tell you about this earlier.


  
It's just that, you know...
Here's the thing.


  
Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars.


  
I know, and if it was up to me,
I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.


  
Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't
be living in my dad's garage.


  
I mean, you're suffocating in here.
You deserve better than this.


  
This is hard enough, man.
Don't make it harder.


  
Can you just look at me, please?


  
Come on, big guy.
Look, the guardian thing is done.


  
Okay? You did your job.
Look, I'm safe now.


  
You need to go be with
Optimus Prime and the others.


  
I just want to be normal, Bee.
That's why I'm going to college,


  
and I can't do that with you.


  
It's not the last time I'm gonna see you,
you know, Bee.


  
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.


  
But you'll always be my first car.


  
Love you, Bee.


  
Wow!


  
Between State Farm and the taxpayers,
we're all taken care of.


  
- You got dirt all over you.
- Stop. Stop.


  
- What?
- Stop, I'm okay.


  
Look.


  
So, you think you can make it through
those East Coast winters without me?


  
You're the best thing
to ever happen to me.


  
- And?
- And I'll do anything for you.


  
And?


  
- I think Sam's about to say the L-word.
- Let's go, kiddo!


  
Nice timing, Dad.


  
I adore you.


  
That's not the word that I want


  
- to hear right now.
- What are you talking about?


  
It's the same word as the other word.


  
- It's not the same word.
- Look, if I say the other word now


  
and you forced me to say it,
it won't mean anything, plus


  
you haven't said it either.
So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.


  
Yeah, but I haven't said it because guys
always run when you say it first.


  
Yeah, well, so do girls.
Especially girls like you, with options.


  
So, this is all part of your elaborate plan
to keep me interested?


  
- It can be.
- I hate that it's working.


  
Can I have a kiss?


  
We're going to make it work, I promise.


  
Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.


  
Retrieve it.


  
Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.


  
Bad-ass ice-cream truck
coming through.


  
- Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello!
- No, I don't...


  
- Hold up.
- Those are nice.


  
Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.


  
Yes, sir. Yeah!
Look here, it's my booty call right here!


  
- Time to get my sexy on with the green.
- Green? No, green is mine!


  
I call green!


  
- I got the green.
- That hurt, man.


  
It's supposed to hurt. It's an ass-kicking.


  
Present arms!


  
Director Galloway, what an honor.
I'd love to show you around,


  
but you gotta be
on the classified access list.


  
I am now. Presidential order, Major.


  
I got a message
for your classified space buddies!


  
You guys made a mess of Shanghai.


  
All right, so this is where
we communicate with the JCS


  
and this area serves
as the Autobots' hangar.


  
Secure link to JCS is up, Major.


  
Secure line to
the Pentagon is now open.


  
- General?
- Will, I saw the Shanghai op.


  
- We had a rough day out there.
- Yes, sir.


  
We have intel that I believe
warrants an immediate debrief.


  
Now with your permission,
I can't let you see him,


  
but I would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.


  
Proceed.


  
You gotta wonder,


  
if God made us in his image,
who made him?


  
General, our alliance
has countermanded


  
six Decepticon incursions this year,


  
each on a different continent.


  
They're clearly searching
around the world for something,


  
but last night's encounter
came with a warning.


  
"The Fallen shall rise again."


  
"The Fallen." Meaning what?


  
Origin unknown.
The only recorded history of our race


  
was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with its destruction.


  
Excuse me!


  
With this so-called AllSpark
now destroyed,


  
why hasn't the enemy left the planet
like you thought they would?


  
Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.


  
The President just appointed him liaison.


  
Well, I guess I didn't get that memo.


  
Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me. Coming through.


  
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.


  
After all the damage in Shanghai,


  
the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.


  
Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot
Cooperation Act,


  
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.


  
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.


  
It would absolutely bring
more harm than good.


  
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?


  
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side


  
in the field for two years.


  
We've shed blood,
sweat and precious metal together.


  
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.


  
Don't tempt me.


  
And the newest members of your team.


  
- Easy.
- I understand they arrived here


  
after you sent a message into space,


  
an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.


  
Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. It was vetted right here.


  
And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team


  
has always been above reproach.


  
Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President


  
that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.


  
Now, what do we know so far?


  
We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,


  
is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,


  
is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,


  
surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.


  
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark


  
is locked in an electromagnetic vault


  
here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.


  
Decepticons, we have located the shard.


  
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,


  
well, there's only one clear conclusion!


  
You! The Autobots!


  
They're here to hunt you!


  
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?


  
"The Fallen shall rise again"?


  
It sounds to me
like something's coming.


  
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served


  
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,


  
will you leave peacefully?


  
Freedom is your right. If you make
that request, we will honor it.


  
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.


  
What if we leave and you're wrong?


  
That's a good question.


  
Oh, my gosh! Look at this place!


  
I feel smarter already.


  
- Ron, can you smell it?
- Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.


  
- Hey, cheapo!
- Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff.


  
Just go ahead and check out your room.


  
Yeah, go.


  
- Hey.
- Hey.


  
- You must be Sam, right? I'm Leo.
- Hey.


  
So, I already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?


  
- That side.
- I already chose that side.


  
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.


  
Yeah, see,
you're trying to see if I'm a normal guy.


  
I'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.


  
Balanced, unmedicated,
nothing under the crawl space.


  
Good personal hygiene,
won't stab me in my sleep.


  
No criminal record, won't steal anything.


  
- Including girlfriends.
- Especially girlfriends.


  
- You got a girlfriend?
- I do. You?


  
No, not a chance. You a techie?


  
Sweet! Sharsky,
Fassbinder, where we at?


  
- Server's almost online, Leo.
- Network's up and running.


  
Beautiful, that's what I like to hear.


  
That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder,
my IT gurus.


  
Welcome to my empire, bro,
TheRealEffingDeal. com.


  
That's me, I'm sure you've heard of it.


  
- No, I haven't.
- Well, that sucks.


  
- What is all this for?
- See where I'm going, bro.


  
Look, call me gross,
I want to be a baby billionaire.


  
Kitten calendars.
That's where I started. Look at me now.


  
Got to have dreams, bro.


  
Leo! We got
some brand-new Shanghai vid!


  
Post it, baby! Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ!


  
- What's "FTJ"?
- "Fuel the Jet."


  
Fuel the Jet, bro.


  
FTJ. FTJ, legit!


  
Did you see that? Did you see that?


  
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says "gas leak."


  
Don't believe the hype, bro.


  
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.


  
Yeah, I saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing


  
and they came down and toasted
this woman, and she was like...


  
- It looks fake to me.
- Dude, it's not fake.


  
The Internet is pure truth.
Video doesn't lie.


  
- It looks fake.
- No, man, I've seen them.


  
- They're, like, these robots...
- Look, look, it's fake.


  
Anybody could do it
on any computer, okay?


  
And I wasn't there,


  
- so I can't comment or speculate.
- No.


  
"Comment or speculate"?
And we're supposed to cohabitate?


  
No, listen, okay?
Don't be sucking the sack, bro!


  
- Which sack?
- The ball sack.


  
Dude, what kind of tool are you?


  
Mainstream media sack.
They're lying to us, all right?


  
- It's aliens, man.
- Okay, okay.


  
Follow me.


  
Leo, bad news!


  
We just got scooped.
The video's already up on GFR.


  
Fassbinder!


  
Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.


  
"Effing" was my F-ing idea
and he stole it!


  
He's been linking to my site
and thieving hits forever.


  
By the way, I read your file.
I'm poor, you're poor.


  
We're gonna fix that, all right?
You work for me now.


  
I work for you now? That's incredible.


  
It's first day of college,
I got a career in a dinky Internet firm


  
with a boss who is made up
of just pure champion stuff.


  
Are you mocking
my life's work, Samuel?


  
That's your one warning patrolling,
dude. Don't make me


  
have Fassbinder hack your financial aid,
'cause I'll do it!


  
Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little
intense in my room. Can I switch out?


  
Sad face, 312. No switching, no trading.
Let's turn that frown upside down, okay?


  
- Oh, here we go.
- We made it. Hi.


  
It's just like Hogwarts.


  
- Hi.
- Is this co-ed?


  
This is a co-ed dorm.


  
- You guys want to meet my roommates?
- Yeah.


  
Some real swell guys.


  
- Here's Leo.
- We're the Witwickys.


  
- I'm Leo.
- I'm Judy.


  
Hey, you have a great son, you really do.


  
- Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?
- Yeah, he's real sweet, Ma.


  
What is that in your hand, by the way?


  
I got this at the bake sale for the
environment that those boys are having.


  
You know, you don't often see
white boys with the dreadlocks.


  
- Mom?
- Yeah, it's 100% pure,


  
Hawaiian green for the environment.


  
- How many of these have you eaten?
- Drop it.


  
- What is this?
- Yeah, they baked it with reefer in it.


  
- No, it's...
- Please, give me...


  
Hey! It's my cheat day.
I can eat what I want.


  
I'm going to freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad.


  
Please do something right now.


  
I can eat all the fricking brownies I want!


  
Come on, let's go.


  
I'm sorry and you're welcome.


  
We call it the "Hot Freshman 55."


  
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and
stacked the dorm with pretty Betties.


  
Is... Is so nice...


  
Oh, my God. That's her. She's coming.
She sees me, she sees me.


  
She's tied for number one
on my to-do list.


  
Do not bird-dog my quail, you hear me?


  
Pretty girls! Hey, you.
My son lives in this dorm.


  
You should go make friends with him.
He's Sam.


  
Glad she ain't my mama!


  
And he recently had his cherry popped!


  
He didn't know I was in the house!
I heard it all!


  
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Here he is!


  
He would get in my closet
and dress up as Boy Spice!


  
- Hey, and his car is a talking robot!
- No, like the GPS. OnStar!


  
- OnStar.
- Frisbee!


  
No, Dad! Dad, you just gonna
let her run around the school?


  
- Give it! Mine, mine, mine!
- Hey! Crazy!


  
- You want it?
- I want it.


  
Judy, Judy, just... Just put it down.


  
- You gotta control your mother.
- I don't know who this woman is.


  
Hey, Professor, I'd do anything for an A.


  
All right, Grace Slick. We got
some snacks in the car. Let's go.


  
- Did you get the booties? All right.
- Yes, Dad, I got the booties!


  
I'm upside down!


  
Black Lion X-Ray,
this is Black Lion Tango.


  
We have activation of motion sensors
on the western perimeter fence.


  
Breach at B-14.


  
Go, go, go, go!


  
The shard's gone.


  
Contact!


  
Take it down!


  
- Which way?
- Shoot left!


  
Knock it down!


  
First frat party's the game changer.
Boys, we're hunting in the wild now.


  
So, get your game faces on.


  
I can't stay long.
I have a webcam date with my girlfriend.


  
- That's so cool!
- No, it's not.


  
While he's making out
with his MacBook,


  
I'm gonna be getting
my Spitzy freaky freak on.


  
- Let's roll.
- She's hot.


  
Bro, we're hunting!


  
- See you, darling.
- Bye, Dad.


  
Okay.


  
This is our first live chat date.
I've never done it before.


  
I'm kind of nervous.


  
- Are you okay?
- No.


  
I was getting a napkin for my drink.


  
Thanks. Cheers.


  
- It's Sam, right?
- Yeah.


  
- I wanna dance.
- What, like... Like dancing?


  
Like a pairing? Like a duo?
Like a coupling?


  
'Cause I'm in a permanently semi...
I'm in a relationship, kind of...


  
- Relax. I just want to have some fun.
- Wanna have some fun?


  
Yeah, okay. Let's play some checkers.
You can sit over there and...


  
Oh, my...


  
So, how about tonight
you pretend I'm your girlfriend


  
and I pretend that you're my boyfriend?


  
Hey! Who drove
the freaking yellow Camaro?


  
There is a car on the lawn!


  
What are you doing?


  
Houston, we have a problem.


  
- What is it?
- Freshman!


  
- Yeah?
- Is that your car in our bushes?


  
No, there's a friend of mine,
he just went to get you a tighter shirt.


  
There isn't a tighter shirt! We checked.


  
Now how about
I park my foot in your ass?


  
- What size shoe do you wear?
- Yeah?


  
- Hold on.
- You wanna try?


  
- I'll back it up right now.
- Get him out of here.


  
You have a ride?
Bro, why are you holding out on us?


  
I've only known you 17 hours.


  
This is gonna really change our lives.
You have no idea.


  
- I love Camaros.
- I can't do this right now, okay?


  
- Don't be a wimp.
- Oh, God!


  
- My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
- Yeah?


  
Fuel-injected.
The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.


  
We shouldn't stare...


  
I mean, share stories
with each other at all.


  
Come on, Sam. Just one ride.


  
Your cheatin' heart


  
Don't. Don't!


  
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky


  
- Is your radio broken?
- No, my concentration is.


  
We're not cheating.


  
Not yet.


  
Is something wrong here?


  
God! You okay?


  
She's mighty, mighty


  
I really don't know what to tell you.
This car has a lot of problems. A lot...


  
Oh, God! It's in my mouth!


  
Are you okay? I got Wetnaps.


  
I got Wetnaps for your face! Hold on!


  
I... I'm so sorry!


  
What are you doing?


  
You won't give me a day, huh?


  
- You won't give me one day in college?
- I'm sorry, Sam,


  
but the last fragment of the AllSpark
was stolen.


  
Like what? Like Decepticons stole it?


  
We placed it under human protection
at your government's request,


  
but I'm here for your help, Sam,


  
because your leaders believe we
brought vengeance upon your planet.


  
Perhaps they are right.


  
That is why they must be reminded by
another human of the trust we share.


  
- This isn't my war.
- Not yet,


  
but I fear it soon will be.


  
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron.


  
Whole generations lost.


  
I know, and I want to help you, I do,


  
but I am not some alien ambassador,
you know?


  
I'm a normal kid with normal problems.


  
I am where I'm supposed to be.


  
I'm sorry. I...


  
I really am.


  
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing.


  
You're Optimus Prime.
You don't need me.


  
We do, more than you know.


  
Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact,
bearing 214, and possible hostile,


  
confirmed for
Project Deep Six Drop Point.


  
- What do you got?
- SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet,


  
diving fast.


  
Never seen anything
dive that deep that fast.


  
- Man battle stations.
- Chief of the watch, man battle stations!


  
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead two-thirds.


  
- Left full rudder, two-thirds.
- Dive, go deep.


  
The nets protecting NBE One
are screaming, sir.


  
That is 9,300 fathoms down.
And no confirmed DSRVs on site?


  
- None, sir.
- Then, people, we've got a problem!


  
Need parts! Kill the little one!


  
The shard make Energon!


  
Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts,
and they're coming up fast!


  
- Sound collision alarm.
- Left hard rudder.


  
Five hundred feet.


  
Angel Six,
we got six hostiles coming up.


  
- Collision imminent port side.
- One hundred feet.


  
Brace for impact.


  
Starscream, I'm home.


  
Lord Megatron, I was so relieved
to hear of your resurrection.


  
You left me to die
on that pathetic insect planet.


  
Only to help spawn our new army.
The Fallen decrees it!


  
After all, in your absence,
someone had to take command.


  
- So disappointing.
- Hatchlings! Hatchlings! Careful, fragile!


  
Even in death,
there is no command but mine.


  
My master, I failed you on Earth.


  
The AllSpark is destroyed
and without it, our race will perish.


  
You have much to learn, my disciple.
The Cube was merely a vessel.


  
Its power, its knowledge,
can never be destroyed.


  
- It can only transform.
- How is that possible?


  
It has been absorbed
by the human child.


  
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.


  
Well, then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body!


  
And you will, my apprentice, in time.


  
For millennia, I have dreamed
of my return to that wretched planet


  
where I, too, was once betrayed
by the Primes I called my brothers.


  
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now, only one remains.


  
Optimus! He protects the boy.


  
Then the boy will lead us to him


  
- and revenge will be ours.
- Yes.


  
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.


  
Without more Energon,
the hatchlings will keep dying.


  
Space. Time. Gravity.


  
- Thank you.
- Finish that for me.


  
We're going on a journey together,
you and I, today.


  
All you eager, nubile, young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.


  
And I shall be your consort, your guide,


  
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.


  
Welcome to Astronomy 101.


  
For what do we know about the stars?


  
Virgo, the virgin.


  
Orion, the great hunter.


  
These are no mere twinkling diamonds
for lovely maidens to wish upon.


  
No, they are dynamos


  
filled with a throbbing,
savage and pent-up energy!


  
Behold the work of Albert Einstein,
a professor once, like moi.


  
- Energy equals mass...
- What you doing?


  
Put your hand down.
Put your hand down.


  
Young man, there are no questions


  
until I've reached
the climax of my lecture.


  
I just finished your book and there's
only one problem. Einstein's wrong.


  
Energy does equal
mass times the velocity


  
of light squared in this dimension,


  
but what about the other 17? We haven't
even talked about the other 17.


  
Clear example.


  
Break down the elemental components
of Energon,


  
assume a constant decay rate
and extrapolate for each of the...


  
Fourteen galactic convergences it took


  
the Sentinel Prime expedition
to receive an... Echo on its signal,


  
you wind up with a formula
for inter-dimensional energy increase


  
that mass and light alone
can't possibly explain.


  
Come on, guys, I can't be
the only one in the class who...


  
Young man, I will not be
punk'd in front of the dean.


  
No, this is my universe here.


  
Do you understand?
I am the alpha and the omega.


  
- Get out of my class!
- Yes, sir.


  
Anyone else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?


  
Hi, Bones! Hi. Hi.
You're such a good boy.


  
What a good boy, you are.


  
Hey, Bones. Are you hungry?


  
Come on, check that out.


  
There you go.


  
- Yes, Samuel?
- Hello? Mikaela?


  
I can't believe you're gonna stand me up
on our first web chat date.


  
- Something just happened to me, okay?
- What, you finally hit puberty?


  
No, no, no. Stop laughing.
This is serious. Okay.


  
Remember I was telling you
about my great-great-grandfather,


  
Archibald Witwicky? Remember?


  
Watch it, watch it, watch... No!
Okay, remember how I was telling you...


  
Okay. Can you stop?
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!


  
Mikaela, okay,


  
my great-great-grandfather
went on this Arctic mission, right?


  
And he saw Megatron.
Megatron zapped him,


  
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols. Okay.


  
Well, now I'm seeing them, too.
Excuse me.


  
I just read a 903-page astronomy book
in 32.6 seconds.


  
I had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.


  
I am seeing symbols ever since I...


  
- Since what?
- Ever since I touched the Cube splinter.


  
- Do you have it?
- Yeah, I have it.


  
- It's in the shop safe. It's fine.
- Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?


  
- Don't touch it.
- I'm not gonna touch it.


  
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away.


  
- No one knows where it is.
- I do!


  
You're hot, but you ain't too bright.


  
There we go. Yeah, that'll work.


  
Damn it! Son of a bitch!


  
What are you looking at, slobber puss?


  
What the... This place is
a freaking house of horrors!


  
Pain... It hurts...


  
Hold on.


  
Right to five, then...


  
Is that the best you got, huh?
Is that the best you can do?


  
What are you doing here,
you little freak?


  
That's my eye, you crazy bitch!


  
- You gonna talk now?
- I seek knowledge from the Cube.


  
- The Fallen demands me!
- What knowledge?


  
You got the shard, I need the shard.
Give me the shard. I need the shard.


  
They're gonna whack me!
I'm gonna be dead without that shard!


  
Easy, warrior goddess,
I'm just a little salvage-scrap drone!


  
- And I'm your worst nightmare.
- Hey, hey, hey!


  
- What the hell was that?
- I'll tell you later,


  
just not on an open phone line, okay?


  
I'm gonna get on a plane right now


  
and I'll be there later this afternoon.
Just be careful, Sam.


  
And have any strangers given you
anything suspicious to carry on today?


  
Yeah, a live bomb!


  
- No.
- Good.


  
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots!


  
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity, eastern United States, sir!


  
- As in how many?
- Unclear, sir.


  
Well, get clear.


  
The Autobots are on the move,
splitting into two teams, sir.


  
They're not answering our calls


  
and they're heading to
New York and Philadelphia.


  
All right, full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!


  
Move it!


  
Let's go!


  
Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia.


  
Alicia, mi amor, can I interest you
in an 18-inch Zookeeper's special?


  
Extra-large, triple cheese,
with every known animal as a topping.


  
Basically, I've got,
like, 18 inches of meat.


  
Unless you're vegetarian.
All right. It's cool. I am, too.


  
- Sam home?
- Sam? I think he died,


  
but why don't we check?


  
- Here we are.
- Hey!


  
You ever have a song stuck
in your head? It's like


  
the worst song ever,
but you can't help to whistle it or sing it


  
'cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats
itself, repeats itself, repeats itself?


  
Kitten calendar,
kitten calendar, kitten calendar,


  
- kitten calendar...
- Dude, what the eff?


  
I know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.


  
Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head.


  
Now it's on the walls.
Everything is good.


  
This is the part that...


  
Okay, what were you saying?


  
Alice, I'm horrified you had to see this.
Let's go.


  
Get out.


  
Wait, wait, wait!
Can I just sit and watch?


  
I'll... I'll eat my pizza quietly.


  
Sam, I knew there was
something special about you.


  
Really?


  
And I know you know what happens


  
when two people in the know
get together.


  
They're genuinely amazing in bed.


  
Thank you.


  
All right, listen, hold on! Boundaries.


  
- Flag on the play. Okay. I'm very ticklish.
- We have needs, Sam. Relax.


  
Jeez!


  
What about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?


  
- You are very aggressive.
- Just relax.


  
You want some turkey meatloaf?


  
Sam?


  
- Mikaela!
- Is that your girlfriend?


  
Ex.


  
Mikaela! Wait!


  
I can explain...


  
Sam, your bed buddy, Alice...


  
All right, come on.


  
- She's coming!
- She's an alien robot! You gotta move.


  
- Is this real?
- Just run!


  
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I can't believe
I almost had sex with her in my dream!


  
I can tell
that you really missed me a lot, Sam!


  
- Look, it's not my fault, okay?
- It's not your fault?


  
Listen! Listen, I'm a victim!


  
- You were a victim? Of what?
- Yeah.


  
- Of what, a little 80-pound girl?
- Of... Of molestation.


  
It was like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox!


  
You didn't have to put your tongue
in her mouth!


  
- I didn't! Look!
- You did!


  
You ever had your stomach tongued by
a mountain ox with a five-foot tongue?


  
It's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela?
And it smelled like... Like diesel!


  
- Like a diesel-y tinge to it!
- You're such a little girl!


  
We're gonna have
10 seconds of silence right now.


  
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.


  
You can't give me the silent treatment!
You know what?


  
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.
You have three seconds left.


  
You know what?
You can give me the silent treatment


  
all you want,
but you can't keep me from talking.


  
- What were you gonna say?
- I hope you had a lot of fun,


  
because this, this is over.


  
She violated your orifice
with her nasty alien probe?


  
She did it? She went in there?
All her little embryo alien babies


  
are gestating and hatching inside of you.
They're growing right now, probably!


  
You need to vomit it right now.
Yak it! Yak it right now!


  
Who are you?


  
I'm Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
Okay? I'm the key to this.


  
The aliens,
they want me 'cause of my site.


  
Whoa, guys, right there!


  
Run!


  
Mikaela!


  
Come on! We gotta move!


  
It's a bomb!


  
You've got to get that box!


  
- This way.
- What? Hey! Let me out, let me out!


  
Oh, my God, you know how to
hot-wire a car? That's so hot!


  
Drive, drive, drive!
She's right there! She's right there!


  
Come on, come on, come on.


  
Go! Go! Go! Back up the car!


  
Now!


  
Tongue!


  
Oh, my God!


  
Kiss this, bitch!


  
Drive, drive, drive.


  
Okay, so what else
don't I know, all right?


  
Since you guys forgot to mention
some minor details.


  
That thing you saw back there,
that was the little baby...


  
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Sam!


  
Sam!


  
- Sam!
- Hold on!


  
- Pull me up!
- Hold on!


  
Sam, get back in!


  
I don't want to die!
We're gonna die! Oh, my God!


  
Jesus! Jesus!


  
Come here, boy.


  
Closer.


  
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.


  
You remember me, don't you?


  
I did what you said, okay?
Just don't hurt us.


  
Shut up!


  
Sam!


  
Yeah! Yes, yes.


  
It feels good to grab your flesh!


  
I am going to kill you slowly, painfully,


  
but first, we have
some delicate work to do.


  
How I could snap your limbs off!


  
Doctor, examine this alien specimen.


  
I'll scan you.
Let's take a look at your face.


  
I'm the doctor. The odd job. Information!


  
Yeah!


  
Beseeching my shard!


  
Easy or tough way?


  
- There they are.
- That's what I'm seeing in my head.


  
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.


  
We must have the brain on the table!


  
- Chop, chop!
- Brain?


  
What does he mean by my brain?


  
Well, you have something on your mind,
something I need.


  
Hold on. I know you're pissed.
I know you're pissed


  
because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.


  
If somebody tried to kill me,
I'd be upset, too.


  
I think that we have an opportunity here


  
to start anew
and develop our relationship


  
and see where it leads us, okay?


  
So, you just call Doctor Inspector off
and let's just talk for five seconds!


  
Wait, wait, wait!


  
- Come on! Go, go!
- Sam!


  
Go, go, go!


  
Sam!


  
Run!


  
Go, go, go, go!


  
Here he comes!


  
Hide, Sam!


  
Weak!


  
Puny! Waste of metal!


  
Junkyard crap!


  
Decepticons!


  
Come here, boy.


  
There is another source of
Energon hidden on this planet.


  
The boy could lead us to it.


  
Optimus!


  
Is the future of our race not worth
a single human life?


  
- Up! Get up!
- You'll never stop at one!


  
I'll take you all on!


  
Piece of tin!


  
Sam! Where are you?


  
No!


  
You're so weak!


  
The last Prime is dead!


  
Sam, run. Run.


  
Autobots, attack!


  
Bumblebee, get them out of here!


  
This is Lennox.


  
- That went well.
- We've lost the boy, Master.


  
The Autobots
must be shielding their signals.


  
I can't even rely on you
to swat a simple insect?


  
- One insect among seven billion!
- Shut up!


  
He could be anywhere.


  
Then we will force them
to find him for us!


  
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.


  
No more disguises. No mercy!


  
The time has come
for my master's arrival.


  
Decepticons, mobilize. It is time.


  
Speaking French is so exciting!


  
Oh, God, who is this?


  
Hello? I mean, bonsoir!


  
- What? Who is this?
- Where is the boy?


  
For Pete's sakes. I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth-breathing.


  
Jeez!


  
You are invading my space.
I'm gonna have to drop you.


  
Would you get out of here?


  
I didn't come all the way across
the ocean to eat a plate of snails.


  
I want to try new things.


  
Looks like Canadian goose poop.


  
It's nasty.


  
Revenge is mine.


  
Yeah!


  
...definitely not a plane...


  
Look, carriers don't just sink.


  
...a horrible accident or a terrorist
attack or worse...


  
Negative. NORAD confirmed,


  
projectile came from beyond our
atmosphere, inbound at 30,000 knots.


  
Citizens of the human hive,


  
your leaders have withheld the truth.


  
You are not alone in this universe.


  
We have lived among you, hidden,


  
but no more.


  
As you've seen,
we can destroy your cities at will,


  
unless you turn over this boy.


  
If you resist us, we will destroy
the world as you know it.


  
What we're hearing
from the German government


  
is that the world broadcast
was a satellite hacking.


  
The military has just told us they have
assumed Condition Delta,


  
which is the highest level
we have been at since 9/11.


  
President Obama
is being flown to a bunker


  
somewhere in the middle
of the United States


  
in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.


  
The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes
down off the East Coast, all hands lost.


  
Worldwide casualties
are in the neighborhood of 7,000,


  
but that number could climb.


  
It's still too early to tell.


  
What we need to ask now is,
"Who and why?"


  
The FBI is still trying to locate
the boy, Sam Witwicky.


  
We believe they have information
about the attacks.


  
The FBI, CIA and Interpol


  
are all seeking the cooperation
of worldwide law enforcement.


  
You need to listen to this, man.
You gotta check this out.


  
- They have a traffic-camera spotting...
- They have a picture of me, man.


  
We're dead, bro.
FBI, CIA, we are wanted fugitives now!


  
I just need you to focus


  
- for one minute, man.
- Just stop.


  
This thing has blown up
to a whole other level, all right?


  
You know what? Give me this thing.
They can track us.


  
- Do you see this?
- What?


  
They can track us?
Like, satellite track us?


  
Okay, I'm not even with you guys!


  
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping...


  
- Enough is...
- Yo, Leo!


  
This thing's gonna
give me a heart attack, I swear.


  
- That's 'cause you is a wuss.
- You guys forced me into that car, right?


  
I think he's scared.


  
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do
with this shrimp taco?


  
Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk


  
and then nobody gonna know nothing,
know what I mean?


  
- Not in my trunk.
- Yo, bumper cars? I'm hearing you.


  
Okay? I'm right here and I can hear you!


  
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?


  
I've had a hell of a day!


  
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?


  
Go whine to your boyfriend!


  
Listen, Sam, I know what I'm gonna do,
man. Look, I'm just going to go


  
to the authorities and tell them the truth.


  
Like, I had nothing to do with this.


  
- So, I'm not an accomplice.
- Hey, you wanted this, right?


  
You wanted the real deal?
Well, that's what this is.


  
Wake up! You're in the middle of it!


  
You want to run? Go ahead!
No one's stopping you.


  
Stop complaining.


  
What is the meaning of this?


  
You dare point a gun at me?


  
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!


  
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!


  
- Tell them to lower their weapons!
- Tell them first.


  
Tell them to lower their weapons.


  
Major, there's nothing I can do.
Talk to him.


  
Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.


  
You are to cease
anti-Decepticon operations


  
and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.


  
No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.


  
Well, I'll see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff


  
and I will raise you
a President of the United States.


  
I have operational command now.


  
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores


  
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.


  
The secret is out!


  
This is our war now and we will win it
as we always have,


  
with a coordinated military strategy.


  
This fool is terribly misinformed.


  
You're gonna need every asset
that you've got.


  
What we need is to draw up battle plans


  
while we explore
every possible diplomatic solution.


  
Like what, handing over the kid?


  
All options are being considered.


  
Whatever the Decepticons are after,
this is just the start.


  
- There is no negotiating with them.
- I'm ordering you to stand down.


  
You won't be needing this anymore.
Get your assets back to base!


  
And take that pile of scrap metal back
to Diego Garcia.


  
Let's go!


  
I really don't like that dude.
He's an asshole.


  
Autobots, report to hangar for transport.


  
- Ironhide, we should leave this planet.
- That's not what Optimus would want.


  
There's nothing
that you could have done.


  
- You okay?
- Yeah.


  
Bee, if you hate me, I understand.


  
I messed up. I'm sorry.


  
Young fella, you are the person
I care about most in my life.


  
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.


  
He's dead because of me. He came
here to protect me and he's dead.


  
There's some things
you just can't change.


  
So, his sacrifice for us would
not have been in vain. Hallelujah!


  
I'm gonna make it right.
I'm going to turn myself in.


  
We... We've got to stick together.


  
- You're not going to do that.
- Yes, I am.


  
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out in one day!


  
- You two...
- Huh?


  
Hey, you know the glyphs?


  
These? The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head?


  
That's old school, yo.
That's, like... That's Cybertronian.


  
That's some serious stuff, right there.


  
They gotta mean something,
like a message or like a map.


  
Like a map to an Energon source!


  
- Can you read this?
- Read?


  
No. We don't really do much reading.
Not so much.


  
If you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can.


  
Look who came sashaying back!


  
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him.


  
I had a bit
of a mild panic attack earlier, right?


  
That's 'cause you're a pussy.


  
I think I'm allowed that,
considering what I've been through.


  
I heard you have a problem.


  
- I think I know someone who can help.
- Who?


  
Robo-Warrior.


  
This guy, Robo-Warrior,


  
everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.


  
One time we revenge-hacked his site


  
and maybe I saw some
of your alien drawings or whatever.


  
This is it. Yep.


  
Deli. Good front!


  
All right, wait here.
I'll give you the go/no go. All right?


  
Number 42, we got your kishka, knish,


  
kasha-varnishka
and kreplach combo right here.


  
Cash only. Who's next?


  
I told you to cure the lox in the brine
and then smoke it.


  
Ma, you want me
to cut my hand off, or what?


  
You... You ruined
a beautiful piece of fish, you retard!


  
I'm like a ninja with a blade.
It's an art form.


  
Give me your money. Get out of here!


  
Hey, Sal! Watch your reach, huh?
Take a number, young man.


  
Robo-Warrior.


  
- Know him?
- I never heard of him.


  
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal. com?


  
You must be talking about that
amateur-hour blog operation


  
- with Game Boy-level security.
- Robo-Warrior.


  
It's him! It's him!
That's the guy right there! That's him!


  
No.


  
- You got to be kidding me.
- All right, meat store's closed!


  
- Everybody out! Out, right now!
- When he says to go,


  
- you go.
- That means you, lady, right now.


  
- Wait a minute. You know this guy?
- We're old friends.


  
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven,


  
got the kibosh, disbanded.


  
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.


  
All 'cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend.


  
- Look at her now, so mature.
- Moron! Where's the whitefish?


  
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig.


  
- Yakov!
- What?


  
You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around!


  
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?


  
- It's my dream.
- Help her out.


  
You live with your mama?


  
No, my mama lives with me.
It's a big difference.


  
They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.


  
- Yeah, I know.
- And NBE One's still kicking, huh?


  
How did that happen? Don't answer.


  
I don't know what you're hiding,
but I don't want anything to do with it.


  
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
I got bagels to schmear. Vanish.


  
Can you give me five seconds?
Look, hold on, I need your help.


  
Really? You need my help?


  
I need...
Look, I am slowly losing my mind.


  
Okay, I had a little crab-bot,


  
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain


  
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!


  
And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?


  
You said it projected images
off your brain?


  
- Right.
- Meat locker, now!


  
Dead pigs.


  
What you're about to see is top secret.


  
Do not tell my mother.


  
- Swine flu. Not good.
- Now you know.


  
Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there's a story behind it.


  
Sad little story.


  
An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?


  
Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?


  
Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.


  
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.


  
Okay, Cube-brain.


  
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?


  
Where'd you get these?


  
Before I got fired,
I poached S-7's crown jewel,


  
over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.


  
The Transformers,
they've been here a long, long time.


  
How do I know?


  
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings


  
in ancient ruins all over the world.


  
China. Egypt. Greece.


  
Shot in 1932.


  
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?


  
- Yeah.
- Same ones over here, right?


  
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?


  
Aliens. And I think some of them stayed.


  
Check this out. Project Black Knife.


  
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along.


  
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.


  
I pleaded on my knees with S-to investigate it,


  
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal,


  
that I was obsessed.


  
Me. Can you imagine that?


  
Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.


  
- On Earth. Another source?
- On Earth.


  
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head, would lead him there.


  
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?


  
No, no, no, the source is before them.


  
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them.


  
It's before them.


  
- So, it comes before them.
- Correct.


  
Well, then we're porked,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon.


  
I mean,
I'm not on speaking terms with them.


  
Actually, I am.


  
Let me out!


  
- This is going to be a little bit sad.
- Open it.


  
I will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!


  
Hey, behave!


  
- What is it, a Decepticon?
- Yeah.


  
- And you're training him?
- I'm trying to.


  
I spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,


  
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.


  
Do you want a throwdown,
you pubic 'fro-head?


  
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye, you know,


  
but, if you're a good boy,
then I'm not gonna torch your other eye.


  
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.


  
Just tell me
what these symbols are, please.


  
All right.


  
I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.


  
I don't read it, but these guys...


  
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?


  
- Is this they?
- Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.


  
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something. I don't know what.


  
Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll
translate those symbols for you.


  
- And I know where to find them.
- Show us.


  
Yeah.


  
The closest one's in Washington.


  
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
Land of dreams in there.


  
All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut.


  
- Hold those.
- What is that?


  
What? I wear them when I'm in a funk.


  
So does Giambi, Jeter.
It's a baseball thing. Okay.


  
Watches synchronized,
sharp mind and empty bladder.


  
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.


  
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.


  
It's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.


  
Tricks the polygraph every time.


  
Okay. Now, let's get this show
on the road.


  
No, listen, I can't do this.


  
I'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
I'm not gonna do this.


  
- Guards have guns. I don't want to die.
- Kid, kid, kid.


  
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.


  
Now look into my eyes
and tighten up that sphincter.


  
The museum is now closing.


  
Yo, baba! Bad news, bro!
Ran out of toilet paper!


  
You got any out here?
Please tell me you do.


  
Sir! I suggest you get in there.
The museum is closed!


  
Listen, man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.


  
All right? Thumper dumper.
I got to go. All right.


  
Sir, you are a grown,
naked man around children.


  
- Pull your pants up and exit the building.
- I'm not going anywhere.


  
- You got that paper, right, sir?
- You should be embarrassed.


  
This is a family museum, sir.


  
What is going on here?


  
How many times can you get tased
in the nuts before you can't have kids?


  
You are an amateur, man,
a rank amateur.


  
We just downed five guards.
Five guards.


  
- Get your stuff and get out of here.
- Give me a second here.


  
I got to get the tracker, all right.


  
- Be good.
- I'm claustrophobic.


  
Look, look. Follow him. Follow him.
He knows where he's going.


  
- He knows something.
- What?


  
He knows something.


  
You got what I got?


  
- Yeah.
- Blackbird.


  
There he is.


  
This guy's a legend,
like the Chairman of the Board!


  
Yo, freshman, point the shard
and watch the magic happen.


  
Shit. It's a Decepticon!


  
- Decepticon?
- Decepticon?


  
Behind the MiG now!


  
What sort of hideous
mausoleum is this?


  
Answer me, pawns and knaves!


  
Show yourselves
or suffer my infinite wrath!


  
You little spinal-cord-based organisms!


  
Bugger it!


  
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire!


  
Prepare for remote systems override!


  
- I tell you, this guy did not age well.
- I don't think he's gonna hurt us.


  
I command these doors to open.


  
Fire! I said, fire!


  
Bollocks!


  
- Damn these worthless parts.
- Wait a second!


  
ltchy, wretched rust in my arse!


  
The museum is going to be very angry.
Very angry.


  
We gotta catch that plane.


  
- Right. I'm on a mission.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!


  
- What do you want?
- Look, we just want to talk!


  
I have no time to talk. I'm on a mission.


  
I'm a mercenary doom-bringer.
What planet am I on?


  
- Earth.
- Earth?


  
Terrible name for a planet.
Might as well call it "Dirt." Planet "Dirt."


  
Tell me,
is that robot civil war still going on?


  
- Who's winning?
- The Decepticons.


  
- Well, I changed sides to the Autobots.
- What do you mean, changed sides?


  
It's a choice.
It's an intensely personal decision.


  
So much negativity.
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?


  
You mean you don't have to work


  
for those miserable,
freaking Decepticons?


  
If Decepticons had their way,
they'd destroy the whole universe.


  
I'm changing sides. I'm changing sides,
too, warrior goddess.


  
- Who's your little Autobot?
- You're cute.


  
Name's Wheelie. Yeah.
Say my name, say my name.


  
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?


  
At least he's faithful, Sam.


  
Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude
and he's perverted.


  
Can you just... Can you stop?


  
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It's just something


  
to think about. I won't argue with...
What were you saying?


  
I told you my name was Jetfire,
so stop judging me.


  
- Somebody shit the bed this morning.
- I have issues of my own.


  
And it started with my mother!


  
My ancestors
have been here for centuries.


  
My father, he was a wheel,
the first wheel.


  
- Do you know what he transformed into?
- No.


  
Nothing!


  
But he did so with honor,
dignity, damn it!


  
Bollocks.


  
My boosters are fried.


  
I think we can help each other.


  
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know, I do.


  
I don't think he knows anything.
Honestly, I don't.


  
I could do this all day.
It comes in waves, these vivid symbols.


  
They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind


  
and Megatron wants what's in my mind.


  
- Him and someone called the Fallen.
- The Fallen? I know him.


  
He left me here to rust.
The original Decepticon.


  
He's terrible to work for.
It's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.


  
These transcriptions,
they were part of my mission,


  
the Fallen's search.


  
I remember now,
for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.


  
Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key?
What are you talking about?


  
No time to explain. Hold on, everybody!
Stay still or you'll die!


  
Well, that wasn't so bad.


  
I just hope we're still on the right planet.


  
Hey, that freaking hurt!


  
Oh, my God.


  
Oh, God.


  
Oh, my God, what a beautiful face.


  
This would be a perfect moment,
except you landed on my testicles.


  
Please, get off.


  
God, my balls.


  
Sam!


  
- Where are we? Simmons!
- Hey! Yeah!


  
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What is this? It's Vegas.


  
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.


  
Hey, I think we're in Vegas!


  
That really, really hurt.
You're just lucky that I didn't get hurt!


  
People could have gotten killed, okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,


  
- you would have heard...
- Shut up.


  
I told you I was opening a space bridge.
It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.


  
When did you... When did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything.


  
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?


  
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling!
You were duly informed!


  
Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?


  
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt


  
so we can all have a little bit of
semblance of peace of mind?


  
This planet was visited
by our race once before,


  
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.


  
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,


  
the lifeblood of our race.


  
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize
and rust, like my wretched self!


  
Do you have any idea what it's like
to slowly fall apart and die?


  
Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer?


  
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.


  
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.


  
It harvests Energon by destroying suns.


  
- Destroy suns?
- You mean blow them up?


  
Yes. You see, in the beginning,


  
there were seven Primes,
our original leaders.


  
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.


  
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,


  
until one of them tried to defy this rule.


  
And his name forevermore
was the Fallen.


  
He despised the human race


  
and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.


  
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key


  
called the Matrix of Leadership.


  
A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.


  
The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,


  
so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.


  
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away


  
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,


  
a tomb we cannot find.


  
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.


  
The Fallen knows where it is


  
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.


  
Okay, so how do we stop him?


  
Only a Prime can defeat the Fallen.


  
Optimus Prime?


  
So, you've met a Prime?


  
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.


  
Is he alive, here on this planet?


  
He sacrificed himself to save me.


  
So, he's dead.


  
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop the Fallen.


  
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,


  
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus


  
and bring him back to life?


  
It was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.


  
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?


  
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols.


  
What you carved in the sand,
it's your clue.


  
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!


  
Find the doorway!


  
Go now! Go!


  
That was my mission.
It's your mission now.


  
Go before the Decepticons find me
and find you.


  
Okay, here's what my CIA contact says.


  
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba the "Dagger's Tip."


  
- That's the Dagger's Tip.
- It's part of the Red Sea.


  
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.


  
29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is.


  
First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.


  
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?


  
I'm gonna make a call.


  
We got cops!


  
I can't go to prison, guys.


  
Sam, we got to get off this road
and lay low.


  
Man, stupid cops!


  
This is what's called
blending in like a ninja.


  
- Shut up or I'll blend my fist in your face.
- They're gone.


  
Okay, we're running out of time.
I gotta make the call to Lennox...


  
You're on the Worldwide Wanted List.


  
Try calling one base,
they'll track you here in seconds.


  
- CIA is all over this place!
- You're gonna call.


  
- Okay. That's a good idea.
- All right.


  
I mean, I just had my mind
on other things,


  
like winding up in an Egyptian prison.


  
NEST departure, 2100 hours.


  
So, we're shipping him back to base.
This is such a mistake.


  
Major Lennox, phone call.


  
Lennox, I'm with the kid. The kid. You
know, the one with the attitude, right?


  
We need the truck. The truck.


  
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.


  
You're not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen.


  
Back of a $1 bill.


  
Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north,
34.88 east. Write it down. Write it.


  
Oh, my God. I got to go. Okay.
Heat comes.


  
Wait, who are you?


  
Wait. It's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.


  
Cops are coming right now.
We need to go!


  
Move, move, move, move.


  
Coordinates, 29.5 north, 34.88 east.


  
Tip of the Red Sea.
Gulf of Aqaba.


  
Egypt? Are you serious?


  
Sir.


  
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there,


  
how is this little kid supposed
to bring him back to life?


  
Look, I don't know,
but we got to trust him.


  
Okay, let's go over it again.


  
When the dawn alights
the Dagger's Tip,


  
- the Three Kings...
- Will reveal the doorway.


  
That's what he said.
You know what it means?


  
- No, what does it mean?
- I have no idea.


  
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Checkpoint. Checkpoint.


  
I don't have my passport.


  
Passport!


  
They got cameras at the top.


  
All right, chill. This is espionage now.
I can handle it.


  
These are my people.
I'm one-thirty-sixth Arab.


  
Great, a fricking Munchkin.


  
Little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.


  
The Dagger's Tip? Right?


  
Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there.


  
Me and my family. This is my family.
This is my son,


  
my other son, my daughter.
We're tourists, from New York.


  
- New York?
- Yes. Yes.


  
Fifty kilometers.


  
You look like the guy that runs
my falafel stand. Thank you very much.


  
- I know. I know you from somewhere.
- Go, Yankees!


  
Put it on the wire to the CIA.


  
Decepticons, boy's location detected.


  
Undercover, yo. You got to blend in
with your surroundings.


  
You know, you got to be part
of the landscape.


  
Awesome! I think aliens built that.


  
Yeah, yeah.


  
Come on. Move it! Move it!


  
Guard us. Low profile.
Don't make a scene, okay?


  
Yeah, some of us got work to do!
Dumb Autobots.


  
Being my girlfriend is hazardous
to your health.


  
Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys.


  
- Do they?
- Yeah.


  
You might as well just say it.


  
Ladies first.


  
Okay, so tonight you're going to be
a gentleman.


  
- You're really chivalrous.
- Why are you mad at me?


  
You know what?
Baby, I'm not... I'm not mad.


  
Do you realize that I just flew 3,miles to keep you from getting killed?


  
I know.


  
Who else could be your girlfriend, Sam?


  
Look at the things I go through with you.


  
And now we're underneath the moon
and the stars


  
and the three most beautiful pyramids
on the planet


  
and you still can't even tell me that
you love me.


  
Pyramids.


  
What? Why do boys always


  
- change the subject?
- Pyramids and stars.


  
- Sam?
- Come with me really quick.


  
Simmons! Leo! Wake up!


  
Listen, astronomy class, page 47.
Remember the class?


  
No. I was only in college for two days.
Remember that?


  
- Here. Get up. Up, up.
- What is he talking about?


  
Okay, you see those three stars?


  
You see
how the last one touches the horizon?


  
That's Orion's belt,
but it's also called the Three Kings.


  
And the reason for that
is the three Egyptian kings


  
who built the pyramids of Giza
built them to mirror those stars,


  
so it's like an arrow staring us
straight in the face.


  
They all point due east, towards Jordan.
The mountains of Petra.


  
We've had an engine malfunction.


  
We're gonna have to divert
to SOCCENT.


  
Flight master, let's lighten the load
and prepare for bailout.


  
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?


  
- All right, team, grab your chutes!
- Bailout like bailout?


  
- You familiar with the standard MC-4?
- Of course not!


  
I've never jumped out of
a perfectly good airplane before!


  
Wait a minute, is this really happening?


  
- Yeah.
- All right, here we go.


  
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're behind this, aren't you?


  
What are you talking about?
You heard the pilot.


  
These guys don't mess around.
This is just standard procedure.


  
I'm just following orders to the letter.
Isn't that what you said?


  
You just signed a death warrant
on your career, Major.


  
What was that? What was that?


  
That's not good. Come on.


  
- Right this way!
- I can't jump out of an airplane!


  
- I have an ulcer! No, no.
- Come on. It's okay.


  
I really can't do this.
What are you doing...


  
Come here! Come here.


  
- Why aren't you wearing your chute?
- Because I have to secure the VIPs first.


  
Okay, I want you to listen very carefully
and memorize everything that I say.


  
Each chute has a GPS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.


  
Right next to that's a fabric webbing
called a bridle,


  
which holds the pin
that keeps the main container closed.


  
- Okay, are you listening?
- I can't hear what...


  
- Stop that!
- All right. All right.


  
All right,
when the pilot chute inflates into the air,


  
it pulls the pin
and opens the main.


  
Red's your backup, blue's your primary.


  
I want you to pull the blue.
I need you to pull it really hard!


  
Not now, we're on the plane,
you dumb-ass!


  
- He say good-bye?
- No, he didn't even say good-bye.


  
General, we're loaded and ready.


  
You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.


  
- Excellent.
- Sir, you need to see this now.


  
- Have we checked these coordinates?
- Egypt, sir.


  
- They're airdropping in.
- You've got to be kidding me.


  
He knows something.


  
We need to be ready to back him up
if this thing goes hot.


  
Copy that.


  
CIA just got a hit on the boy,


  
100 miles from the location
on that little note there.


  
It's getting hotter.


  
It's gotta be around here somewhere.


  
You see the size of this?


  
- You see this?
- Spectacular.


  
Amazing. Look at that.


  
- It's here somewhere, guys.
- Yeah, why?


  
'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird


  
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on?


  
In his defense, this is the biggest
doorway I've ever seen in my entire life.


  
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, all right?


  
Nope. Ever cross your mind, guys,


  
that archeologists
have been here before?


  
There's nothing here.


  
Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid.


  
Sometimes you get to
the end of the rainbow


  
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it!


  
I'm listening to you?
You live with your mother!


  
- It's not over.
- It is over. It's done.


  
Why are we still listening to you,
little punk-ass?


  
I mean, what you ever done for us
except ding my rim?


  
Killed Megatron. How about that?


  
Well, he didn't get the job done,


  
you know what I mean,
'cause he's back now...


  
- Are you scared?
- Scared? Scared of your ugly face!


  
I'm ugly?
Well, we're twins, you stupid genius!


  
Bring it, then! Get off me!


  
- I'll change your face around!
- I'll get all up in that ass!


  
Bring it!


  
Guys!


  
- You like the way that feels?
- That didn't hurt.


  
You like that, don't you?


  
- Come on, Bumblebee!
- Bumblebee, listen.


  
Now, that's rude.


  
Oh, my God. The symbols.


  
Bee! Shoot it.


  
- Check this out.
- Look at it.


  
Wow!


  
These are the bodies
Jetfire was talking about.


  
The tomb of the Primes.


  
Yo!


  
Yo!


  
The Matrix.


  
No.


  
No.


  
Thousands of years, turned to dust.


  
This isn't how it's supposed to end.


  
Hear that?


  
US Air Force! C-17 s!


  
- What's a C-17?
- You can't bring him back, Sam.


  
- There's nothing left.
- Look! Look around you.


  
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all,


  
to just have it end like this.


  
There is a reason that we are here.


  
The voices and the symbols in my head
led us here for a purpose.


  
Everyone's after me
because of what I know,


  
and what I know is that
this is going to work.


  
- How do you know it's gonna work?
- Because I believe it.


  
You best let me out of this plane.


  
Dropping the big boy. Sam!


  
You think you can bring him back to life
with that pixie dust?


  
Absolutely. Let's go.


  
Go!


  
Let's move it.
Remember, they're friendlies.


  
Cover Optimus!


  
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.


  
I need snipers and Stingers up high.


  
So, we just dropped off 10 tons of
dead robot in the middle of nowhere.


  
I hope this little kid know
what he's doing.


  
Yeah, me too.


  
Got a visual! Yellow team! Four clicks!


  
Pop flare!


  
- That's them, right there. See the flare?
- Right over there! See it?


  
Sam!


  
Oh, God. Please, God! Please.


  
Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out.


  
Shut this guy up, huh?


  
- Please, just let me live, just let me live!
- Shut up and let him drive!


  
- Just stop screaming...
- All right, that's it!


  
I can't take that guy anymore.


  
Hide in the dust! Use the dust!


  
We've got to split up.
Bumblebee, you're the decoy.


  
You lead the Decepticons away,
all right? I'm gonna get Optimus.


  
I'll help draw their fire
with Huey and Dewey there.


  
You get to those soldiers.


  
- I hope that dust works, kid.
- Thank you.


  
He's turning around. He's coming back.
He's coming back.


  
It's up to me.


  
One man, alone,
betrayed by the country he loves,


  
now its last hope
in their final hour of need.


  
Prepare to be driven like never before,
by the maestro.


  
- Hey, hey! Don't go nowhere! Drive.
- You'll never make it, kid.


  
- I'm coming with you.
- Bravery will only get you so far.


  
You tased me, okay? You owe me!
I'm going.


  
Okay, okay. That was a test.
You passed. All right?


  
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it.
That ain't Air Force.


  
- What the hell was that?
- Anyone copy?


  
- Anyone there? Who's up?
- Copy?


  
- Radio's down.
- It's dead. Comms are down.


  
EMP burst.


  
I see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.


  
Yes, sir?


  
- Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.
- I know, sir.


  
Well, what country am I in right now?


  
United States.


  
No, not the United States.
I'm from the United States.


  
I'm in the middle of nowhere
surrounded by donkeys.


  
Well, that was our good friend,
Galloway. He's less than pleased.


  
How is it that we can't reach our men,


  
but he can reach me,
from some random Egyptian desert?


  
Nothing.


  
Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye in
the sky know we need some help.


  
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, boys, old school time!


  
Pop some more flares
so the kid can find us.


  
Look. There it is.
We got a couple of miles.


  
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.


  
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?


  
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.


  
Our satellites in the area have
gone blind. We're working it, sir.


  
Damn it. Something's not right.
It doesn't add up.


  
Contact the Jordanians, see
what air assets they've got in the area,


  
and get Egypt's General Salam.


  
Ask him to clear some USV overflights
in Egyptian airspace.


  
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.


  
Scramble Predators now.


  
V-1, rotate.


  
We still have a mile that way.


  
Come on.


  
This way. This way.


  
- One man, alone...
- Stop saying that!


  
...betrayed by the country he loves!


  
Oh, my goodness.
I'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.


  
Just relax. You're with the maestro.


  
I don't think he's still following us.


  
I don't think he's still following us.


  
That's what you think.


  
Master, sorry to be the bearer
of bad news,


  
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.


  
The boy must have the Matrix.


  
We cannot let him reach Optimus.


  
Decepticons, begin our assault!


  
We've got incoming!


  
We got a whole lot of fight
coming our way.


  
- How many?
- About 13 of them.


  
This ain't good. This ain't good.


  
We're about to get our asses whupped.


  
Bravo-Charlie, kneel!


  
All right, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.


  
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life,


  
so our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.


  
All right, we're gonna draw fire
from the left flank. I need a scout team.


  
I'm leading.


  
Go up through the middle
with Arcee and Ironhide!


  
All right, when you see
the precious cargo,


  
I want you to pop green smoke and
come back through those pillars.


  
We'll have the ambush set. All right.
Let's go. Move out!


  
You ever see that film
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral?


  
- With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?
- No, why?


  
- Looks like we're right in the middle of it.
- Is that good?


  
A lot of people died.


  
Hide!


  
- Vámonos, amigos!
- Oh, my God!


  
- Hit the deck!
- Oh, my God!


  
Sam, Sam.


  
I don't think they saw us.


  
Get down. Get down. Get down.


  
Okay. Listen.


  
Once it's clear, we run for Optimus
as fast as we can, okay?


  
What if it doesn't work?


  
It's gonna work.


  
- What if it doesn't?
- It's gonna work. It'll work.


  
Up, up, up!


  
Get ready to jump!


  
We got a half-mile. I don't think
the soldiers know we're here.


  
Fall back!


  
Fall back!


  
- Ironhide, up the middle!
- Ironhide, move it!


  
Let's go! Go, go!


  
Devastator!


  
We're trapped! There's nowhere to go.
We're gonna die.


  
If we're going out, we're going out
like men, understand?


  
Look at this mother...


  
Mean robots suck!


  
Hang on! Hang on, okay?


  
- Simmons!
- Don't let go!


  
Hang in there, I got you! Just hang in.


  
I don't want to die!


  
Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip!


  
You ain't getting me!


  
He dead. He got so ate.


  
- Who's your daddy now, huh?
- He got all ate up.


  
The only safe place is right under it.


  
- Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it!
- Yeah.


  
You should've never eaten me!
I'm gonna bust your face up!


  
Oh, my God!


  
Nobody mess with me! In your face!


  
Keep fighting, Mudflap!


  
Oh, my God!


  
Nobody messes with the twins.


  
I got you... My bad!


  
Man! You shot me in the face!


  
- Stay under it!
- Yeah, stay under it!


  
Come on.


  
Judy!


  
- Sam! Sam!
- What?


  
Sam! Sam!


  
Sam!


  
- Sam!
- Dad!


  
Wait, wait!


  
Please listen to me!
I want you to run! Run!


  
Dad, just stop!
They don't want you, they want me!


  
- Oh, God!
- Wait!


  
Sam Witwicky.


  
Don't hurt them. This is what you want.
You don't want them.


  
- Go! Go!
- Please, stop!


  
- Stop!
- Listen to your father!


  
Just get out of here!


  
Just don't hurt them.
I know what you want.


  
Just go! Just go!


  
And I know that you need me
because I know about the Matrix.


  
- Don't do it, Sam...
- Please, Dad.


  
- They're going to kill us all anyway!
- Here's what you want, right here.


  
Bumblebee!


  
Kill him, Bee. Kill him.


  
- Stay tight, Ma.
- Come on. Get in here.


  
- Bee?
- Yeah.


  
- Hey!
- I don't know


  
what's going on, but we've got to move!


  
There's got to be a way out of here!


  
Judy, get back, get back, get back.


  
Against the wall! Against the wall!
Against the wall. Against the wall.


  
Bee! Bumblebee!


  
You get them somewhere safe,
all right?


  
You've got to get in the car
and get to safety.


  
No, this isn't up for discussion!


  
- You're my son! You're my son!
- I know.


  
- Dad...
- We all go together!


  
- Listen...
- We're all going together!


  
Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car.
He's gonna get you to safety.


  
You know, you run.
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.


  
You hear what I'm saying, okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.


  
- No.
- You've got to let me go, Dad.


  
- You have to let me go. You have to.
- Ron.


  
Ron. Ron, let him go.


  
You come back! Come on.


  
Ron! Mikaela! Mikaela!


  
- Go with my parents.
- I'm not gonna go without you.


  
Move to cover!


  
We got Jordanians!


  
We got help!


  
Down!


  
You okay, soldier?


  
We're gonna help you, soldier. Let's
get these wounded clear of the bird.


  
Stay still. Stay still. Don't move.


  
You all right, young man?
You have a radio?


  
Hey, kid, it's been nice knowing you.
Remember what I did for my country.


  
This is my moment.


  
You're crazy!


  
ETA to station, two minutes.


  
- Put it on the main screen.
- Sir. Yes, sir.


  
Predator 01.


  
Shit, it's a trick.


  
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.


  
- Get those Marines on the ground.
- Roll in strike packages...


  
- Get those Marines on the ground.
- Roll in strike packages...


  
Task Force Ripper, execute Lightning.


  
- Spotted Sam!
- Sam!


  
Ironhide!


  
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.


  
Get out, Sam! Get to the pillars!


  
Let's go.


  
Oh, God. This is it. The pyramid's built
right over the machine.


  
If they turn that machine on,
no more sun.


  
Not on my watch.


  
Not on my watch.


  
USS Stennis. Identify.


  
Where the hell are you?
Watching the Weather Channel?


  
SportsCenter?
I Dream of Jeannie or something?


  
We got 300 satellites up there.
Where the hell are all our men?


  
Identify yourself.


  
What is your name, sailor?


  
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier.


  
Okay, Captain Wilder.


  
This is Agent Seymour Simmons
of Sector Seven.


  
There is the mother
of all non-biologicals


  
getting ready to blow up our sun.


  
Do you want to have a throwdown
about my lack of clearance


  
or do you want to help save
a gazillion lives?


  
All right, Agent Simmons. I'm listening.


  
Five clicks west of the Gulf,


  
Five clicks west of the Gulf,


  
we got ourselves an alien
remodeling a pyramid.


  
Our one hope is a prototype weapon
called a rail gun,


  
- shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7.
- That's classified.


  
Don't talk to me about classified,
all right?


  
Now, if you've got a battleship
in the Gulf, which I know you do,


  
you tell them to ready that weapon!


  
Contact destroyer USS KIDD.


  
Alpha Team, flank left!


  
This way! Move it!


  
- Where do you need us, sir?
- Protect those in the line of fire.


  
Let's go! Go!


  
Give me your Comms. Come on. Epps!


  
Right now, we need air support, ASAP!


  
Have troops in contact 20 miles
northwest. Radar contact.


  
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...


  
B-1, snap 090.


  
You are approved to drop your
2,000-pound JDAMs.


  
- What you got?
- I couldn't get to them, sir.


  
They're 600 meters away
and they're heading right for the pillars.


  
All right. Precious cargo's coming!


  
Move!


  
Curse you!


  
Sam! Spotted Sam!


  
- Come on!
- 2-2 covering fire.


  
Two civilians, 12 o'clock!


  
Cover for us!


  
Hold the air strike!
We're rescuing civilians!


  
Keep firing!


  
Come on! Mikaela!


  
Come on! Get in here!


  
Look who showed up.


  
You better have a good reason for us
to be here.


  
- Where's Optimus?
- He's right over there,


  
across the courtyard.


  
- I got to get to him right now.
- Not with an air strike coming.


  
I have to get to him right now.


  
Go. Back, back, back, back.


  
- Go.
- Listen up...


  
Okay.


  
Incoming!


  
Stick the landing.


  
Behold the glory of Jetfire!


  
Now let me show you how we brought
the pain in my day!


  
I'm too old for this crap.


  
Keep going, man, 15 rounds of fighting.


  
I am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.


  
25.7 meters above sea level,
29.32 north.


  
- Kill track, 5205...
- Target acquired.


  
- Killing track.
- Two, one...


  
Fire!


  
Yeah! Yeah!


  
B-1's time on target, 30 seconds.
2,000-pound JDAMs inbound.


  
We're gonna make a break through
the B's on my command, okay?


  
You guys stick with me, you
understand? You stay on my ass.


  
- 1-1 tally orange smoke.
- I hope these F-16s got good aim.


  
- Yeah? Why is that?
- I told them to hit the orange smoke.


  
You mean that orange smoke?


  
It wasn't my best toss, okay?


  
- Viper, thunder.
- Run!


  
Incoming!


  
Come on!


  
Sam!


  
Run!


  
Die!


  
Sam!


  
Hold your fire!


  
Sam!


  
Stay back! Mikaela, stay back!


  
Fucking do something!


  
- Sam! Sam!
- Sam! Sam! Sam! Sammy! Sam!


  
- Let me go!
- Come on, you got to move.


  
- You got to move, come on.
- We got no pulse.


  
Starting CPR.


  
- I have to see my kid! I got a son...
- Sammy!


  
Sam!


  
- Clear.
- Ready to shock.


  
- Clear!
- Ready to shock. One, two, three.


  
Do it again!


  
No!


  
Okay, listen to my voice.
I love you and I need you.


  
Please. Please, come back to me.
Sam, please!


  
I love you.


  
Where am I? Where am I?
Am I dead? Am I dead?


  
We have been watching you
a long, long time.


  
You have fought for Optimus,
our last descendant,


  
with courage and with sacrifice,
the virtues of a leader,


  
a leader worthy of our secret.


  
The Matrix of Leadership is not found,
it is earned.


  
Return now to Optimus.


  
Merge the Matrix with his spark.


  
It is, and always has been, your destiny.


  
Sam!


  
I love you. I love you.


  
Boy, you returned for me.


  
A living Prime.


  
I don't believe it!


  
My Matrix!


  
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!


  
Get up, Prime!


  
Oh, no.


  
He's turning on the machine!
You got to stop him! Get up!


  
Optimus!


  
Fallen, my master.


  
My brothers could not stop me from this.


  
Yes, now I claim your sun.


  
- Move!
- Enemy target, top of pyramid. Engage!


  
Engage! Engage!


  
In moments, we'll be at firing strength.


  
All my Decepticon life, I never did
a thing worth doing until now.


  
Optimus, take my parts


  
and you will have a power
you've never known.


  
Fulfill your destiny.


  
Jolt! Electrify!


  
Transplant those afterburners.


  
Let's roll.


  
Fire mission on the pyramids.


  
This planet will be dark forever.


  
Die, like your brothers!


  
They were your brothers, too.


  
Starscream!


  
You picked the wrong planet.


  
Give me your face.


  
I rise.


  
You fall.


  
No, no.


  
Not to call you a coward, Master,


  
but sometimes cowards do survive.


  
This isn't over.


  
It took all this for you to tell me that
you love me.


  
You said it first.


  
Thank you, Sam, for saving my life.


  
Welcome.


  
Thank you for believing in me.


  
Our races united by a history
long forgotten


  
and a future we shall face together.


  
I am Optimus Prime,


  
and I send this message so that our
pasts will always be remembered,


  
for in those memories, we live on.


  
So glad you could join us,
Professor Einstein.


  
Yeah, I was kind of busy.


  
Okay.
