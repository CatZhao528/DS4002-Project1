When the boy was born...


  
... like all Spartans, he was inspected.


  
If he'd been small or puny
or sickly or misshapen...


  
... he would have been discarded.


  
From the time he could stand,
he was baptized in the fire of combat.


  
Taught never to retreat,
never to surrender.


  
Taught that death on the battlefield
in service to Sparta...


  
... was the greatest glory
he could achieve in his life.


  
At age 7, as is customary in Sparta...


  
... the boy was taken from his mother
and plunged into a world of violence.


  
Manufactured by 300 years
of Spartan warrior society...


  
... to create the finest soldiers
the world has ever known.


  
The agoge, as it's called,
forces the boy to fight.


  
Starves them, forces them to steal...


  
... and if necessary, to kill.


  
By rod and lash the boy was punished...


  
... taught to show no pain, no mercy.


  
Constantly tested, tossed into the wild.


  
Left to pit his wits and will
against nature's fury.


  
It was his initiation...


  
... his time in the wild...


  
... for he would return to his people
a Spartan...


  
... or not at all.


  
The wolf begins to circle the boy.


  
Claws of black steel...


  
... fur as dark night.


  
Eyes glowing red...


  
... jewels from the pit of hell itself.


  
The giant wolf sniffing...


  
... savoring the scent of the meal to come.


  
It's not fear that grips him...


  
... only a heightened sense of things.


  
The cold air in his lungs.


  
Windswept pines
moving against the coming night.


  
His hands are steady.


  
His form...


  
... perfect.


  
And so the boy, given up for dead...


  
... returns to his people,
to sacred Sparta, a king!


  
Our king, Leonidas!


  
It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf and the winter cold.


  
And now, as then, a beast approaches.


  
Patient and confident,
savoring the meal to come.


  
But this beast
is made of men and horses...


  
...swords and spears.


  
An army of slaves, vast beyond imagining,
ready to devour tiny Greece.


  
Ready to snuff out the world's
one hope for reason and justice.


  
A beast approaches...


  
...and it was King Leonidas himself
who provoked it.


  
That's it.


  
Now, the more you sweat here,
the less you'll bleed in battle.


  
My father taught me...


  
...that fear is always a constant.


  
But accepting it...


  
...makes you stronger.


  
My queen.


  
A Persian emissary awaits Leonidas.


  
In the end...


  
...a Spartan's true strength
is the warrior next to him.


  
So give respect and honor to him,
and it will be returned to you.


  
First...


  
...you fight with your head.
- Then you fight with your heart.


  
What is it?


  
A Persian messenger awaits you.


  
Do not forget today's lesson.


  
- Respect and honor.
- Respect and honor.


  
Councilman Theron.
You found yourself needed, for once.


  
My king and queen,
I was just entertaining your guests.


  
I'm sure.


  
Before you speak, Persian...


  
...know that in Sparta everyone,
even a king's messenger...


  
...is held accountable
for the words of his voice.


  
Now, what message do you bring?


  
Earth and water.


  
You rode all the way from Persia
for earth and water?


  
Do not be coy or stupid, Persian.
You can afford neither in Sparta.


  
What makes this woman
think she can speak among men?


  
Because only Spartan women
give birth to real men.


  
Let us walk to cool our tongues.


  
If you value your lives
over your complete annihilation...


  
...listen carefully, Leonidas.


  
Xerxes conquers and controls
everything he rests his eyes upon.


  
He leads an army so massive,
it shakes the ground with its march.


  
So vast, it drinks the rivers dry.


  
All the God-King Xerxes requires is this:


  
A simple offering of earth and water...


  
...a token of Sparta's submission
to the will of Xerxes.


  
Submission.


  
Now, that's a bit of a problem.


  
See, rumor has it...


  
...the Athenians
have already turned you down.


  
And if those philosophers and boy-lovers
have found that kind of nerve, then...


  
- We must be diplomatic.
- And, of course, Spartans...


  
...have their reputation to consider.


  
Choose your next words carefully,
Leonidas.


  
They may be your last as king.


  
"Earth and water."


  
Madman. You're a madman.


  
Earth and water.


  
You'll find plenty of both down there.


  
No man, Persian or Greek,
no man threatens a messenger.


  
You bring the crowns and heads
of conquered kings to my city steps.


  
You insult my queen.


  
You threaten my people
with slavery and death.


  
Oh, I've chosen my words carefully,
Persian.


  
Perhaps you should have done the same.


  
This is blasphemy. This is madness!


  
Madness?


  
This is Sparta!


  
Welcome, Leonidas.


  
We have been expecting you.


  
The ephors, priests to the old gods.


  
Inbred swine.


  
More creature than man.


  
Creatures whom even Leonidas
must bribe and beg.


  
For no Spartan king has gone to war
without the ephors' blessing.


  
The Persians claim their forces
number in the millions.


  
I hope, for our sake, they exaggerate.


  
But there's no question, we face
the most massive army ever assembled.


  
Before your plan is heard...


  
...what do you offer?


  
We will use our superior fighting skills...


  
...and the terrain of Greece herself
to destroy them.


  
We will march north to the coast,
where I will make sure...


  
It is August, Leonidas.
The full moon approaches.


  
The sacred and ancient festival.


  
Sparta wages no war
at the time of the Carneia.


  
Sparta will burn!


  
Her men will die at arms...


  
...and her women and children
will be slaves or worse.


  
Now, we will block
the Persian coastal assault...


  
...by rebuilding the great Phocian Wall.


  
And from there, we will funnel them into
the mountain pass we call the Hot Gates.


  
Now, in that narrow corridor,
their numbers will count for nothing.


  
And wave after wave of Persian attack...


  
...will smash against Spartan shields.


  
Xerxes' losses will be so great,
his men so demoralized...


  
...he will have no choice
but to abandon his campaign.


  
We must consult the oracle.


  
Trust the gods, Leonidas.


  
I'd prefer you trusted your reason.


  
Your blasphemies...


  
...have cost us quite enough already.


  
Don't compound them.


  
We will consult the oracle.


  
Diseased old mystics.


  
Worthless remnants of a time
before Sparta's ascent from darkness.


  
Remnants of a senseless tradition.


  
Tradition even Leonidas cannot defy...


  
... for he must respect
the word of the ephors.


  
That is the law.


  
And no Spartan, subject or citizen,
man or woman...


  
... slave or king, is above the law.


  
The ephors choose only
the most beautiful Spartan girls...


  
... to live among them as oracles.


  
Their beauty is their curse...


  
... for the old wretches
have the needs of men...


  
... and souls as black as hell.


  
"Pray to the winds...


  
...Sparta will fall.


  
All Greece will fall.


  
Trust not in men...


  
...honor the gods.


  
Honor the Carneia."


  
The king's climb down is harder.


  
Pompous, inbred swine.


  
Worthless, diseased, rotten...


  
... corrupt.


  
Truly, you're in the god-king's
favor now...


  
...O wise and holy men.


  
Yes.


  
And when Sparta burns,
you shall bathe in gold.


  
Fresh oracles shall be delivered to you...


  
...daily...


  
...from every corner of the empire.


  
Your lips can finish
what your fingers have started.


  
Or has the oracle robbed you
of your desire as well?


  
It would take more than the words
of a drunken adolescent girl...


  
...to rob me of my desire for you.


  
Then why so distant?


  
Because it seems...


  
...though a slave and captive
of lecherous old men...


  
...the oracle's words
could set fire to all that I love.


  
So that is why my king loses sleep
and is forced from the warmth of his bed?


  
There's only one woman's words that
should affect the mood of my husband.


  
Those are mine.


  
Then what must a king do
to save his world...


  
...when the very laws he is sworn
to protect force him to do nothing?


  
It is not a question
of what a Spartan citizen should do...


  
...nor a husband, nor a king.


  
Instead ask yourself, my dearest love...


  
...what should a free man do?


  
- Is this all of them?
- As you ordered. Three hundred.


  
All with born sons to carry on their name.


  
We are with you, sire.


  
For Sparta. For freedom.


  
To the death.


  
He is your son.


  
He is too young
to have felt a woman's warmth.


  
I have others to replace him.
Astinos is as brave and ready as any.


  
No younger than we were the first time
you stood next to me in battle.


  
You are a good friend...


  
...but a better captain, there is none.


  
My good king.


  
My good king, the oracle has spoken.


  
The ephors have spoken.
There must be no march.


  
It is the law, my lord.


  
- The Spartan army must not go to war.
- Nor shall it.


  
I've issued no such orders.


  
I'm here just taking a stroll,
stretching my legs.


  
These 300 men
are my personal bodyguard.


  
Our army will stay in Sparta.


  
Where will you go?


  
I hadn't really thought about it...


  
...but now that you ask...


  
...I suppose I'll head north.


  
The Hot Gates?


  
Move out!


  
Move out!


  
What shall we do?


  
What can we do?


  
What can you do?


  
Sparta will need sons.


  
Spartan!


  
Yes, milady?


  
Come back with your shield...


  
...or on it.


  
Yes, milady.


  
"Goodbye, my love."


  
He doesn't say it.


  
There's no room for softness...


  
... not in Sparta.


  
No place for weakness.


  
Only the hard and strong
may call themselves Spartans.


  
Only the hard. Only the strong.


  
We march...


  
... for our lands, for our families,
for our freedoms.


  
We march.


  
Daxos.


  
- What a pleasant surprise.
- This morning's full of surprises, Leonidas.


  
- We've been tricked.
- Can't be more than a hundred.


  
- This is a surprise.
- Silence.


  
This isn't their army.


  
We heard Sparta was on the warpath
and we were eager to join forces.


  
If it is blood you seek,
you are welcome to join us.


  
But you bring only this handful
of soldiers against Xerxes?


  
I see I was wrong to expect Sparta's
commitment to at least match our own.


  
Doesn't it?


  
You, there.


  
What is your profession?


  
I'm a potter, sir.


  
And you, Arcadian.
What is your profession?


  
- Sculptor, sir.
- Sculptor.


  
- And you?
- Blacksmith.


  
Spartans! What is your profession?


  
You see, old friend?


  
I brought more soldiers than you did.


  
No sleep tonight...


  
... not for the king.


  
All his 40 years
have been a straight road...


  
... to this one gleaming moment
in destiny...


  
... this one radiant clash
of shield and spear...


  
... sword and bone, and flesh and blood.


  
His only regret...


  
... is that he has so few to sacrifice.


  
We're being followed.


  
It has followed us since Sparta.


  
My king! Look!


  
What happened here?


  
Where are all the people?


  
Persians.


  
I put their number at around 20.


  
A scouting party.


  
But these footprints...


  
Behind us!


  
Child!


  
It's quiet now.


  
They...


  
They came with beasts
from the blackness.


  
With their claws and fangs...


  
...they grabbed them.


  
Everyone...


  
...but me.


  
The villagers.


  
I found them.


  
Have the gods no mercy?


  
We are doomed.


  
Quiet yourself.


  
The child speaks of the Persian ghosts,
known from the ancient times.


  
They are the hunters of men's souls.


  
They cannot be killed or defeated.


  
Not this darkness. Not these lmmortals.


  
Immortals?


  
We'll put their name to the test.


  
Into the Hot Gates we march.


  
Into that narrow corridor we march...


  
... where Xerxes' numbers
count for nothing.


  
Spartans, citizen-soldiers, freed slaves.


  
Brave Greeks, all.


  
Brothers, fathers, sons...


  
... we march.


  
For honor's sake, for duty's sake,
for glory's sake, we march.


  
Look! Persians.


  
Into hell's mouth we march.


  
Let's watch these motherless dogs...


  
...as they're embraced by the loving arms
of Greece herself. Come.


  
True.


  
It does look like rain.


  
Zeus stabs the sky with thunderbolts...


  
... and batters the Persian ships
with hurricane wind.


  
Glorious.


  
Only one among us
keeps his Spartan reserve.


  
Only he.


  
Only our king.


  
My queen?


  
My queen...


  
...the courtyard is a more fitting place
for a married woman.


  
I'm afraid gossip and protocol...


  
...are the least of my worries now,
councilman.


  
Is such secrecy needed?


  
How am I to trust beyond the walls
of my own home?


  
Even here, Theron has eyes and ears
which fuel Sparta with doubt and fear.


  
You speak as if all Sparta
conspires against you.


  
I wish it were only against me.


  
Many on our council
would vote to give all we have...


  
...and follow Leonidas...


  
...but you must show them favor.


  
And you can arrange for me
to speak to the council?


  
If it is reason they want,
I will let them know.


  
Know what, my queen?


  
Freedom isn't free at all.


  
That it comes with the highest of costs,
the cost of blood.


  
I will do my best to gather our council.


  
And its chamber
shall be filled with your voice.


  
- I'm in your debt.
- No.


  
Leonidas is my king as well as yours.


  
I saw those ships smash on the rocks.


  
How can this be?


  
We saw but a fraction of the monster
that is Xerxes' army.


  
There can be no victory here.


  
Why do you smile?


  
Arcadian...


  
...I have fought countless times...


  
...yet I've never met an adversary
who could offer me...


  
...what we Spartans
call "a beautiful death."


  
I can only hope...


  
...with all the world's warriors
gathered against us...


  
...there might be one down there
who's up to the task.


  
Move!


  
Keep going, you dogs!


  
Move!


  
Forward, I say!


  
Stop here!


  
Who commands here?


  
I am the emissary...


  
...to the ruler of all the world...


  
...the god of gods, king of kings...


  
...and by that authority...


  
...I demand that someone
show me your commander.


  
Listen. Do you think the paltry dozen
you slew scares us?


  
These hills swarm with our scouts.


  
And do you think your pathetic wall
will do anything...


  
...except fall like a heap of dry leaves
in the face of...?


  
Our ancestors built this wall...


  
...using ancient stones
from the bosom of Greece herself.


  
And with a little Spartan help...


  
...your Persian scouts supplied the mortar.


  
You will pay for your barbarism!


  
My arm!


  
It's not yours anymore.


  
Go now. Run along and tell your Xerxes
he faces free men here...


  
...not slaves.


  
Do it quickly...


  
...before we decide to make our wall
just a little bit bigger.


  
No.


  
Not slaves.


  
Your women will be slaves.


  
Your sons, your daughters...


  
...your elders will be slaves!


  
But not you, no.


  
By noon this day you will be dead men.


  
A thousand nations of the Persian Empire
descend upon you.


  
Our arrows will blot out the sun.


  
Then we will fight in the shade.


  
The wall is solid.


  
It'll do the job of funneling the Persians
into the Hot Gates.


  
Have the men found any route
through the hills to our back?


  
None, sire.


  
There is such a route, good king.


  
Just pass that western ridge.


  
It's an old goat path.


  
The Persians could use it to outflank us.


  
Not one step closer, monster!


  
Wise king, I humbly request an audience.


  
- I'll skewer you where you stand.
- I gave no such order.


  
Forgive the captain.


  
He is a good soldier...


  
...but a bit short on manners.


  
There is nothing to forgive, brave king.
I know what I look like.


  
You wear the crimson of a Spartan.


  
I am Ephialtes, born of Sparta.


  
My mother's love
led my parents to flee Sparta...


  
...lest I be discarded.


  
Your shield and armor?


  
My father's, sir.


  
I beg you, bold king,
to permit me...


  
...to redeem my father's name
by serving you in combat.


  
My father trained me to feel no fear,
to make spear and shield and sword...


  
...as much a part of me
as my own beating heart.


  
I will earn my father's armor, noble king...


  
...by serving you in the battle.


  
A fine thrust.


  
I will kill many Persians.


  
Raise your shield.


  
- Sire?
- Raise your shield as high as you can.


  
Your father should have taught you
how our phalanx works.


  
We fight...


  
...as a single, impenetrable unit.


  
That is the source of our strength.


  
Each Spartan protects the man
to his left...


  
...from thigh to neck with his shield.


  
A single weak spot
and the phalanx shatters.


  
From thigh to neck, Ephialtes.


  
I am sorry, my friend.


  
- But not all of us were made to be soldiers.
- But I...


  
- lf you want to help in a Spartan victory...
- Yes.


  
...clear the battlefield of the dead,
tend the wounded, bring them water...


  
...but as for the fight itself...


  
...I cannot use you.


  
You...


  
Mother! Father! You were wrong!


  
You are wrong!


  
Leonidas! You are wrong!


  
Dispatch the Phocians to the goat path...


  
...and pray to the gods
nobody tells the Persians about it.


  
Earthquake.


  
No, captain.


  
Battle formations.


  
This is where we hold them.


  
This is where we fight!


  
This is where they die!


  
Earn these shields, boys!


  
Remember this day, men...


  
...for it will be yours for all time.


  
Spartans!


  
Lay down your weapons!


  
Persians!


  
Come and get them!


  
Hold!


  
Give them nothing...


  
...but take from them everything!


  
Steady!


  
Push!


  
Is that the best you can do?


  
Push! Push!


  
Now!


  
Push!


  
No prisoners!


  
No mercy!


  
They look thirsty.


  
Well, let's give them something to drink.


  
To the cliffs.


  
Halt.


  
Hell of a good start.


  
Tuck tail!


  
Persian cowards.


  
- What the hell are you laughing at?
- Well, you had to say it.


  
- What?
- "Fight in the shade."


  
Recover.


  
Today no Spartan dies.


  
Easy, son.


  
We do what we were trained to do...


  
... what we were bred to do...


  
... what we were born to do.


  
No prisoners. No mercy.


  
A good start.


  
- I was afraid you might not come.
- I'm sorry, my son is...


  
Is doing what children do best.
Please, don't apologize.


  
Your son starts the agoge next year.


  
That is always a difficult time
for a Spartan mother.


  
Yes, it will be hard. But also necessary.


  
You will speak before the council
in two days' time.


  
My husband does not have two days.


  
Think of the two days as a gift.


  
It's no secret...


  
...Theron wants what you control.


  
It's his voice you must silence.


  
Make him your ally...


  
...and you will have your victory.


  
Thank you.


  
You are wise as you are kind.


  
There's your mother.


  
You should keep a better eye on him
if he's to be king one day.


  
Be unfortunate if anything
were to happen to him.


  
Or to his beautiful mother.


  
No!


  
Our Greek comrades are begging
for a crack at the Persians, sire.


  
Good.


  
I've got something
I think they can handle.


  
Tell Daxos that I want him...


  
...and 20 of his best eager, sober
and ready for the next charge.


  
King Leonidas.


  
- Stelios, catch your breath, boy.
- Yes, milord.


  
The Persians are approaching.


  
A small contingent.
Too small for an attack.


  
- Captain, I leave you in charge.
- But sire...


  
Relax, old friend.


  
If they assassinate me,
all of Sparta goes to war.


  
Pray they're that stupid.


  
Pray...


  
...we're that lucky.


  
Besides...


  
...there's no reason we can't be civil...


  
...is there?


  
None, sire.


  
Let me guess.


  
You must be Xerxes.


  
Come, Leonidas.


  
Let us reason together.


  
It would be a regrettable waste...


  
...it would be nothing short of madness
were you, brave king...


  
...and your valiant troops to perish...


  
...all because of a simple
misunderstanding.


  
- There's much our cultures could share.
- Haven't you noticed?


  
We've been sharing our culture
with you all morning.


  
Yours is a fascinating tribe.


  
Even now you are defiant...


  
...in the face of annihilation
and the presence of a god.


  
It isn't wise to stand against me,
Leonidas.


  
Imagine what a horrible fate
awaits my enemies...


  
...when I would gladly kill
any of my own men for victory.


  
And I would die for any one of mine.


  
You Greeks take pride in your logic.
I suggest you employ it.


  
Consider the beautiful land
you so vigorously defend.


  
Picture it reduced to ash at my whim.


  
Consider the fate of your women.


  
Clearly you don't know our women.


  
I might as well have marched them up here,
judging by what I've seen.


  
You have many slaves, Xerxes...


  
...but few warriors.


  
It won't be long
before they fear my spears...


  
...more than your whips.


  
It's not the lash they fear...


  
...it is my divine power.


  
But I am a generous god.
I can make you rich beyond all measure.


  
I will make you warlord of all Greece.


  
You will carry my battle standard
to the heart of Europa.


  
Your Athenian rivals...


  
...will kneel at your feet...


  
...if you will but kneel at mine.


  
You are generous...


  
...as you are divine...


  
...O king of kings.


  
Such an offer
only a madman would refuse.


  
But the...


  
The idea of kneeling, it's...


  
You see, slaughtering
all those men of yours has...


  
Well, it's left a nasty cramp in my leg...


  
...so kneeling will be hard for me.


  
There will be no glory in your sacrifice.


  
I will erase even the memory of Sparta
from the histories.


  
Every piece of Greek parchment
shall be burned.


  
Every Greek historian and every scribe
shall have their eyes put out...


  
...and their tongues
cut from their mouths.


  
Why, uttering the very name of Sparta
or Leonidas will be punishable by death.


  
The world will never know
you existed at all.


  
The world will know
that free men stood against a tyrant.


  
That few stood against many.


  
And before this battle was over...


  
...that even a god-king can bleed.


  
You fought well today...


  
...for a woman.


  
As did you.


  
Maybe if I'm injured,
you'll be able to keep up with me.


  
Perhaps I was so far ahead
you couldn't see me.


  
More likely offering your backside
to the Thespians.


  
Jealousy...


  
...does not become you, my friend.


  
Move it, men!


  
Pile those Persians high.


  
For unless I miss my guess...


  
...we're in for one wild night.


  
They have served the dark will
of Persian kings for 500 years.


  
Eyes as dark as night.


  
Teeth filed to fangs.


  
Soulless.


  
The personal guard to King Xerxes himself.
The Persian warrior elite.


  
The deadliest fighting force in all of Asia:


  
The Immortals.


  
The god-king has betrayed a fatal flaw:


  
Hubris.


  
Easy to taunt, easy to trick.


  
Before wounds and weariness
have taken their toll...


  
... the mad king
throws the best he has at us.


  
Xerxes has taken the bait.


  
Spartans, push!


  
Immortals.


  
We put their name to the test.


  
Father!


  
My king!


  
Arcadians, now!


  
Go! Show the Spartans what we can do.


  
Go!


  
They shout and curse...


  
... stabbing wildly,
more brawlers than warriors.


  
They make a wondrous mess of things.


  
Brave amateurs, they do their part.


  
Immortals.


  
They fail our king's test.


  
And a man who fancies himself a god...


  
... feels a very human chill
crawl up his spine.


  
To our king!


  
And our honored dead.


  
Whom will Xerxes dare to send next?
Whom?!


  
There's nothing that can stop us now!


  
Even the king allows himself
to hope for more than glory.


  
Such mad hope, but there it is:


  
"Against Asia's endless hordes,
against all odds, we can do it.


  
We can hold the Hot Gates.


  
We can win. "


  
Dawn.


  
Whips crack. Barbarians howl.


  
Those behind cry, "Forward!"


  
Those in front cry, "Back!"


  
Our eyes bear witness
to the grotesque spectacle...


  
... coughed forth from the darkest corner
of Xerxes' empire.


  
When muscle failed...


  
... they turned to their magic.


  
One hundred nations descend upon us,
the armies of all Asia.


  
Funneled into this narrow corridor,
their numbers count for nothing.


  
They fall by the hundreds.


  
We send the severed bodies
and the fragile hearts back to Xerxes' feet.


  
King Xerxes is displeased
with his generals.


  
He disciplines them.


  
Xerxes dispatches his monsters
from half the world away.


  
They're clumsy beasts...


  
... and the piled Persian dead are slippery.


  
- You still here?
- Somebody's gotta watch your back.


  
Not now, I'm a little busy.


  
Regroup!


  
Astinos!


  
My son!


  
Astinos!


  
No!


  
Day wears on.


  
We lose few...


  
... but each felled is a friend,
or dearest blood.


  
And upon seeing the headless body
of his own young son...


  
... the captain breaks rank.


  
He goes wild, blood-drunk.


  
The captain's cries of pain
at the loss of his son...


  
... are more frightening to the enemy
than the deepest battle drums.


  
It takes three men to restrain him
and bring him back to our own.


  
The day is ours.


  
No songs are sung.


  
Your gods were cruel to shape you so,
friend Ephialtes.


  
The Spartans, too...


  
...were cruel to reject you.


  
But I am kind.


  
Everything you could ever desire...


  
...every happiness you can imagine...


  
...every pleasure your fellow Greeks
and your false gods have denied you...


  
...I will grant you.


  
For I am kind.


  
Embrace me as your king
and as your god.


  
Yes.


  
Lead my soldiers to the hidden path
that enters behind the cursed Spartans...


  
...and your joys will be endless.


  
Yes! I want it all.


  
Wealth. Women.


  
And one more thing...


  
...I want a uniform.


  
Done.


  
You will find...


  
...I am kind.


  
Unlike the cruel Leonidas,
who demanded that you stand...


  
...I require only...


  
...that you kneel.


  
Beautiful night.


  
Yes, but I did not ask you here
for small talk, Theron.


  
You can be sure of that.


  
You never spared words with me.


  
Can I offer you something?
A drink, perhaps?


  
Is it poison?


  
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
it's only water.


  
I'm told it's been arranged for you
to go before the council.


  
Yes.


  
I need your help in winning votes
to send the army north to our king.


  
Yes.


  
I can see it,
the two of us standing together.


  
Me, politician. You, warrior.
Our voices as one.


  
But why would I want to do that?


  
It proves you care for a king who right now
fights for the very water we drink.


  
True.


  
But this is politics, not war.


  
Leonidas is an idealist.


  
I know your kind too well. You send men
to slaughter for your own gain.


  
Your husband, our king,
has taken 300 of our finest to slaughter.


  
He's broken our laws
and left without the council's consent.


  
- I'm simply a realist.
- You're an opportunist.


  
You're as foolish as Leonidas if you think
men don't have a price in this world.


  
All men are not created equal.
That's the Spartan code, my little queen.


  
I admire your passion.


  
But don't think that you...


  
...a woman, even a queen...


  
...can walk into the council chamber
and sway the minds of men.


  
I own that chamber...


  
...as if it were built with these hands.


  
I could crush
the life out of you right now.


  
You will go before the council,
but your words will fall on deaf ears.


  
Leonidas will receive no reinforcements,
and if he returns, without my help...


  
...he will go to jail or worse.


  
Do you love your Sparta?


  
Yes.


  
- And your king?
- I do.


  
Your husband fights for his land
and his love.


  
What do you have to offer...


  
...in return for my word
that I'll help you send our army north?


  
What does a realist want with his queen?


  
I think you know.


  
This will not be over quickly.


  
You will not enjoy this.


  
I'm not your king.


  
Dilios.


  
I trust that scratch
hasn't made you useless?


  
Hardly, my lord. It's just an eye.


  
The gods saw fit to grace me
with a spare.


  
My captain?


  
Curses the gods and mourns alone.


  
Leonidas!


  
We are undone.
Undone, I tell you. Destroyed.


  
Daxos, calm yourself.


  
Our hunchback traitor led Xerxes' lmmortals
to the hidden goat path behind us.


  
The Phocians you posted there
were scattered without a fight.


  
- This battle is over, Leonidas.
- This battle is over when I say it is over.


  
By morning, the lmmortals will surround us.
The Hot Gates will fall.


  
Spartans! Prepare for glory!


  
Glory? Have you gone mad?


  
There is no glory to be had now.


  
Only retreat or surrender. Or death.


  
Well, that's an easy choice
for us, Arcadian.


  
Spartans never retreat.
Spartans never surrender.


  
Go spread the word.


  
Let every Greek assembled
know the truth of this.


  
Let each among them
search his own soul.


  
And while you're at it, search your own.


  
My men will leave with me.


  
Godspeed, Leonidas.


  
Children!


  
Children.


  
Gather round.


  
No retreat, no surrender.


  
That is Spartan law.


  
And by Spartan law,
we will stand and fight...


  
...and die.


  
A new age has begun.


  
An age of freedom.


  
And all will know that 300 Spartans...


  
...gave their last breath to defend it.


  
My friend.


  
I have lived my entire life
without regret until now.


  
It's not that my son
gave up his life for his country.


  
It's just that I never told him
that I loved him the most.


  
That he stood by me with honor.


  
That he was all that was best in me.


  
My heart is broken for your loss.


  
Heart?


  
I have filled my heart...


  
...with hate.


  
Good.


  
Dilios...


  
...let's take a walk.


  
Yes, my lord.


  
But, sire, I am fit and ready for battle.


  
That you are, one of the finest.


  
But you have another talent
unlike any other Spartan.


  
You will deliver my final orders
to the council...


  
...with force and verve.


  
Tell them our story.


  
Make every Greek know
what happened here.


  
You'll have a grand tale to tell.


  
A tale of victory.


  
Victory.


  
Yes, my lord.


  
Sire, any message...?


  
For the queen?


  
None that need be spoken.


  
Hundreds leave.


  
A handful stay.


  
Only one looks back.


  
Spartans!


  
Ready your breakfast and eat hearty...


  
...for tonight we dine in hell!


  
May I give the floor now...


  
...to the wife of Leonidas
and queen of Sparta.


  
- What's this?
- This is nothing.


  
Councilmen...


  
...I stand before you
not only as your queen.


  
I come to you as a mother.


  
I come to you as a wife.


  
I come to you as a Spartan woman.


  
I come to you with great humility.


  
I am not here to represent Leonidas.


  
His actions speak louder
than my words ever could.


  
I am here for all those voices
which cannot be heard.


  
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons.


  
Three hundred families
that bleed for our rights...


  
...and for the very principles
this room was built upon.


  
We are at war, gentlemen.


  
We must send the entire Spartan army
to aid our king...


  
...in the preservation of not just ourselves,
but of our children.


  
Send the army
for the preservation of liberty.


  
Send it for justice.


  
Send it for law and order.


  
Send it for reason.


  
But most importantly,
send our army for hope.


  
Hope that a king and his men have not
been wasted to the pages of history.


  
That their courage bonds us together.


  
That we are made stronger
by their actions...


  
...and that your choices today
reflect their bravery.


  
Three hundred.


  
We must send them.


  
Moving...


  
...eloquent, passionate.


  
But it doesn't change the fact
that your husband has brought war upon us.


  
You are wrong.
Xerxes brought it forth...


  
...and before that,
his father Darius at Marathon.


  
The Persians will not stop...


  
...until the only shelter we will find
is rubble and chaos.


  
This chamber needs no
history lesson, my queen.


  
Then what is the lesson
you would like to leave?


  
Shall I begin to enumerate all of them?


  
Honor. Duty. Glory.


  
You speak of honor, duty and glory?


  
But what of adultery?


  
- How dare you.
- How dare I?


  
Watch her carefully.


  
She is a trickster in true form.


  
Do not play with the members
of this sacred chamber, my queen.


  
Just hours ago,
you offered yourself to me.


  
Were I a weaker man,
I would have her scent on me still.


  
- This is outrage.
- Oh, the hypocrite speaks!


  
Did you not receive a similar payment,
which you took...


  
...in exchange for her having an audience
with these noble men?


  
- That is a lie.
- Is it?


  
Was he not, by your invitation,
asked to come to the king's bedchamber?


  
The very bed where you attempted
to negotiate with me so vigorously?


  
You look shocked.
A bribe of the flesh, gentlemen...


  
...while her husband
promotes anarchy and war.


  
He speaks truth.


  
Words escape
even the most cunning tongue...


  
...my little whore queen.


  
What queen-like behavior.


  
Remove her from this chamber
before she infects us further...


  
...with her inglorious and shabby self.


  
This will not be over quickly.


  
You will not enjoy this.
I am not your queen.


  
Traitor.


  
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!


  
Traitor!


  
Leonidas, my compliments
and congratulations.


  
You surely have turned calamity
into victory.


  
Despite your insufferable arrogance...


  
...the god-king has come
to admire Spartan valor and fighting skill.


  
You will make a mighty ally.


  
Yield, Leonidas.


  
Use your reason. Think of your men.


  
I beg you.


  
Listen to your fellow Greek.


  
He can attest
to the divine one's generosity.


  
Despite your several insults,
despite your horrid blasphemies...


  
...the lord of hosts
is prepared to forgive all...


  
...and more, to reward your service.


  
You fight for your lands.


  
Keep them.


  
You fight for Sparta.


  
She will be wealthier and more powerful
than ever before.


  
You fight for your kingship.


  
You will be proclaimed warlord
of all Greece...


  
...answerable only
to the one true master of the world.


  
Leonidas, your victory will be complete...


  
...if you but lay down your arms...


  
...and kneel to holy Xerxes.


  
It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf in the winter cold.


  
And now, as then,
it's not fear that grips him...


  
... only restlessness.
A heightened sense of things.


  
The seaborne breeze coolly kissing
the sweat at his chest and neck.


  
Gulls cawing...


  
... complaining even as they feast
on the thousands of floating dead.


  
The steady breathing
of the 300 at his back...


  
... ready to die for him
without a moment's pause.


  
Every one of them...


  
... ready to die.


  
His helmet is stifling.


  
His shield is heavy.


  
Your spear.


  
You there...


  
...Ephialtes.


  
May you live forever.


  
Leonidas, your spear.


  
Stelios!


  
Slaughter them!


  
His helmet was stifling.


  
It narrowed his vision,
and he must see far.


  
His shield was heavy.
It threw him off balance...


  
... and his target is far away.


  
The old ones say we Spartans
are descended from Hercules himself.


  
Bold Leonidas gives testament
to our bloodline.


  
His roar is long and loud.


  
My king.


  
It's an honor to die at your side.


  
It's an honor to have lived at yours.


  
My queen!


  
My wife.


  
My love.


  
"Remember us."


  
As simple an order as a king can give.


  
"Remember why we died."


  
For he did not wish tribute or song...


  
...nor monuments,
nor poems of war and valor.


  
His wish was simple.


  
"Remember us"...


  
...he said to me.


  
That was his hope.


  
Should any free soul
come across that place...


  
... in all the countless
centuries yet to be...


  
... may all our voices...


  
... whisper to you
from the ageless stones.


  
Go tell the Spartans, passerby...


  
... that here, by Spartan law, we lie.


  
And so my king died...


  
... and my brothers died...


  
...barely a year ago.


  
Long I pondered my king's
cryptic talk of victory.


  
Time has proven him wise.


  
For from free Greek to free Greek...


  
...the word was spread
that bold Leonidas and his 300...


  
...so far from home...


  
...laid down their lives
not just for Sparta...


  
...but for all Greece
and the promise this country holds.


  
Now, here on this rugged patch of earth
called Plataea...


  
...Xerxes' hordes face obliteration!


  
Just there the barbarians huddle...


  
...sheer terror gripping tight their hearts...


  
...with icy fingers...


  
...knowing full well
what merciless horrors they suffered...


  
...at the swords and spears of 300.


  
Yet they stare now across the plain
at 10,000 Spartans...


  
...commanding 30,000 free Greeks!


  
The enemy outnumber us
a paltry three to one.


  
Good odds for any Greek.


  
This day, we rescue a world
from mysticism and tyranny...


  
...and usher in a future
brighter than anything we can imagine.


  
Give thanks, men...


  
...to Leonidas and the brave 300.


  
To victory!


It's going. It's going.


  
And it's gone.


  
Whatever.


  
Maybe we should take a break.


  
That's it. I can't take this anymore.


  
I can't. I give up.


  
I'm sick of struggling for survival.


  
Competing with gophers and
earthworms and that loser sparrow...


  
...who always takes my nuts.


  
And I'm especially sick of this stupid...


  
...stupid tree.


  
-What's happening?
-Guys.


  
I think he made it angry.


  
I'm awake.


  
I'm up...


  
...and I'm late.


  
Demo. Dave Seville.


  
Keys. Bag.


  
Pants.


  
I need pants. Pants are essential.


  
Claire.


  
-Dave.
-Hey.


  
How's it going?


  
I haven't seen you since....


  
Well, since you said you never wanted
to see me again.


  
So I guess it worked.


  
What a fun day that was.


  
Let me guess.
You're late for something again.


  
-Same old Dave.
-Not following you.


  
You know,
the guy who's always fooling around...


  
...who can't handle
a serious relationship.


  
That was the old Dave.


  
How about we get together,
talk about the new Dave?


  
Tomorrow night. My place.


  
-I....
-Great.


  
-No--
-You look good, Claire.


  
Where are we?


  
Well, I think they remodeled our forest.
I like it. Stylish, yet functional.


  
Where did the mountains go?


  
Give me a break.
We're in a building, Theodore.


  
Dave.


  
-Ian.
-Hey, big guy.


  
Hey, you ever seen the view
from the 80th floor?


  
-No. They never let me past the lobby.
-What? I can't....


  
Hey, back off, man,
this is Dave Seville.


  
Mr. Seville, can I offer you
some muffins, scones, pastries?


  
No. I'd hate to be a bother.


  
It's no problem.
We have an omelet station.


  
Omelet station.


  
Can I get you some water
or a soy latte?


  
How about a shot
of wheatgrass juice?


  
Maybe later. Thanks.


  
let's talk about your song, Dave.


  
Well, as crazy as it sounds...


  
-...the original inspiration came to me--
-The song sucks, Dave.


  
-What?
-Your song? It's awful. I hate it.


  
You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it?
Justin, Fergie? Not a chance.


  
I need something new.
I need something fresh.


  
-That is new.
-The next big thing.


  
Dave, we go way back, all right?


  
And we've both come a long way
since college. You? Not so much.


  
I wanted to like that song,
but you heard it. Not that good.


  
If I wasn't your friend,
I'd say:


  
''Dave, you go right back
out of this office...


  
...and you keep writing music.
You'll get there someday.''


  
But I am your friend,
so I'm going to tell you...


  
...that there is no sense
in writing songs...


  
...that no one is ever,
ever going to sing.


  
Ever?


  
Excuse me.


  
Can I get some of that water?


  
We ran out.


  
Hey!


  
-Out of the way.
-Alvin...


  
-...slow down.
-Move your butt, Theodore.


  
You stepped on my tail.


  
Last one to the door is roadkill.


  
I'm in.


  
What are these shiny things?


  
Theodore, we're leaving now.


  
Okay, this wasn't my best idea.
Look out!


  
Maniac!


  
Back to tree. Back to tree.


  
Back to the dog. Back to the dog!


  
-Basket! Three o'clock.
-Which way is 3 o'clock?


  
-This way.
-Guys, wait for me.


  
Wait up.
I still have baby fat, you know.


  
-Jump. You've gotta really want it.
-I want it.


  
-I want it.
-I can't hang like this all day.


  
Will you jump already?


  
Muffins.


  
Gross. Is this his house?


  
No. It's his garbage can.


  
This must be where he stores
his food for winter.


  
As it came down to one--


  
Boa has the mouse trapped on a branch
with no way out.


  
As the boa moves in for the attack...


  
...the mouse
seems to be facing certain death.


  
The boa's sensitive tongue
tastes the victim's presence.


  
The mouse crashes
through the foliage.


  
Come on, baby. Come to papa!


  
Hello, gorgeous.


  
We've hit the mother lode.


  
--tropical rainforest
where food is bountiful.


  
This is the greatest day of my life.


  
Eureka! I found the cheese balls.


  
Alvin, what are you doing?
Don't make a mess.


  
Cannonball.


  
Quick. Hide.


  
Hurry, you guys.


  
Did I put these here?


  
There you are. I got you.


  
He's been out for quite a while.


  
You guys, he's dead.


  
Don't panic. Wipe everything down.


  
I need three garbage bags, a shovel,
some disinfectant...


  
...some latex gloves and oregano, go!


  
Hang on, Sherlock. He's coming to.


  
I must be hearing things.


  
Oh, this is trippy.


  
Sir, are you all right?


  
Get back!


  
Squirrels can't talk.


  
Hey.


  
Watch it, genius.


  
We are chipmunks. Chipmunks.


  
Chipmunks can't talk either.


  
Our lips are moving
and words are coming out.


  
This is not happening.


  
I am not talking to chipmunks.
I am not talking to chipmunks.


  
So how's that working for you, Dave?


  
How do you know my name?


  
I'll field that one.
We read your mail. By accident.


  
You really ought to pay
that utility bill, Dave.


  
-You ever heard of a credit rating?
-What's this thing?


  
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Stop doing-- Turn that off.


  
Sorry.


  
He fell out of the tree at birth.


  
Can all animals talk?


  
Well, I believe fish
have this type of sign language.


  
Hey, Dave, do all humans have houses
that smell like sweat socks?


  
Dave likes to wear


  
Dirty underwear with little hairs


  
We're getting off on the wrong foot.


  
Allow us to introduce ourselves.


  
Hello, I'm Simon, the smart one.


  
-He's Alvin.
-The awesomest one.


  
And I'm Theodore.


  
Oh, nice to meet you.
Now get out of my house.


  
But we talk.


  
Which makes me want you
out of my house that much more.


  
It's creepy. Unnatural. Somewhat evil.


  
I kind of liked him better
when he was unconscious.


  
-Gotcha.
-Hey.


  
Don't do this, Dave.


  
We can gnaw right through this door.


  
Hi.


  
Oh, were we disturbing you?


  
What, you guys can sing too?


  
That's not singing. This is singing.


  
This is amazing.


  
Here, everyone inside.


  
-There you go.
-Thank you.


  
All right, here's the deal.


  
You guys sing my songs,
you get to sleep here.


  
No. Wait. Is breakfast included?


  
I can live with that.


  
What about TV privileges?


  
Okay, but not after 7.


  
-Eight.
-Done.


  
But don't tell your animal friends,
because I don't wanna come home...


  
...and find rabbits
and skunks on my couch.


  
Filthy creatures, Dave.
Never associate with them.


  
Yeah, you're our only friend.


  
No, no, no.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.


  
Let's just start with me
being your songwriter.


  
Let me ask you.
Have you ever written a song before?


  
-Yup.
-And is that your music stuff outside?


  
Yup.


  
Oh, no!


  
Hurry back.


  
So, fellas, all we gotta do
is find the right song, rehearse--


  
-Hey, Dave.
-Simon.


  
My bad.


  
This is my sheet music.


  
Alvin.


  
This is not a Hula-Hoop.
It's a towel rack.


  
-Killjoy.
-Are you guys always like this?


  
We're kids, Dave.


  
Well, where are your parents?


  
When you're a chipmunk, your parents
take care of you for a week.


  
Then they take off.


  
Our parents were hippies.
They left early to join a commune.


  
-I am Robert the Robot.
-Help! Crazy robot. Help! It's after me!


  
-It's after me.
-Hey. Hey. Be careful with that.


  
-Sorry.
-It's a collectible.


  
-I got it for Christmas last year.
-Christmas! We love Christmas.


  
Even though we've never
actually celebrated it.


  
But we want to.


  
Yeah, you can never go wrong
with Christmas.


  
Oh, maybe we can celebrate it
with you.


  
Yeah, maybe.


  
Look, I've had a long and weird day,
so off to bed.


  
Come on.


  
We start work tomorrow.


  
I want you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed by 8.


  
My tail isn't bushy till 9.


  
Not my problem. Now go to sleep.


  
I hope Christmas comes fast.


  
Me too.


  
Want a plane that loops the loop?


  
Loop.


  
Hoop.


  
Hula-Hoop.


  
Here's trouble. Fire in the hole!


  
What are you guys doing?


  
Nothing. What are you doing?


  
Stand back, Dave. She's gonna blow!


  
I got it. I got it, guys. Come to papa.


  
-Hey. Where did it go?
-Simon, this landed right in front of you.


  
You didn't see it?


  
How many fingers am I holding up?


  
Four. No, no, no.
Eight? Counting your thumb?


  
-Wait, wait, wait--
-Hang on a second.


  
Six. Final answer is six.


  
Try these.


  
How's that?


  
Someone trashed your house.


  
It was clean


  
Well, we colored for a while,
but then we got hungry.


  
Wanna see what we colored?


  
Actually, I wanna play you
something.


  
I wrote a song
for you guys to sing, so let's--


  
We've put a few toaster waffles
aside for winter.


  
And we're not sharing.


  
Guys, we're gonna have food all winter,
so if you start storing it...


  
...it's gonna get gross
and we're gonna have rodent....


  
Bad, you know,
non-talking rodents around here.


  
Let's go. Let's get to work.


  
All right, you chipmunks.
Ready to sing your song?


  
-I'll say we are.
-Yeah. Let's sing it now.


  
-Ready, Simon?
-Okay.


  
-Ready, Theodore?
-Okay.


  
Alvin?


  
Alvin?


  
This kicks a hamster wheel's butt.


  
Alvin!


  
Okay!


  
Christmas, Christmastime is near


  
Time for toys and time for cheer


  
We've been good, but we can't last


  
Hurry, Christmas, hurry fast


  
Want a plane that loops the loop


  
Me, I want a Hula-Hoop


  
We can't hardly stand the wait


  
Please, Christmas, don't be late


  
What?


  
Dave Seville's in the lobby.


  
He says he won't leave
without seeing you.


  
That loser again?


  
-Dave.
-Ian.


  
-Okay.
-I've got something for you.


  
-It's your next big thing.
-Dave.


  
Don't say anything.


  
What the...?


  
Dave, don't do this to yourself, man.


  
They sing.


  
No. They don't.


  
They do. Just give me a second.


  
Come on, guys.


  
Want a plane that loops the loop


  
Me, I want a Hula-Hoop


  
You know, Dave...


  
...some people might say
it's kind of weird...


  
...that a grown man
would want a Hula-Hoop.


  
And others would say,
''You know what's weirder than that?


  
A grown man bringing
another grown man...


  
...a big box
with a bunch of chipmunks in it...


  
...who not only speak English
but can sing.''


  
They do sing.
We've been practicing all morning.


  
Oh, you've been practicing.
I never realized. Okay, well.


  
Yeah. Okay, no.
Dave, I'm going to pretend...


  
...that I have a lunch to go to.


  
I've got a lunch to go to.


  
What was that?


  
Nothing. Nothing.
Just a little stage fright.


  
I thought my heart
was gonna explode.


  
We're not performing monkeys.


  
Why do we have to sing
for that guy?


  
Well, how's this?


  
Pretend I need the money
and I hate my job...


  
...and you're staying at my place,
so you owe me.


  
We're sorry, Dave.


  
Yeah, that helps.


  
Never mind. I'm late for work.


  
Can we go with you?


  
What, so you can mess that up too?


  
You're going home.


  
Can I stand in your lap and steer?


  
Oh, can we at least beep the horn?


  
Never mind.


  
So sorry about the delay.
It should be a couple more minutes.


  
But we're building the suspense.


  
-Here he is.
-Sorry I'm late.


  
Boy, am I jazzed about our
Yum-able Energy Bars commercial.


  
That's Good-able Energy Bar
commercial.


  
Right, Good-able.


  
Okay, here's the pitch.


  
We open on a group of lethargic kids.


  
Close-up on a little girl's face.
She's sad.


  
Our customers don't like to think
of their kids as being sad.


  
Could she be flying a kite?


  
I like kites.


  
Good.


  
Okay, great. She's flying a kite.


  
She's running with a kite.
She's running out of steam.


  
She's tired and lets go of the kite.


  
Oh, no. We see her face, it's sad.


  
-But not too sad.
-Right.


  
So she pulls out
her Good-able Energy Bar--


  
It's my mom. Sorry.


  
-Hi, Mom.
-A little situation, Dave.


  
Theodore vacuumed up Alvin.


  
-Alvin.
-Dave, help!


  
-What?
-At least it wasn't the garbage disposal.


  
Just stay calm.


  
And there goes Theodore.


  
Look, I can't do this right now, okay?


  
I absolutely understand but--
Sorry, Dave?


  
Quick question.


  
How do you feel about an indoor pool?


  
Look, if you flood my house,
you're dead.


  
Out on the street, capiche?


  
Mothers.


  
Why don't we come over here
and look at the sales projections?


  
You know, when I first saw these
numbers, I thought there's just no way...


  
...but then I looked again.


  
The ''size of Theodore's butt''?


  
Why don't we come back to that?


  
Anyway, 10 years ago, the market share
for healthy food snacks...


  
...was imperceptible
among 6- to 12-year-olds.


  
''How smart Simon thinks he is''?


  
Yeah, as opposed to
how smart he actually is.


  
Who's Simon?


  
-I didn't--
-Just move it along.


  
You know what?
I think I'll just clean out my office.


  
Sounds good.


  
SpongeBob. You're 15 minutes late.


  
Sorry, Mr. Krabs,
I was out all night looking for Gary.


  
He got away. Well....


  
Guys. What's this about?


  
Obviously, Theodore's butt.


  
We told you we colored.


  
On my presentation boards?
You got me fired.


  
We didn't know.


  
-We're sorry, Dave.
-Oh, you're sorry? That's fantastic.


  
Sorry doesn't get my job back, now,
does it, Theodore?


  
Why are my clothes all over the place?


  
We used them to mop up the water.
Good idea, right?


  
Oh, my God. Theodore, did you just--?


  
It's a raisin, Dave.


  
Prove it.


  
Okay, you got me.


  
I wanna talk to all you guys.
Where's Alvin?


  
-Alvin?
-You owe me bigtime.


  
Alvin.


  
Come on. Come on.


  
There's this new thing.
It's called knocking.


  
-Get out.
-I'm waiting for the rinse cycle.


  
-Out.
-I'm taking a shower here.


  
You know,
if I made a list of my worst days ever...


  
...today would be at the top
of the list.


  
And it's still early.


  
Clam it, sudsy.


  
Okay. Guys, let me just put it
to you like this, okay?


  
I have no job, no career, my house
is always a mess. Thank you very much.


  
Hi, Dave. It's Claire Wilson calling.
And why did I just say my last name?


  
That was weird. I guess I'm just a little
nervous about coming over for dinner.


  
-Dinner.
-So, yeah. I'm gonna hang up now.


  
I'll be there at 7. Okay. Bye.


  
That's half an hour.


  
Who's Claire?


  
Claire is Dave's mate.


  
She is not my mate.


  
She's my ex-mate.


  
Okay. This is great.


  
Dave. Dave, relax.


  
You just go get the food.
We'll take care of the rest.


  
Why am I having a hard time
believing you?


  
That hurts, Dave. That really hurts.


  
-Yeah. We're all in this together, Dave.
-Like a family.


  
No. Not like a family.


  
Tick-tock, Dave. Better bust a move.


  
Right.


  
We also do offices
and recreational vehicles.


  
What's that smell?


  
It's your cologne.


  
What did you do?
Dump the entire bottle on the rug?


  
We Call it scenting the area.


  
I gotta admit I'm surprised.


  
The place looks great.


  
Well, Dave, we chipmunks
are notoriously tidy.


  
Yeah, I see that.


  
-Those bread sticks smell great.
-Yeah.


  
So when's dinner?


  
Guys, I don't know
how to tell you this...


  
...but it's just gonna be Claire and me.


  
Hold the phone, Dave.


  
-We can't have--
-No.


  
-Even if we--
-No.


  
-We thought it--
-And no. Look, in the other room.


  
Jeez.


  
What a buzzkill, man.


  
-I never knew you could cook this well.
-It's all about slow roasting.


  
It takes longer.
But when it comes to flavor, why rush?


  
Well, I'm impressed.


  
-I've been seeing your photos.
-Yeah, it's going really great.


  
How about you, how's your job?


  
Great. Loving it.


  
How do you think it's going?


  
Terrible. They're not even sniffing
each other.


  
Alvin. Dave said that--


  
Dave needs a little help
from the love doctor.


  
And his assistant.


  
Get back here.


  
You know, this is nice.


  
Just two friends having dinner.
Hanging out.


  
No pressure. Nothing weird.


  
My stereo does that all the time.
It's like it has a mind of its own.


  
You were saying?


  
Oh, nothing. I was just a little nervous
about coming over here.


  
I wasn't sure if you thought
this was a date or something.


  
A date? No.


  
The wiring in my unit is shot.


  
You should get an electrician
to fix that.


  
I don't need anyone
to fix anything for me.


  
Okay.


  
Could you excuse me for a moment?
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.


  
Hey.


  
Look, I know what you guys
are up to. Alvin.


  
-Breath check.
-Where's al--?


  
Dave, are you okay?


  
Everything's fine.


  
Why did you do that?


  
I was just trying to help, Dave.
You have garlic breath.


  
Well, stop helping.
You're ruining everything.


  
I think I got something in my eye.


  
Here. Let me see.


  
Yeah. It looks really irritated.
It's so red. What happened?


  
What was that?


  
Oh, I thought I saw a rat.


  
-A rat?
-Probably nothing.


  
Here, let's finish eating, huh?


  
Tomorrow, I'm gonna call
the exterminator.


  
-What?
-Claire.


  
Dave? Dave?


  
-Tell her she completes you.
-What are you doing?


  
-You got it, Dave.
-Dave.


  
Dave, let go.


  
I'm sorry, Claire. It's just....


  
I lost my job, Claire.


  
And I guess I just needed a hug.


  
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Tell me what happened.


  
Well, this is gonna sound
really strange.


  
No games. No fooling around.


  
-The truth?
-Please, I'm begging you.


  
My life is being sabotaged
by talking chipmunks.


  
-You know what?
-I'm not crazy, I swear.


  
You haven't changed at all.


  
Wait. Claire. Don't go. I can explain.


  
Chipmunks.


  
You should've kissed her, Dave.


  
She wanted you.


  
Alvin, you're not helping.


  
Don't give up, Dave.


  
Go away. Leave me alone.


  
Dave, would you like a cookie?


  
I said, leave me alone.


  
Is it me, or was he a little mad?


  
I wonder, is Dave mad? Yes.


  
He really did have garlic breath.


  
Yeah, well-played, guys.


  
Idea.


  
Who has cab fare?


  
Cab fare?
We don't even have pockets.


  
Dear fellas, I'm sorry,
but this isn't really working out.


  
I don't know what made me think
I could handle you guys...


  
...when I can barely manage
my own life.


  
You should go back to your real home
in the forest.


  
That's what's best for all of us.


  
I'm sorry it has to be this way, but....


  
Guys?


  
Simon, Theodore?


  
Guys?


  
Alvin?


  
Alvin!


  
Simon?


  
Theodore?


  
Alvin?


  
Alvin.


  
Hello?


  
Hello?


  
Kids.


  
Christmas, Christmastime is near


  
Time for toys and time for cheer


  
We can't hardly stand the wait


  
Please, Christmas, don't be late


  
Welcome to Jett Records.


  
Okay. New rule.
No going out after 9.


  
And not at all unless
I know where you're going.


  
Were you worried about us, Dave?


  
No. I just need to know, that's all.


  
Wait. If you're not worried,
then why do you need to know?


  
I need to know, okay?


  
Alvin.


  
Oh, sorry about that. Yeah.


  
-Sorry.
-Kids, huh?


  
They keep you on your toes.
Do you have any?


  
Three boys.


  
Well, some days
are better than others.


  
And some days
you just wanna close them in a box...


  
...leave the box in the park
and run away, you know?


  
Quick, hide.


  
Guys, what's all this?


  
Toaster waffles.


  
You know, I can't afford
all these toaster waffles.


  
-What?
-Well, in case you didn't notice...


  
...I don't have a job anymo--


  
My song?


  
-All right.
-Yeah.


  
-Hello?
-Hey, Dave.


  
Hey, how's my favorite songwriter?


  
-Ian?
-Tell me you've heard the song.


  
Yeah. I'm listening to it right now.


  
How did you--? When did--?


  
Speed of business, baby.
That's how we do it. That's how I roll.


  
Got a friend in satellite radio,
put it in immediate rotation.


  
And that video of your little guys,
10 million hits already on YouTube.


  
It's crazy. I gotta go.


  
Hey, put some clothes on those guys.
It's kind of embarrassing.


  
We owed you, Dave.


  
So we're good
with the toaster waffles, right? Dave?


  
Soup's on.


  
Alvin.


  
So, what do you think?


  
Cool.


  
All right.


  
Toothbrush, huh? Okay.


  
No.


  
Dave...


  
...are you awake?


  
I am now.


  
I had a nightmare.


  
Can I sleep with you?


  
You won't even know I'm here.


  
Okay. Sure.
But stay on that side of the bed.


  
Oh, okay.


  
Theodore, that's not your side
of the bed.


  
-Theodore, wake up. It's Christmas.
-Come on, man. It's Christmas.


  
Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.


  
On the first day of Christmas
Dave woke up


  
Come on, man, it's Christmas.
Hallelujah.


  
Wake up, lazy bones.


  
Oh, yeah. Christmas.


  
-Up and at them.
-You can sleep when you're dead.


  
-I'm coming
-Come on, Dave.


  
Hurry up, Dad.


  
-Dad?
-Dave. I said Dave.


  
This is shaping up to be
my favorite Christmas ever.


  
-You want to open mine first.
-Open mine first.


  
-No, Dave, mine is better.
-You guys got me presents?


  
Of course.


  
All right. Simon?


  
Wow, it's a--


  
It's a paper-clip compass.


  
A paper-clip compass.
Now I'll never get lost.


  
Me next.


  
Alvin.


  
-My wallet.
-Do you like it?


  
really? I wanted to get you something
you'd use every day.


  
And I have been using this
for almost 10 years now.


  
Very thoughtful, Alvin. Thank you.


  
Yeah, the look on your face
says it all, Dave.


  
Oh, nicely done, Theodore.
''To Dav.''


  
Let's see, it says, ''Merry Christmas.
Love, Theodore.''


  
And it's got a nice picture
of some pineapples?


  
Those aren't pineapples.
That's our family.


  
Look, fellas. Let's make sure
we understand each other here.


  
I'm not your....


  
You know,
your dad or anything, right?


  
But you're like a dad.


  
Well, not really.


  
I mean, we're friends for sure.


  
And I write your music, you know,
manage your career.


  
-Make us sweaters.
-Feed us.


  
Let us sleep in your bed
when we have nightmares.


  
That's what friends do.


  
So who wants to open their presents?


  
-Is that a trick question? We do.
-Yeah.


  
-Presents.
-Oh, boy.


  
Presents. Presents. Presents.


  
I can't wait to open mine first.


  
Envelopes.


  
They're savings bonds.


  
Cool.


  
You know, in seven years, you're
gonna get to buy something really nice.


  
Do you maybe have any
that you bought seven years ago?


  
-Alvin, manners.
-Thank you, Dave.


  
Yeah. Thanks, Dave.


  
-Ian?
-Who wants presents?


  
-All right.
-Cool.


  
Hey, there's plenty more
where this came from.


  
Bring them on in, fellas.


  
-Oh, yeah.
-Jackpot.


  
What are you doing?


  
-Taking care of my boys.
-Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.


  
Weird. What happened
to your presents?


  
-Which one is mine?
-That big one is for me, I think.


  
What did you get them?


  
Savings bonds.


  
Great. Just what every kid dreams of.


  
You're in luck.
Your uncle Ian came through.


  
-Cool.
-uncle Ian?


  
Is-- Is this for me?


  
No, it's for Simon.


  
-Theodore.
-Oh, boy.


  
-And Alvin.
-Thank you, Santa.


  
This is for you.
You like the Oak Ridge Boys, right?


  
Yeah, you're welcome.


  
And guess what, guys.


  
uncle Ian is gonna have
a big launch party for the new CD.


  
That's right. Press, paparazzi.
Hollywood hotshots.


  
The whole nine yards.


  
-Awesome.
-Sweet.


  
Yeah. Dave, you've got one week
to write me a new hit single.


  
All right? Something funky and fresh.


  
-Peace. We out.
-Bye, uncle Ian.


  
-Merry Christmas.
-Now it really is Christmas.


  
Mayday, mayday.


  
This way, this way, this way.


  
All right. All right. Settle in, settle in.
Thank you for coming.


  
It is a very special night tonight.


  
Here at Jett Records, we pride ourselves
on bringing you tomorrow's music today.


  
Oh, and guess what. I did it again.


  
Ladies and gentlemen,
here to sing their new hit single...


  
...give it up
for Alvin, Simon and Theodore.


  
Yeah, in the place to be


  
Chipmunks on the M-I-C
"Witch Doctor"


  




  
Everybody, can they do it?


  
Can they do it?


  
Come on, people, let's get to it


  
Let's get to it


  
Come on, shake, come on, roll
Everybody hit the floor


  
Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go


  
I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you


  
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me too


  
And then the witch doctor
He told me what to do


  
He said:
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah


  
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang


  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang


  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah


  
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang


  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang


  
Yo, DJ, pump this party!


  
Everybody, can they do it?


  
-Can they do it?
-Go! Go! Go!


  
Come on, people, let's get to it


  
Go! Go! Go!


  
Come on, shake, come on, roll
Everybody hit the floor


  
Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go


  
Alvin! Simon! Theodore!


  
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me true


  
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me nice


  
And then the witch doctor
He gave me this advice


  
He said to me:


  
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang


  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang


  
You've been keeping love from me


  
-And that's not very smart
-Not very smart


  
I went out and found myself someone
Who'd tell me how to win your heart


  
My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to say


  
My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to do


  
I know that you'll be mine
When I say this to you


  
-Oh, baby, baby!
-Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah


  
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang


  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang


  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah


  
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang


  
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang


  
Yeah.


  
All right, party people.
You know how we do it.


  
Get on that dance floor,
let me see what you got.


  
-Thank you.
-Thank you.


  
-You mind if I grab a few pics?
-Claire.


  
-Not at all. Fire away.
-Great.


  
I've got a new assignment.
I'm covering your rise to fame.


  
-Oh, this is Alvin, Simon and Theodore.
-Hi.


  
-Hello.
-Hi, Claire.


  
You're hot.


  
Forgot you guys haven't officially met.


  
So, Dave...


  
...I'm sorry about that night.
I really thought that you--


  
That I was insane?


  
I totally understand it.


  
Talking chipmunks.
It's a lot to take in over dinner.


  
But look at you now. You've got
the career, promising future, kids.


  
You're like a family.


  
Don't say ''family'' in front of Dave.
It gives him gas.


  
-Like, clear-the-room gas.
-Does not.


  
He doesn't want a family.


  
Why don't you guys go and play
or raid the dessert table?


  
Don't take it personally, you guys.


  
Some people don't know a good thing
when they've got it.


  
Right, Dave?


  
Claire.


  
No offense, big guy,
but you are not good at this.


  
Hey, what do you think of this?


  
-What is it?
-It's Alvin.


  
That looks nothing like Alvin.


  
Well, yeah. It's a prototype.
We'll sell a million of these things.


  
It's voice-activated.
Here, say something to it.


  
Hello, ugly little Alvin doll
that looks nothing like Alvin.


  
-See? You love it. It's Spanish.
-You know what? That's just weird.


  
Come on, Dave, Dave, Dave.


  
We've got to expand
the Munks' fan base.


  
I mean, forget about the music.


  
The music is but a means
to the big money, okay?


  
I'm talking about our own
fur clothing line, cologne.


  
-I mean--
-They're just kids.


  
No, they're rats.


  
And they could make us both
so much money...


  
-...if you just let me work with them.
-I can't hear you, the music's too loud.


  
Don't go against me on this, Dave.
I never lose.


  
Has anyone tried
the chocolate meatballs?


  
I'll probably go into insulin shock.
But it's worth it.


  
Oh, a sweet, sweet,
sweet molasses meat.


  
Hey, alvster. Love the song, bro.


  
-Up top.
-What's up, player?


  
So I see you're enjoying my little spread
that I've put out for you guys.


  
What am I talking about?
You probably eat like this all the time.


  
Well, Dave says
he doesn't wanna spoil us.


  
Dude, you're a rock star.
You're supposed to be spoiled.


  
I mean, you should be riding
in limousines and private planes.


  
And you should be going to parties
like this every night.


  
really?
Because Dave says we need our sleep.


  
Look, Alvin, this is hard to say
but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it.


  
Dave's holding you back, you know.
I could be making you 20 large a day.


  
-Is that a lot?
-Yes.


  
Another thing-- I'm not gonna tell you.
I will tell you.


  
Look, behind your back,
Dave Calls you...


  
...''the rats.''


  
-Rats?
-Yeah. Whatever, right? I know.


  
Well, don't let it bother you.
I mean, me? I consider you boys family.


  
And if there's anything you need,
anything at all...


  
...give your uncle Ian a call, all right?


  
-Oh, right.
-Ciao.


  
Come on, pal.
You drive like my grandmother.


  
Get a wheelchair. Move over!


  
Hey, guys, look at me.
Up, up and away.


  
Alvin.


  
Can't help you, Simon.
I'm about to take the lead here.


  
Hey, guys,
I have an idea for a new song.


  
Hey, Dave.


  
What's going on in here?
I thought I told you guys to clean up.


  
We are.


  
-Who's that?
-uncle Ian hired us a housekeeper.


  
She's also a masseuse.


  
Come on, move over, road hog.


  
Drive it or park it, pal.
Get in the slow lane.


  
-Where did you get that game?
-uncle Ian.


  
Move it or lose it!
Get some training wheels, buddy.


  
Okay, you know what?


  
That's enough.


  
What are you doing?
I was about to beat my high score.


  
Too bad. Where's Theodore?


  
Spit it out.


  
-Spit it out.
-No.


  
Jett Records.


  
Okay. That's it. Meeting. Now.
Everyone on the couch.


  
Could you give us a minute?


  
Guys, look, it's hard, I know.


  
Three months ago, you were hanging out
in a tree somewhere and now you're--


  
Major rock stars.


  
Okay. Whatever.
My point is just because you're--


  
Major rock stars.


  
Doesn't mean you can have or do
whatever you want.


  
Well, uncle Ian says
we should always be happy.


  
Okay, you know what?


  
He's not your uncle.


  
He also, David, said
that we should be making $20 a day.


  
Guess what.
You're making way more than that.


  
And because I care,
I'm putting it all away for you.


  
Just like storing nuts for the winter.


  
Oh, winter's for losers.


  
Yeah. shouldn't we have a say
in how to build our investment portfolio?


  
Where is all this coming from?
You guys are just kids.


  
-Kids, Dave, or rats?
-What?


  
Well, uncle Ian says
we're like his family.


  
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you love uncle Ian so much...


  
...and don't think I'm watching out
for you...


  
...why don't you go live
with Uncle Ian?


  
Dave?


  
Are you still mad at us?


  
Dave?


  
''Dear fellas, I'm sorry, but....


  
You should go back
to your real home in the forest.''


  
I guess he really does want us to go.


  
I told you, Dave.


  
I never lose.


  
Boys, welcome to your new home.


  
-Oh, yeah. Daddy's home.
-Yeah.


  
Can we play with all this stuff?


  
Sure, why not? It's your house.


  
So, what are the rules around here?


  
Oh, I do have one rule...


  
-...that there are no rules!
-Cool.


  
Four degrees elevation.


  
Six degrees azimuth.


  
Fire!


  
Prepare to face the fury
of my vengeance.


  
Don't make me laugh.


  
Pray for a quick demise,
young chipmunk.


  
Uppercut. Left. Fake-out, fake-out.


  
Your kung fu is no match
for my rockets.


  
Sneak attack.


  
Okay, Simon. That's enough.


  
I'm finished now. Simon.


  
-Hey, give me that.
-Let go, Alvin.


  
Oh, come on.


  
-You had a turn.
-Who says you get a turn?


  
Give me that.


  
Simon!


  
-You got to try.
-Get your mangy paws off of it.


  
-Scram.
-I want it.


  
Alvin, you don't decide.


  
-Why didn't the airbags deploy?
-Theodore, don't go into the light.


  
-Let's do it again.
-Awesome.


  
-playing hard?
-Oh, yes.


  
Good.


  
Because tomorrow, you start working hard.
Coast to coast in five days.


  
Well, Dave says that touring is no live
for a kid.


  
For a normal kid.
You guys are superstars.


  
-Yes.
-Which reminds me...


  
...Simon, let's get rid of these
boring glasses.


  
And try on these super cool
in-the-now glasses.


  
Oh, my God, oh.


  
These would be great
if I could see out of them.


  
Your eyes will adjust.
Come on, boys. Let's hit the road.


  
-Shotgun.
-Hit the road.


  
Alvin--


  
Give me a big fella. Alvin, big, big.


  
No hiding. Come on, come on.
Make love to the camera.


  
Sell it. Big smile. Yes.
Theodore, chin out. Yeah. That's it.


  
Good stuff. There you go.
Come on, get in there.


  
Strong. Give me some booty.


  
Spank it. There you got it.
Now you got it.


  
If the Chipmunks like Crunchy Nibbles,
your pet will love them.


  
Cut.


  
Here we are.


  
Okay? All right?


  
Hold it.


  
We're not done.


  
-You tell me.
-Killing me.


  
-What do you want?
-You are killing me here.


  
There's no button I can push
that wakes them to sing notes.


  
You kidding?
There's 5000 buttons here.


  
-What button do you want me to push?
-Fine. I've got it.


  
All right, guys. Guess what your
uncle Ian brought you. Coffee.


  
I love toffee.


  
No, it's coffee, Theodore, coffee. It's a--
Like a super cool energy health drink...


  
...with whipped cream and caramel
and two pumps of chocolate.


  
Enjoy.


  
That ought to keep them awake.


  
-Get munk'd
-Go, go, go


  
Yeah, Chipmunks
Always can get munk'd


  
Hey, hey, hey


  
Come and get munk'd
With the Chipmunk rugrats


  
Come and get munk'd with the Munks
Get munk'd with the Chipmunk rugrats


  
Come and get munk'd with the Munks


  
Stop, stop. Come on, guys.
We need more energy, okay?


  
We need more dry ice. We need more,
you know, wow. All right?


  
We're the Chipmunks,
for crying out loud.


  
This is absurd.
I feel like P. Diddy with fur.


  
And to be honest, the new songs
don't really sound like us.


  
Well, you know what I think? I think
the new direction is perfect, you know.


  
It's all about today's edge.


  
Dave always said
it was all about the music.


  
''Dave always said....''


  
You know what? Dave, Dave, Dave.
Dave is not here, okay? It's me.


  
It's fun uncle Ian, all right? Okay?


  
What are you--? What are you
gonna say? What's your name?


  
-Taffy.
-Taffy? What kind of name is Taffy?


  
What do you do?


  
-Choreography.
-I don't know what ''choreography'' is.


  
-What is that?
-It's dance.


  
Oh, is it dancing? Well, next time say,
you know, ''I'm the dance guy--'' Hello?


  
Who? Dave Seville.


  
Name rings a bell. A dead...


  
...broken bell.


  
-Just let me talk to the guys.
-I don't think that's such a good idea.


  
The boys are still stinging a little bit
from you kicking them out.


  
-That's not what happened.
-Denial.


  
So, what's this I hear
about a European tour?


  
You're taking them away
for six months?


  
No, 12 actually.
If we can get China to go chipmunk.


  
Twelve?


  
Look, I just wanted to say hi.
See how they're doing.


  
They're doing great.
They're loving life.


  
Living large.


  
Face it, Dave. They've moved on.


  
-They're happy now.
-Look, Ian, I wanna talk to them.


  
Put them on the phone.


  
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen, Dave.


  
Got a world tour,
gonna start tomorrow.


  
And these guys don't need
the extra pressure.


  
-We'll send you a postcard.
-Ian, you can't do this.


  
They're not ready for something
like that. They're just kids.


  
-I'm gonna see them.
-Look, Dave, I'm-- Wait.


  
-Ian?
-Yeah? What?


  
-Ian.
-I can't--


  
Ian...


  
...was that Dave?


  
Yes. Yes, it was.


  
He wanted me to let you know
he's great and he's happy.


  
He's really, really happy. So.... All right.


  
And is he coming to the show?


  
You know what? I sent him tickets.
And here's the thing, he sent them back.


  
Yeah, I know. I guess he's busy,
you know. Got better things to do.


  
Hey, come on.
What's with the long furry faces?


  
We're gonna have fun.
We're gonna have a big show.


  
I'll tell you what, you guys like
deep-tissue massage? All right?


  
I know a guy. Let me Call my guy.
I'll get on that.


  
Hey, captain, come here.


  
Listen.


  
Dave Seville.
Learn the name, look for the face.


  
If he shows up tomorrow night,
he doesn't get near my chipmunks.


  
-Got it? Okay.
-Got it.


  
uncle Ian?


  
-What are you doing here?
-Can I sleep with you?


  
I had a nightmare.


  
Oh, you had a nightmare?


  
I had a nightmare too.
In my nightmare...


  
...I had to put together 37 dates
in 42 days, in 16 different countries.


  
And I had to coordinate different radio and print interviews...


  
...in five different languages.


  
But you know what, Theo?
The only difference is...


  
...in my nightmare, when I open
my eyes, it doesn't end.


  
So is that a no?


  
Guys...


  
...I wanna go home.


  
What do you mean? You are home.


  
No, I mean, ''home'' home.


  
You know, with Dave.


  
But, Theodore, come on.
Wake up and smell the toffee.


  
Dave doesn't even want us. He doesn't
care enough to even come to our show.


  
Here's Julianne Reynolds
with today's entertainment news.


  
Too tired to rock?
The Chipmunks might be.


  
Rumor of exhaustion and voice strain are
swirling around the singing sensation.


  
Is it because of toaster waffle overload?
Or a rigorous tour schedule?


  
It's hard to say. But manager-producer
Ian Hawke has assured Fox...


  
...the trio will make
their first stop tonight...


  
...on their highly anticipated world tour
at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles.


  
That's it.


  
Okay.


  
You three sound like
you've been gargling nails.


  
-I'll cover for you.
-Thank you.


  
Can we get wardrobe
down here, please?


  
Well?


  
I could give you a lot of fancy terms,
but, bottom line, they're exhausted.


  
Okay, well, give them a shot
or a cream or a pill or something.


  
I've invested every dime I have
in these guys.


  
They need a long rest.


  
A long rest. Are you--? Okay.
Yeah, a long rest, right.


  
Right, yeah. I'm not a doctor, so....


  
I'll get them that rest. Thank you.
I'll take care of it.


  
Thank you so much. I will--
I appreciate it. Hey, hey, doc.


  
Chipmunk fever, catch it.


  
Knock, knock.


  
So listen, guys,
I just talked to the doctor.


  
And I don't feel right about
sending you guys out like this.


  
So you're gonna cancel the show?


  
No. No,
then I'd have to give out refunds.


  
No. What I'm talking about
is having you guys lip-synch. Yeah.


  
Isn't that like cheating?


  
No, it's not like cheating. It's--
Cheating is wrong.


  
This is more like helping.
Yeah, all the superstars do it.


  
Just make sure that you mouth the
words exactly like we recorded them.


  
-Otherwise, people will know.
-That we're cheating.


  
-No.
-Guys, what other choice do we have?


  
Yeah. See?
That's why he's the one with the letter.


  
All right, guys, tighten up.


  
And remember, mouth the words
and no one will know.


  
Love you.


  
You know you got it made


  
When you drop your Escalade
For the drop top


  
Iced out, rocks hot
Droppin' dollars, ladies holler


  
Hey, gotta get that cream


  
You know you got it made
When they send in a parade


  
When you drop down
Write a check in town


  
All just for one day


  
Gotta get that cream


  
-Don't you know that's how they roll?
-Roll, roll, roll


  
Can you get down with the
Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks?


  
Baby, you know


  
Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks


  
Oh, come on,
you gotta have one more ticket.


  
Sorry.


  
Come on, here's Theodore


  
You're here to stay
When you're always getting paid


  
And it don't stop, never, no
It won't stop no matter what they say


  
-Gotta live the dream
-Take it, Simon


  
You're here to stay
When your honeys think you hit


  
'Cause we gots it
Everybody watch it


  
I love it. You love it? Chipmunk fever.
Catch it, baby.


  
Dave Seville.


  
No, there's no Dave Seville
on this list.


  
You know what? That's fine.
I'm the editor of the L.A. Music Journal.


  
-No, I don't think so.
-He's with me.


  
He's my assistant.


  
Okay.


  
Thanks, Claire.


  
What's going on, Dave?
What are you--?


  
I gotta get my boys back
but Ian's trying to keep me out.


  
Your boys.


  
I know that probably sounds weird
coming from me.


  
It's a good weird, though.


  
Because after all I did to mess up
everything, including you--


  
-Dave, your boys. We should go.
-Right. Okay.


  
How we roll


  
Come on, can you feel it?


  
-How we roll
-Yeah, yeah, come on


  
If you're gonna do something,
do it fast. Here.


  
-You're press, remember?
-Thanks.


  
Roll


  
-Let's go, pal.
-I'm a photographer.


  
-I have a press pass.
-You're out of here.


  
Alvin! Alvin!


  
Alvin!


  
-Dave! He's here.
-It's Dave.


  
What's going on?


  
Alvin, what are you doing?


  
I'm sending a message
to our dear old uncle Ian.


  
-Sounds like a plan to me.
-Me too.


  
Come on, guys.


  
Hey, Ian...


  
...kiss my furry cheeks.


  
Here, hold on to that.


  
Top of the morning to you.


  
Get off my set.


  
Are you ready to rock?


  
Turn it up, girl.


  
How we roll


  
How we roll


  
I feel fine.


  
Alvin, Simon, Theodore!
Come on, guys, we're going home.


  
Move, move.


  
Let's go.


  
-Get them.
-Look out. Run.


  
Hi.


  
Bye.


  
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo


  
Miss a chipmunk because you're slow


  
Watch your knees.


  
-Sorry.
-Come on, big fella. Come on. Come on.


  
A little bit closer.


  
Come on, right there. Perfect.


  
He'll feel that in the morning.


  
-Guys.
-Dave!


  
You're not going anywhere.


  
What are you doing?


  
-Put us down.
-Let me go.


  
-Hey.
-You better study your French.


  
-You're going to Paris tonight. Okay?
-Let go. Just had my tail redone.


  
-No, wait.
-Put it with my stuff.


  
-Let us out of here. Let us out of here.
-No.


  
What? Ian, they don't want this anymore.
Just let them go.


  
But the guy just left. You should have
said something about five seconds ago.


  
Come back.


  
Ian, they need a real life.
Not all of this.


  
Besides, they just ruined the concert.


  
Word will get out,
no one will come to see them.


  
Dave, they're chipmunks who talk.
people will come.


  
Guys, with me.


  
Roll, that's how we roll


  
You'll never take us alive.


  
They just did take us alive, Alvin.


  
It's a figure of speech, Simon.


  
Instead of criticizing me, why not use
your big brain to think of a way out?


  
Go, go, go. Go.


  
Come on.


  
Step on it, Dave. You're losing him.


  
How did you guys...?


  
We are talking chipmunks, Dave.


  
We can get out of a cat carrier.
Not even hard to do.


  
You came back for us.


  
Well, of course I came back.
We're a family.


  
Holy nuts.


  
-What?
-Am I going crazy?


  
Or did he just say ''family''?


  
I know...


  
...but I really missed you guys.


  
I missed you too, Dave.


  
Me too.


  
-So did Alvin. He's too Cool to admit it.
-Yeah, too macho.


  
Missed you too.


  
Sorry, I had some sentimentality
stuck in my throat.


  
I just said, I missed you too.


  
Whatever.
Who are you guys to judge me?


  
Okay, you know what?
I miss my friend Dave, okay?


  
I'll scream it from the rooftops.
And I'm not afraid. I'm not ashamed.


  
That's right. I love you, Dave.


  
Come here.


  
-Dave?
-Yes, Alvin?


  
Now can I steer?
Oh, please, please, please.


  
-I want to work the windshield wipers.
-Oh, and I'd like to beep the horn.


  
Have at it, fellas.


  
-I'm a good beeper.
-Save some horn for the rest of us.


  
-Come on, Dave, drive faster.
-Not with you steering.


  
Dave, you drive like a sleepy old bear.


  
-Okay, Alvin, that's enough.
-Enough of what? Of being awesome?


  
Alvin, I said that's enough.


  
Hey, look, Dave, no paws.


  
Hey, if you guys behave, maybe
I'll let you call me ''uncle Ian'' again.


  
Deal?


  
No!


  
Claire.


  
-Hey.
-Come on in.


  
-Hi, Claire.
-Well, hello, Clarina.


  
-Hi, guys.
-Hope you like toaster waffies.


  
And, for us classy chipmunks,
a bit of the bubbly.


  
Stupid cork. Doesn't--


  
I'm not gonna say it.


  
Good grief.


  
Are you still not gonna say it?


  
Nope.


  
I'm gonna say it. Alvin!


  
Okay!


  




  
Okay, guys, come on,
let's try it again.


  
Here we go, and sing.


  
Come on, sing for your uncle Ian.
Come on, sing.


  
Why--? Why won't you sing?


  
You know, I said, sing.


  
Sing.






Special thanks to SergeiK.


Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Transcript detail I don't know about you, it's just too hot today, isn't it? And it's going to get even worse. Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius... that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100. So, please, remember to cover up and stay cool... with the hottest hits on your FM dial. Come on, guys, time to go home. Come on, love, off you get. Do we have to? Yes, we do. I'll make you your favorite dinner to compensate. He squealed like a pig, didn't he? Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D. Did you see his face? Hey, Big D. Beat up another. This one deserved it. Yeah. Five against one, very brave. Well, you're one to talk. Moaning in your sleep every night? At least I'm not afraid of my pillow. "Don't kill Cedric." Who's Cedric, your boyfriend? Shut up. "He's going to kill me, Mum." Where is your mum? Where is your mum, Potter? She dead? Is she dead? Is she a dead Pott...? Dudley. Dudley, let's go. What's going on? What are you doing? I'm not doing anything. We're getting out of here, Dudley. Come on, Dudley, hurry up. Dudley, run. Expecto Patronum. Mrs. Figg. Don't put away your wand, Harry. They might come back. Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next? Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. - I don't understand. How do you know...? Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you. Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore? After You-Know-Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year... did you expect him to let you go wandering on your own? Good Lord, boy. They told me you were intelligent. Now, get inside and stay there. Expect someone will be in touch soon. Whatever happens, don't leave the house. It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere. There's sweat. There's stifling. Diddykins? Is that you? Duddy. Vernon, come quick. We're going to have to take him to a hospital. Who did this to you, boy? Happy, are we, now? You've finally done it. You've finally driven him loopy. Vernon, don't say that. Well, just look at him, Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy. I've reached my limit, do you hear? This is the last I'm gonna take of you and your nonsense. Dear Mr. Potter. What? The Ministry has received intelligence that at 6:23 this evening... you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle. As a clear violation... of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery... you are hereby expelled... from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk. Justice. He's not very well. Sorry, Hedwig. Very clean, these Muggles. Tonks, for God's sake. Unnatural. Professor Moody. What are you doing here? Rescuing you, of course. But where are we going? The letter said I've been expelled. You haven't been. Not yet. Kingsley, you take point. But the letter said... Dumbledore persuaded the minister to suspend your expulsion... pending a formal hearing. A hearing? Don't worry. We'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters. Not here, Nymphadora. Don't call me Nymphadora. Stay in formation, everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed. Come on, you, around the corner. Come on. In you go, son. There've been no sightings. No deaths. No proof. He almost killed Harry. If that isn't proof enough... Yes, but guarding you-know-what is the most important... We must trust Dumbledore on this. Was he able to protect Harry last year? Well, tonight I say it's time to take action. Cornelius Fudge is a politician first and a wizard second. His instinct would be to ignore it... Keep your voices down. He's getting stronger and stronger by the minute. We have to act now. Harry. Mrs. Weasley. Heavens, you're all right. Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait until after the meeting's finished. Nope. No time to explain. Straight upstairs, first door on the left. Yeah. Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves. If my poor mistress knew the scum they let into her house... what would she say to old Kreacher? Oh, the shame. Freaks. There, there, mistress. Scum of the earth. Not like it was in the days of my fathers. Kreacher is here. Oh, Harry. Are you all right? We overheard them talking about the Dementor attack. You must tell us everything. Let the man breathe, Hermione. And this hearing at the Ministry. It's just outrageous. I've looked it up. They simply can't expel you. It's completely unfair. Yeah. There's a lot of that going round at the moment. So, what is this place? It's headquarters. Of the Order of the Phoenix. It's a secret society. Dumbledore formed it back when they fought You-Know-Who. Couldn't have put any of this in a letter, I suppose? I've gone all summer without a scrap of news. We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did. Only... Only what? Only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything. Dumbledore said that? But why would he keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help. I'm the one who saw Voldemort return... the one who fought him, who saw Cedric Diggory get killed. Harry. Thought we heard your dulcet tones. Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out. If you're all done shouting... Do you wanna hear something a little more interesting? If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for Harry... we wouldn't even know Voldemort was back. He's not a child, Molly. But he's not an adult either. He's not James, Sirius. Well, he's not your son. He's as good as. Who else has he got? Hey, Ginny. He's got me. How touchingly paternal, Black. Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather. Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus. Snape's part of the Order? Git. ...about your supposed reformation. I know better. So why don't you tell him? Get off it. Quick. Get it up. Crookshanks. Stop it. Get off, you bloody cat. Crookshanks. Leave it alone. Get it up. Hermione, I hate your cat. Bad Crookshanks. Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen. Just because you're allowed to use magic now... does not mean you have to whip your wands out for everything. Hi, Mum. You hungry, Harry? You sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us quite a turn. Harry Potter. Sirius. This is very, very peculiar. It seems your hearing in the Ministry is to be before the entire Wizengamot. I don't understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me? Show him. He'll find out soon enough. He's been attacking Dumbledore as well. Fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet... to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned. Why? He thinks Dumbledore's after his job. No one in their right mind could believe that... Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind. It's been twisted and warped by fear. Now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry. The last time Voldemort gained power... he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the minister will do almost anything... to avoid facing that terrifying truth. We think Voldemort wants to build up his army again. Fourteen years ago, he had huge numbers at his command. And not just witches and wizards, but all manner of dark creatures. He's been recruiting heavily, and we've been attempting to do the same. But gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in. We believe... Voldemort may be after something. Sirius. Something he didn't have last time. You mean like a weapon? No. That's enough. He's just a boy. You say more and you might as well induct him into the Order. Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight. Harry. You are hereby expelled. Before the entire Wizengamot. Trains. Underground. Ingenious, these Muggles. Here we are. I've never used the visitors' entrance before. Should be fun. Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money. Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons trading on the potions market. Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet? Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous? Morning, Arthur. Morning, Bob. Interdepartmental memos. We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable. Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley. They've changed the time of your hearing. When is it? In five minutes. Department of Mysteries. And I'm confident, minister, that you will do the right thing. Yes, but we must be... Remember, during the hearing, speak only when you're spoken to. Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong. As the Muggles say, truth will out. Yes? I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid. Good luck, Harry. Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August... into offenses committed by Harry James Potter... resident at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag... Witness for the defense. Albus Percival Wulfric... Brian Dumbledore. You got our message that the time and place of the hearing... had been changed, did you? I must have missed it. But by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. The charges? The charges against the accused are as follows: "That he did knowingly... and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions... produce a Patronus Charm... in the presence of a Muggle." Do you deny producing said Patronus? No, but... And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school... while under the age of 17? Yes, I was, but... Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot... I was only doing it because of the Dementors. Dementors? In Little Whinging? That's quite clever. Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy? Highly convenient. I'm not lying. There were two of them, and if I hadn't... Enough. I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story... but since you can produce no witnesses of the event... Pardon me, minister, but as it happens, we can. Please describe the attack. What did they look like? Well, one of them was very large and the other rather skinny. Not the boys. The Dementors. Oh, right, right. Well, big. Cloaked. Then everything went cold... as though all the happiness had gone from the world. Now, look here. Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb... and happen across a wizard. The odds are astronomical. I don't think anyone would believe... the Dementors were there by coincidence, minister. I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, professor. Dementors are, after all, under the control of the Ministry of Magic. And it's so silly of me, but it sounded for a moment as though... you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy. That would be disturbing indeed, Madam Undersecretary... which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry... into why the two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban... and why they mounted an attack without authorization. Of course, there is someone... who might be behind the attack. Cornelius, I implore you to see reason. The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontrovertible. He is not back. In the matter of Harry Potter... the law clearly states... that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations. Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore. Clearly. Has it become practice to hold a full criminal trial... to deal with a simple matter of underage magic? Those in favor of conviction? Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges? Cleared of all charges. Professor. Padfoot. Are you barking mad? You'll blow the entire operation. Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you... I had to see you off, didn't I? What's life without a little risk? I don't wanna see you get chucked back in Azkaban. Don't worry about me. Anyway, I wanted you to have this. Original Order of the Phoenix. Marlene McKinnon. She was killed two weeks after this was taken. Voldemort wiped out her entire family. Frank and Alice Longbottom. Neville's parents. They suffered a fate worse than death, you ask me. It's been 14 years. And still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad. Do you really think there's going to be a war, Sirius? It feels like it did before. You keep it. Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now. I'll see you at the train. Bye-bye, darling. I love you. Hold my hand, lovey. There they are. They're in the far carriage. Bye. I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free. Better enjoy it while you can. I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it. What'd I tell you? Complete nutter. Just stay away from me! It's only Malfoy. What'd you expect? Hi, guys. Hey, Neville. Hey there, Neville. What is it? What's what? That. Pulling the carriage. Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. It's pulling itself, like always. You're not going mad. I can see them too. You're just as sane as I am. Everyone, this is Loony Love... Luna Lovegood. What an interesting necklace. It's a charm, actually. Keeps away the Nargles. Hungry. I hope there's pudding. What's a Nargle? No idea. Good evening, children. Now, we have two changes in staffing this year. We're pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank... who'll be taking Care of Magical Creatures... while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave. We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... Professor Dolores Umbridge. And I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing the professor good luck. Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you... She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge. Thank you, headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. And how lovely to see all your bright... happy faces smiling up at me. I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends. That's likely. That's likely. The Ministry of Magic has always considered... the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. Although each headmaster... has brought something new to this historic school... progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged. Let us preserve what must be preserved... perfect what can be perfected... and prune practices that ought to be prohibited. Thank you, Professor Umbridge. That really was most illuminating. Illuminating? What a load of waffle. What's it mean? Magic is forbidden in the corridors... It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts. Dean, Seamus. Good holiday? All right. Better than Seamus', anyway. Me mum didn't want me to come back this year. Why not? Let me see. Because of you. The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot of things about you and Dumbledore. What, your mum believes them? Nobody was there the night Cedric died. I guess you should read the Prophet, then, like your stupid mother. Don't talk about my mother. I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar. What's going on? He's mad, is what's going on. Do you believe the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who? Yeah. I do. Has anyone else got a problem with Harry? You all right? Fine. Seamus was bang out of order, mate. But he'll come through, you'll see. I said, I'm fine, Ron. Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then. Harry. Bring it over here. Over here. Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it. Good morning, children. Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations. O-W-Ls. More commonly known as OWLs. Study hard and you will be rewarded. Fail to do so, and the consequences may be severe. Your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly uneven. But you'll be pleased to know, from now on... you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved... course of defensive magic. Yes? There's nothing in here about using defensive spells? Using spells? Well, I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom. We're not gonna use magic? You'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way. What use is that? If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free. Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class. It is the view of the Ministry... that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient... to get you through your examinations... which, after all, is what school is all about. And how's theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there? There is nothing out there, dear. Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourself? Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort. Now, let me make this quite plain. You have been told... that a certain dark wizard is at large once again. This is a lie. It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him. Detention, Mr. Potter. Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord? Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident. It was murder. Voldemort killed him. Enough! Enough. See me later, Mr. Potter. My office. Come in. Good evening, Mr. Potter. Sit. You're going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter. No, not with your quill. Going to be using a rather special one of mine. Now... I want you to write, "I must not tell lies." How many times? Well, let's say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in. You haven't given me any ink. Oh, you won't need any ink. Yes? Nothing. That's right. Because you know, deep down... you deserve to be punished. Don't you, Mr. Potter? Go on. Skiving Snackboxes. Sweets that make you ill. Get out of class whenever you like. Obtain hours of pleasure from unprofitable boredom. Care for another? I'm not asking you to write all of it for me. I've been busy studying for these stupid OWL exams. I'll do the introduction. That's all. Hermione, you're honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met. And if I'm ever rude to you again... I'll know you've gone back to normal. What's wrong with your hand? Nothing. The other hand. You've got to tell Dumbledore. No. Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now. I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction. Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you. If the parents knew about this... I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron? Harry, you've got to report this. It's perfectly simple. You're being... No, it's not. Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple. You don't understand. Then help us to. Dear Padfoot... I hope you're all right. It's starting to get colder here. Winter is definitely on the way. In spite of being back at Hogwarts, I feel more alone than ever. I know you, of all people, will understand. Hello, Harry Potter. Your feet. Aren ' t they cold? Bit. Unfortunately, all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared. I suspect Nargles are behind it. What are they? They're called Thestrals. They're quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they're a bit... Different. But why can't the others see them? They can only be seen by people who've seen death. So you've known someone who's died, then? My mum. She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment... and one day, one of her spells went badly wrong. I was 9. I'm sorry. Yes, it was rather horrible. I do feel very sad about it sometimes, but I've got Dad. We both believe you, by the way. That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and you fought him... and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you. Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do. I don't think that's true. But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel. What do you mean? Well, if I were You-Know-Who... I'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else... because if it's just you alone... you're not as much of a threat. Do you ever stop eating? What? I'm hungry. Harry. Can I join you? Pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating? I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students... you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices. So silly of me, but it sounds... as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom... Minerva. Not at all, Dolores, merely your medieval methods. I am sorry, dear. But to question my practices is to question the Ministry... and by extension, the minister himself. I am a tolerant woman... but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty. Disloyalty. Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared. Cornelius will want to take immediate action. What's happened to Dumbledore? Having already revolutionized... the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts... Dolores Umbridge will, as high inquisitor, have powers... to address the seriously falling standards at Hogwarts School. Just one question, dear. You've been in this post how long, exactly? You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct? Yes. But you were unsuccessful? Obviously. Could you please predict something for me? I'm sorry? Move those mouths. One teensy little prophecy? Pity. No, wait. Wait, no. I think I do see something. Yes, I do. Something dark. You are in grave danger. Lovely. Cho. What's going on? It's Professor Trelawney. Sixteen years I've lived and taught here. Hogwarts is my home. You can't do this. Actually, I can. Something you'd like to say? Oh, there are several things I would like to say. There... Professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside? Sybil, dear. This way. Thank you. Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms... of Educational Decree Number You have the right to dismiss my teachers. You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds. That power remains with the headmaster. For now. Don't you all have studying to do? Professor. Professor? Professor Dumbledore. Professor! Professor Dumbledore. That foul, evil, old gargoyle. We're not learning how to defend ourselves. We're not learning how to pass our OWLs. She's taking over the entire school. Security has been and will remain the Ministry's top priority. Furthermore, we have convincing evidence... that these disappearances are the work... of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black. Harry. Sirius. What are you doing here? Answering your letter. You said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing? Training you to kill half-breeds? She's not letting us use magic at all. Well, I'm not surprised. The latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat. Combat? What does he think, we're forming some sort of wizard army? That's exactly what he thinks. That Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry. He's becoming more paranoid by the minute. The others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry... but things aren't going at all well with the Order. Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn... and these disappearances are just how it started before. Voldemort is on the move. Well, what can we do? Someone's coming. I'm sorry I can't be of more help. But for now, at least, it looks like you're on your own. He really is out there, isn't he? We've got to be able to defend ourselves. And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will. Harry. This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me? I'm a nutter, remember? Look on the bright side: you can't be any worse than old toad face. Thanks, Ron. I'm here for you, mate. Who's supposed to be meeting us, then? Just a couple of people. Lovely spot. Thought it would be safer off the beaten track. Matey, come back here. Hi. So you all know why we're here. We need a teacher. A proper teacher. One who's had experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts. Why? Why? Because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot. So he says. So Dumbledore says. So Dumbledore says because he says. The point is, where's the proof? If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed... I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here, clear out now. Come on, Hermione. They're here because they think I'm some sort of freak. Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm? Yes. I've seen it. Blimey, Harry. I didn't know you could do that. And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office. It's true. Third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once. Last year, he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh. Wait. Look, it all sounds great when you say it like that... but the truth is, most of that was just luck. I didn't know what I was doing half the time. I nearly always had help. He's just being modest. No, Hermione, I'm not. Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. In school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow. But out there... when you're a second away from being murdered... or watching a friend die right before your eyes... You don't know what that's like. You're right, Harry, we don't. That's why we need your help. Because if we're going to have any chance at beating... Voldemort... He's really back. Right. First we need to find a place to practice... where Umbridge won't find out. The Shrieking Shack. It's too small. Forbidden Forest? Not bloody likely. Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out? Who cares? I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules? Who are you and what have you done with Hermione? Anyway, at least we know one positive thing that came from today. What's that? Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she? Right. Over the next few days, we should each come up... with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice. We've got to make sure, wherever it is, there's no chance she can find us. Will do, Harry. All student organizations are henceforth disbanded. Any student in noncompliance will be expelled. Watch where you're going, Longbottom. You've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement. The what? It's also known as the Come and Go Room. The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it. And it's always equipped for the seeker's needs. So say you really needed the toilet... Charming, Ronald. But, yes, that is the general idea. It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back. Expelliarmus. I'm hopeless. You're just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus. You will please copy the approved text four times... to ensure maximum retention. There will be no need to talk. No need to think's more like it. Expelliarmus. Wands away. Stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal. It's a wizard's bread and butter, really. So come on, then, Nigel. Give it your best shot. Stupefy! Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done. Don't worry. I'll go easy on you. Thanks, Ronald. Come on, Ron. Come on, Ron. You can do it. Come on, Ron. One Sickle. You're on. Stupefy. Thank you. Shut up. I let her do that. It's good manners, isn't it? It was completely intentional. Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea? Now, focus on a fixed point and try again. Expelliarmus. Very good. Keep your concentration. Great. A little higher. I'm okay. I'm okay. Stupefy. Stupefy. Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... may sign up in the high inquisitor's office. Diminuendo. Working hard is important, but there's something that matters even more: Believing in yourself. Expelliarmus. Levicorpus. Got it. Think of it this way. Every great wizard in history has started out... as nothing more than what we are now: students. If they can do it, why not us? Stupefy. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Reducto. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Expelliarmus. Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man. So that's it for this lesson. Now, we' re not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays. So just keep practicing on your own as best you can. And well done, everyone. Great, great work. Well done, mate. Thanks. See you after Christmas. See you in the Common Room, Harry. Thanks a lot, Harry. No worries. Thank you so much. Not at all. Merry Christmas. Thank you, Harry. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Have a good Christmas. Have a great Christmas, Luna. We've been thinking. We could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles. Or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus-filled boils... Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me? Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day. Yeah. I'm okay. Anyway, it's worth it. It's just, learning all this... makes me wonder whether, if he'd known it... Cedric did know this stuff. He was really good. It's just, Voldemort was better. You're a really good teacher, Harry. I've never been able to stun anything before. Mistletoe. Probably full of Nargles, though. What are Nargles? No idea. Well, how was it? Wet. I mean, she was sort of crying. That bad at it, are you? I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory. Cho spends half her time crying these days. You'd think a bit of snogging would cheer her up. Don't you understand how she must be feeling? Well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric... and confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him... conflicted because Umbridge might sack her mum from the Ministry... and frightened of failing her OWLs because she's worrying about everything. One person couldn't feel all that. They'd explode. Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon... Harry. Voldemort may be after something. Something he didn't have last time. Harry. Harry. In the dream, were you standing next to the victim... or looking down at the scene? Neither. It was like I... Will you please just tell me what's happening? Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight. Make sure he's found by the right people. Sir. Phineas. You must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. Tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured... and his children will be arriving there soon by Portkey. They've got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it. What's more, the Dark Lord failed to acquire it. Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to... Look at me! What's happening to me? You wished to see me, headmaster? Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning. Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable. It appears there's a connection... between the Dark Lord's mind and your own. Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear. Pray he remains ignorant. You mean, if he knows about it, then... he'll be able to read my mind? Read it, control it... unhinge it. In the past, it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure... to invade the minds of his victims... creating visions designed to torture them into madness. Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony... only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally... kill them. Used properly, the power of Occlumency... will help shield you from access or influence. In these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind. You will attempt to resist. Prepare yourself. Legilimens. Concentrate, Potter. Focus. hо, hо, hо. Merry Christmas. Here we go. Daddy's back. Sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, presents. And a nice big box for Ron. Big box for you. And... Fred and George. Come on, open up. I want to see your faces. Yes. Try it on. Thanks, Mum. It's perfect. Just what he wanted, actually. Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum. Come on, then, everybody. Let's clear this away. Oh, Harry, Harry. There you are. Happy Christmas. Thank you. Lovely to have you with us. Thank you. Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy. Thank you. Has everybody got? Fred? George? Hermione. A Christmas toast. To Mr. Harry Potter... without whom I would not be here. Harry. Harry. Harry. That is delicious. I shall be needing some more of that. Daddy, don't forget last Christmas. I can't understand why you don't want to wear it, Ronald. I look like a bloody idiot, that's why. No more than usual, Ron. I don't know why... Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass. Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord. Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike. If my poor mistress only knew... Kreacher! That's enough of your bile. Away with you! Of course, master. Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black. Sorry about that. He never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy. Not to me, anyway. What, you grew up here? This is my parents' house. I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order. About the only useful thing I've been able to do. This is the Black family tree. My deranged cousin. I hated the lot of them. My parents with their pure-blood mania. My mother did that after I ran away. Charming woman. I was 16. Where did you go? Round your dad's. I was always welcome at the Potters'. I see him so much in you, Harry. You are so very much alike. I'm not so sure. Sirius, when I was... When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching. I was the snake. And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office... there was a moment when I wanted to... This connection between me and Voldemort. What if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him? I just feel so angry all the time. And what if, after everything that I've been through... something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad? I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. You're not a bad person. You're a very good person who bad things have happened to. You understand? Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We've all got both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are. Harry, time to go. When all this is over, we'll be a proper family. You'll see. Come on. Really? Harry. Harry. Hagrid's back. I'm sorry. I will say this one last time. I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been. I told you. I've been away for me health. Your health? Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know. Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh air must be difficult to come by. If I were you, I shouldn't get too used to being back. In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all. This is top-secret, right? Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants. Giants? You found them? Well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see? I tried to convince them to join the cause. But I wasn't the only one that was trying to win them over. Death Eaters? Yes. Trying to persuade them to join You-Know-Who. Did they? I gave them Dumbledore's message. Suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose. And they did this to you? Not exactly, no. Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog. It's changing out there. Just like last time. There's a storm coming, Harry. We'd all best be ready when she does. We have confirmed that 10 high-security prisoners... in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape. And of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger. We strongly suspect... that the breakout was engineered... by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban... notorious mass murderer Sirius Black... cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange. Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen. He's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth. Harry. I wanted to apologize. Now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up. So, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you. Neville? Fourteen years ago... a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange... used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents. She tortured them for information... but they never gave in. I'm quite proud to be their son. But I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet. We're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise. Make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember. Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus. George, your turn now. Expecto Patronum. A full-bodied Patronus is the most difficult to produce... but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents. Wow, that was really good. Fantastic, Ginny. Just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused. So focus, Luna. Think of the happiest thing you can. Expecto Patronum. I'm trying. I know. It's good. This is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well. Expecto Patronum. I'll make short work of this. Bombarda Maxima. Get them. Been watching them for weeks. And see, " Dumbledore's Army"... proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius. All your fear-mongering about You-Know-Who... never fooled us for a minute. We saw your lies for what they were: A smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry. Naturally. No, professor. He had nothing to do with it. It was me. Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out... the parchment clearly says "Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's." I instructed Harry to form this organization. And I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities. Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet. If we hurry, we should still make the morning edition. Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore... to Azkaban... to await trial for conspiracy and sedition. I thought we might hit this little snag. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I'm going to... What was the phrase? ...come quietly. Well, I can tell you this: I have no intention of going to Azkaban. Enough of this. Take him. Well, you may not like him, minister... but you can't deny... Dumbledore has got style. Boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other. Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... Students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities. Any student in noncompliance will be expelled. Harry. You did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag. Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming. Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours. Yeah, we talked you into it. Yeah, but I agreed. I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is make things worse. Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore. Because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much. And the more you care, the more you have to lose. So maybe it's just better to... To what? To go it alone. Hagrid. Any idea where he's taking us? Hagrid, why can't you just tell us? I've never seen the centaurs so riled. And they're dangerous at the best of times. The Ministry restricts their territory much more... they'll have a full uprising on their hands. Hagrid, what's going on? I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three. I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone... I'll likely be getting the sack any day now. And I just couldn't leave without telling someone about him. Grawpy. Down here, you great buffoon. Grawpy. Brought you some company. I couldn't just leave him, because... Because he's my brother. Blimey. Well, half brother, really. He's completely harmless, just like I said. Little high-spirited, is all. Grawpy, that is not polite. Hagrid, do something. We talked about this. You do not grab, do you? That's your new friend, Hermione. Grawpy. Grawp. Put me down. Now. You all right? Fine. Just needs a firm hand, is all. I think you've got an admirer. You just stay away from her, all right? He gets his own food and all. It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone. You will look after him, won't you? I'm the only family he's got. Feeling sentimental? That's private. Not to me. And not to the Dark Lord, if you don't improve. Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you. You won't last two seconds if he invades your mind. You're just like your father. Lazy, arrogant. Don't say a word against my father. Weak. I'm not weak. Then prove it. Control your emotions. Discipline your mind. Legilimens. Harry. Sirius. I may vomit. Stop it. Is this what you call control? We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest. The Dark Lord isn't resting. You and Black, you're two of a kind. Sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been. Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair. Your blessed father knew that. In fact, he frequently saw to it. My father was a great man. Your father was a swine. Legilimens. Protego. Come on, Moony, Padfoot. Snape. Expelliarmus. Nice one, James. Dad. Impedimenta. Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy. Right. Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers? Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy. Enough. Enough. Your lessons are at an end. I... Get out. What's your name? Michael. Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael. Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See? It's fading already. You can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while. As I told you once before, Mr. Potter... naughty children deserve to be punished. You know, George... I've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement. Fred, I've been thinking exactly the same thing. All right, professor! Here you go. Ready when you are. I need that prophecy. You'll have to kill me. Oh, I will. But first, you will fetch it for me. Crucio. Crucio. Sirius. Harry, are you sure? I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley. It's the door I've been dreaming about. I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before. Sirius said Voldemort was after something. Something he didn't have the last time, in the Department of Mysteries. Harry, please, just listen. What if Voldemort meant for you to see this? What if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you? What if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die? Hermione, he's the only family I've got left. What do we do? We'll have to use the Floo Network. Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance. Not all of them. Alohomora. Alert the Order if you can. Are you mental? We're going with you. It's too dangerous. When are you going to get it into your head? We're in this together. That you are. Caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl. You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you? No. Liar. You sent for me, headmistress? Snape, yes. The time has come for answers, whether he wants to give them to me or not. Have you brought the Veritaserum? I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students. The last of it on Miss Chang. Unless you wish to poison him... And I assure you, I would have the greatest sympathy if you did. ...I cannot help you. He's got Padfoot. He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden. Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? What is he talking about, Snape? No idea. Very well. You give me no choice, Potter. As this is an issue of Ministry security... you leave me with... no alternative. The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue. That's illegal. What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him. Tell her, Harry! Tell me what? Well, if you won't tell her where it is... I will. Where what is? Dumbledore's secret weapon. How much further? Not far. It had to be somewhere students wouldn't find it accidentally. What are you doing? Improvising. Well? Where is this weapon? There isn't one, is there? You were trying to trick me. You know... I really hate children. You have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter. Lower your weapons. I warn you, under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence... Protego. How dare you? Filthy half-breed. Incarcerous. Please. Please stop it. Please. Now, enough. I will have order. You filthy animal. Do you know who I am? Leave him alone. It's not his fault. No, he doesn't understand. Potter, do something. Tell them I mean no harm. I'm sorry, professor. But I must not tell lies. What are you doing? I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge. Let me go! Thank you, Grawp. Hermione. Hermione, Sirius. How'd you get away? Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty. Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets. They told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves. That was clever, Ron. Has been known to happen. It was brilliant. So how are we getting to London? Look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you... but I've got you into enough trouble as it is. Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be about doing something real. Or was that all just words to you? Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate. So how are we going to get to London? We fly, of course. Department of Mysteries. This is it. Ninety-two. Ninety-three. Ninety-four. Ninety-five. He should be here. Harry. It's got your name on it. The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal... but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not. For neither can live while the other survives. Harry. Where's Sirius? You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams... and reality. You saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. Now, hand me the prophecy. If you do anything to us, I'll break it. He knows how to play. Itty, bitty baby. Potter. Bellatrix Lestrange. Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad? Better, now they're about to be avenged. Now, let's everybody just calm down... shall we? All we want is that prophecy. Why did Voldemort need me to come and get this? You dare speak his name? You filthy half-blood! It's all right. He's just a curious lad, aren't you? Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made. Which is lucky for you, really. Haven't you always wondered... what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord? Why he was unable to kill you... when you were just an infant? Don't you want to know the secret of your scar? All the answers are there, Potter, in your hand. All you have to do... is give it to me. Then I can show you everything. I've waited 14 years. I know. I guess I can wait a little longer. Now. Stupefy. Stupefy. Levicorpus. Petrificus Totalus. Well done, Neville. Stupefy. Stupefy. Stupefy. Stupefy. Reducto. Get back to the door. Department of Mysteries. They got that bit right, didn't they? The voices. Can you tell what they're saying? There aren't any voices, Harry. Let's get out of here. I hear them too. Harry, it's just an empty archway. Please, Harry. Get behind me. Did you actually believe... or were you truly naive enough to think... that children stood a chance against us? I'll make this simple for you, Potter. Give me the prophecy now... or watch your friends die. Don't give it to him, Harry. Get away from my godson. Now, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here. What? No, I'm staying with you. You've done beautifully. Now, let me take it from here. Black. Expelliarmus! Nice one, James. Avada Kedavra. No. No. I killed Sirius Black. You coming to get me? Crucio. You've got to mean it, Harry. She killed him. She deserves it. You know the spell, Harry. Do it. So weak. It was foolish of you to come here tonight, T om. The Aurors are on their way. By which time I shall be gone, and you... shall be dead. You've lost, old man. Harry. So weak. So vulnerable. Look at me. Harry, it isn't how you are alike. It's how you are not. Harry? You're the weak one... and you'll never know love or friendship. And I feel sorry for you. You're a fool, Harry Potter. And you will lose everything. He's back. I know how you feel, Harry. No, you don't. It's my fault. No, the fault is mine. I knew it was only a matter of time... before Voldemort made the connection between you. I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year... he'd be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected. The prophecy said: "Neither one can live while the other one survives." It means one of us is gonna have to kill the other, in the end. Yes. Why didn't you tell me? For the same reason you tried to save Sirius. The same reason your friends saved you. After all these years, after all you've suffered... I didn't want to cause you any more pain. I cared too much about you. How come you're not at the feast? Lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them. That's awful. Oh, it's all good fun. But as it's the last night, I really do need them back. Do you want any help finding them? I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry. Are you sure you don't want any help looking? That's all right. Anyway, my mum always said... the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. If not always in the way we expect. Think I'll just go have some pudding. I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me. What's that? That even though we've got a fight ahead of us... we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have. Yeah? Something worth fighting for.

... spring training camp and
he's definitely got the inside track.


  
Word is that they're having
some problems with injuries.


  
Really? Are they looking into...


  
... free-agent signings last second,
anything like that?


  
Possibly, and they've got
a strong farm club too.


  
They've got some triple-A ballplayers
they might bring up.


  
Peter would certainly be able
to tell us more about that.


  
Who do you like?


  
So far,
I like what I'm seeing in New York.


  
They've got a strong ball club, as usual.
That's in the American.


  
And in the National,
I'm still liking Chicago...


  
... with a little bit of a twist here
for Los Angeles.


  
Okay, so we're looking at
New York-Chicago World Series...


  
... possible Los Angeles.
Could be a dark horse.


  
Hold him to it
at the end of the season.


  
That's gonna do it for us
from the Sports Desk.


  
- Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave.
Thanks for nothing, Eddie.


  
Thank you, guys. That's not all we're
following. Here's Karen at the Health Desk.


  
The world of medicine
has seen its share of miracle cures...


  
...from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants...


  
...but all past achievements may pale in
comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.


  
Thank you for joining us this morning.


  
- Not at all.
- So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.


  
Well, the premise is quite simple.


  
Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...


  
...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.


  
- We're talking about a virus?
- Yes.


  
In this case, the measles virus...


  
...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.


  
Um, I'm not... I find the best way
to describe it is...


  
...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...


  
...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...


  
...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.


  
But then if you replace that man
with a cop...


  
...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.


  
Now, how many people
have you treated so far?


  
Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials
in humans so far.


  
- And how many are cancer-free?
- Ten thousand and nine.


  
So you have actually cured cancer?


  
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.


  
What you see? What you see?


  
Damn.


  
Let's go, Sam.


  
Come on.


  
Good morning, Matt.
It's looking great, I'll tell you.


  
Not only was this the biggest
snowstorm in New York City history...


  
... it had to be one of the prettiest.
Imagine waking up on Sunday...


  
... to 26.9 inches of snow
in New York City.


  
Here you go. Just the way you like it.


  
Disgusting.


  
Excuse me, excuse me.


  
All right. Come on, relax.


  
However, it did strand
planes, trains and automobiles.


  
There was a report, a Turkish Airlines
flight skidded off the runway at JFK.


  
No one was injured,
but for the most part, Matt...


  
There you go.


  
I'm gonna show you, attempting
the Bob Hager rule of thumb here.


  
And I'm gonna plug my ruler in.


  
In New York, in 30 Rock,
we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.


  
Back to you, Matt and Katie.


  
Gosh. All right, it looks great. It'll be
beautiful for the next day, at least.


  
- And then it turns brown.
If that.


  
Anyway, Ann, thanks so much.


  
Mm-mm. No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.


  
Don't just push them around, eat them.
I'm not playing.


  
Good morning. This morning,
all up the East Coast...


  
Okay. You gonna eat your vegetables.
We will sit down here all night.


  
The biggest challenge
is getting back to work.


  
What are you whining about?
Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?


  
Hey. All right, here's the deal.
Look. Look.


  
You're gonna eat twice as many vegetables
tomorrow night. All right?


  
Deal? Deal?


  
Come on.


  
Don't worry
About a thing


  
'Cause every little thing
Gonna be all right


  
I know that feels good.


  
Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds


  
Ah, Sam.


  
Singin' sweet songs
Of melody...


  
I'm all right.


  
I'm all right, it's all right.


  
What's happening? I tried to reach you
on your cell. I get a recording.


  
- Cell service is down.
- Where are we going?


  
- Can't get used to the new regs.
Going to Aunt Sara's.


  
- Ma! No! Why?
- Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.


  
We're at 30 minutes, colonel.
- Copy.


  
- Thirty minutes to what?
- They're sealing off the island.


  
- Seal off the island? This island?
- But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's.


  
Did you bring all the money?
Yeah.


  
How much?
Six hundred.


  
Why did you say, "You're going"?


  
That's not enough.
- Robert.


  
You said, "You're going,"
not, "We're going."


  
When you get across, I need you to get
to the ATM. Get as much cash as you can.


  
Take Sara's car, go upstate.
I'll meet you at the farm.


  
Bring enough food for two weeks.


  
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?


  
Is it airborne?


  
But we only go to Aunt Sara's
in the summer.


  
- It may be.
- Oh, my God.


  
- It's Christmas. What about my presents?
- He's announcing it.


  
Make no mistake, Americans, this virus...


  
You left my Christmas presents
in the closet.


  
Hush now, Mar.


  
- Threatens the survival of not only our
nation, but of every other nation...


  
- Mommy, look, it's a butterfly.
- Marley, enough!


  
And so it is with great sadness,
but even greater resolve...


  
... that tonight I have signed
an executive order...


  
... initiating a military quarantine
of New York City.


  
God be with us.


  
This has been a special...


  
The window is still open. We find
something in a week or two weeks...


  
...we can reverse the spread.


  
I can still fix this.


  
Please. You can do the same work
outside the city.


  
This is ground zero. This is my site.
We talked about this.


  
What are you doing?


  
What am I doing?


  
I'm not gonna let this happen.


  
Let? This isn't up to you.
You can't control...


  
Ah! Daddy, it's a monster!


  
How'd you sleep?


  
Look out. Come on,
you know better than that.


  
Uh-uh.


  
I'll be back.


  
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012,
GA series, serum 391.


  
Animal trials. Streaming video.


  
GA series results appear typical.


  
Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...


  
...11, 14, 16, 18 did not kill the virus.


  
Compounds 2, 5, 7...


  
...12, 13, 15, 17...


  
...all killed the host.


  
Hold on a second.


  
Compound 6 appears to be showing
decreased aggression response.


  
Partial pigmentation return.


  
Slight pupil constriction.


  
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6...


  
...next candidate for human trials.


  
You hang in there, number six.


  
Yeah, that's what you want.


  
Hey!


  
Good morning, Marge.
Good morning, Fred.


  
What are you guys doing here so early?


  
That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred.
Don't set it down anywhere.


  
I'll see you guys inside.


  
What's happening, buddy?


  
Yes.


  
Good morning, Hank.
I'm midway through the G's.


  
Hey, who's the girl in?


  
Never mind.
Hey, I'll see you in the morning.


  
What am I supposed to say?


  
"Hello.


  
Wanna see some infected rats?"


  
Okay, tomorrow.
I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.


  
Psst.


  
Come here. Hey. Hey.


  
Good job. You did so good.


  
Yes. Yes.


  
Ah.


  
Look at that. See that? Red salmon.


  
Wow, actual Spam. Yeah.


  
You'll get some of that later.


  
Let's go.


  
Wait.


  
My name is Robert Neville.


  
I am a survivor living in New York City.


  
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.


  
I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...


  
... when the sun is highest in the sky.


  
If you are out there...


  
If anyone is out there...


  
I can provide food.


  
I can provide shelter.


  
I can provide security.


  
If there's anybody out there...


  
... anybody...


  
Please.


  
You are not alone.


  
Fore!


  
Yeah.


  
Keep your eye on this one for me.


  
Ooh.


  
I'm getting good.


  
Ss-ss.


  
Sam! No, no, no!


  
No! No! Sam!


  
No! No!


  
Sam? Sam? Sam?


  
Sam? Sam?


  
Sam? Sam?


  
Hello, Sam?


  
Sam?


  
Sam?


  
Come on. Sam.


  
I gotta go, Sam.


  
I gotta go. I gotta go.


  
Sam?


  
Sam? Sam?


  
Sam? Sam?


  
Sam. Sam.


  
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go.
Sam.


  
What are you doing?


  
Sam, we gotta go!


  
Sam, go! Go!


  
Sam, get out! Get out!


  
You gotta pay attention, okay?
You gotta pay attention.


  
Listen, uh...


  
...I want you to stay here
on this one, okay?


  
Because you can still get infected.


  
And I can't.


  
So, look, if I'm not back by dark...


  
...just go.


  
Okay. Subject is female.
Likely 18 to 20 years of age.


  
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively
at six times human dose.


  
Core temperature, 106 Fahrenheit.
Pulse, 200 bpm.


  
Respiration elevated.


  
PA 02, 300 percent of normal.


  
Pupils fully dilated.


  
Nonreactive to light.


  
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.


  
Symptoms and tissue samples
confirm subject is infected with KV.


  
Vaccine test.


  
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6.


  
Commencing human trials.


  
Respiration slowing.


  
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...


  
...105...


  
...104 and decreasing.


  
We may have something here.


  
GA series, serum 391, Compound ineffective on humans.


  
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.


  
Still no cure.


  
Day 1001.


  
We came in close contact
with a hive today.


  
Blood tests confirm that
I remain immune to both the airborne...


  
...and contact strains.


  
Canines remain immune
to airborne strain only.


  
You can't go running
into the dark, dummy.


  
Vaccine trials continue.


  
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity
to infected hosts.


  
The Krippin Virus is...


  
...elegant.


  
Just fishing in the dark, son.


  
Mm. A behavioral note, um:


  
An infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.


  
Now, it's possible
decreased brain function...


  
...or the growing scarcity of food
is causing them to...


  
...ignore their basic survival instincts.


  
Social de-evolution appears complete.


  
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.


  
Why are we stopping?


  
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.


  
- We got less than 10 minutes.
- Baby, give me the dog.


  
- Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
Daddy!


  
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.


  
Keep the colonel and his family
between us and don't let anyone stop you.


  
Mommy, they have guns!


  
It's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy.


  
Unless you have clearance...


  
... you cannot pass the checkpoint.
Please return to your homes.


  
Make a hole, make a hole!
Coming through!


  
Coming through!


  
Unless you have clearance,
you cannot pass the checkpoint.


  
Please return to your homes.


  
You're clear. Move ahead.


  
You're clear.


  
All right, that's it, move up.


  
All right, step up.


  
You're clear. Next. Let's go.


  
No good.


  
Military quarantine is about to begin.


  
Come on, step back.


  
- Military quarantine is about to begin.
- Look, look, look.


  
I'm not infected.
Clear. Good, go on.


  
I'm not infected.


  
Please! Please!


  
- Please take my baby. Take my baby, please.
You're gonna have to move back.


  
- No good.
Follow me, ma'am.


  
What? No! Robert! Robert!


  
Get your hands off my wife.
Get your hands off.


  
- Mommy!
Stand down.


  
Lieutenant...


  
- Mommy!
- Scan her again. Get your hands off of her!


  
Get your hands off of my wife.


  
Stand down!
- Scan her again. Stand down!


  
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!


  
I am Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville.
I am ordering you to scan her again.


  
Scan her again!


  
All right, scan her again.


  
- It's clear.
- It's clear. Move through.


  
Who's next? Come on.


  
Take my baby with you!
Please! Please!


  
- Mommy!
- Please take my baby. Please!


  
Daddy, why can't the little girl come too?


  
Stay away from the shoreline.


  
How long?


  
Five minutes. We'll make it.


  
This is Ranger 621, we're on site.


  
Military quarantine is about to begin.


  
I won't take my eyes off them, colonel.
You got my word on it.


  
Give me a kiss.


  
I love you. I love you.


  
Dear Lord, please watch over Robert...


  
...and keep him strong
through the struggles ahead.


  
Lord, please just bring him home safely.
Amen.


  
Daddy's gonna make the monsters
go away, baby, okay?


  
Sam, you protect Daddy.


  
- No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog.
Sir, we gotta go!


  
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.


  
It's a butterfly.


  
All right, come on, let's go!


  
How'd you sleep?


  
Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look
at the ongoing mutations...


  
... of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed
miracle cure for cancer.


  
So far, almost 5000 patients
treated with her retrofitted virus...


  
... have begun exhibiting symptoms
resembling the early onset of rabies.


  
Twenty-five patients have already died.


  
Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals
to stockpile antiviral drugs...


  
... and to begin
preliminary quarantine protocols.


  
It's my birthday.


  
We are fully confident Dr. Neville
can see us through these...


  
You gonna sing?


  
My name is Robert Neville.


  
I am a survivor living in New York City.


  
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.


  
I will be at the South Street Seaport
every day at midday...


  
... when the sun is highest in the sky.


  
If you are out there,
if anyone is out there...


  
I can provide food. I can provide shelter.


  
I can provide security.


  
If there's anybody out there, anybody...


  
Please.


  
You are not alone.


  
Listen, uh...


  
...if you're planning a party or something,
just tell me now.


  
Okay? Because you know
I don't like surprises.


  
And I swear I'll act surprised. Okay?


  
Hey! Hey!


  
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!


  
What the...? What the hell are you...?
No!


  
No! No!


  
No.


  
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!


  
How did you get out here?!


  
Fred, if you're real,
you better tell me right now!


  
If you're real,
you better tell me right now!


  
Damn it, Fred!


  
Damn it!


  
I'm all right. I'm all right, I'm all right.


  
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.


  
Baby. I'm okay.


  
I'm okay. I'm okay.


  
Let's go.


  
Eh, eh! Come on. Sam, come on.


  
Let's go! Sam!


  
No! No! Let's go!


  
We gotta go home, Sam. Let's go!


  
Sam!


  
No!


  
Sam? Sam?


  
It's okay.


  
You're all right. Okay. It's okay.


  
You're all right. You're all right.


  
Samantha? Samantha, look at me, girl.


  
Hey. You're okay.
You're okay. Samantha.


  
We just gotta get you home.
Gotta get you... Gotta take you home.


  
Let me take you home.
All right, come here.


  
Come here. Come here. Come here.


  
Come on. Come here. Come here.


  
I got you. I got you.


  
It's okay.


  
You're okay.


  
Don't worry


  
About a thing


  
'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right


  
Don't worry
About a thing


  
Rise up this morning


  
Smiled with the rising sun


  
Three little birds


  
I promised my friend...


  
...that I would say hello to you today.


  
Hello.


  
Hello.


  
Please say hello to me.


  
Please say hello to me.


  
Die!


  
Die!


  
Die!


  
Come on! Stay with me!


  
Where do you live?


  
Hey.


  
Hey!


  
Stay with me.


  
Where do you live?


  
Where do you live?


  
Uh...


  
11 Washington Square.


  
They don't know where I live.


  
Don't... Don't let them track us.


  
You gotta stay out till dawn.


  
No!


  
Donkey?


  
What are you doing?


  
I would think of all people you would
recognize a wall when you see one.


  
Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.


  
It is. Around your half, see?
That's your half, this is my half.


  
Oh, your half? Hm.
Yes, my half.


  
I helped rescue the princess. I did
half the work. I get half the booty.


  
Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.


  
Back off!
No, you back off.


  
This is my swamp!
Our swamp.


  
- Smelly ogre.
Fine!


  
Come back,
I'm not through with you!


  
Well, I'm through with you.


  
You know, with you
it's always "me, me, me."


  
Well, guess what, now it's my turn.
So you just shut up and pay attention!


  
You are mean to me! You insult me and
you don't appreciate anything that I do.


  
You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.


  
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?


  
Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!


  
Oh, yeah.


  
You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...


  
... for stabbing me in the back!


  
You're so wrapped up in layers,
you're afraid of your own feelings.


  
Go away.
See?


  
Doing it again,
just like you did to Fiona...


  
... and all she did was like you,
maybe love you.


  
Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.


  
I heard the two of you talking.


  
She wasn't talking about you,
she was talking about somebody else.


  
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.


  
Obviously you know that.


  
They're yours.


  
But I did find bacon, which is about
the most fantastic thing in history.


  
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.


  
I put by your plate,
because your leg is okay...


  
...but it won't be for very long
if you don't start a course soon.


  
Who are you?


  
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.


  
Don't let it get cold.


  
It's okay. Go on.


  
We came from Maryland.
We heard your message on the radio.


  
We were at the pier at noon.
We waited all day.


  
We're going to Vermont.


  
To the survivors' colony.


  
What?


  
In Bethel. It's a safe zone.


  
There's no survivors' colony,
there's no safe zones.


  
Nothing happened
the way it was supposed to.


  
Nothing worked
the way it was supposed to.


  
In the mountains. There's a whole colony
of people there who didn't get sick.


  
The virus couldn't survive the cold.
There's a colony...


  
Shut up! Shut up!


  
Everybody's dead.


  
Everybody is dead.


  
I just need...
I need a minute. Okay?


  
Just...


  
I just... I was saving that bacon.


  
I was saving it.


  
I'm just... I'm gonna go upstairs.
All right? Just...


  
I'm gonna go.


  
Ethan, put the knife down.


  
You there! Ogre.
Aye.


  
By the order of Lord Farquaad...


  
... I am authorized
to place you both under arrest...


  
... and transport you
to a designated resettlement facility.


  
Oh, really? You and what army?


  
Can I say something to you?


  
You was really, really something
back there. Incredible.


  
Are you talking to...


  
...me?


  
Yes, I was talking to you.
You was really great back there.


  
Those guards, they thought they was
all that. You showed up, and bam!


  
Tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.


  
That really made me
feel good to see that.


  
That's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.


  
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?


  
Hm?


  
But, uh...


  
...I don't have any friends.


  
And I'm not going out there by myself.


  
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.
I'll stick with you!


  
You a mean, green fighting machine.


  
Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.


  
I like Shrek.


  
That was really scary.
If you don't mind me saying...


  
... if that don't work, your breath
will get the job done...


  
... because you definitely need some
tic tacs, because your breath stinks!


  
Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose. Just like the time...


  
You're not so good with people anymore,
are you?


  
Thank you for my leg.


  
Okay.


  
Where have you been?


  
I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship
out of Sao Paulo.


  
Those boats
weren't meant to be permanent.


  
No, they weren't.


  
When the Navy fell apart,
we started docking to take on supplies.


  
Someone picked it up on shore.
Five of us were immune.


  
You said five?


  
The Darkseekers got them.


  
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?


  
It's too late today.


  
If we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can
make it to Vermont in a straight shot.


  
- So if you had...
- I'm not leaving.


  
This is ground zero.


  
This is my site.


  
I'm not gonna let this happen.


  
I can still fix this.


  
Whoa. You scared me.
- Sorry.


  
I called down twice.


  
Oh. Oh, thank you.


  
It's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.


  
I've never seen one so still.


  
They're always biting.


  
You think that can cure her?


  
Um... No, this will
almost certainly kill it...


  
...but it's possible by drastically reducing
the body temperature...


  
...I can increase the compound's
effectiveness.


  
Did all of them die?


  
Yes.


  
My God.


  
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.


  
Where can Ethan sleep?


  
He's heavy.


  
Can you get that?


  
She's beautiful.


  
What's her name?


  
Marley.


  
- Her name was Marley.
- It's a beautiful name.


  
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.


  
- Who?
- Uh, the singer.


  
Damian?


  
Uh, his father.


  
His father.


  
Nope.


  
I shot the sheriff


  
But I didn't shoot the deputy


  
- Oh, that is unacceptable.
- What?


  
Best album ever made.


  
- You don't recognize that?
- Mm-mm.


  
Wow.


  
He had this idea,
it was kind of a virologist's idea.


  
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate. Literally cure it...


  
...by injecting music and love
into people's lives.


  
One day, he was scheduled
to perform at a peace rally.


  
Gunmen came to his house
and shot him down.


  
Two days later...


  
...he walked out on that stage and sang.


  
Somebody asked him why.


  
He said, "The people...


  
...who are trying to make this world worse
are not taking a day off.


  
How can I?"


  
Light up the darkness.


  
Come with us, Neville.


  
To the colony.


  
There's no colony, Anna.


  
Everything just fell apart.


  
- There was no evacuation plan...
- You're wrong. There is a colony.


  
I know, okay?


  
How do you know, Anna?


  
I just know.


  
How? I said, how do you know?
How could you know?


  
God told me.


  
He has a plan.


  
- God told you?
- Yes.


  
- The God?
- Yes.


  
- I know how this sounds.
- It sounds crazy.


  
But something told me
to turn on the radio.


  
Something told me to come here.


  
My voice on the radio
told you to come here, Anna.


  
You were trying to kill yourself
last night?


  
Anna.


  
I got here just in time to save your life.
That's a coincidence?


  
- Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
- He must have sent me here for a reason.


  
Neville, the world is quieter now.


  
You just have to listen.


  
If we listen...


  
...we can hear God's plan.


  
- God's plan?
- Yeah.


  
All right. Let me tell you
about your God's plan.


  
There were 6 billion people on Earth
when the infection hit.


  
KV had a 90 percent kill rate.
That's 5.4 billion...


  
...people dead.


  
Crashed and bled out, dead.


  
Less than 1 percent immunity.


  
That left 12 million healthy people
like you, me and Ethan.


  
The other 588 million...


  
...turned into your Darkseekers.


  
And then they got hungry.


  
And they killed and fed on everybody.


  
Everybody!


  
Every single person
that you or I has ever known...


  
...is dead!


  
Dead!


  
There is no God. There is no God.


  
What is that?


  
Was it still dark when you
brought us home last night?


  
You were bleeding.
There was light on the horizon.


  
Turn the light off. Turn it off.


  
They followed us home.


  
Ethan.


  
Shit.


  
Anna.


  
Anna.


  
Anna!


  
Anna!


  
Anna!


  
Anna?


  
Anna.


  
Come on. Come on.


  
- Are you okay? You all right?
Yeah.


  
Are you all right?


  
- You okay?
- Oh, my God. You're bleeding.


  
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!


  
Get to the lab! To the lab!


  
Get behind the Plexi.


  
Oh, my God. Come on.


  
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.


  
Oh, my God.


  
It's working.


  
Neville...


  
...it's working.


  
No! Stop! Stop!


  
Look, look, look, I can save you.


  
I can sa... I can help you.
You are sick and I can help you.


  
I can... I can fix this!


  
I can save everybody!


  
I can fix everything! It's working.
It's working!


  
Stop! Stop!


  
Let me save you! Let me save you!


  
No, no!


  
No, no!


  
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.


  
Robert.


  
- What are you doing?
- The cure is in her blood.


  
Coal chute. I think it'll be safe.
Ethan, get in!


  
- Go.
- Come on, get in.


  
- Get in.
- Anna.


  
I think this is why you're here.


  
What are you doing?


  
I'm listening.


  
- Neville, there's room. Come!
- No.


  
They're not gonna stop.
They're not gonna stop.


  
Stay in till dawn.


  
In 2009, a deadly virus
burned through our civilization...


  
... pushing humankind
to the edge of extinction.


  
Dr. Robert Neville dedicated his life...


  
... to the discovery of a cure...


  
... and the restoration of humanity.


  
On September 9th, 2012...


  
... at approximately 8:49pm...


  
... he discovered that cure.


  
And at 8:52, he gave his life to defend it.


  
We are his legacy.


  
This is his legend.


  
Light up the darkness.








Special thanks to SergeiK.




[fireworks exploding]


  
[crowd clamoring]


  
[indistinct chatter]


  
[man] He's in the other room.


  
- Are you Thomas Gates?
- Yes.


  
We got something
that we'd like you to take a look at.


  
I hear you're quite good
with puzzles and riddles.


  
- [man] It's a coded message.
- [Gates] It's a Playfair cipher.


  
- Playfair cipher?
- Can you decode it?


  
Cipher's impossible to decode
without the key.


  
- What do you mean by "a key"?
- A keyword or phrase.


  
I believe what you need is right there.


  
It'll take some time.


  
Go on. I'll take your diary.
I'll meet up with you later.


  
- [horse grunts]
- Whoa.


  
[man]...calculate the distance
and you're sure to hit the mark


  
in about most things
as well as shootin'.


  
[laughter]


  
...ready to pour out all over you
like apple sass over roast pork.


  
[laughter]


  
[woman] I'll take care not to
give up my hold on poor De Boots


  
till I am quite sure of the American.


  
- [woman 2] Ah, that's my own girl.
- [laughter]


  
Augusta, dear, to your room.


  
[man]...to turn you inside out, old
gal, you sockdologizing old man-trap.


  
- [audience laughs]
- [screaming]


  
Sic semper tyrannis!


  
- [grunts]
- [horse whinnies]


  
[indistinct chatter]


  
[Gates] Temples.


  
Gold.


  
Cibola? This is a treasure map.


  
KGC? You're Knights of the
Golden Circle. You're a traitor.


  
You're all traitors.


  
- [man] President Lincoln's been shot!
- [man 2] Everybody, out! All of you!


  
[boy] Killer's on the loose!


  
I'd much appreciate it if you'd finish
deciphering that code now.


  
- [glass shatters]
- [shouting]


  
[grunts]


  
- Dad!
- The war is over.


  
No!


  
- No!
- [gasping] No!


  
You're wrong about that.


  
The war has only just begun!


  
[gasping] Charles.
The debt that all men... men pay.


  
The debt that all men p... [stammers]


  
Dad! No, please!


  
[sobbing] Come back. It's not fair.


  
Help! Somebody help, please!


  
So recapping:


  
The Knights of the Golden Circle
was a Southern extremist group,


  
operating in the north
to subvert Union forces.


  
Had Thomas not burned the legendary
missing pages from the Booth diary,


  
the killers may have found
a vast treasure of gold,


  
and the Union may well have
lost the Civil War.


  
- Thank you.
- [applause]


  
[man] I'd like
to thank Ben and Patrick Gates.


  
Thank you.


  
And say what a wonderful addition Thomas
Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit.


  
Thank you.


  
Thank you, Dr. Nichols.
I only wish my grandfather


  
had been here to see this wonderful day.


  
[man] Excuse me.
I have a question I'd like to ask.


  
What do you think happened
to that Booth diary page


  
- that was pulled out of the fire?
- We may never know.


  
Perhaps.


  
- Perhaps not.
- [crowd murmuring]


  
You see, I have one of those
great-great-granddaddies, like you,


  
way up in my family tree,
name of Silas Wilkinson.


  
He used to tell a story
about the night Lincoln was shot.


  
As Silas tells it,


  
Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates
regarding the treasure map that night.


  
It was Thomas who called the meeting.


  
A meeting to plan
the assassination of Lincoln.


  
- How absurd.
- That's a lie!


  
[crowd murmuring]


  
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you...


  
...one of the missing pages from the
infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth


  
with the name Thomas Gates written on
a list along with all the other killers.


  
- And Latin?
- Booth was a student of Latin.


  
He shouted, "Sic semper tyrannis"
after he shot Lincoln.


  
- "Thus always to..."
- "Thus always to tyrants." We know.


  
- "Surratt, copiae"?
- Military supplies.


  
Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged


  
for supplying Booth with
a rifle and field glasses.


  
- "Thomas Gates, artifex."
- "Designer"


  
- or "mastermind."
- I know what it means.


  
He must have,
uh, planned the assassination.


  
- I see.
- Could mean mastermind of anything.


  
You see that?
Burned out right there.


  
I can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you.


  
- May l, Mr...?
- Wilkinson.


  
I'll see if this new page
matches the Booth diary.


  
This is an outrage.
You're calling my grandfather a liar.


  
With respect, now you're calling
my great-great-granddaddy a liar.


  
Yes, sir, I am. This isn't
some garbage from a history book.


  
My grandfather
told me this story himself.


  
- I saw the truth of it in his eyes.
- I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.


  
We'll test this thoroughly,
Patrick, to authenticate it.


  
It can't be.


  
Maps to presidents' houses.


  
Keys to locks that don't exist.


  
What's the point?
What am I looking for?


  
Proof, proof, proof.


  
What proof?


  
Oh, wow. Is this a book
about the Templar treasure?


  
Yes, it is about the Templar treasure,
but it's also about other things.


  
Conspiracy theories, urban legends
and other myths that are true.


  
- So the author's here signing copies?
- I'm the author.


  
- You are?
- Yeah. See, uh...


  
There's a picture of me right there.


  
I think it's a pretty good picture.


  
I thought that guy,
Benjamin Gates, found the treasure.


  
Well, yes, Ben did,
but I am the co-finder.


  
- Oh, I've never heard of you.
- Oh!


  
Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates?


  
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Do you own a red Ferrari?


  
- Yes, I do.
- Well, it's being towed.


  
Hm?


  
[laughs]


  
Wait! Wait! That's my car!


  
[wheels squeaking]


  
Where's the Ferrari?


  
- IRS impounded it.
- The IRS?


  
Funny story.
My accountant set up a corporation


  
on an island that didn't exist


  
and assured me
that that's how rich people do it.


  
Then I got audited and slapped
with a huge fine plus interest.


  
Wanna know what taxes
are on five million dollars?


  
Six million dollars.


  
But enough about me.


  
[sighs] What's new with you?


  
Well, my girlfriend kicked me out,
I'm living with my dad,


  
- my family killed President Lincoln.
- All right.


  
I need your help.


  
[man] I can't believe
you have to break into your own house.


  
[Ben] I need to get Abigail's ID.
She has access to the Booth diary page.


  
Why don't you ask Abigail for her help?


  
She changed the alarm code, Riley.
She's not going to talk to me.


  
All right.


  
We have 30 seconds after
the alert starts to disable the alarm.


  
- Go.
- [beeping]


  
I'll probably regret asking this, but
what happened with you and Abigail?


  
I don't know. I don't know.
She started using the word "so" a lot.


  
"So?"


  
Yeah, like,
"So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter."


  
"So, you seem to always know what's
best." "So, I guess I'm invisible."


  
Now I've moved out,
we're dividing furniture...


  
- [beeping]
- [Riley] Oh.


  
Women. Can't live with them, especially
if they change the alarm codes.


  
You did that in 25 seconds.


  
That's why I tell people to get a dog.


  
- Got it.
- All right, let's go.


  
[car approaching]


  
[Ben] That's not Abigail's car.


  
[Ben] She was on a date.


  
Isn't that that guy?
The White House guy?


  
The White House Easter Egg Roll
is next Monday. Maybe if you're not...


  
He's weird!


  
[Abigail] What happens if kids
don't find all the eggs?


  
[man] Wow. You work in a museum,
and you live in one.


  
[Abigail] Pretty much.


  
What clever repartee.
She must like him.


  
[Abigail] All right, let me give you
a tour of the house.


  
- OK.
- That's actually kind of...


  
Oh, Abigail.


  
- What are you doing here?
- I just needed to get some things.


  
- Connor, good to see you again.
- Gates.


  
How did you get in, Ben?


  
Riley! Come out here!


  
What? [laughs]


  
Hey! What are you doing here?
I mean, it's your house, but...


  
I sent you a copy of my book.
Did you get a chance...?


  
- No, I haven't read it yet.
- Mm.


  
I know you.
You're the White House curator.


  
- I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in...
- Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.


  
What?


  
Um, maybe I should go.


  
- Yeah, I'm really...
- Dinner tomorrow night?


  
I... I actually already
have plans for tomorrow.


  
You do?


  
- Of course you do.
- But I'm free on Friday.


  
- Awkward.
- Oh, great. [laughs]


  
- Good night.
- Good night.


  
I cannot believe you broke in.


  
- What did you take?
- It's just my things.


  
Hand it over, Ben.


  
[sighs] I need to see
the Booth diary page.


  
You saw the page yourself.
There is no treasure map on it.


  
No, it's a cipher leading to a map.
Anyone spectral-image the page?


  
No need to. The ink writing
on the page is clearly visible.


  
It could have been erased or faded.


  
You're the director of document
conservation. You know this.


  
Not up to me.
It's not my department.


  
That department reports
to your department.


  
Come on. One look under infrared.


  
You can have the Boston Tea Tables.


  
Both of them?


  
[beeping]


  
[Riley] We've been looking
at this page for hours.


  
There's nothing there.


  
Ben, I really don't think we're
going to find anything on this page.


  
In a hundred years,
no one's going to remember


  
anyone involved in the Lincoln
assassination besides Booth.


  
That's not true. Do you know
the expression, "His name is mud"?


  
- Yes. Of course.
- You do?


  
- You know the origin of the expression?
- Does anyone but you?


  
Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted
of being a co-conspirator


  
in the Lincoln assassination.
The evidence was circumstantial.


  
He was later pardoned,
but it didn't matter.


  
Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And l
will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.


  
- [Abigail] Ben.
- What?


  
Look at this.


  
- See that?
- Oh.


  
- That's quite something, isn't it?
- Yeah. It says "smudge."


  
It's nothing.


  
Residual ink
from the facing page. Flip it.


  
The letters are backwards.


  
- It's a cipher.
- Yes. It is.


  
A cipher.
See how the letters are coupled?


  
Playfair ciphers encode letters
in pairs. This could prove his story.


  
Unless you decode the cipher,
this does not prove a theory.


  
That's OK.
We need a five-letter keyword.


  
- What's the keyword?
- I don't know yet.


  
- All right.
- Uh, can I get a printout of this?


  
[Riley] There's a billion words
in the English language.


  
Got to be a logical...
Let's start from the beginning.


  
A. Aardvark.


  
Don't want to rain on your parade here,
but I don't think this is gonna stop


  
Dr. Nichols from announcing
the discovery of the page tomorrow.


  
No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to
wait until I prove Thomas is innocent?


  
What if he isn't innocent?


  
[beeping]


  
Sir? Looks like our old friend
Ben Gates is in the news again.


  
What did he find now? Atlantis?


  
A guy came forward
with a missing Booth diary page.


  
That's not the best part.
Listen to this.


  
"On the page are the names
of the conspirators


  
in the Lincoln assassination, as well
as a previously unknown conspirator,


  
Thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said
to be the great-great-grandfather


  
of treasure hunter
Benjamin Franklin Gates."


  
- [woman] Thought my relatives were bad.
- What do we know about this Wilkinson?


  
- Sir?
- Guy claims he had this page


  
for 140 years then just suddenly
comes forward with it?


  
- Why?
- We'll find out.


  
Better.


  
Better.


  
Bacon.


  
[beeping]


  
- Keep going.
- That's stupid.


  
- How's he doing?
- Keep working.


  
[Nichols] We're grateful
to the Wilkinson family


  
for coming forth with the page.


  
On the page is a name of a previously
unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates.


  
- Nichols has bought into it. See?
- Would you stop watching that.


  
[Nichols continues talking]


  
It's on the internet!


  
- No stopping it now.
- Gates may have been the architect...


  
- They have no understanding.
- You know the truth.


  
That's all that matters.
You heard the story from Grandpa.


  
The story? This guy's got evidence.
He's got everything.


  
We have a story. We have nothing.


  
For one brief moment,
the Gates family could hold its head up.


  
- Now we're a bunch of crazies.
- But we're not liars.


  
Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates


  
was a mastermind to one of
the darkest hours in U.S. history.


  
And he burned the diary page
to cover that up.


  
You and I both know he burned the page


  
to keep Booth's men
from finding the treasure.


  
That's what we're going to prove.


  
- Only one way to prove it.
- Find the treasure.


  
You've got to find it. You're
going to help me find it. So come on.


  
Let's hear the story again
from Grandpa Charles.


  
Grandpa heard his father say,
"Treasure map."


  
- Then there was a commotion.
- Got all that. Anything after that?


  
Anything he said,
something he did? Anything at all?


  
- Wait a minute.
- What?


  
He took his son's hand.


  
He looked him in the eye, and he said,
with his dying breath,


  
- "The debt that all men pay."
- "The debt that all men pay"?


  
The debt that Thomas paid.


  
That's five letters.


  
Oh!


  
Try "Death."


  
- What?
- It's the keycode.


  
The debt that all men pay is death.


  
All right.


  
[beeping]


  
[Riley] L-A-B-O-U-L...


  
It's Lab-ool...


  
Lab-ahl... La...


  
It's gibberish.


  
- Laboulaye!
- Laboulaye!


  
- What is that?
- It's a who. Édouard Laboulaye.


  
Where's the phone?


  
I don't know.
Can't find anything in this mess.


  
- Temporary till I find a new place.
- Find the old one. I like her.


  
[indistinct chatter]


  
- Hi.
- Dr. Chase.


  
- Abigail, please.
- Abigail.


  
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.


  
Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.


  
Of course. I was actually going
to call you about the diary page.


  
- Any news?
- Well...


  
We actually found some
latent letter fragments on it.


  
Take a look.


  
[Wilkinson] Random letters. A cipher?


  
- Maybe.
- Gates seen this?


  
He's the one that discovered it.


  
[cell phone rings]


  
- I'm sorry.
- Not a problem.


  
- I need one minute.
- Please, take your time.


  
Hey. What?


  
We cracked the cipher. It's "Laboulaye."


  
The cipher spells "Laboulaye. "


  
So? Laboulaye was well-known
in France. It could be nothing.


  
Or maybe there was a treasure map
like Thomas Gates said there was,


  
and Laboulaye had it.
We only got a partial on the next word.


  
L-A-D, lad... ladder...


  
- L-A-D.
- Aladdin! Aladdin?


  
- Lady!
- Thank you, Abigail!


  
Laboulaye Lady. Do you know
what Laboulaye was planning


  
right around the time
Lincoln was assassinated?


  
OK, Ben, I've got to go.


  
There's a map or a clue to a map
on the Statue...


  
- She hung up.
- She took your call. That was good.


  
- Dr. Gates?
- Yes.


  
Sounds like he cracked the cipher.
I couldn't help but overhear.


  
Laboulaye? As in Édouard Laboulaye?


  
He seems to believe so, yes.


  
Man who had the idea
for the Statue of Liberty.


  
You're saying there's a treasure map
in the Statue of Liberty?


  
Laboulaye was a Mason.
They built clues into everything.


  
Did you learn that from my book?


  
- Have an interest in history?
- Fascinated by it.


  
Civil War, especially.
My family's descended from


  
Confederate General Albert Pike.
He was a remarkable man.


  
But, then again, what is history but
a marker for the deeds of great men?


  
A man only has one lifetime,
but history can remember you forever.


  
So the only question is,
which Statue of Liberty?


  
Exactly.


  
Is there more than one?


  
There are three, actually, Riley.


  
One is in New York,
one in the Luxembourg Garden.


  
But he only referred to one
as his "lady."


  
But he only referred to one
as his "lady."


  
This is like, impossible,
what you're doing.


  
I'm glad you're enjoying it.


  
[Ben] Laboulaye had to leave a clue
somewhere on here. Move in on the torch.


  
[Riley] Let me get there.
It's not as easy as it looks.


  
No. Believe me, I understand.


  
[policeman speaks French]


  
Excuse me, officer. May I help you?


  
Ah, American, eh?


  
Of course you see no problem


  
in disturbing everyone's
pleasant morning


  
- with your buzzing there.
- Hey!


  
You know how much our constitution was
influenced by your man, Montesquieu?


  
- You know Montesquieu?
- Got it.


  
[policeman speaks French]


  
Montesquieu, yeah. "A government
should be set up so that..."


  
[both] "...no man need
be afraid of another."


  
- That's very good.
- Thank you.


  
- I'm astonished.
- I got it, I got it.


  
- I hope you read French.
- May l?


  
[speaks French]


  
He's a cop.


  
Um... "Across the sea
these twins stand determined..."


  
- Resolute.
- "Resolute," yeah.


  
"...to preserve what we are looking for.


  
- Uh... Laboulaye, 1876."
- Six.


  
- It's a clue.
- "These twins stand resolute."


  
Let's see. Resolute twins.


  
Resolute.


  
Resolute. And then twins.


  
Siamese twins? Siam? Trade routes
between France and Thailand?


  
[laughs] That's ridiculous.
HMS Resolute.


  
A British ship that got lost
in the Arctic in the 1800s.


  
It was salvaged by American whalers, and
then Congress sent it back to England.


  
When the ship was finally retired,


  
Queen Victoria had two desks
made from its timbers.


  
Voilà. Resolute twins.


  
- And where are those desks now?
- The closest one is in London.


  
How fast can we get
to Buckingham Palace?


  
Don't know. Why don't you ask
your new best friend?


  
[speaking French]


  
He's going to call you a cab.


  
- [speaks French]
- OK?


  
- Nice helicopter. Is that yours?
- Yes, actually. It is.


  
- OK, so you get the ticket.
- [laughs] Great.


  
Mitch Wilkinson studied history
at Virginia Military Institute.


  
Graduated 1978. Ran a private security
company which had contracts in Iraq


  
during the invasion,
and in the Congo in the late '90s.


  
These are trained mercenaries as well as
being black-market antiquities dealers.


  
So why does a black market
antiquities dealer...


  
...give up a rare Civil War artifact?


  
Something he could sell to a private
collector for a good deal of money?


  
- [crickets chirping]
- [dog barking]


  
[alarm chirps]


  
[rustling]


  
[grunting]


  
[beeping]


  
[Riley] So the queen's office is here.


  
The elevator shaft gets you close,


  
but the only direct access
is through security.


  
- That should be exciting.
- We got to get you in that room.


  
[phone rings]


  
- Hi, Dad.
- [Patrick] Ben.


  
It's Patrick Gates' phone.
He's calling Ben.


  
Give me that.


  
The house was broken into
last night. I was attacked.


  
Call the police. I'm coming home.


  
- What?
- What good would that do?


  
They didn't take anything.
And besides, I'm fine.


  
OK. We're in London.
We're going to Buckingham Palace.


  
We have an appointment
with the curator tomorrow afternoon.


  
- Son, just be careful. Goodbye.
- Bye.


  
Someone else is after the treasure.


  
Of course someone else
is after the treasure.


  
- It's the axiom of treasure hunting.
- We have to hurry and see that desk.


  
We don't want to miss that appointment.


  
- Hi. Ben Gates.
- See security. They'll let you in.


  
[whistling]


  
Wow.


  
OK. It's teatime, chaps.


  
Looking for the curator's office.
Which way was it again?


  
Follow the stairs round,
then turn first left.


  
Thank you so much.


  
- Ben.
- Abigail.


  
- What's she doing here?
- What're you doing?


  
Your dad called me.
Said your next clue was here.


  
- [Riley] She's really there?
- Ben...


  
- drop her. Lose her.
- I want to help.


  
That's very nice,
but it's a bad time right now.


  
- A bad time, right now?
- It's a bad time.


  
[scoffs] OK, I just flew all the way
to London to offer my help...


  
- Remember the plan.
- You don't need it?


  
You're the one making a scene.


  
- l... I'm not making a scene right now.
- We want to make a scene.


  
Well then, fine! If that's what
you want, let's have it out now!


  
- So subtle.
- Let me guess? It's the wrong time.


  
It's the wrong place. I'm wrong again!


  
Wrong about us,
wrong about Thomas Gates,


  
wrong that you'd like
the Queen Anne chair!


  
You're wrong to assume
I'd like the chair.


  
You see? Everybody, listen to this.
This is more interesting than that.


  
She thinks that even when I'm right,
I'm wrong! Isn't that right?


  
Abigail, just because
I answer a question quickly


  
doesn't make it wrong.


  
Not if the answer's something
we need to figure out as a couple.


  
- That's what couples do!
- Sir.


  
You and your missis, take it outside.


  
Now look what you've done. You've
brought the little bobbies down on us!


  
You take the missis outside.
I'm staying right here.


  
- Ben!
- Whee!


  
- Good afternoon, sir.
- [English accent] Hello.


  
- Been drinking, have we?
- Just a nip.


  
Popped down to the pub for a pint!
Bit of all right!


  
Going to arrest a man for that?


  
Going to detain a blighter
for enjoying his whiskey?


  
- Enough.
- Bangers and mash.


  
Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.


  
- Sir!
- Haggis!


  
- That's it! Dismount the banister!
- I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts!


  
Here they are, standing in a row!


  
Small ones, big ones,
some as big as your head!


  
That was brilliant.


  
- What's wrong with being right?
- Nothing. You should try it sometime.


  
- You're saying that I'm never right?
- I did not say that.


  
Hoo! So I'm wrong again.


  
- Now, see, there you are correct.
- Capital. Topper.


  
- Your mother told me about you.
- [continued arguing]


  
- [man] In here, please.
- Why don't you just make a list


  
of what's OK for me
to say or not write something...


  
- What's right or wrong...
- You two, stay.


  
- Right?
- No! No, no, man.


  
- Don't leave me in here!
- That's great. Wow.


  
What is going on?


  
I'm sorry for getting you roped
into this, but you were excellent.


  
- Thank you. So were you.
- When did you figure out


  
- it was a fake argument?
- When'd you figure out I was


  
- arguing during the fake argument?
- The middle.


  
Where "l assume I'm right."
Get us out. Which I don't get.


  
If I'm right, after I assume I'm right,
then I'm correct.


  
When you get to a conclusion
without asking,


  
and you happen to be right,
you got lucky.


  
I get lucky a lot.


  
So where does that leave me, Ben?


  
You guys are so great together.


  
- Want to know why I'm here?
- Uh-huh.


  
Think there may be a clue on
the Resolute desk in the queen's study.


  
Does that help?


  
Don't understand why it's difficult for
you to include others in your decisions.


  
Just because you may know
what my answer is going to be


  
doesn't mean you don't have to ask me.


  
- [Riley] door number one, opening.
- [buzzing]


  
OK. Let me try this out.


  
Abigail, would you like
to come with me, please?


  
Yes. Thank you.


  
Ridiculous. You're staying.


  
- It's too dangerous.
- I am so coming.


  
- Door number two.
- Door two, coming up.


  
[buzzing]


  
- You're not coming.
- Call security.


  
[Riley] You should be near
a service elevator.


  
What are you doing?
Are those for the queen?


  
Queen's not here. There's
no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.


  
- What are you doing?
- See the desk, without you.


  
- No.
- Don't let her go.


  
- Abigail...
- [clicking]


  
All right. Get in. Get in. Get in!


  
Hold this.


  
Will you give me
the flowers back, please?


  
Yeah.


  
- What?
- Wearing the perfume I bought you.


  
So?


  
So I think it smells kind of pretty.


  
- It's the flowers, Ben.
- No, it's not.


  
Let's go.


  
[Riley] OK, now turn left.


  
- Dead end.
- [Riley] I mean right. Go right.


  
- The flowers... petals... stamens.
- Good. Good.


  
Go, go.


  
[Ben] That's it.


  
[Abigail] The Resolute desk.


  
We're looking for...


  
...writing, patterns in the carvings.
Could be anything.


  
Hey, look at this.


  
- "Malcolm Gilvary, 1880."
- Hold on one second.


  
Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary.
He didn't make furniture.


  
He made Chinese puzzle boxes.


  
- Oh...
- What?


  
I think these drawers
work like tumblers in a safe.


  
OK, four drawers...
Four-digit combination?


  
What about a year?


  
Uh, let me see.
Queen Victoria, born 1819.


  
So you go one...


  
Eight.


  
One.


  
Nine.


  
- Any luck?
- OK... 1876 was on the inscription


  
on the statue in Paris. Let's try that.


  
One.


  
Eight.


  
Seven.


  
Six.


  
[Ben] Uh-oh.


  
New rules.


  
These markings, like Incan or Aztec.


  
I have never seen any symbols like this.


  
I mean, this looks centuries older
than Civil War.


  
What do you think it means?


  
I doubt it has anything to do
with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.


  
[beeping]


  
Uh-oh.


  
Mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of there.


  
- Oi! Where are my detainees?
- OK, let's make some noise.


  
- [beeping]
- [alarm wailing]


  
The fire alarm's gone off.


  
Uh-oh. God save the queen.


  
[man] All units, go to action zebra.


  
- What's going on?
- Haven't the foggiest.


  
- [indistinct chatter]
- [alarm blaring]


  
Someone or something is causing this.


  
- Check your primary stations.
- This doesn't make any sense.


  
Find the source terminal
and check public areas four and eight.


  
[man] This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much. Keep moving.


  
Keep walking until you're
on the other side of the fountain.


  
- Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through.
- I got them. They're at the main gate.


  
[siren wailing]


  
- Oi! Sparkle. Come on.
- OK. Here we go.


  
I'm a little bit allergic.


  
- Riley.
- Thank you. OK.


  
- See you later. Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Sit! Sorry!


  
Thanks for waiting for me.
Can I see the thing?


  
Daniel, hold it.


  
What is that?


  
Went to Buckingham Palace,
all I got was this wood?


  
Look at the symbols.
Never seen anything like this.


  
It's an incredible discovery.


  
- Wilkinson.
- Stop them. Go, go, go!


  
- He's the one after the treasure.
- I'll drive.


  
We're in England.


  
[Ben] It's a gun! Get down!


  
- We're trapped!
- Hang on! Keep your heads down.


  
Hey, who are you?


  
[Abigail] Sorry.


  
- Hey!
- Oi!


  
- Ben, they're getting closer.
- What is their problem?


  
Whoa!


  
- Go left! Go left!
- Hold on.


  
Turn, turn!


  
Watch out!


  
Everybody OK?


  
- Come on, come on.
- Danny, I want them stopped.


  
Look out!


  
Ah!


  
Ah!


  
Go. Go, go, go, go!


  
Did you see where he went?


  
[phone rings]


  
- What is that? Someone's phone.
- It's him.


  
- Have his number in your speed dial?
- Oh, shu...


  
This has to end
before someone gets hurt.


  
Give me what you got at Buckingham,
it won't be necessary.


  
Tell that to my father.


  
- [man] Moron!
- [honking]


  
Why are they standing
in the middle of the street?


  
- [honking]
- [screaming]


  
- Where are these people going?
- Why's everyone running?


  
- He's right there! Go!
- Move!


  
- Get out of the way!
- [honking]


  
- Did I just run over a man's foot?
- [Abigail] Watch the people!


  
Go! Go! Faster!


  
- Right over there.
- I got them.


  
- They're still behind us.
- This phone have a camera?


  
- No. No, it's broken.
- All right. Give me the plank.


  
Hang on.
We're going to run a red light.


  
- [honking]
- Ah! Ah!


  
Hack into the London Police database
and get a picture from that traffic cam.


  
- Okey-dokey.
- You can't do it?


  
No, I can. I just don't like
that you assume that I can.


  
[laughs] Why, thank you, Riley.


  
Get it!


  
Stop! Stop!


  
- He's got it.
- What is it?


  
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.


  
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.


  
- Abigail!
- Hey, Patrick.


  
Nice to see you two together again.


  
- Yeah, well, we're not.
- Yeah.


  
Oh, I was hoping to get some
of these boxes out of the house.


  
I can't read the whole thing,
but I can tell you that


  
these are definitely pre-colonial
Native American markings.


  
- Easily 500 years old.
- Easily.


  
I can identify one symbol.


  
Look at this.
Do you know what that is?


  
Sacred calendrical? I don't know.


  
That symbol is Cibola.


  
That's Cibola.


  
The City of Gold.


  
The City of Gold.


  
[Ben] "ln 1527, a Spanish ship
wrecked on the Florida coast.


  
There were only four survivors.


  
One was a slave named Estebán
who saved a local tribe's dying chief.


  
As a reward,
he was taken to their sacred city,


  
a city built from solid gold.


  
Later, when Estebán tried to find
the city again, he never could.


  
But the legend grew, and every explorer
came to the New World in search of it.


  
When General Custer's search for gold
ended with his last stand


  
at Little Bighorn, it became clear
none would ever find it."


  
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates
got their hands on the City of Gold...


  
My God.


  
I'm going to go talk to her.


  
- You're coming with me.
- No!


  
- Hey. No one else can translate it.
- There are others.


  
There are several others.


  
For ancient Native American?
No one better.


  
- Who?
- Look, Ben, I can't go with you.


  
- It's been, what? Twenty-five years.
- Thirty-two.


  
That long?


  
There's a reason
why we haven't spoken in 32 years.


  
- We have nothing in common.
- Me?


  
Yes, of course. And I'm sure
she's just as proud of you as I am.


  
- Who?
- His mom.


  
- Will you relax? It's gonna be fine.
- Sure. Should look at the bright side.


  
Been a long time. Maybe she
lost her memory, won't recognize me.


  
I hate her!


  
We're in the right place.


  
I'm gonna take myself
out of the line of fire for this one.


  
- [Ben] Hi, Mom.
- [woman] Benjamin!


  
Abigail! What a surprise!
Hello, sweetheart.


  
Hi.


  
Oh.


  
You see? One syllable,
a knife in the heart.


  
- Oh, no.
- She can do that.


  
I can also track the whereabouts
of my toothbrush.


  
I was not the one that left
the toothbrushes in Marrakech.


  
I stowed them both
in the travel case, as instructed.


  
Yes, and you also insisted
on loading the luggage into the taxi.


  
- Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage.
- Not the travel case.


  
Travel case is not luggage.
The case goes into the luggage.


  
- Who was in charge of packing?
- I couldn't get the case into


  
the luggage. It was full
with that stupid rug you bought.


  
You thought it had secret stitching.


  
- How stupid was that?
- Did have stitching.


  
- Six phony green leather suitcases...
- Mom.


  
I need you to take a look at this.


  
- What is that a picture of?
- It's interesting.


  
- We think it might be Olmec.
- It is.


  
Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.


  
We were hoping
that you could translate it.


  
Yes, of course you were.


  
Oh, this doesn't involve
another treasure hunt, does it?


  
Mom, this is actually very important.


  
All right. What have we got here?


  
This... this glyph here,
that means "bird." And that means...


  
Uh, "noble bird."


  
"Find the noble bird,
let him take you by the hand


  
and give you passage
to the sacred temple."


  
[laughs]


  
Oh, you think this is a treasure map
for Cibola, don't you?


  
Well, that is exactly what it is.


  
No, this glyph doesn't mean "Cibola."
It means "the center of the world."


  
You know, you used to like it. She
fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.


  
That was not love. That was
excitement, adrenaline and tequila.


  
- [Ben] Mom...
- I was trying to get course credit.


  
Treasure hunting paid off,
in case you haven't read the papers.


  
Had nothing to do with you.
That was Ben.


  
Ben found the treasure.
You did nothing.


  
Patrick, Emily, please. Can we
just figure out what's on the page?


  
Well, that's it, I'm afraid.


  
These glyphs are only partials.
So you only have half a treasure map.


  
I'm sorry.


  
Not that I'm surprised.


  
[Ben] At least we know
where the rest of the map is.


  
What?


  
You know where it is?
Why didn't you tell me?


  
Obviously you have
a tendency to overreact!


  
- I'm sorry.
- So am l.


  
So where is it?


  
Inscription on the statue in Paris said,
"These twins stand resolute."


  
We think the map's divided
between the two Resolute desks.


  
The Resolute desk.
The Resolute desk?


  
President's desk?


  
The president. What president?


  
- Our president?
- Unfortunately, yes.


  
But that means...


  
Wait, so we have to...


  
The White House?


  
The Oval Office... to be exact.


  
Why would I overreact to that?


  
- That's not what I signed on for.
- Could we focus on the issue at hand?


  
Thank you.


  
[Nichols] It's early, pre-Columbian.


  
- Can you translate it?
- Are you kidding?


  
This is an extinct,
exceedingly rare language.


  
Only a handful of people
study these languages.


  
Where are we to find them?


  
Universities, I suppose.
But you don't have the whole thing.


  
What do you mean?


  
These glyphs here... they're cut off.


  
There's more to the map?
How are we going to find that?


  
We won't have to.
Gates will get it somehow.


  
The Resolute desk is near
the south wall in the Oval Office.


  
Look at this. Look.


  
Small door on the front of the desk.


  
[Patrick] FDR had that put in so
guests couldn't see his wheelchair.


  
- But...
- Guys, take a look at this.


  
[Abigail] This could work.


  
I believe it's time for you to make
a date with your new boyfriend.


  
I think you're right.


  
[man] We hope you're enjoying
the White House Easter Egg Roll.


  
Face painting continues at 2:near the south fountain.


  
- [Ben] That Connor in the bunny suit?
- Thank you.


  
I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll.
It's kind of sweet.


  
Yeah, I love it.


  
I know you. Your great-great-grandfather
killed President Lincoln.


  
No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.


  
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool


  
in a greater conspiracy
that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.


  
Absurd.
Eisenschiml's book is filled with


  
- spotty research and false assumptions.
- Oh, yeah?


  
Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard
left his post that night?


  
Because President Lincoln
was never accompanied by guards


  
when attending the theater. Listening?
Especially on Good Friday.


  
Explain why all the bridges
out of Washington were closed


  
except one,
the one Booth needed to escape?


  
OK, run along now,
you impossible child. Run along.


  
What is going on
with the education in America?


  
- Hey! Hey!
- Connor!


  
- I'm so glad you decided to come...
- Hey.


  
-...with Gates.
- Connor.


  
- We just ran into each other.
- Oh.


  
Aren't you going to ask him?


  
- Ask me what?
- Nothing.


  
- No, really. What?
- I really wouldn't want to impose.


  
Well, what she means is
she doesn't think you can.


  
- Doesn't think I can what?
- She wants to see the Oval Office.


  
- No. That is way too much to ask.
- No, it's, uh...


  
- I can do that.
- Really?


  
You see?


  
- You can?
- Yeah.


  
That is so cool, Connor. I have
always wanted to see the Oval Office.


  
Connor rocks.


  
Well... here we are.


  
- Mm.
- Wow.


  
Empire furnishings
and crenellated molding. Love it.


  
Hm.


  
Amazing feeling, isn't it,
standing in here?


  
- Yes. Amazing, huh?
- Oh, could...


  
Oh. Sorry.


  
Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk.


  
Might recognize it from
the photo of young JFK Junior


  
playing underneath
while his father was working.


  
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.


  
But many people don't know


  
that this desk has a twin
that sits in Buckingham Palace.


  
- Isn't that something?
- Who knew?


  
Every president since
Rutherford B. Hayes


  
has used that desk,
except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.


  
And Ford, of course.


  
- Uh, no.
- Uh, yes.


  
- No.
- Yes.


  
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?


  
Oh! I... I did, yes.


  
Connor, these were given to me
by my grandmother.


  
I suppose we should look for it.
Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring


  
that doesn't belong
to the first lady in the Oval Office.


  
- Yes.
- Excellent point,


  
considering we're not
supposed to be here.


  
- Yeah.
- Why don't we, um, go over here


  
and check it out?


  
I'll check over here.


  
- Do you think it fell down here?
- Yes.


  
- Maybe here.
- Probably.


  
Oh, no.


  
- You did sit on the sofa.
- Oh, the bunnies.


  
Connor!


  
- You found it.
- I did.


  
Thank you so much!


  
Uh...


  
You're just the best. Mm.


  
Mm!


  
Mm!


  
Mm!


  
- [clears throat]
- [moaning]


  
[panting] Thank you.


  
OK.


  
OK.


  
- [Ben] Empty.
- [Abigail] Someone must've taken it.


  
Brightest men in our country sat
at that desk for over a hundred years.


  
- Look.
- Course one of 'em found the map.


  
- A symbol stamped into the wood.
- The presidential seal.


  
It's not the presidential seal.


  
The eagle's holding a scroll
instead of olive branches.


  
- [Ben] I'm not sure what this is.
- [Patrick] What do we do?


  
Did none of you read my book?


  
The eagle clutching the scroll.


  
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah.


  
But it's not something I could tell you.


  
It's something that
I have to show you... in my book.


  
- You didn't even open it?
- I was moving.


  
Chapter 13.


  
- "The President's Secret Book"?
- "The President's Secret Book."


  
It happens to be a collection
of documents for presidents


  
by presidents,
and for presidents' eyes only.


  
And I'm not just talking about
JFK here, guys.


  
The 18 and a half missing minutes
of the Watergate tapes.


  
Did the Apollo really land
on the moon? Did it? Did it?


  
And the coup de grâce... Area 51.


  
Come on, Riley. That's...
that's an urban legend.


  
Is it, Abigail? Is it?


  
It's just totally...


  
- Crazy?
- Yeah.


  
Hm. 'Cause last time I checked,
we pretty much make our living on crazy.


  
- He's got a point.
- I guess so.


  
Same symbol.


  
Released in '66 under
the Freedom of Information Act.


  
The eagle and the scroll,


  
the secret symbol
in the President's Book.


  
So you're saying that
whatever was on that plank


  
is now in the President's Secret Book?


  
[Riley] Ben.


  
If it was you trying to convince me...


  
...you'd have less evidence,
and I'd already believe you by now.


  
The eagle with the scroll?


  
Conspiracy theorists like to believe


  
that it's the symbol
for the President's Secret Book.


  
You bought Riley's book.


  
[laughs] Your friend writes a book
about government conspiracies.


  
- You don't think we know about it?
- But is it true?


  
Does the president have a secret book?


  
Do you like ducks?


  
[quacking]


  
There is a book.


  
Why are you telling me out here?


  
Because inside, I'm a federal agent.


  
Out here,
I'm talking to you as a friend.


  
- Where's the President's Book kept?
- Only the current president knows.


  
The book is passed
from president to president,


  
and each one chooses
his own hiding place.


  
You're the FBI.
Can't you get it for me?


  
Only way you'll ever see that book
is if you get elected president.


  
Well, you never know.


  
All I need is a few minutes with him.


  
A few minutes? Really?


  
Even if you were married
to the president,


  
you wouldn't be able
to get a few minutes.


  
Not when he's surrounded by handlers.
If I get him alone...


  
How do you expect
to get the president alone?


  
Before the Civil War,
the states were all separate.


  
People used to say,
"The United States are."
are


  
Wasn't until the war ended people
started saying, "The United States is."


  
Under Lincoln... we became one nation.


  
And Lincoln paid for it with his life.


  
- So did Thomas Gates.
- Right.


  
With his life.


  
So how am I gonna get him alone?


  
I'm gonna kidnap him.


  
I'm gonna kidnap
the president of the United States.


  
[laughs]


  
- That's not funny.
- I'm your father.


  
How do you expect me to respond?
I can't let you ruin your life.


  
Are you out of your mind?


  
Read my book, and you'd know
you can't get to that book.


  
Exactly how do you plan on doing this?


  
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.


  
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.


  
- What?
- I'm in.


  
[man] Sir, we have to move the party.


  
Some historian claims
the Spencer Landmark Hotel


  
was used for Klan meetings
in the late 1800s.


  
- Anyone know if this is true?
- I've got the Washington Gazette.


  
They want a quote on, "Is the president
being insensitive to minority issues?"


  
- Doesn't matter.
- Get a list of approved alternates.


  
- What do you have?
- Yeah, I know it's short notice.


  
The pipe burst in the hotel
that we previously booked.


  
- l... There is water everywhere.
- A retirement party for 200 people.


  
- Gunston Hall.
- Monticello is booked.


  
So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.


  
The Denby Hotel is available,
and so is Mount Vernon.


  
- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver.
- The Denby is great.


  
Strike that. The Denby was booked.
Mount Vernon's all we got.


  
Book it before someone else does.


  
[cheering, applause]


  
And let me say
what an honor it is to be here


  
and add my happy birthday to you,
Mr. President.


  
[? Randy Travis:
Better Class of Losers]


  
[singing]


  
[siren wails]


  
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.


  
Are you aware that you are
in a restricted area?


  
Yeah, but this is
where the fish are, son.


  
That may be, but I'm gonna
need to have you move upriver.


  
Are you aware that according
to article one, section 
  
of the Maryland constitution,
I'm allowed to fish in public water?


  
Are you aware I have the right to detain
you for the next 48 hours without cause?


  
I am going to go back where
I came from just as fast as possible.


  
Maybe one day I'll wear this thing
to a party I was actually invited to.


  
[? Randy Travis: Is It Still Over]


  
[singing]


  
Twenty hundred time check. Station 11.


  
- [man] All clear. Perimeter secure.
- Hey.


  
You didn't happen to see
a cute brunette wandering around?


  
- Went to get a drink, she disappeared.
- No, sir.


  
I've got no game tonight.


  
Good evening, Your Excellency. Hello.


  
Prime Minister, it's a delight
to have you back in the States.


  
Spread the word, contribution limits
not enforced on the president's birth...


  
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.


  
- Ben Gates. The Templar treasure?
- Oh, right, Ben Gates. Yeah.


  
- We won't keep you.
- Thanks so much. Always a pleasure.


  
I can't tell you what a thrill it is
for me to be invited here tonight, sir.


  
Yeah, you must have
the Secret Service hopping about now.


  
Sir?


  
Considering your discovered lineage.


  
- Oh, yeah. Oh, that...
- Carry on.


  
I beg your pardon, sir,
but I know what a huge admirer you are


  
of George Washington. I thought
you might want to take a look at this.


  
Have a look at that.


  
This is a map of Mount Vernon
drawn by George Washington himself.


  
Mr. President,
that is exactly what it is.


  
- Architectural history major, Yale.
- I did not know that.


  
It belonged to my great uncle.


  
Got it from the granddaughter
of a slave, Charlotte.


  
- Happy birthday.
- Always a pleasure. Thank you so much.


  
Charlotte, who lived here
and worked here at Mount Vernon.


  
- Yeah.
- And we're standing right here, sir.


  
This line is an underground tunnel,
an escape route that was never found.


  
I wonder...
I wonder if it's still there.


  
- Well...
- [laughs]


  
- Only one way to find out, sir.
- Maybe we should take a look.


  
Are we allowed to do that?


  
I mean, I know you're allowed
to do that. You're the president.


  
Can I come with you?


  
- You guys are just everywhere.
- Yes, sir.


  
- Give my friend your flashlight.
- Thank you.


  
According to this map, it should be...


  
It's one... two. In here.


  
Yeah, should be in here.


  
- May l?
- Absolutely.


  
All right.


  
You know, Craig,
I appreciate you doing your job,


  
but I have no enemies down here.


  
In the cellar. In this tiny little room.


  
I'll just wait here, then.


  
[Ben] Over here.


  
- That's the mark of George Washington.
- Only it's slightly different.


  
- How?
- These axes, the angle's off.


  
For it to correspond with the ones on
the map, it should form a perfect V.


  
[clanking]


  
OK, what else?


  
The arrowhead...


  
...is sideways.


  
[rumbling]


  
[gasps]


  
[president] We're all right.
Don't worry.


  
Look at that.


  
Come on.


  
Mr. President?


  
We have a breach
in zone nine! There's...


  
- Inform Fairfax, SecTac Channel One!
- Perimeter detail, lock down all exits!


  
- Gates, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Mr. President.


  
I need to ask you a question,
which I know you can't answer


  
- unless we're alone.
- Two coming in!


  
I want a sledgehammer, I want a crowbar,
I want a jackhammer, now!


  
Tom, alert the vice president.


  
Mr. President, sometime between 1880,


  
when the Resolute desk
was placed in the Oval Office,


  
and now, one of our presidents found
a secret compartment in the desk.


  
Hidden inside was a plank
with Native American writing on it.


  
A treasure map to Cibola,
the legendary City of Gold, sir.


  
All this just to ask me
about a treasure map?


  
That map is a key to proving
Thomas Gates' innocence.


  
I know for a fact that the plank
is no longer in the Resolute desk.


  
You've been in my desk too?


  
I believe the whereabouts
of that plank is now hidden...


  
...in the President's Book, sir.


  
The book known only to our presidents.


  
It contains all of our nation's secrets.


  
[laughs]


  
That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.


  
I saw the seal in the desk, sir.
I know the map exists.


  
You're not going to tell me
how to get out of here


  
- unless you get what you want.
- The way out is that direction,


  
and I'll show you.


  
You don't negotiate very well, do you?


  
No, sir.


  
Mr. President!


  
Where are my sledgehammers?


  
I don't get you, Gates.


  
You do all this,
you're willing to go to prison,


  
just to clear your ancestor's name.


  
The way out is just down those stairs.


  
Everything I am
is because of my ancestors, sir.


  
Thomas Gates gave his
last full measure of devotion


  
to his country to stop the KGC.


  
When someone dies for their country,
I believe they should be honored.


  
"Last full measure of devotion"?


  
Lincoln is my favorite president, sir.
No offense.


  
None taken. He's my favorite too.


  
Sir, I know the book exists,
and my question is,


  
"Will you agree to let me see it?"


  
Even if something like that
really did exist,


  
why do you think I would
actually just give it to you?


  
Because it will probably lead us


  
to the discovery of the greatest
Native American treasure of all time.


  
A huge piece of culture lost.


  
You can give that history
back to its descendants.


  
And because you're the president
of the United States, sir.


  
Whether by innate character, or the oath
you took to defend the Constitution,


  
or the weight of history
that falls upon you.


  
I believe you
to be an honorable man, sir.


  
People don't believe that stuff anymore.


  
They want to believe it.


  
[grunting]


  
[owl hooting]


  
Nearest highway is that direction.
You'll understand if we part ways here.


  
- Gates.
- Sir?


  
The following conversation
never happened.


  
The book exists.


  
- Where is it?
- Where else do you keep a book?


  
In the Library of Congress.


  
X, Y, two, three, four,
seven, eight, six.


  
Thank you, sir.


  
You'll also need to know
three, seven, nine, four.


  
Got it.


  
- And, Gates...
- Sir?


  
Two hundred people know you held me
against my will. I can't tell them why.


  
Unless you find what you're looking for,


  
you'll be charged
with kidnapping the president.


  
- You know what that means.
- Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.


  
- I want you to do something for me.
- It would be a privilege, sir.


  
Page 47. Just have a look at that.


  
[dialing phone]


  
Riley, meet me at the
Library of Congress in 20 minutes.


  
OK.


  
[phone rings]


  
Sadusky.


  
The president's been what?


  
The president's been what?


  
Gates.


  
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.


  
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.
X-Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.


  
- Hey.
- Hey.


  
We're close.


  
- Where do we start?
- XY is the book classification code.


  
Stands for special collections,
which means very special books.


  
- Where are they?
- This way. We'll sneak in.


  
This will be good.


  
Here we go. XA... XM...


  
Look. Do you have a code?


  
Three-seven-nine-four.


  
What did the president say
the number was?


  
Two-three-four-seven-eight-six.


  
Two-three-six-seven...


  
X-Y-two-three-three,
two-three-seven-eight... Here.


  
Two-three-four-seven-nine-one.


  
- Two-three-four-seven-nine...
- Seventy-six, seventy-eight...


  
It's not there.


  
[Riley] Maybe someone checked it out.


  
- Why send us here if there's no book?
- He probably wanted us to get caught.


  
- [siren wailing]
- [tires squealing]


  
Here.


  
- What is that?
- It's a six-dial combination lock.


  
The location is the combination.


  
The location is the combination.


  
[laughs]


  
[Riley] Yes. I was right.


  
Well done, Mr. Poole.


  
Eagle and the scroll.


  
- Area 51!
- Shh!


  
- Kennedy assassination.
- Shh! We don't have time.


  
Yeah, it's true. [clears throat]


  
[sirens wailing]


  
Here. Wait.


  
"April 1865. Queen Victoria
sends Pike two coded missives.


  
The first is received.
Contains information regarding


  
New World treasure. The City of Gold."


  
Wait. The queen
wanted to help the Confederacy?


  
- A divided America'd have been weaker.
- Needed cotton from the South.


  
"The second missive was thought
to contain a Playfair cipher


  
suggesting contact with Laboulaye,
who'll hide clues before his death."


  
The cipher written into the Booth
diary page that Thomas tried to burn.


  
- The one we have.
- Exactly. "1880."


  
Resolute desk arrives in Washington,
sent by queen to President Hayes."


  
Look at that.


  
Missing plank from the White House. Wow.


  
Here's the final entry
by President Coolidge.


  
"1924. I found a plank
in secret desk compartment.


  
Plank photographed and then destroyed.


  
Borglum commissioned
to destroy landmarks


  
in sacred Black Hills mountains."


  
Borglum. Mount Rushmore?


  
He carved Mount Rushmore
to erase the map's landmarks


  
in order to protect the City of Gold.


  
Mount Rushmore was a cover-up.


  
- [police siren blares]
- What is it?


  
There's my tax dollars at work,
coming to arrest me.


  
Not coming for you,
they're for me. Go to the car.


  
- No!
- Go! I'll meet up with you.


  
This way.


  
[clicks]


  
[indistinct chattering]


  
So Gates abducts the president,
lets him go


  
and heads to the Library of Congress?


  
- Why?
- Maybe he wants to check out a book.


  
[clicks]


  
[shouting]


  
This way.


  
[indistinct chatter]


  
[man on police radio] All agents...


  
[dialing phone]


  
- Dad.
- Ben.


  
Get out of there.
I had to move the car.


  
FBI, Secret Service all over the place.


  
Calm down. I sent a picture
of the plank to your cell.


  
- You can do that?
- Yes, I can do that.


  
did you get it?


  
- I got it.
- [Ben] Look.


  
- Take it to Mom for translation.
- Why me?


  
He say his mom
could translate the plank?


  
Find out who she is.


  
- How are we going to find Ben?
- I don't know.


  
- Hold it! Who are you?
- We work here.


  
- IDs.
- Here. We were told to evacuate.


  
[Riley] I don't know what's going on.


  
- My car's parked...
- One second I'm reading...


  
- Special section for...
-...a book, then we're rushed out...


  
- Go ahead.
- OK. Thank you.


  
- Thank you for your help, officer.
- Best of luck.


  
- [alarm chirps]
- Have a good night.


  
[man] Hey, go
to the northeast sectors...


  
[Riley] Start the car.


  
[engine starts]


  
Put it in gear.


  
- Uh-oh.
- What's the problem?


  
It's clear. Let's go!


  
We're going to jail.


  
[man] I want to run a check...


  
[grunts]


  
Get in! Hang on!


  
Mercedes SUV...


  
- He's in! Go!
- Hang on!


  
[Abigail] Whoa!


  
OK. We can do this.


  
Close the barricade, lock it down!


  
Lock it down!


  
- Drive, drive, drive!
- OK.


  
I don't think so!


  
Whoa, whoa!


  
[man] Go, go, go, go, go!


  
Let's go! Let's go!


  
[engine hissing]


  
That did not turn out
the way it was supposed to!


  
- How'd they find us so quick?
- I'll tell you how.


  
- The president is a tattletale!
- Sadusky. He was there.


  
He knows more about the book
than I thought.


  
How'd the president
feel about being kidnapped?


  
How'd the president
feel about being kidnapped?


  
He was OK.


  
- Dr. Appleton.
- This office is closed. I'm sorry.


  
I do apologize
for the lateness of the hour.


  
My name is Mitch Wilkinson.


  
I've got something I want you
to take a look at. Just take a minute.


  
- You're a treasure hunter.
- No, ma'am.


  
I'm just a man trying
to make his mark on history.


  
Can you help me?


  
Um... No, I don't know that language.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.


  
- [phone rings]
- Oh, excuse me.


  
Yes.


  
Got it.


  
Your ex-husband's on his way up.
He wants the translation.


  
Tell him anything but the truth.
Get rid of him. His life depends on it.


  
Emily?


  
I know I'm the last person
you want to see,


  
and I'm not comfortable either,
but we need you to translate something.


  
- Ben sent me. He needs your help.
- Yes, of course.


  
If it's for Ben, of course. What is it?


  
Oh. Uh...


  
It's in the cell phone.
I'm not sure how to...


  
- Give it to me.
-...bring it out.


  
[beeping]


  
We know it leads to Mount Rushmore.


  
Yes. "Islands...
Islands of stone in a sea of grass."


  
That's what the Lakota used to call
the Black Hills in South Dakota.


  
Right.


  
"Find where the moon touches the earth
and release the hummingbird."


  
That's it?


  
Did it ever occur to you...?
I can't believe I'm saying this.


  
Did it ever occur to you that I did
the things I did to impress you?


  
No, you did it because you wanted to,
and I would've done the same thing,


  
except one of us had to grow up
and stay home and look after Ben.


  
Certainly wasn't going to be you.


  
Did it ever occur to you that I made
sacrifices for us that you never did?


  
No, of course not.


  
So just go away.


  
Lousy tequila.


  
Don't feel bad. You did good.


  
Patrick believed every word you said.


  
Besides, your son would have
never found the treasure anyway.


  
You don't know Benjamin.


  
Perhaps not.
But then again, I have this.


  
A letter from Queen Victoria to
the Confederate General Albert Pike?


  
Seems the dear old queen
was partial to the Confederate cause.


  
This has been handed down
by my family for 140 years.


  
Contains a vital piece of information.
The final clue, as it were.


  
This piece of information is worthless
without your translation of the planks.


  
It's ironic, isn't it?


  
This all began with the burning
of pages, and now it ends


  
with the burning of this,
the final clue.


  
Making me the only one...


  
...who can find Cibola.


  
...who can find Cibola.


  
Get your coat.


  
Her translation on the second half
of the planks says


  
- we need to find an island of stone.
- Ben would have found it by now.


  
I don't think so.


  
[whistles]


  
How do I get to, um, this...


  
Hello, Mitch.


  
Mom...


  
- Wait for me.
- No way. You're too slow.


  
I knew you'd figure out
the message I gave your father.


  
The hummingbird was good. Let her go.


  
We're the ones with the firepower,
and you're giving me orders.


  
I kidnapped the president. The FBI
is on their way right now to arrest me,


  
and I'm sure they'll love to meet you.


  
They'll find us both and arrest us both.


  
That path doesn't lead
to the City of Gold, does it?


  
This man has information you need.
He's got a letter.


  
From Queen Victoria
to General Albert Pike.


  
- How do you know that?
- I read about it, in a book.


  
I'm afraid he's burned it.


  
All right... You've had me do
all the work so far, why stop now?


  
You tell me what you know,
I'll find the City of Gold,


  
prove Thomas Gates' innocence,
you can have the treasure.


  
- What?
- I'm going with you.


  
But if anyone's gonna be credited
for discovering the City of Gold,


  
it's going to be me.


  
But your partners stay here,
and all the guns.


  
What makes you think I'd agree?


  
Because you need that treasure.
Believe me, I know.


  
All right, Gates. We'll do it your way.


  
But believe me... I don't need the guns.


  
- Which president? The president?
- I thought it best not to tell you.


  
[Abigail] I still don't see anything
that looks like a noble bird.


  
All right. Let's have it.


  
What did the letter say? What's
the clue from Queen Victoria's letter?


  
"The entrance shall only be revealed
under a cloudless rain."


  
Figure that one out.


  
So we come back when it's raining?


  
"Cloudless." Could simply mean the sun.


  
You need a sunny day... and rain.


  
We need water.


  
Water.


  
Abigail.


  
Everybody, the water makes
the rocks darker. Use the water.


  
Em? Water?


  
- What's this in my hand? Are you blind?
- Good, good, good.


  
This is ridiculous.
Are we going to water the whole thing?


  
That's it.


  
Oh! That's it. I found it.
Over here! Found it! Over here!


  
Look at this!


  
It's an eagle.


  
- Look at that. It's an eagle.
- There it is.


  
- "The noble bird..."
- "Will give you passage."


  
- Uh-huh. Now what?
- We need to join hands,


  
and in a noble manner,
pass over the bird.


  
- [Patrick] It indicates direction...
- [Riley] Somehow that bird...


  
...will rise from the rock
and kind of caw...


  
You can stand around guessing for a
while, or I can give you the next clue.


  
"Surrender your hand
to the heart of the warrior."


  
And the eagle
is a symbol of the warrior.


  
Ben, no. Wait, wait! No.


  
That's probably a horrible trap.
Tell him!


  
It's a horrible trap.


  
It would be a pity to come this far
and not even try, now, wouldn't it?


  
I'll do it, Ben.


  
It's OK.


  
Surrender your hand.


  
[screaming]


  
[laughing]


  
- I am sorry. I... I couldn't resist.
- You!


  
It, uh... feels like a latch.


  
[crackling]


  
Look at this.


  
All right, good. Let's go.


  
[Emily] Oh!


  
Ben, look at this.


  
Oh, that's beautiful!


  
- Patrick. Patrick!
- [Abigail] Ben, what is that?


  
[Ben] Appears to be a counterweight
to hold the door open.


  
- [Riley] What is that sound?
- [groaning]


  
[Emily] Fascinating.


  
[Riley shouting]


  
- [gasping]
- Ah!


  
Ben!


  
[Riley] Sorry.


  
- You OK?
- No.


  
Get up.


  
It's locked.


  
- Patrick, what have you done?
- Some kind of a bolt. I didn't do it.


  
Only one way out of here now.


  
Forward.


  
[Emily gasps] Oh!


  
Never seen so many relics.


  
So beautifully preserved.


  
Looks like we're going
to be moving some rocks.


  
- There's a tunnel back in through here.
- Guys, look at this.


  
It's a little golden man.


  
Look. It's got a tiny little torso.
Look at that. It looks like...


  
[shouting]


  
- Ben!
- Ben!


  
Move back! Move back!
All of you! Other side!


  
Back up! Back up!


  
Ah!


  
Riley, move forward! Move forward!


  
No, back up, back up.


  
- What you want me to do?
- Stop! Stop!


  
We have to balance our weight
to even this thing out.


  
- We'll find 'em.
- What are we gonna do?


  
Figure something out.
Tell you what we're going to do.


  
- No, I'll tell you.
- No. I'll tell you!


  
No, I'll tell you!
There's that passageway.


  
You go, pull those stones out,
because that leads somewhere.


  
That is a good idea.


  
[Wilkinson] There's nothing.
Just a big old black hole.


  
[Abigail] Ben, look!
There's a ladder.


  
- I mean, what's left of a ladder.
- Toss me the light.


  
Riley. Move slowly to that corner.
No! Wait. Just...


  
- As I move to this corner.
- OK.


  
One step at a time. Good.


  
If we can raise this corner,
I think I'll reach it.


  
[shouting]


  
- Stop! Red light!
- You're not helping!


  
I can get up there just as easy as you.


  
Just stop.


  
- Guys!
- It's three against one here.


  
I ain't going last, and if I'm not
going last, I might as well go first.


  
Look!


  
What's it gonna be?


  
We'll do this your way.


  
[creaking, rumbling]


  
The rest of us, on my count of three,
all move together.


  
One step at a time.


  
One, two, three.


  
- You ready?
- Go.


  
[grunting]


  
Ah!


  
[Ben] Mitch, what do you see?


  
Is there a way out?


  
What's up there, Mitch?


  
[both grunting]


  
Em?


  
- Are you all right?
- Just promise me he's gonna be OK.


  
All right.


  
Let's go.


  
Mitch! Come on!


  
- I've been doing the math here, and...
- I know.


  
We're gonna have to leave
one person behind.


  
[Riley] Promise you'll
come back for me.


  
I can do the math too.


  
- That makes you next.
- I'll go last.


  
"No, we'll figure something else out."
"We need you there. Please, Riley."


  
[laughs]


  
I'm just kidding. Go.


  
OK...


  
[rumbling, creaking]


  
- One... two... three!
- Go!


  
Oh!


  
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.


  
Uh!


  
I can't get it.


  
Just go! Go now! Go!


  
- All right, ready?
- Now!


  
Ah!


  
Riley! Hang on!


  
OK. Mitch, the idol.
OK, Ben. We found a gold idol here!


  
We can roll it over
to offset your weight!


  
Then roll it!


  
[Abigail] Here it comes!


  
[Riley] Come on, Ben!


  
Here! Give me your hand!


  
[Abigail] Ben!


  
Thanks, Riley.


  
Why couldn't a girl see me do that?


  
- You all right?
- You're OK. You're OK. You're OK.


  
So... forward.


  
- What is this?
- [running water]


  
Oh! Oh! Oh!


  
Oh!


  
Put your light over there.


  
What are you doing?


  
[grunts]


  
[grunts]


  
[Riley] I can't see anything!
Is this it?


  
It's oil!


  
It's a dead end!
There's no way out!


  
We have to turn back!


  
OK.


  
No. No, Patrick, this is crazy.


  
OK.


  
I got it!


  
I got you! I got you!


  
[both shouting]


  
[gasping]


  
[laughing]


  
[Abigail] There's no forward!


  
It's not forward, it's down!


  
All this water has to go out somewhere.
Otherwise, it'd be filled up.


  
Help me turn this wheel!


  
[Wilkinson] The water's going down.


  
It is... Em.


  
Em. Em.


  
Ben! Hey!


  
Dad! We found it!


  
- Thomas was right!
- No, you were right!


  
Sorry I smeared your
great-great granddaddy's good name.


  
Seemed like the only way
to get you in on the hunt.


  
But this was a chance for the Wilkinson
family to make its mark on history,


  
to find the City of Gold,
to be remembered.


  
[gurgling, bubbling]


  
What happened to you?
Your father was worried sick about you.


  
She was frantic. She was frantic.


  
Dad, coming through,
did you happen to see...?


  
Stop it. Coming through, did you see
any branches that could lead out?


  
No, it's all blocked. You can't even
get back to the big, round stone door.


  
Where's your mother going?


  
[Emily gasps]


  
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.
Have a look at this.


  
- What?
- Look.


  
This is gonna unlock
the Olmec language.


  
It's gonna give us incredible
insight into pre-Columbian history.


  
Oh! [laughs]


  
[Patrick] Em?


  
- You happy?
- Oh, yeah.


  
- Ben! Look at this! Look!
- Oh, yeah.


  
That's where they slit the throat,
cut the heart out.


  
[laughs]


  
[banging]


  
- What was that?
- Listen.


  
[banging]


  
Ah!


  
I tried to find a way out.
All those portals are blocked off!


  
I'm telling you, all this water
goes out somewhere. We'll find it.


  
Ben, there's a current!


  
Follow it!
There's got to be a central drain!


  
It's under us. Right here!


  
Come on!


  
Let's go! Get in there!


  
The water's rising too fast!


  
Let's get that door open
so we don't all drown!


  
Ben, it slopes down!
It's a drainage tunnel.


  
It fills with water
when you open the door!


  
We need to find something
to stick under it to keep it open!


  
No, if it's open,
this tunnel will stay flooded.


  
We've got to get to the other side
and close the door.


  
Patrick, Emily, go!


  
- No.
- No!


  
No!


  
Mitch, we got to be
on the other side of that door!


  
Nobody leaves unless I say so.


  
That door is not gonna stay open
by itself.


  
We both know what has to happen here.


  
One of us keeps the door open
and stays behind.


  
I vote Mitch.


  
This isn't a democracy.


  
[grunting, shouting]


  
Stop! I'll stay!
I'm staying. Look. Look!


  
See? I'm right here! I'm staying!


  
I'll tell everybody
how this is going to go.


  
You and me are going to open that door.
Anybody tries to leave before me,


  
I drop the door,
we start this all over again!


  
Try any funny business, I guarantee you
people are going to get hurt!


  
I won't! You have my word.
Just let her go.


  
Ben, no, we're not leaving without you.


  
[Ben] Abigail.


  
You make my parents leave.
You make my parents leave.


  
- No!
- Let's go!


  
Let's go, please! Patrick, Emily,
he's trying to save our lives.


  
Please, come on.


  
Push, Ben!


  
The current's too strong!


  
- I'm ready!
- It's all yours!


  
Ah!


  
Mom!


  
- [straining]
- Hang on!


  
Hold your breath!


  
Ah!


  
We got to get Ben out of there!


  
If I'm stuck in the door,
it stays open,


  
both rooms fill up, and we all drown!


  
- Open the door! I'll get you out!
- The current's too strong!


  
I open the door,
you'll be washed down!


  
I'll get you out!


  
I found the City of Gold! I found it!


  
And no one will ever know?


  
We can figure this out!
We can all get out!


  
It's not a puzzle!
No more puzzles, Ben!


  
We're all going to die,
or it could just be me!


  
- Tell them I found it!
- Don't quit!


  
- [straining]
- Mitch!


  
Ah!


  
Thank you.


  
- We haven't officially met. I'm Riley.
- [Emily] Oh, hi.


  
Sir! It's for you.


  
Sadusky.


  
- I have my proof.
- Ben!


  
We were just talking about you.
Ready to turn yourself in?


  
Not quite.
We found the City of Gold.


  
Doesn't matter.
You still committed a federal crime.


  
Stop. Stop it.


  
- Mr. President?
- Craig, give us a minute.


  
Sir, for your information,
this is the man who kidnapped you.


  
As I recall, we were
exploring a hidden tunnel,


  
and a door closed accidentally,
and this man saved my life.


  
Yes, sir.


  
- Gates.
- Sir.


  
For the record, after centuries
of exploration, on this day,


  
you have brought honor
to your country and your family.


  
You've done this country
a great service. I thank you.


  
- Thank you.
- Craig.


  
I thought you might want to
take a look at tomorrow's headlines.


  
Tomorrow?


  
Thank you, sir.


  
All of you, along with
Emily and Patrick Gates


  
will get credit for this discovery.


  
And Mitch Wilkinson, sir.


  
- Is that right?
- It's true, sir.


  
Ben, I am curious
about that favor I asked you.


  
Any report regarding
what's on page 47?


  
I believe I can help with that, sir.


  
- So it's good.
- Life-altering, sir.


  
What's on page 47?
Are you talking about the Book?


  
What book?


  
[Emily] Be very careful with that.
Is that distilled water you're using?


  
- Yes.
- Have you catalogued all of this?


  
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't?


  
Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?
Are you cataloguing this?


  
You should've been there
when we picked out our first couch.


  
Excuse me.


  
Hey, you're that guy...
The treasure hunter guy, right?


  
No, actually, the guy you're thinking of
is somewhere over there.


  
No. You're him. Riley Poole.
I recognize you from your book.


  
- Will you sign it?
- [crashing]


  
OK.


  
Thank you.


  
So, um, the tea tables...


  
Yes, I'm going to have the movers
bring them to you next week.


  
I was going to say
you can keep them.


  
And maybe you could...


  
...come and move back in with me.


  
- No. You used the word "so."
- So?


  
So, when you say "so,"
it means you're angry.


  
Sometimes.
And then sometimes it doesn't.


  
It's sort of like a puzzle.


  
And you're so good at puzzles.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.


  
So...


  
[sighs]


  
[engine starts]


  
I love this car.


  
- [tires screech]
- [crashing]

Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End Script - Dialogue Transcript
Voila! Finally, the Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End script is here for all you fans of the Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley movie. This puppy is a transcript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of the movie to get the dialogue. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast names in there and all that jazz, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. At least you'll have some Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End quotes (or even a monologue or two) to annoy your coworkers with in the meantime, right?
And swing on back to Drew's Script-O-Rama afterwards -- because reading is good for your noodle. Better than Farmville, anyway.
________________


Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End Script
 
  
"In order to affect a timely halt
to deteriorating conditions


  
and to ensure the common good,


  
a state of emergency is declared
for these territories


  
by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett,


  
duly appointed representative
of His Majesty, the king.


  
By decree, according to martial law,


  
the following statutes
are temporarily amended:


  
Right to assembly, suspended.


  
Right to habeas corpus, suspended.


  
Right to legal counsel, suspended.


  
Right to verdict by a jury of peers,
suspended.


  
By decree, all persons
found guilty of piracy,


  
or aiding a person convicted of piracy,


  
or associating with a person
convicted of piracy...


  
...shall be sentenced to
hang by the neck until dead."


  
 The king and his men
 The king and his men 


  
 stole the queen from her bed 


  
 and bound her in her Bones. 


  
 The seas be ours 


  
 and by the powers 


  
 where we will, we'll roam. 


  
 Yo, ho, 


  
 All hands
 haul together, 


  
 hoist the Colors high. 


  
 Heave ho, 


  
 thieves and beggars, 


  
 never shall we die. 


  
 Yo, ho, 


  
 haul together, 


  
 hoist the Colors high. 


  
Lord Beckett!


  
They've started to sing, sir.


  
- Finally.
-  Thieves and beggars


  
 never shall we die. 


  
 Some men have died,
and some are alive 


  
 Others sail on the sea
 and others sail on the sea 


  
 with the keys to the cage 


  
 and the Devil to pay 


  
 We lay to Fiddler's Green


  
 The bell has been raised
from its watery grave


  
 Hear its sepulchral tone


  
 A call to all
Pay heed the squall
 We are a call to all, pay head the squall 


  
 Turn your sails to home
 and turn your sail toward home! 


  
 Yo, ho, 


  
 haul together, 


  
 Hoist the colors high


  
 Heave-ho 


  
-  Thieve...
- Thief and beggar.


  
 never say we die. 


  
A dangerous song to be singing...


  
...for any who are
ignorant of its meaning.


  
Particularly a woman.


  
Particularly a woman alone.


  
What makes you think
she's alone?


  
You protect her?


  
And what makes you think
I need protecting?


  
Your master's expecting us.


  
And an unexpected death'd
cast a slight pall on our meeting.


  
Pick those feet up!


  
On the double!


  
Eyes front!


  
No, no, no. None.


  
It always takes me
about a week to get my sea legs.


  
I was throwing up horribly
the last time.


  
Steady as she goes.


  
All right.


  
Have you heard anything from Will?


  
I trust young Turner
to acquire the charts


  
and you to remember your place
in the presence of Captain Sao Feng.


  
Is he that terrifying?


  
He's much like myself, but absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair play.


  
We're through. Make ready.


  
Hurry now.


  
Do you think because she is a woman
we would not suspect her of treachery?


  
Well, when you put it that way...


  
Remove. Please.


  
Remove. Please.


  
Captain Barbossa,
welcome to Singapore.


  
More steam.


  
None of that.


  
If things don't go the way we want,
then we're the only chance they've got.


  
I understand that you have
a request to make of me.


  
More of a proposal to put to ye.


  
I've a venture underway and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.


  
Hmm. It's an odd coincidence.


  
Because you happen to have
a ship and a crew you don't need?


  
No.


  
Because earlier this day,
not far from here,


  
a thief broke into
my most revered uncle's temple


  
and tried to make off with these.


  
The navigational charts.


  
The route to the Farthest Gate.


  
Wouldn't it be amazing
if this venture of yours


  
took you to the world beyond this one?


  
It would strain credulity at that.


  
This is the thief.
Is his face familiar to you?


  
Then I guess he has
no further need for it.


  
No, no!


  
You come into my city
and you betray my hospitality.


  
- I assure you I had no idea...
- That he would get caught!


  
You intend to attempt the voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.


  
But I cannot help but wonder...


  
Why?


  
The song has been sung.
The time is upon us.


  
We must convene the Brethren Court.


  
As one of the nine pirate lords,
you must honor the call.


  
More steam.


  
More steam!


  
- There is a price on all our heads.
- Aye.


  
It is true.


  
It seems the only way a pirate
can turn a profit anymore...


  
...is by betraying other pirates.


  
We must put
our differences aside.


  
Wait for the signal.


  
The First Brethren Court
gave us rule of the seas.


  
But now that rule is being challenged
by Lord Cutler Beckett.


  
Against East India
Trading Company,


  
what value is the Brethren Court?


  
What can any of us do?


  
You can fight!
Get off me!


  
You are Sao Feng,
the pirate lord of Singapore.


  
You command in an age of piracy
where bold captains sail free waters.


  
Where waves aren't measured in feet,
but as increments of fear,


  
and those who pass the test
become legend.


  
Would you have that era
come to an end on your watch?


  
The most notorious pirates
from around the world


  
are uniting against our enemy,


  
and yet you sit here
cowering in your bathwater!


  
Elizabeth Swann.
Elizabeth Swann


  
There is more to you
than meets the eye, isn't there?


  
And the eye does not go wanting.


  
But I cannot help but notice
you have failed to answer my question.


  
What is it you seek
in Davy Jones' Locker?


  
Jack Sparrow.


  
He's one of the pirate lords.


  
The only reason...


  
...I would want Jack Sparrow returned
from the land of the dead...


  
...is so I can send him back myself!


  
Jack Sparrow holds
one of the nine pieces of eight.


  
He failed to pass it along
to a successor before he died.


  
So we must go and get him back.


  
So you admit...


  
...you have deceived me.


  
Weapons!


  
Weapons.


  
Sao Feng, I assure you,
our intentions are strictly honorable.


  
Drop your weapons or I kill the man!


  
Kill him. He's not our man.


  
If he's not with you,
and he's not with us...


  
...who's he with?


  
Charge!


  
Will!
Will!


  
Look out! Look behind you!


  
Ready!


  
Fire.


  
Chart!


  
Boo!


  
Company! Make ready. Set. Fire!


  
Company!


  
Make ready. Set.


  
Fire!


  
It's an odd coincidence, isn't it?


  
The East India Trading Company finds me
the day you show up in Singapore.


  
It is coincidence only.


  
If you want to make a deal with Beckett,
you need what I offer.


  
You cross Barbossa.
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.


  
Why should I expect any better?


  
I need the Black Pearl
to free my father.


  
You're helping me to get it.


  
Uh-oh.


  
Fire in the hole.


  
Thank you, Jack.


  
Thank you, Jack.


  
- You have the charts?
- And better yet.


  
- A ship and a crew.
- Where's Sao Feng?


  
He'll cover our escape
and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.


  
This way. Be quick.


  
Haul the snotters with a will!


  
Keep it taut.


  
Secure provisions
and stow the cargo.


  
There's no place left
for Sao Feng to cower.


  
Do you think he will honor the call?


  
I cannot say.


  
There's an evil on these seas


  
that even the most staunch and
bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.


  
A piece of eight.


  
Nine of them, you say.


  
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.


  
Nine pieces of eight.


  
What's the significance of that,
I wonder.


  
Nothing can hold against the armada.


  
Not with the Flying Dutchman
at the lead.


  
Nothing we know of.


  
Did your friend mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?


  
He was mum on that, sir.


  
Hmm.


  
Then he knows the value of information.


  
Better keep this between ourselves.


  
We don't want anyone
running off to Singapore, do we?


  
- Ah, admiral.
- You summoned me, Lord Beckett.


  
Yes. Something for you there.


  
Your new station deserves an old friend.


  
- Not more requisition orders.
- No, sir.


  
Execution.


  
The Brethren know they face extinction.


  
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.


  
No one said anything about cold.


  
I'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.


  
Why don't that obeah woman
bring Jack back the same way


  
- she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.


  
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul,


  
to a place not of death, but punishment.


  
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself...


  
...stretching on forever.


  
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.


  
Yeah. I knew there was a good reason.


  
Nothing here is set.


  
These can't be
as accurate as modern charts.


  
No. But it leads to more places.


  
"Over the edge.


  
Over again."


  
"Sunrise sets.


  
Flash of green."


  
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?


  
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?


  
I reckon I seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.


  
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.


  
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.


  
Some claim to have seen it who ain't.
And some say...


  
It signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.


  
- Sorry.
- Trust me, young Master Turner.


  
It's not getting to the land
of the dead that's the problem.


  
It's getting back.


  
Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!
Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!


  
Aye, aye, sir!


  
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.


  
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.


  
Fetch the chest.


  
And the governor?


  
He's been asking questions
about the heart.


  
Does he know?


  
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.


  
Step lively, men.


  
Step lively!


  
Stand fast!


  
Steady, men.


  
Go. All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.


  
I will not have it on my ship!


  
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that...
because I will.


  
Because it seems to be
the only way to ensure


  
that this ship do as directed
by the company.


  
We need prisoners to interrogate,


  
which tends to work best
when they're alive.


  
The Dutchman sails
as its captain commands.


  
And its captain
is to sail it as commanded.


  
I would have thought you'd learned that
when I ordered you to kill your pet.


  
This is no longer your world, Jones.


  
The immaterial has become...


  
...immaterial.


  
Charge your bayonets.


  
How long do we continue not talking?


  
Once we rescue Jack,
everything'll be fine.


  
Then we rescue Jack.


  
For what we want most...


  
...there is a cost
must be paid in the end.


  
- Barbossa, ahead!
- Aye, we're good and lost now.


  
- Lost?
- For certain you have to be lost


  
to find a place as can't be found.


  
Elseways, everyone
would know where it was.


  
- We're gaining speed.
- Aye.


  
To stations!


  
All hands to stations!


  
Huh?


  
Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.


  
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!


  
Blimey.


  
- You've doomed us all.
- Don't be so unkind.


  
You may not survive
to pass this way again,


  
and these be the last
friendly words you'll hear.


  
Tie her off.


  
Hard aport.


  
Hold on!


  
Strike your colors,
you blooming cockroaches.


  
Dead men tell no tales.


  
My peanut.


  
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.


  
Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.


  
Step lively with a will.


  
- Aye, aye.
- Right away, sir.


  
I want a fire down below!


  
- Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.


  
Haul! Haul!


  
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalize the lateens.


  
- Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.


  
- Mr. Sparrow?
- Aye, cap'n.


  
What say you about
the condition of this tack line?


  
- It be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?


  
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.


  
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.


  
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you gave a man another chance.


  
Shall I?


  
It's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.


  
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.


  
Precious time,
which cannot be recovered once lost.


  
Do you understand?


  
- Aye, aye, captain.
- Do you now?


  
It will all have to be redone.
All of it.


  
And let this serve
as a lesson to the lot of you.


  
Doldrums, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.


  
I have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots,


  
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.


  
Gentlemen, I wash my hands
of this weirdness.


  
No wind.


  
Of course, there's no bloody wind.


  
My soul I do swear for a breeze.


  
Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.


  
Yes, sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?


  
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?


  
We shall have a magnificent
garden party and you're not invited.


  
Shoo.


  
A rock.


  
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.


  
Oh.


  
A rope.


  
This truly is a godforsaken place.


  
I don't see Jack.
I don't see anyone.


  
He's here.


  
Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he took.


  
And does it matter?


  
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.


  
Witty Jack is closer than you think.


  
Impossible.


  
Boat.


  
Slap me thrice
and hand me to me mama. It's Jack.


  
- It's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.


  
Hide the rum.


  
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye, cap'n.


  
I thought so.


  
I expect you're able
to account for your actions, then.


  
Sir?


  
There's been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?


  
- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...


  
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.


  
I know that.
I know where I am.


  
- And don't think I don't.
- Jack Sparrow.
- Jack Sparrow


  
Oh, Hector.


  
It's been too long. Hasn't it?


  
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.


  
No, I didn't.


  
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?


  
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.


  
He thinks we're a hallucination.


  
William, tell me something:


  
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,


  
or rather, damsel in distress?
Either one.


  
No.


  
Well, then,
you wouldn't be here, would you?


  
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.


  
Jack.
Jack


  
This is real. We're here.


  
- The Locker, you say?
- Aye.


  
We've come to rescue you.


  
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.


  
But it would seem that
as I possess a ship and you don't,


  
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.


  
I see my ship. Right there.


  
Can't spot it.


  
Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.


  
Jack, Cutler Beckett
has the heart of Davy Jones.


  
- He controls the Flying Dutchman.
- He's taking over the seas.


  
The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.


  
Leave you alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.


  
Aye. The world
needs you back something fierce.


  
And you need a crew.


  
Why should I sail with any of you?


  
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.


  
Oh, she's not told you.


  
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.


  
As for you...


  
Now... don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.


  
Fair enough. All right, you're in.


  
Don't need you. You scare me.


  
Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm...


  
- Cotton.
Cotton


  
Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy, but
at least I'll have someone to talk to.


  
Who are you?


  
Tai Huang. These are my men.


  
- Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.


  
- I have a ship.
- That makes you the highest bidder.


  
Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.


  
Weigh anchor.


  
Jack...
Jack...


  
Which way are you going, Jack?


  
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.


  
- Haul the pennant line.
- Haul the pennant line.


  
What are you doing?


  
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?


  
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?


  
What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.


  
The captain of the ship
is giving orders.


  
- My ship, makes me captain.
- They be my charts.


  
That makes you "chartman."


  
Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?!


  
Sorry. I just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,


  
I'd throw in my name for consideration.


  
Sorry.


  
- I'd vote for you.
- Yeah?


  
You left Jack to the Kraken.


  
He's rescued now. It's done with.


  
Will, I had no choice.


  
You chose not to tell me.


  
I couldn't.


  
It wasn't your burden to bear.


  
But I did bear it, didn't I?


  
I just didn't know what it was.


  
I thought...


  
You thought I loved him.


  
If you make your choices alone,
how can I trust you?


  
You can't.


  
Eerie.


  
That's downright macabre.


  
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them?


  
Be disrespectful, it would.


  
They should be
in the care of Davy Jones.


  
That was the duty
him was charged with...


  
...by the goddess, Calypso.


  
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.


  
And every ten years...


  
...him could come ashore...


  
...to be with she
who love him... truly.


  
But the man has become a monster.


  
So he wasn't always... tentacley?


  
No.


  
Him was a man...


  
...once.


  
Now there's boats coming.


  
They're not a threat to us. Am I right?


  
We are nothing but ghosts to them.


  
It's best just let them be.


  
It's my father. We've made it back.


  
Father! Father, here, look here!


  
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth


  
We're not back.


  
Father!


  
Elizabeth. Are you dead?


  
No. No.


  
I think I am.


  
No, you can't be.


  
There was this chest, you see.


  
It's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.


  
Come aboard.


  
And a heart.


  
I learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place.


  
And you will sail the seas for eternity.


  
The Dutchman must have a captain.


  
Silly thing to die for.


  
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!


  
Come on.


  
A touch... of destiny.


  
Take the line.


  
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.


  
Father, the line! Take the line!


  
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!


  
Please come with us!
Please! No! I won't leave you!


  
I'll give your love to your mother.


  
- Please, I won't let you go!
- Elizabeth.
- Elizabeth


  
- Elizabeth.
Elizabeth


  
Is there a way?


  
Him at peace.


  
No water.


  
Why is all but the rum gone?


  
Rum's gone too.


  
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,


  
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.


  
Doomed to roam the reach between worlds.


  
Forever.


  
With no water, forever
looks to be arriving a mite too soon.


  
Why doesn't he do something?


  
- Me eye. Give it back!
- There's no sense to it.


  
And the green flash
happens at sunset, not sunrise.


  
"Over the edge." Ah, it's
driving me over the blooming edge.


  
Sunrises don't set.


  
"Up is down."


  
Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.


  
Why are these things never clear?


  
- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What? Eh?


  
- Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.


  
- Come again?
- The Dutchman must have a captain.


  
That's even more
than less than unhelpful.


  
Sail the seas for eternity.


  
- I love the sea.
- What about port?


  
I prefer rum. Rum's good.


  
Making port. Where we can get rum,
and salty wenches...


  
- Once every 10 years.
- What'd he say?


  
- Once every 10 years.
- Ten years is a long time, mate.


  
Even longer given the deficit of rum.


  
But eternity is longer still.


  
And how will you be spending it? Dead?


  
Or not?


  
- The immortal Captain Sparrow.
- Oh, I like that.


  
Come sunset, it won't matter.


  
Not sunset.


  
Sundown.


  
And rise. Up.


  
What's that?


  
What is that?
I don't know. What do you think?


  
- Where?
- There.


  
What is it?


  
He's rocking the ship.


  
We're rocking the ship.


  
Aye. He's onto it.


  
He's rocking the ship.


  
We'll tie each other
to the mast upside down,


  
so when the boat flips
we'll be the right way up.


  
Time it with the swell.


  
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.


  
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.


  
Now up...


  
...is down.


  
This was your idea.


  
Blessed sweet westerlies!


  
We're back!


  
It's the sunrise.


  
Parley?


  
We need our pistols!
Get untied, hurry!


  
All right, then!


  
The Brethren Court
is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.


  
And, Jack, you and I are a-going.
There'll be no arguing that point.


  
I is arguing the point.


  
If there's pirates a-gathering,
I'm pointing my ship the other way.


  
The pirates are gathering
to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.


  
Fight or not,
you're not running, Jack.


  
If we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down one by one,


  
till there be none left but you.


  
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.


  
Aye.


  
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.
How does that figure into your plan?


  
I'm still working on that.


  
But I will not be going back
to the Locker, mate. Count on that.


  
Wet powder.


  
Wait! We can still use them as clubs!


  
- Ow!
- Sorry. Effective, though.


  
There's fresh water on this island.


  
We can resupply there and get back
to shooting each other later.


  
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.


  
I'll not be leaving
my ship in your command.


  
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command.


  
Temporarily.


  
Mind the boat.


  
- Criminy.
- Odds bodkins!


  
Careful! Careful!


  
You stupid fish!


  
Actually it's a cephalopod.


  
Serves you right.


  
Pin, I bet people
would pay a shilling to see this.


  
And another shilling
for a sketch of them sitting atop!


  
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.


  
We could serve up
a slice as a souvenir.


  
Still thinking of running, Jack?


  
Think you can outrun the world?


  
You know, the problem
with being the last of anything...


  
...by and by, there be none left at all.


  
Sometimes things come back, mate.
We're living proof, you and me.


  
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?


  
There's never
a guarantee of coming back.


  
But passing on, that's dead certain.


  
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?


  
It's our only hope, lad.


  
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.


  
The world used to be a bigger place.


  
The world's still the same.


  
There's just... less in it.


  
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.


  
Eh, I know him. He was in Singapore!


  
- Singapore.
- Captain!


  
Hoy!


  
We got company!


  
He's the captain.


  
Sao Feng...


  
...you showing up here,
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.


  
Jack Sparrow.
Jack Sparrow


  
You paid me great insult once.


  
That doesn't sound like me.


  
Shall we just call it square, then?


  
Release her.


  
- She's not part of the bargain.
- And what bargain be that?


  
You heard Captain Turner.


  
- Release her!
- "Captain Turner"?


  
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!


  
I need the Pearl to free my father.


  
That's the only reason
I came on this voyage.


  
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?


  
It was my burden to bear.


  
He needs the Pearl.
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.


  
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.


  
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?


  
I'm standing with them.


  
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see you first.


  
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.


  
Here is your chance to find out.


  
Curious.


  
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.


  
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates


  
can defeat the Flying Dutchman.


  
And so despair leads to betrayal.


  
But you and I are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?


  
It's not here, Jack.


  
What? What isn't?


  
The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the Dutchman,


  
and so unavailable for use as leverage


  
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.


  
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.


  
By your death?


  
And yet here you are.


  
Close your eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.


  
That's how I get by.


  
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of your survival?


  
Ship oars.


  
Ship oars.


  
Be on your guard, men.


  
My men are crew enough.


  
Company ship, company crew.


  
You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.


  
And so it was.


  
Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement.


  
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you but information.


  
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
In exchange for fair compensation?


  
Square my debt with Jones...


  
...guarantee my freedom?


  
Of course.


  
It's just good business.


  
Were I in a divulgatory mood,
what then might I divulge?


  
Everything.


  
Where are they meeting?


  
Who are the pirate lords?


  
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?


  
Prepare the brig.


  
Beckett agreed the Black Pearl
was to be mine.


  
He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?


  
Shame they're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?


  
Because honor's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.


  
There is no honor
to remaining with the losing side.


  
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.


  
- The losing side, you say?
- They have the Dutchman.


  
Now the Pearl!


  
And what do the Brethren have?


  
We have Calypso.


  
Calypso.


  
An old legend.


  
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.


  
Imagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.


  
I intend to release her.
But for that I need the Brethren Court.


  
All the Court.


  
You can keep Barbossa.


  
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.


  
And Turner. Especially Turner.


  
The rest go with me on the Pearl.
I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,


  
where I will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.


  
- Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?


  
What interest is she to you?


  
What are you proposing, captain?


  
What be accepting, cap'n?


  
- The girl.
- What?


  
Jack.
Jack


  
I've just recalled.


  
I've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever I want.


  
So for what do I need you?


  
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.


  
Out of the question.


  
It was not a question.


  
Points to the thing you want most.


  
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?


  
- Then what is, Jack?
- Me.


  
- Dead.
- Done.


  
What? Not done.


  
You got us into this.
If it frees us, then done!


  
Damn.


  
Although, if I kill you,
then I can use the compass


  
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.


  
Cut out the middle man, as it were.


  
Elizabeth, they are pirates.


  
I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!


  
Then we have an accord?


  
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the cove,


  
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...


  
...able to withstand blockade for years.


  
Then you'd be wishing,"If only there
was someone I had not killed inside


  
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."


  
And you can accomplish all this?


  
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.


  
Who am I?


  
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.


  
Done!


  
Man overboard!


  
You're mad.


  
Thank goodness.
If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.


  
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.


  
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.


  
Which ship do we follow?


  
Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.


  
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?


  
She's going down!


  
Stand clear!


  
Do you think he plans it all out,
or just makes it up as he goes along?


  
Sir.


  
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.


  
Calypso.


  
Excuse me?


  
Not a name you fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that you have...


  
...but it is what we call you.


  
We being who?


  
You confirm it.


  
Confirm what?


  
- You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not I.


  
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision I would have opposed.


  
They bound you to human form


  
so the rule of the seas
would belong to man and not...


  
To me.


  
But one such as you should never
be anything less than what you are.


  
Pretty speech from a captor.


  
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.


  
Can I be blamed for my efforts?


  
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.


  
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.


  
I offer simply my desire.


  
And in return?


  
I would have your gifts,
should you choose to give them.


  
And if I should choose not?


  
Then I will take...


  
...your fury.


  
Sao Feng?


  
Here.


  
Please.


  
With all nine pieces of eight...


  
...you will be free.


  
Take it!


  
You are captain now.


  
Me?


  
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.


  
Captain! The ship is taken.
We cannot...


  
Forgive me... Calypso.


  
Sao.


  
What did he tell you?


  
He made me captain.


  
Set! Fire!


  
You are not my captain.


  
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth


  
James. James.
James James


  
Thank God, you're alive.


  
Your father'll be overjoyed


  
- to know you're safe.
- My father's dead.


  
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.


  
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?


  
Who among you
do you name as captain?


  
Captain. Her.


  
Her.


  
Captain?


  
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.


  
The captain shall have my quarters.


  
Thank you, sir.


  
- But I prefer to remain with my crew.
- Elizabeth.
- Elizabeth


  
I swear.


  
I did not know.


  
Know what?
Which side you chose?


  
Well, now you do.


  
Bootstrap?


  
Bootstrap.


  
Bill Turner?
Bill Turner?


  
Bootstrap.


  
You know my name.


  
Yes, I know your son.


  
Will Turner.
Will Turner


  
William.
William


  
He made it. He's alive.


  
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.


  
God's wounds. He's on his way.


  
Yes, Will is alive.


  
And he wants to help you.


  
He can't help me. He won't come.


  
But you're his father.


  
I know you.


  
He spoke of you.


  
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.


  
Me?


  
You're Elizabeth.


  
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.


  
If Jones be slain,
he who slays him must take his place.


  
Captain... Forever.


  
The Dutchman
must always have a captain.


  
And if he saves me...


  
...he loses you.


  
I see.


  
He won't pick me.


  
I wouldn't pick me.


  
Tell him not to come.


  
Tell him to stay away.


  
Tell him it's too late.


  
I'm already a part of the ship...


  
...and the crew.


  
Bootstrap.


  
You know my name.


  
You know my name.


  
Yes, I know your son.


  
William.
William


  
He's coming for me.


  
Wait and see.


  
You'll see.


  
He promised.


  
Swing her over.


  
Ready those lines.


  
Sir.


  
A breadcrumb trail.


  
- And we're meant to follow.
- A betrayer among them?


  
- Or a trap?
- A gambit by a skilled opponent.


  
- Adjust course, lieutenant.
- Sir?


  
We can only hope
to reach our destination


  
before they run out of bodies.


  
You escaped the brig
even quicker than I expected.


  
William, do you notice anything?


  
Rather...


  
...do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?


  
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?


  
Not as odd as this.


  
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?


  
I said to myself,"Think like Jack."


  
This is what you've arrived at?


  
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...


  
...accomplish your own ends?


  
It's like you don't know me at all.


  
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?


  
Ah.


  
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.


  
I'm losing her, Jack.


  
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.


  
If you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.


  
If I might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...


  
...avoid the choice altogether.


  
Change the facts.


  
Let someone else dispatch Jones.


  
Who?


  
You?


  
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.


  
I slip aboard the Dutchman,
find the heart, stab the beating thing,


  
your father's free from his debt,


  
you're free to be
with your charming murderess.


  
You're willing to cut out your heart
and bind yourself to the Dutchman...


  
...forever?
- No, mate. I'm free forever.


  
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.


  
You have to do the job though, Jack.


  
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.


  
Or end up just like Jones.


  
I don't have the face for tentacles.


  
But immortal has to
count for something, eh?


  
What's this for?


  
Think like me. It'll come to you.


  
My regards to Davy Jones.


  
I hate him.


  
Come with me.


  
Quickly.


  
What are you doing?


  
Choosing a side.


  
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.


  
I fear there may be
a traitor among them.


  
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.


  
I had nothing to do
with your father's death.


  
But that does not absolve me
of my other sins.


  
Come with us.


  
James, come with me.


  
Who goes there?


  
Go. I will follow.


  
You're lying.


  
Our destinies have been entwined,
Elizabeth...


  
...but never joined.


  
Go, now.


  
Back to your station, sailor.


  
- No one leaves the ship.
- Stand down. That's an order.


  
That's an order.


  
Part of the crew, part of the ship.


  
Part of the crew,
part of the ship. Part of the crew...


  
- Steady, man.
- Part of the crew, part of the ship.


  
All hands, prisoner escape!


  
- Belay that!
- James!
- James!


  
Prisoner escape!


  
James! No!


  
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?


  
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead.


  
- To the captain's cabin!
- Aye!


  
Back to the ship.


  
James Norrington. Do you fear death?


  
I take that as a "no."


  
Nice sword.


  
The Dutchman is under my command.


  
For now.


  
Look alive and keep a weather eye.


  
Not for naught
it's called Shipwreck Island.


  
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the town of Shipwreck.


  
You heard him. Step lively.


  
For all that pirates are clever clogs,


  
we are unimaginative
when it comes to naming things.


  
Aye.


  
I once sailed with a geezer who lost
both of his arms and part of his eye.


  
What'd you call him?


  
Larry.


  
I do not renege
on a bargain once struck.


  
But we agreed on ends only.


  
The means are mine to decide.


  
Caution, Barbossa.


  
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.


  
Or what it mean if you fail me.


  
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back.


  
Why I could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.


  
It took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.


  
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.


  
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.


  
Take this fishwife to the brig.


  
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.


  
I cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.


  
Apparently, you can.


  
I believe you know each other.


  
Come to join my crew again,
Master Turner?


  
Not yours.


  
His.


  
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.


  
Sparrow?
Sparrow?


  
You didn't tell him.


  
We rescued Jack from the Locker
along with the Black Pearl.


  
What else have you not told me?


  
There is an issue far more troublesome.


  
I believe you're familiar
with a person called Calypso.


  
Not a person.


  
A heathen god.


  
One who delights in cursing men
with their wildest dreams


  
and then revealing them to be
hollow and naught but ash.


  
- The world is well rid of her.
- Not quite so well, actually.


  
The Brethren Court
intends to release her.


  
No! They cannot!


  
The First Court
promised to imprison her forever.


  
- That was our agreement.
- Your agreement?


  
I showed them how to bind her.


  
She could not be trusted.


  
I... She gave me no choice.


  
We must act before they release her.


  
You loved her.


  
She's the one.


  
And then you betrayed her.


  
She pretended to love me.


  
She betrayed me.


  
And after which betrayal
did you cut out your heart, I wonder.


  
Do not test me.


  
I hadn't finished that.


  
You will free my father.


  
And you will guarantee
Elizabeth's safety.


  
Along with my own.


  
Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.


  
We will expect fair value in return.


  
There is only one price I will accept:


  
Calypso murdered.


  
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.


  
Jack has sailed
the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.


  
And with you no longer aboard her,
how do you propose to lead us there?


  
What is it you want most?


  
Look at them all.


  
There's not been a gathering
like this in our lifetime.


  
And I owe them all money.


  
As he who issued summons,


  
I convene this,
the Fourth Brethren Court.


  
To confirm your lordship
and right to be heard,


  
present now your pieces of eight,
my fellow cap'ns.


  
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.


  
Aye. The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.


  
But when the First Court met,
the Brethren were to a one skint broke.


  
So change the name.


  
To "nine pieces of whatever we happened
to have in our pockets at the time?"


  
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.


  
Master Ragetti, if you will.


  
I kept it safe, just like
you said when you gave it to me.


  
Aye, you have.
But now I need it back.


  
Sparrow.
Sparrow


  
Might I point out that
we are still short one pirate lord,


  
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.


  
Sao Feng is dead.


  
He fell to the Flying Dutchman.


  
The plagued ship.


  
He made you captain? They're
giving the bloody title away now.


  
Listen. Listen to me.


  
Our location has been betrayed.


  
Jones is under the command of
Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.


  
- Who is this betrayer?
- Not likely anyone among us.


  
- Where's Will?
- Not among us.


  
It matters not how they found us.
The question is,


  
what will we do now that they have?


  
We fight.


  
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.


  
A well-supplied fortress.


  
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.


  
There be a third course.


  
In another age, at this very spot,


  
the First Brethren Court captured the
sea goddess and bound her in her bones.


  
That was a mistake.


  
Oh, we tamed the seas
for ourselves, aye.


  
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.


  
Better were the days
when mastery of seas


  
came not from bargains
struck with eldritch creatures,


  
but from the sweat of a man's brow
and the strength of his back alone.


  
You all know this to be true.


  
Gentlemen.


  
Ladies.


  
We must free Calypso.


  
- Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue!


  
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then
shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.


  
Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.


  
Calypso was our enemy then,
she will be our enemy now.


  
It's unlikely her mood's improved.


  
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.


  
- You threaten me?
- I silence you.


  
- This is madness.
- This is politics.


  
Meanwhile, our enemies
are bearing down upon us.


  
If they not be here already.


  
My sweet.


  
You come for me.


  
- You were expecting me.
- It has been torture.


  
Trapped in this single form.


  
Cut off from the sea.


  
From all that I love.


  
From you.


  
Ten years I devoted
to the duty you charged to me.


  
Ten years I looked after
those who died at sea.


  
And, finally,
when we could be together again...


  
...you weren't there.


  
Why weren't you there?


  
It's my nature.


  
Would you love me
if I was anything but what I am?


  
I do not love you.


  
Many things you were, Davy Jones.


  
But never cruel.


  
You have corrupted your purpose...


  
...and so your self.


  
And you did hide away
what should always have been mine.


  
Calypso.


  
I will be free.


  
And when I am,
I would give you my heart.


  
And we would be together always.


  
If only you had a heart to give.


  
Why did you come?


  
And what fate have you planned
for your captors?


  
The Brethren Court?


  
All of them, the last thing
they will learn in this life...


  
...is how cruel I can be.


  
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?


  
My heart will always belong to you.


  
It was the First Court
what imprisoned Calypso.


  
We should be the ones to set her free.


  
And in her gratitude,
she will see fit to grant us boons.


  
Whose boons? Your boons?


  
Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.


  
If you have a better alternative,
please, share.


  
Cuttlefish.


  
Aye.


  
Let us not, dear friends,


  
forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.


  
Flipping glorious little sausages.


  
Pen them up together, they'll devour
each other without a second thought.


  
Human nature, isn't it?


  
Or... Or fish nature.


  
So, yes, we could hole up here
well-provisioned and well-armed.


  
Half of us would be dead
within the month.


  
Which seems quite grim to me,
any way you slice it. Or...


  
Uh...


  
As my learned colleague
so naively suggests,


  
we can release Calypso, and we
can pray that she will be merciful.


  
I rather doubt it.


  
Can we pretend she's anything
other than a woman scorned


  
like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.


  
Res ipsa loquitur, tabula in naufragio.


  
We are left with but one option.


  
I agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth...


  
...Captain Swann. We must fight.


  
- You've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.


  
- Have so.
- Have not.


  
- Have so.
- Have not!


  
- You have so, and you know it.
- Have not. Slander and calumny.


  
I have only ever embraced that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.


  
I submit that here now
that is what we all must do:


  
We must fight...


  
...to run away.


  
- Aye!
- Aye!


  
As per the code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,
As per the code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,


  
can only be declared by the pirate king.


  
- You made that up.
- Did I, now?


  
I call on Cap'n Teague,
keeper of the code.


  
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly!


  
Hang the code. Who cares a...?


  
Code is the law.


  
You're in my way, boy.


  
- The code.
- The code.


  
As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.


  
- That can't... How did...
- Sea turtles, mate.


  
Sea turtles.


  
Ah. Barbossa is right.


  
Hang on a minute.


  
"It shall be the duties, as the king,


  
to declare war,
parley with shared adversaries..."


  
Fancy that.


  
There has not been a king
since the First Court.


  
And that's not likely to change.


  
- Not likely.
- Why not?


  
See, the pirate king
is elected by popular vote.


  
And each pirate
only ever votes for hisself.


  
I call for a vote.


  
I vote for Ammand the corsair.


  
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.


  
Sri Sumbhajee
votes for Sri Sumbhajee.


  
Mistress Ching.


  
Gentleman Jocard.


  
- Elizabeth Swann.
- Barbossa.
- Elizabeth Swann
- Barbossa


  
Vallenueva!
Vallenueva


  
Elizabeth Swann.
Elizabeth Swann


  
- What?
- I know. Curious, isn't it?


  
Vote for me. Vote for me.


  
What you talking about?


  
No!


  
Am I to understand that you lot
will not be keeping to the code, then?


  
Very well.


  
What say you, Captain Swann,
king of the Brethren Court?


  
Prepare every vessel that floats.


  
At dawn...


  
...we're at war.


  
And so we shall go to war.


  
What?


  
You've seen it all,
done it all. You survived.


  
That's the trick, isn't it?
To survive?


  
It's not just about
living forever, Jackie.


  
The trick is
living with yourself forever.


  
How's Mum?


  
She looks great.


  
The enemy is here! Let's take them!


  
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.


  
Parley?


  
You be the cur that led
these wolves to our door.


  
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of your betrayal.


  
If you wish to see its grand architect,
look to your left.


  
My hands are clean in this.


  
Figuratively.


  
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.


  
- Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.


  
Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.


  
I understand the burden you bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.


  
No cause is lost if there is
but one fool left to fight for it.


  
If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?


  
You made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates. And here they are.


  
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim your reward.


  
Your debt to me
is still to be satisfied.


  
One hundred years in servitude
aboard the Dutchman. As a start.


  
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.


  
- You escaped.
- Technically.


  
I propose an exchange.


  
Will leaves with us...


  
...and you can take Jack.


  
Done.


  
- Undone.
- Done.


  
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.


  
King.


  
- As you command, your nibs.
- Blackguard!


  
If ye have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.


  
First to the finish, then?


  
Do you fear death?


  
You've no idea.


  
Advise your Brethren,


  
you can fight, and all of you will die.


  
Or you can not fight,
in which case only most of you will die.


  
You murdered my father.


  
He chose his own fate.


  
And you have chosen yours.


  
We will fight.


  
And you will die.


  
So be it.


  
King?


  
Of the Brethren Court.
Courtesy of Jack.


  
Maybe he really
does know what he's doing.


  
Bravo!


  
You've successfully arrived aboard
the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.


  
- Look
- Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.


  
Except for this sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.


  
Go away.


  
- What, back to the Locker?
- Not without you, Jackie.


  
Stab the heart.


  
Live forever as captain
of the Flying Dutchman.


  
Then again...


  
...if you're in the brig...


  
...who's to stab the heart?


  
Does seem to put immortality
a bit out of reach.


  
Peanut.


  
We'll need to use the Black Pearl
as a flagship to lead the attack.


  
- Oh, will we now?
- All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.


  
Barbossa, you can't release her.


  
We need to give Jack a chance.


  
Apologies, Your Majesty. Too long
my fate has not been in me own hands.


  
No longer.


  
The enemy...


  
...has opted for oblivion.


  
Ready the fleet.


  
- To your stations.
- To your stations.


  
Be there some manner
of rite or incantation?


  
Aye.


  
The items brought together, done.


  
Items to be burned...


  
...and someone must speak the words:


  
"Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds."


  
Is that it?


  
'Tis said it must be spoken
as if to a lover.


  
Ooh!


  
Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds!


  
- Is that it?
- No, no, no. He didn't say it right.


  
He didn't...


  
You have to say it right.


  
Calypso...


  
...I release you from your human bonds.


  
Tia Dalma.
Tia Dalma


  
Calypso.


  
When the Brethren Court imprisoned you,
who was it that told them how?


  
- Who was it that betrayed you?
- Name him.


  
Davy Jones.
Davy Jones


  
This is it! This is it!


  
Calypso!


  
I come before you as but a servant,
humble and contrite.


  
I have fulfilled me vow
and now ask your favor.


  
Spare meself, me ship, me crew...


  
...but unleash your fury upon those who
dare pretend themselves your masters...


  
...or mine.


  
Is that it?


  
Why, she's no help at all.


  
What now?


  
Nothing.


  
Our final hope has failed us.


  
- It's not over.
- There's still a fight to be had.


  
We've an armada against us, and
with the Dutchman, there's no chance.


  
There's only a fool's chance.


  
Revenge won't bring
your father back, Miss Swann,


  
and it's not something
I'm intending to die for.


  
You're right.


  
Then what shall we die for?


  
You will listen to me.


  
Listen!


  
The Brethren will still be looking here
to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.


  
And what will they see?


  
Frightened bilge rats
aboard a derelict ship? No.


  
No, they will see free men and freedom!


  
And what the enemy will see
is the flash of our cannons.


  
They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do.


  
By the sweat of our brows,


  
and the strength of our backs...


  
...and the courage of our hearts.


  
Gentlemen...


  
...hoist the colors.


  
Hoist the colors.


  
- Hoist the colors.
- Hoist the colors!


  
Aye.


  
The wind's on our side, boys.
That's all we need!


  
Hoist the colors!


  
We have a favorable wind, sir.


  
Oh, so we do.


  
Signal Jones to give no quarter.


  
That should brighten his day.


  
To arms! We give no quarter!


  
Calypso.


  
Have you noticed,
on top of everything, it's raining?


  
That's a bad sign.


  
Man the capstan. Raise the main topyard.
Keep that powder dry.


  
Maelstrom!


  
Captain Barbossa!


  
We need you at the helm.


  
Aye, that be true.


  
Brace up yards,
you cack-handed deck apes.


  
Dying is the day worth living for.


  
Veer off!


  
She'll not harm us.


  
Full-bore and into the abyss.


  
Are you mad?


  
Ha! You afraid to get wet?


  
She's on our stern and gaining.


  
More speed!
Haul your wind and hold your water.


  
Bow cannons!


  
Blow the cannons!


  
Take us out or they'll overbear us.


  
Nay. Further in.
We'll cut across to faster waters.


  
Prepare to broadside.


  
Captain the guns. Bear a hand.


  
Muster your courage, men.
At the ready.


  
Think like the whelp. Think like
the whelp. Think like the whelp.


  
Hinges. Hinges.


  
Think like the whelp.


  
Half-barrel hinges.


  
Leverage.


  
Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.


  
- I miss him already.
- He is quite charming, isn't he?


  
Nobody move.


  
I dropped me brain.


  
Batten down the hatches!


  
Stand to your guns.
Stand to your guns.


  
Midship cannoneers, sight the masts.


  
Main battery at the ready!


  
Hold there!
Wait till we're board-and-board.


  
Fire!


  
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire all!


  
Fire!


  
Fire!


  
Come on, men.


  
It be too late
to alter course now, mateys.


  
Halt there or we'll shoot.


  
Good one.


  
I just come to get me effects.


  
Admirable though it may be, why are
you here when you could be elsewhere?


  
Someone has to stay
and guard the chest.


  
There's no question, there's a breakdown
in military discipline on this vessel.


  
I blame the fish people.


  
Oh, so fish people,
by dint of being fish people,


  
automatically aren't
as disciplined as non-fish people?


  
Seems contributory,
is all I'm suggesting.


  
It's true, if there were no fish people,
there'd be no need to guard the chest.


  
And if there were no chest
we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.


  
Prepare to board!


  
Cover!


  
No!


  
Lookee here, boys. A lost bird.


  
A lost bird that never learned to fly.


  
To my great regret.


  
But...


  
...never too late to learn, eh?


  
Whoa!


  
The chest, hand it over.


  
I can set you free, mate.


  
My freedOm waS fOrfeit IOng agO.


  
Elizabeth!


  
Elizabeth...


  
Will you marry me?


  
I don't think now's the best time.


  
Now may be the only time.


  
I love you.


  
I've made my choice. What's yours?


  
Barbossa.


  
Marry us.


  
I'm a little busy at the moment.


  
Barbossa, now.


  
Fine, then.


  
Dearly beloved,
we be gathered here today...


  
To nail your gizzards
to the mast, you poxy cur.


  
Elizabeth Swann,
do you take me to be your husband?
Elizabeth Swann...


  
- I do.
- Great.


  
Will Turner, do you take me...


  
...to be your wife...


  
...in sickness and in health...


  
...with health being the less likely?


  
I do.


  
As captain, I now pronounce you...


  
You may kiss...


  
You may kiss...


  
Just kiss.


  
Leave it.


  
You can do nothing without the key.


  
I already have the key.


  
No, you don't.


  
Oh, that key.


  
No!


  
Oi. My pistol.


  
Turner.
Turner


  
Fire!


  
Thank you, Jack.


  
Stop! It's me.


  
It's Will. Your son.


  
Go!


  
Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.


  
That's why I brought this.


  
I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.


  
Missed.


  
Did you forget?
I'm a heartless wretch.


  
Ah. Love.


  
A dreadful bond.


  
And yet, so easily severed.


  
Tell me, William Turner,
do you fear death?


  
Do you?


  
Heady tonic, holding life and death
in the palm of one's hand.


  
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.


  
Cruel is a matter of perspective.


  
Is it?


  
Will?


  
Look at me! Stay with me!
You're all right.


  
William?


  
My son.


  
Will? Will?
Look at me. Look at me!


  
You will not forestall my judgment.


  
Calypso.


  
She's taking us down! Make quick
or it's the Locker for us all!


  
No.


  
No, no.


  
No!


  
Part of the crew.
Part of the ship, part of the crew.


  
Part of the ship, part of the crew.


  
Don't leave me.


  
Don't. No!


  
I won't leave you.


  
The Dutchman must have a captain.


  
Hold on.


  
Thank goodness, Jack.


  
The armada's still out there. The
Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard,


  
and I think it's time we embrace that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.


  
Never actually been one for tradition.


  
Close haul her.
Luff the sails and lay her in irons.


  
Belay that,
or we'll be a sitting duck.


  
Belay that "belay that."


  
- But the arma...
- Belay.


  
- The Endeav...
- Stow. Shut it.


  
What are they waiting for?


  
He expects us to honor our agreement.


  
Ready guns and gun ports.


  
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.


  
Ah, she survived.


  
- Ready on the guns.
- Guns ready.


  
Full canvas.


  
Aye, full canvas.


  
Orders, sir.


  
Sir!


  
Cap'n.


  
- Fire.
- Fire!


  
- Fire!
- Fire!


  
Fire, all!


  
Orders? Orders, sir?


  
Sir, what do you command?


  
It's just...


  
...good business.


  
Abandon ship!


  
- Abandon ship!
- All hands, abandon ship!


  
They're turning away!


  
Wind in your sails.


  
Shiver me timbers.


  
Captain Turner!


  
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Cap'n?


  
- You may throw my hat if you like.
- Aye, aye, cap'n.


  
Hooray!


  
Now go and get it.


  
Orders, sir?


  
You're no longer bound
to the Dutchman. You're free.


  
Aye.


  
That's a fine thing, but...


  
...by my reckoning,
I still have a debt that has to be paid.


  
If you'll have me.


  
On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner.


  
Aye, Captain Turner.


  
This ship
has a purpose again.


  
And where we are bound...


  
...she cannot come.


  
One day ashore.


  
Ten years at sea.


  
That's a steep price
for what's been done.


  
Depends on the one day.


  
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.


  
The oars are inside.


  
Mrs. Turner.


  
Goodbye, poppet.


  
Jack.
Jack


  
It would never
have worked out between us.


  
Keep telling yourself that, darling.


  
Once was quite enough.


  
Thank you.


  
I'm going to need the other one.


  
It's nearly sunset.


  
It's always belonged to you.


  
Will you keep it safe?


  
Yes.


  
Yes.


  
Will!
Will!


  
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.


  
Granted it tends to list to port,
and has been, on occasion,


  
known to frighten young women.


  
But I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.


  
Is that it?


  
The Black Pearl?


  
It's not very big.


  
Love, that is a dinghy.


  
My vessel is magnificent
and fierce and huge-ish and...


  
...gone. Why is it gone?


  
Is that it there?


  
Yes, there it is.


  
Why is it there?


  
It's much larger up close.


  
Jack, you promised
to take us for a ride.


  
- I was to be given the first ride.
- What? You?


  
- Not what he said.
- I never!


  
Mr. Gibbs? Any particular reason
why my ship is gone?


  
The ship? We're on the ship.


  
Jack! The ship's gone!


  
Really?


  
Ladies! Will you please shut it?


  
Listen to me.
Yes, I lied to you.


  
No, I don't love you.


  
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.


  
It is pronounced "egregious."


  
By the way, no, I've never actually
met Pizarro, but I love his pies.


  
And all of this pales
to utter insignificance


  
in light of the fact that
my ship is once again gone. Savvy?


  
- Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.


  
Tell me, ladies,
what do you know of sea turtles?


  
Sea turtles?


  
Let me tell you
the amazing story of Cap...


  
All men up the ratlines.


  
All men up the ratlines!


  
Oh, you want a taste of this?


  
Oh, that's a good boy!
You're Daddy's boy.


  
Oh, yes, you are.


  
Sir?


  
Some of the men don't feel
entirely settled


  
- about leaving Captain Jack behind.
- Again.


  
- Again.
- Is that so?


  
It would make us feel a whole lot
better regarding our fortunes


  
if we could see that item
you told us about.


  
- On the charts.
- Aye.


  
With our own eyes.


  
To help put an ease
to our burden of guilt, so to speak.


  
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.


  
There's more than one way
to live forever.


  
Gents, I give you
the Fountain of Youth.


  
Sparrow.

 Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me


  
 We're devils and black sheep
Really bad eggs


  
 DrinK up, me hearties, Yo ho 


  
 Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me


  
 We pillage, we plunder, We rifle and loot


  
 Drink up, me hearties Yo ho

 Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho

          INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES THEATER - NIGHT
                         
          A familiar beam of light shines down. The beam of light
          descends onto a stage. Lightning flashes to reveal Prince
          Charming riding his valiant steed Chauncey across the open
          plains. The wind blows back his golden mane.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Onward Chauncey, to the highest
           room of the tallest tower! Where
           my princess awaits rescue from her
           handsome Prince Charming.
                         
          Lightning cracks. Thunder booms. Charming straddles a
          wooden hobby horse and gallops in place. A stage hand uses a
          bellow to blow air into Prince Charming's face. Another
          stage hand turns a crank that creates the moving background.
          In the orchestra, a man uses coconuts to create the sound
          effects of a galloping horse. Two more stage hands back
          stage create the cheap sound effects of thunder and
          lightning. A crudely constructed castle tower sits in front
          of a cheaply painted backdrop.
                         
          The Fairytale Creatures are sitting at a table in the
          audience.

           This is worse than Love Letters! I
           hate dinner theatre.
                         
                          PINOCCHIO
           Me too.
                         
          Pinocchio's nose grows as he is caught in the lie.
                         
          Prince Charming rides to the base of the tower.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Whoa there, Chauncey!
                         
          He dismounts and sets his hobby horse on the ground. He
          strikes a dramatic pose.
                         
          A Princess leans from a tower window.
                         
                          ACTRESS
           Hark! The brave Prince Charming
           approach-ith.
                         
          Prince Charming puffs his chest out.

                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Fear not fair maiden! I shall slay
           the monster that guards you and
           take my place as rightful King.
                         
          An old couple at a table look confused.
                         
                          OLD LADY
           (to old man)
           What did she say?
                         
          Prince Charming glares as the bored audience largely ignores
          him.
                         
          A man in a bad ogre costume comes onto the stage.
                         
                          OGRE
           Grrrrrrr!
                         
          The crowd erupts into applause. The Fairytale Creatures
          cheer.
                         
                          FAIRYTALE CREATURES

                          GINGERBREAD MAN
           Yea! Shrek!
                         
          At first, Prince Charming is put off by the cheers for the
          Shrek-like beast. He pulls his sword and confronts the
          monster.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Prepare foul beast to enter into a
           world of pain with which you are
           not familiar!
                         
          He is cut off as a waiter enters with a birthday cake.
                         
                          WAITER
                          (SINGING)

                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Do you mind?
                         
          Prince Charming hops out of the way when a chair lands on
          stage. It slides past him and bumps into the tower facade.
                         
                          GINGERBREAD MAN
           Do you mind? Bo-ring!

          The audience laughs. Prince Charming glares at them and then
          tries to recover. He points his sword at the monster again.
          The tower facade starts to topple.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (CLEARS THROAT)
           Prepare foul beast-
                         
          Prince Charming looks over his shoulder and sees the facade
          falling. He cringes.
                         
          The scenery slams against the stage, but Prince Charming is
          unharmed, perfectly framed in the princesses' window. The
          crowd laughs at the embarrassed Prince Charming. He shakes
          his mangled sword at the audience.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           (shaking his sword again)
           Someday you'll be sorry.
                         
                          HECKLER
           (O.S.)
           We already are!
                         
          They laugh again. Prince Charming throws down his sword,
          picks up his hobby horse and exits.
                         
                          OGRE
           Grrrrrrr!
                         
          The song and the laughter follow Prince Charming backstage.
                         
                         
          INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Prince Charming walks through a tunnel backstage that leads
          to a door. The door has a star with his name written on it.
          He opens it.
                         
                         
          EXT. MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Prince Charming sits at his broken vanity and sobs. His make-
          shift dressing room is in an alley way next to the theater.
                         
          Horses whinny as a carriage passes by. The castle of Far Far
          Away can be seen on the hill in the background. Prince
          Charming breaks down and cries.
                         
          He looks up and sees a picture of the Fairy Godmother taped
          to the vanity. "Don't stop believing! Mommy's Little Angel"
          is written on the picture.

                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (HEAVY SOBS)
           Oh mommy.
                         
          He weeps again and then looks back at the picture. A
          determined change grows across his face.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oh, you're right. I can't let this
           happen. I can't.
                         
          Prince Charming looks at the castle on the hill. His
          expression hardens. He stands and faces the castle. He
          holds his chin up high.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           I am the rightful King of Far Far
           Away and I promise you this mother.
           I will restore dignity to my
           throne!
                         
          A big gust of wind blows a newspaper page across his face.
          He peels it off and looks at the headline. His eyes tense
          and narrow.
                         
           PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
           And this time, no one will stand in
           my way!
                         
          In the newspaper is a picture of Shrek and Fiona waving to a
          crowd.
                         
          Prince Charming crumples up the newspaper in his fists.
                         
                         
          EXT. CASTLE - MORNING
                         
          The camera booms down from the Far Far Away sign. The sun
          rises and the birds sing.
                         
                         
          INT. SHREK AND FIONA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The sun shines through the bedroom window as the camera pans
          over to Shrek and Fiona waking up.
                         
                          SHREK
           Good morning.

          Shrek breathes in and smiles.

           I know. Isn't it wonderful?
                         
          The bedroom doors fly open and Donkey and the Dronkeys rush
          in. The Dronkeys head right for Shrek and Fiona. Shrek
          cowers beneath the bedclothes.
                         
                          DONKEY
                          (SINGING)
           "Good morning! Good morning!"
                         
          Shrek sinks further into the blankets as the Dronkeys
          exuberantly lick him. Fiona is amused.
                         
          Donkey starts to sing "Good Morning" from Singin' in the Rain
          as he enters the room.
                         
                          DONKEY
                          (SINGING)
           "The sun is shining through! Good
           morning! Good morning.
           (coming closer and closer
                          TO SHREK)
           "To you!"
                          (TO SHREK)
           "And you!"
                          (TO DRONKEY)
           And you!
                         
          The Dronkeys fly out of the room, knocking down everything in
          their path.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Oh, they grow up so fast.
                         
          Shrek, greatly annoyed, lifts his hand and snuffs out a
          little fire on the bed left behind by the Dronkeys.
                         
                          SHREK
           Not fast enough.
                         
          Puss leaps onto the bed.
                         
                          PUSS
           Okay. You have a very full day
           filling in for the King and Queen.
           There are several functions that

           Great! Let's get started.
                         
          Shrek immediately pulls the covers up over his head and
          starts to snore.
                         
                          DONKEY
           C'mon, lazy bones, time to get
           movin'!
                         
          Donkey yanks the sheets off of Fiona and Shrek. He is
          surprised to see Shrek's bare legs.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Aaahhh! You know you really need
           to get yourself a pair of jammies.
                         
          Shrek sighs.

          The camera pans down from a stained glass window. The song
          "Royal Pain" by the Eels plays in the background as the
          title: "Shrek The Third" is superimposed.
                         
          A large crowd has gathered to watch the knighting. Shrek
          walks down the aisle of the church.
                         
          Shrek walks up to the knight who seems a bit nervous.
                         
          Shrek takes a sword from Puss, but he doesn't have any idea
          what he is supposed to do with it. Shrek looks at Puss, who
          indicates how to knight a person with his own sword. Shrek
          starts to knight the knight.
                         
                          SHREK
           I knight thee...
                         
          Shrek accidentally stabs the knight.
                         
                          SHREK
           He-he. Ooh.
                         
          The crowd, Fiona, Puss and Donkey look on, shocked.

          Shrek and Fiona officiate at a boat christening for the Royal
          Navy.
                         
          Shrek is holding a bottle of champagne. He leans on the
          boat, accidentally pushing it down the ramp. Shrek throws
          the bottle at the boat and it punches an enormous hole in the
          side of the hull. The boat quickly sinks.
                         
          Shrek turns to find the patrons of Far Far Away shaking their
          heads as they leave.

          INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Raul, the make-up specialist, tightens some aprons around
          Shrek and Fiona. Donkey, Puss and Raul stand in front of
          them.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Well, since you're filling in for
           one, you might as well look like a
           real King. Can somebody come in
           here and work on Shrek please?
                         
          Raul stares at Shrek. Shrek raises his eyebrow.
                         
                          RAUL
                          (AHEM)
           I will see what I can do.
                         
          He unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools.
                         
          Suddenly Shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair.
                         
          A man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip
          cord as if he's holding a chain saw. VROOM! VROOM! He
          turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind
          away at Shrek's gruesome toenails. Shrek cringes.
                         
          We see a close-up of Shrek's eye. A mascara brush comes into
          frame and pulls at Shrek's eyelash.
                         
          Fiona gets her nose hairs plucked.

          Lipstick is applied to some lips. The camera pulls back to
          reveal that the lips are Shrek's.
                         
          A hand tries to tighten a zipper on Shrek's back. It keeps
          snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and
          tighten up the zipper all the way.
                         
          A small sock is placed onto Shrek's foot. With a shoe horn,
          Shrek's foot is shoved into a small shoe. POP!
                         
          A collar is placed around Fiona's neck and her corset is
          tightened.
                         
          A drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on Shrek's
          belt. A mole is placed on his cheek.

                          PUSS
           Yeah, wow.
                         
          Fiona is uncomfortable.

          Fiona turns to Shrek and sees he is not in a good mood.
                         
                          SHREK
           I don't know how much longer I can
           keep this up Fiona.
                         
                          FIONA
           I'm sorry Shrek, but can you please
           just try to grin and bear it? It's
           just until Dad gets better.
                         
          Shrek lets out another frustrated sigh.
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek?
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah.
                         
                          FIONA
           You look handsome.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ah. Come here, you.
                         
          She gives him a supportive smile. He relaxes and smiles
          back.
                         
          Fiona puckers up her lips and Shrek leans in for a kiss, but
          their bulky outfits prevent it.
                         
          Shrek and Fiona let out a huge breath of air.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, my butt is itching up a storm
           and I can't reach it in this monkey
           suit!
                         
          Shrek tries to scratch his butt but to no avail.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh.

           Hey you. Come here!
                         
          A man holding a ruby scepter walks over to Shrek.

           MASTER OF CEREMONIES
           Ladies and gentlemen, Princess
           Fiona and Sir Shrek!
                         
          The audience claps. The curtain starts to open.
          Fiddlesworth is scratching away at Shrek's butt.
                         
                          SHREK
           You've done it. Oh, a little over
           to the left, yeah. That's great.
                         
                          FIONA
           Uh Shrek?
                         
          Fiddlesworth struggles to reach Shrek's itch. The crowd
          looks on in horror. Fiona tries to get his attention.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahh! All right, you got it...Oh
           yeah, you're on it. Oh that's it!
           Oh that's good!
                         
                          FIONA

                          SHREK
           Oh yeah! Scratch that thing! You
           got it. You're on it. That's
           great!
                         
                          FIONA
           SHREK!
                         
          Shrek and Fiddlesworth finally see the crowd. They both
          freeze. Shrek laughs nervously.
                         
          Suddenly Shrek's belt buckle snaps off and hits Donkey in the
          eye. He stumbles through the crowd screaming.
                         
                          DONKEY

          As he is stumbling, he grabs hold of a lady in the crowd.
                         
                          WOMAN
           What are you doing?
                         
          The woman pushes Donkey away. He falls, knocking over a
          guard holding an axe on his way down. The guard drops the
          axe. It flies past Puss, who is in the arms of a lady. The
          axe knocks over a vase. The vase flies up on stage and Fiona
          maneuvers to catch it. In flight, water spills out of the
          vase which causes Fiona to fall over.
                         
          Shrek's tuxedo bib slaps him in the face. The clasp holding
          Shrek's pants up breaks off. Shrek stands on stage with his
          pants around his ankles. He shuffles towards Fiona.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona!
                         
          He trips over his pants and hits a loose wooden plank on the
          stage. The plank flings up and sends Fiddlesworth flying
          through the air where his jacket slips over a banner pole,
          trapping him.
                         
                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Uhhh...
                          (WIMPER)
                         
          Shrek has reached Fiona who is still lying on the floor.
                         
                          SHREK
           Are you okay?
                         
                          FIONA
           Yeah. I'm fine.
                         
          Fiona's eyes suddenly widen.
                         
          Fiddlesworth's jacket rips and he falls onto a waiter
          carrying flaming skewers.
                         
                          FIDDLESWORTH
           Ahhhh!
                         
          The skewers fly through the air. Donkey stands up in frame
          with one eye half shut. The flaming skewers shoot by him and
          land in the curtains, setting them on fire. He blows one of
          the skewers out and takes a bite.
                         
                          DONKEY

          The fire causes a Far Far Away shield to detach from a wooden
          ceiling beam and fall onto the stage, breaking it in half.
                         
          The whole stage collapses in the middle. The buffet tables
          slide toward Shrek and Fiona at the other end and collide.
                         
          CRASH! BANG!

          The door to Fiona's room flies open.
                         
                          SHREK
           That's it! We're leaving!
                         
          Shrek storms in pulling bits of buffet food off his face.
                         
                          FIONA
           Honey, please calm down...
                         
          Shrek grabs the wig off of his head and throws it aside.
                         
                          SHREK
           Calm down? Who do you think we're
           kidding? I am an ogre! I'm not cut
           out for this, Fiona and I never
           will be.
                         
          Shrek wipes off his makeup with his shirt sleeve and flings
          his shirt to the floor. He falls onto the bed next to
          Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY
           I think that went pretty well.
                         
          Shrek startles.
                         
                          SHREK
           Donkey!
                         
          Shrek picks him up and throws him out the door.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Aww, come on now Shrek!
                         
          Shrek slams the door shut.
                         
          Shrek turns back towards the bed and sees Puss reclining on
          his pillow.

                          PUSS
           Some people just don't understand
           boundaries.
                         
          Shrek picks Puss up by the scruff of his neck and tosses him
          outside the window. He shuts it. Puss sits sadly on the
          ledge, giving Shrek his sad-eyes routine. Shrek draws the
          blinds.
                         
          Shrek stomps over and falls back onto the bed. Fiona tries
          to calm him down.
                         
                          FIONA
           Just think... a couple more days,
           and we'll be back home in our
           vermin-filled shack, strewn with
           fungus, filled with the rotting
           stench of mud and neglect.
                         
          This thought calms him. Shrek takes in a long, deep breath
          and exhales. He smiles.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, you had me at "vermin-filled."
                         
                          FIONA
           And, uh... maybe even the pitter-
           patter of little feet on the
           floor...?
                         
                          SHREK
                          (LAUGHS)
           That's right. The swamp rats will
           be spawning.
                         
                          FIONA
           Uh, no... you know, what I was
           thinking of is a little bit bigger
           than a swamp rat.

          Shocked, Shrek falls off the bed.
                         
          He slowly emerges from behind the bed.
                         
                          SHREK
           Honey? Let's try and be rational
           about this. Have you seen a baby
           lately? They just eat and poop and
           they cry and then they cry when
           they poop and they poop when they
           cry...Now, imagine an ogre baby.
           They extra cry and they extra poop.

          Shrek takes her hand.
                         
                          SHREK
           Right now, you're my family.
                         
          There is a knock on the bedroom door. The door bursts open,
          revealing a Royal Page.
                         
          Shrek springs up.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well, somebody better be dying.

          The camera pushes through a corridor that leads to the King's
          bedroom. The King is lying on his lily pad, coughing.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           I'm dying.
                         
          The King inhales and launches into a violent coughing fit.
          Shrek looks a bit guilty about his last admission. The Queen
          comes to the King's aid and he settles down.

          The Queen is used to these kind of non-sequiturs.

          The King suppresses a few coughs. He turns to his daughter.
                         
                          KING HAROLD

                          KING HAROLD
           I know I've made many mistakes with
           you.

                          KING HAROLD
           But your love for Shrek has taught
           me so much.
                         
          Fiona smiles. The King addresses Shrek.
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           My dear boy, I am proud to call you

           Frog... King Dad in-law.
                         
          Shrek smiles.

           Now, there is a matter of business
           to attend tooo...
                         
          The King starts wheezing and coughing. Eventually he stops.
          They think he's dead. Puss solemnly removes his hat.
                         
                          PUSS
           The Frog King is dead.

                          (TO PUSS)

                          KING HAROLD
           Shrek, please come hither.
                         
          Fiona gives Shrek a look. Shrek walks over to the King.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah, Dad?
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           This Kingdom needs a new king. You
           and Fiona are next in line for the
           throne.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ooo. Next in line. Now you see
           Dad, that's why people love you.
           Even on your deathbed you're still
           making jokes.
                         
          The King stares at Shrek, stone-faced. Shrek leans in
          closer.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, come on Dad...an Ogre as King?
           I don't think that's such a good
           idea. There's got to be somebody
           else. Anybody?
                         
                          KING HAROLD
           Aside from you there is only one
           remaining heir.
                         
          Shrek brightens.
                         
                          SHREK

          Shrek leans in closer after each "is," waiting in
          anticipation. The King starts to hyperventilate.
                         
                          FIONA
           Daddy!
                         
          The King is dead. A fly comes out of his mouth and flies
          away.
                         
          Puss starts to take his hat off. The fly buzzes into frame.
          A tongue catches it. Puss puts his hat back on.
                         
                          KING HAROLD

          Puss takes his hat off.
                         
          Fiona starts to cry and hugs Shrek. The weight of the King's
          request hits Shrek. He is in a state of shock.
                         
          We hold a moment on the Queen, Shrek, Fiona, Puss and Donkey
          to let the King's passing sink in.

          Close on a statue of the late King. Shrek, Fiona, the Queen,
          and all the Fairy-tale Creatures and Princesses have gathered
          for the funeral. The Queen sets an old shoe box ("Ye Olde
          Footlocker") on top of a lily pad and sends it floating out
          into the water.
                         
          An overhead shot shows the box floating through the lily

          Fairy-tale Creatures all bow their heads solemnly.
                         
          Shrek puts his arm around Fiona.
                         
          The funeral has ended and the crowd begins to disperse.
          Shrek, Fiona and the Queen stand by the pond. The Queen
          sadly gazes at the pond.

          rides off.

          Prince Charming rides up to the Poison Apple Bar.

          INT. POISONED APPLE BAR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Smoke wafts through the screen. The camera pans down to the
          top of a piano where an ashtray with a lit cigarette burns
          and a brandy sifter is filled with coins. The camera pans
          over to a Singing Witch who turns around to reveal a
          microphone in her hand. The Singing Witch starts to sing
          "I've Never Been To Me" by Nancy Wilson.
                         
          The bar is filled with various Fairy-tale Villains. Two
          pirates sit forlornly with their mugs. The Puppet Master
          takes a drink out of a beer mug. He is surrounded by a bunch
          of empty beer mugs.
                         
          Prince Charming enters the bar.
                         
          A group is gathered around Cyclops riding a medieval
          mechanical bull, hooting and hollering. The bull stops and
          the Villains turn to look at Prince Charming.
                         
          Prince Charming hangs his cape on a tree branch. The camera
          adjusts right to reveal the branch is actually one of the
          Evil Trees, who flings the cape to the floor. Everyone takes
          notice as Prince Charming walks through. Little Red Riding
          Hood is sitting on a pile of books at a table. Evil Dwarves
          glare in Prince Charming's direction. Prince Charming walks
          by a pair of witches (one is the Evil Queen from Snow White)
          playing pool. The Evil Queen scratches when she sees him and
          the pool ball goes flying into the Headless Horseman's neck.
          Prince Charming walks by the singing witch. He reaches the
          bar, pulls out a handkerchief, places it over the bar stool,
          and sits.
                         
          Prince Charming spots the bartender with her back to him. He
          clears his throat.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           What does a Prince have to do to
           get a drink around here?
                         
          Mabel, the other ugly stepsister, rises up in front a poster
          with a smiling beer wench.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Ah Mabel, why they call you an ugly
           stepsister I'll never know.
                         
          He winks at her. She glares at him.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

           She's not welcome here and neither
           are you.
                         
          She spits into the mug and wipes it with a towel.
                         
                          MABEL (CONT'D)

           redemption...
                          (LAUGHS)
           And a Fuzzy Navel.
                         
          Prince Charming stands up and turns to the bar patrons.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

          Captain Hook rips his hook across the piano keys. The
          singing witch bares her teeth. The witches break their pool
          cues. The Puppet Master breaks his beer mug.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           We're not your friends.
                         
          Prince Charming grows nervous.
                         
          The Villains all approach Prince Charming.
                         
          From behind the bar, Mabel grabs Prince Charming by his
          shoulders and pins him on top of the bar.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Ahh!
                         
          Captain Hook places his hook against Prince Charming's neck.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           You don't belong here.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

          Prince Charming turns to the Evil Queen.

                          PRINCE CHARMING
           They left you the un-fairest of
           them all. And now here you are,
           hustling pool to get your next
           meal. How does that feel?
                         
                          EVIL QUEEN
           Pretty unfair.
                         
          Prince Charming begins to work the crowd.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           And you? Your star puppet abandons
           the show to go and find his father.
                         
                          PUPPET MASTER
           I hate that little wooden puppet.
                         
          Prince Charming turns to Captain Hook.

          Prince Charming looks down at the hook.
                         
           PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
           ... Need I say more?
                         
          Captain Hook backs off, feeling insecure about his appendage.

          Prince Charming gains more confidence as he confronts Mabel.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

           tiny glass slipper?

           Once upon a time, someone decided
           that we were the losers. But there
           are two sides to every story. And
           our side has not been told.
                         
          The crowd listens, rapt.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           So who will join me? Who wants to
           come out on top for once? Who
           wants their happily ever after?!
                         
          The crowd of villains cheer and starts getting rowdy. A bar
          room brawl ensues. Prince Charming looks on, shocked. He
          ducks out of the way of a flying liquor bottle. He smiles
          nervously and lifts his fruity, Fuzzy Navel to drink.

          The blind mice stumble and fall trying to get down the steps
          to the dock. The Fairy-tale Creatures and Dragon have
          gathered to wish Shrek, Puss and Donkey a bon voyage as they

          over to Puss who breaks free of the embrace of a lady cat.
                         
                          PUSS
           It's out of my hands senorita, the
           winds of fate have blown on my
           destiny. But I will never forget
           you. You are the love of my life.
                         
          Off-screen, a cat meows and walks towards Puss.

           And you.
                         
          Puss starts walking away as two of the cats begin to engage
          in a cat fight. They are hissing at each other as Puss backs
          away from them and into another.

           but I'd like to. I gotta go.
                         
          Puss runs out of frame. Cut to Dragon, who is talking to
          Donkey. Puss runs past them in the background. Dragon lets
          out a soft wail.
                         
                          DONKEY
           I know, I know... I don't want to
           leave you either baby, but you know
           how Shrek is. The dude's lost
           without me.
                         
          She gives him an understanding smile.

          He blows her a kiss and she catches it. He looks down at his
          children, holding back tears.

           Oh, c'mon, there's no way I could

           And if he gives me any trouble,
           I've always got persuasion and
           reason.

           Here's persuasion,

          Shrek chuckles. Fiona gives him a look. Shrek reassures her.

           It will be. I promise. I love
           you.
                         
          He kisses her and joins Puss and Donkey on the boat.

          The boat sets sail. The Dronkeys spell out "We Love You
          Daddy" with smoke in the sky.

           That's lovely.
                         
          Donkey waves to his kids, sobs.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Bye bye babies!
                         
          Fiona runs after the boat.
                         
                          FIONA
           Shrek!
                         
          Shrek leans against the rail, calling out to her.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah?
                         
                          FIONA
           Wait!
                         
                          SHREK
           What is it?
                         
          She smiles and takes a deep breath.
                         
                          FIONA
           I'm, I'm-
                         
          The Ship Captain blows a fog horn and cuts her off. Shrek
          smiles back at her.
                         
                          SHREK
                          (LAUGHS)
           I love you too honey!

          The Ship Captain starts to blow again. Shrek grabs the horn
          and throws it overboard.
                         
                          SHREK
           You're what?!
                         
                          FIONA
           I said I'm pregnant!
                         
          The Fairy-tale Creatures behind Fiona cheer.

           Uh... what was that?
                         
                          FIONA
           You're going to be a father!
                         
                          SHREK
                          (NERVOUS LAUGH)
           That's great.
                         
                          FIONA
           Really? I'm glad you think so! I
           love you.
                         
          Shrek smiles back at Fiona.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah...

           Me too... you...
                         
          Fiona smiles as the Queen places a hand on her shoulder.
                         
          Overjoyed at the news, Donkey pops up onto the railing.
                         
                          DONKEY
           I'm gonna be an Uncle. I'm gonna
           be an Uncle! I'm gonna be an

           Oh, and you my friend are royally--
                         
          The fog horn blasts again as the boat disappears into the
          fog.

          EXT. BOAT CABIN - NIGHT
                         
          The boat travels along in the open sea. Shrek is fast asleep
          as the boat travels through an estuary and beaches itself.
                         
          Shrek wakes up. He opens the cabin door.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahhh. Home.
                         
          He smiles to himself. The boat has beached itself right
          outside of Shrek's swamp house.
                         
          He leaps off the boat.
                         
                          SHREK
           Woohoo!
                         
                         
          EXT. SWAMP HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Shrek takes a deep breath of swamp air.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahh.
                         
          He skips and dances happily toward his house.
                         
           FIONA (O.S.)
           Shrek!?
                         
                          SHREK
           Ooo.

          INT. SWAMP HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          He sashays through the front door with his eyes closed,
          presenting himself.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona!
                         
          After a moment of silence, he opens his eyes, realizing that
          Fiona is not there.
                         
                          SHREK
           Fiona?
                         
          He looks around the room, puzzled. The door slams closed
          behind him.
           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 28.
                         
                         
          A baby carriage rolls slowly into frame behind him. He turns
          slowly and sees the baby carriage covered with a blanket.
          Shrek removes the blanket, revealing a baby ogre, smiling
          innocently at him.
                         
                          SHREK
           Huh? Oh no.
                         
          The baby burps.
                         
                          SHREK
                          (AMUSED)
           Better out than in, I always say.
           Ha ha!
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Hiccup!
                         
          This time the baby's burp turns into projectile vomit aimed
          directly at Shrek. Shrek puts his hand up to block the
          vomit, but to no avail. The baby continues to vomit, but
          eventually stops after completely soiling himself and Shrek.
          The baby looks like it's about to cry. Shrek raises his
          hands.
                         
                          SHREK
           No, no, no, no, no, no. Ha, ha.
           It's okay. It's gonna be alright.
                         
          Shrek picks the baby up, smiling at it cautiously. He holds
          it awkwardly for a few seconds, then looks up and realizes
          that his house is filled with babies.
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Da-Da!
                         
          Babies roll around his living room, tearing the fabric off
          his chair. The chair reclines, catapulting one of the babies
          onto Shrek's head. A standing lamp with a baby on top falls,
          and Shrek dives to catch him. Another baby is pulling the
          tablecloth, causing lethal knives to fly straight at him.
          Shrek snatches the baby away just before he is impaled. One
          of the babies strikes a match near the fireplace. Shrek runs
          over, picks up the baby and blows out the match. He takes a
          baby out of the cauldron.
                         
                          SHREK
           Hey! Hey, hey, wait! Would ya?
           No, no. Stop! Hey, hey, hey. No.
                         
          Shrek panics. A baby is knocking glass jars off the shelf.
          Shrek catches him before he crawls off of it. Shrek runs
          through the room picking up babies.

          INT. SHREK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          After he has collected as many babies as he can, Shrek slides
          open the curtain to his bedroom.
                         
                          SHREK
           Huh?
                         
          He sees a baby sitting in his bed, smiling up at him. The
          baby shrugs.
                         
                          OGRE BABY
           Bubabatoo?
                         
          Suddenly, Shrek hears a loud rumble. He turns around.
          Babies start pouring out of the window and the fireplace.
          First there is one, then two, then thirty more follow.
          Hundreds of them start piling in.
                         
          Shrek makes a run for the doorway, but no matter how hard he
          runs, the doorway keeps getting farther and farther away! He
          keeps trying, hundreds of babies trailing behind.
                         
                         
          INT. GRADUATION STAGE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Finally, Shrek reaches the door and opens it. He slams it
          shut behind him and closes his eyes. Everything is quiet.
          He opens his eyes and finds himself on stage in front of his
          high school.
                         
          Shrek looks up to find a graduation cap on his head. The
          audience is full of ogre babies laughing at him. The camera
          pulls back to reveal Shrek standing at the podium, naked.

          Shrek's eyes pop open, he sits upright and tries to compose
          himself.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ahhhh! Oh, Donkey! Donkey, wake-
           up!
                         
          Donkey and Puss turn around, but they both have baby-ogre
          faces! Donkey makes a baby noise. As the camera zooms in,
          Donkey's eyes glow red and his teeth become sharp and pointy.

          A fog horn blows. Shrek bolts upright again. Donkey and
          Puss wake up.

          He breaths heavily, trying to compose himself.

           Oh... I can't believe I'm going to
           be a father.
                         
          Donkey and Puss look at each other. He gets up and walks to
          the ship's railing.
                         
                          SHREK

                          PUSS
           Allow me to explain. You see, when
           a man has certain feelings for a
           woman, a powerful urge sweeps over
           him...
                         
                          SHREK
           I know how it happened. I just
           can't believe it.
                         
          Shrek walks away.
                         
          Donkey leans over to Puss.

          Donkey sees Shrek at the back of the boat staring out at the

                          SHREK
           Donkey, can you just cut to the
           part where you're supposed to make
           me feel better?
                         
          Shrek slumps against the rail. Puss hops up on the railing
          and whispers into Shrek's other ear.
                         
                          PUSS
           You know I love Fiona, Boss.
           Right?
                          (CONFIDENTIALLY)
           But what I'm talking about here is
           you, me, my cousin's boat, an ice-
           cold pitcher of mojitos, and two
           weeks of nothing but fishing.
                         
          Puss makes a "let's go fishing" gesture by casting an
          imaginary rod into the ocean. Donkey is right there to
          whisper in Shrek's other ear.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Man, don't you listen to him.

                          SHREK
           It's not my life I'm worried about
           ruining. It's the kid's.
                         
          Donkey and Puss pause as Shrek rants.
                         
                          SHREK

           Stop squirming, Arthur.
                         
                          KNIGHT (LANCELOT)
           I'm not Arthur!
                         
          Shrek stops and holds Lancelot above his head. Lancelot
          tries to regain his dignity.
                         
                          LANCELOT
           I am Lancelot.
                         
          Lancelot points across the school yard.
                         
                          LANCELOT
           That dork over there is Arthur!
                         
          He points to the TEENAGE ARTHUR, skulking away across the
          school yard.
                         
                          SHREK
           Hey!
                         
          Artie turns his head briefly, but keeps on walking.
                         
          Shrek sighs and dumps Lancelot to the ground.
                         
                          LANCELOT
           Aaah.
                         
          Shrek storms off towards the school. Puss and Donkey catch
          up. One of the female students steps in front of Shrek.

          Shrek and Puss search the hallways, looking for Artie.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh Arthur! Come out, come out
           wherever you are...
                         
          Off-screen we hear mumbling from inside a locker. Shrek and
          Puss look as Donkey pushes the locker door open. He has been
          stuffed inside. Off-screen we hear some students laughing.

          An "I Suck-eth" sign has been taped Donkey's butt.
                         
          Shrek spots students entering the Gymnasium. They approach a
          HALL MONITOR who stops them.

           Grrrrr!
                         
          The Hall Monitor waves them in. Shrek gets an idea.
                         
                          SHREK
           (pleased with himself)

           too.
                         
          The Hall Monitor reaches out and starts painfully pinching
          and pulling Shrek's skin. Shrek tries to hide the pain.
                         
                          HALL MONITOR

           long!
                         
          The Hall Monitor lets his face snap back into place. Shrek
          struggles not to scream in agony. Hall Monitor is still
          suspicious.
                         
                          HALL MONITOR
           Looks pretty real to me.
                         
                          PUSS
           If it were real could I do this?
                         
          Puss's claws snap out one at a time like jack-knives and then
          Puss jabs all the claws deep into Shrek's butt.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Or this?
                         
          Donkey kicks Shrek hard in the groin with his hind legs.
          Shrek winces and sweats.

          Principal Pynchley presides over an assembly for the entire
          student body. He speaks through a megaphone.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           Thank you to Professor Primbottom
           for his invigorating lecture on how
           to just say "nay".
                         
          Two students are standing next to Pynchley. One is dressed
          up like a dragon and the other as a griffin.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY

          Shrek bursts through the double-doors of the gym.

           --ogre?
                         
          The students gasp as Shrek marches forward.
                         
                          SHREK
           That's right. I'm the new mascot.
           So let's really try and beat the
           other guys... at whatever it is
           they're doing.
                         
          The band plays Smashmouth's "Rock Star."
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY
           This is indeed all a bit
           unorthodox.
                         
          Without breaking stride, Shrek grabs Principal Pynchley's
          megaphone.
                         
                          SHREK

          The students all point... to the basketball hoop, where Artie
          hangs helplessly. Shrek, Donkey and Puss turn and look up
          and see the freshly wedgied student. The students laugh.
                         
          In the front row, Lancelot bumps fists with Bohort.

           I didn't do it. They did.
                         
          Lance points to the D&D; nerds. They are beside themselves
          with nasal laughter. Nosebleed boy starts bleeding again.
                         
          Shrek reaches up and pulls Artie down to eye level.
                         
                          ARTIE

          Even Principal Pynchley gets caught up in the excitement.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL PYNCHLEY

          Shrek yanks on Artie and pulls him off the hoop.
                         
                          SHREK
           I'm not here to eat him.

           My good people, I think there's a
           lesson here for all of us. Maybe
           the next time you're about to dunk
           a kid's head in a chamber pot,
           you'll stop and think, hey, maybe
           this guy has feelings. Maybe I
           should cut him some slack. Because
           maybe, just maybe... this guy's
           gonna turn out to be, uh...I
           dunno...a King! And maybe his
           first royal decree will be to
           banish everyone who ever picked on
           him -- that's right, I'm looking at
           you, jousting team.

          All the Princesses and Fairy-tale Creatures have gathered for
          Fiona's baby shower. A group of birds gently place a

          Fiona stands at the buffet table, stuffing her face with
          cakes, pies, and anything else she can get her hands on.

           order.
                         
          Puss jumps up onto the railing next to Artie.
                         
                          PUSS

           royal food tasters.

           Oh yeah? What do they do?
                         
                          PUSS
           They taste the food before the King
           eats, to make sure it's not
           poisoned.

          Shrek senses trouble and immediately steps in.

           Or too salty!
                         
          Shrek turns to Puss and Donkey, trying to shut them up.
                         
                          DONKEY
                          (TO ARTIE)
           Don't worry about it. You'll be

           your body guards.

                          PUSS
           All of them, willing at a moment's
           notice to lay down their own lives
           out of devotion to you.
                         
                          ARTIE

                          PUSS
           Si, and the whole kingdom will look
           to you for wisdom and guidance.
                         
          Behind Artie, Shrek mouths "shut-up" to Puss and Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY

           The coughing, the groaning, the
           festering sores.
                         
          Shrek interrupts with a mock laugh.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh! Festering sores! Hey, you are
           one funny kitty cat.
                         
                          PUSS
           What did I say?
                         
                          SHREK
           We don't want Artie here getting
           the wrong idea.
                         
          Shrek motions to Artie, but he's gone. They all look around.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           Uh, Artie?
                         
          The boat suddenly pitches to the right. Shrek braces
          himself. Puss and Donkey tumble away.
                         
                          ALL
           Whoa!
                         
          Artie swings the wheel around, sending the boat back in the
          direction of his school. Shrek works his way into the cabin
          and gains control of the wheel. The drunken Ship Captain
          slides by.
                         
                          SHIP CAPTAIN
           Whoa! Oh, there goes my hip.
                         
                          SHREK
           Artie!
                         
          Shrek turns the wheel the other way.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?!
                         
          The boat veers again, heading back toward Far Far Away.
          Artie falls to the ground and slides to the back of the boat.
                         
          A shuffle board stick slides next to Artie. He grabs it.
                         
                          ARTIE
           What does it look like?!
                         
          He jams it in the boat's wheel. The boat lurches.

          He swings the boat back in the other direction. Shrek rises
          up and grabs the wheel and turns it.
                         
                          SHREK
           This really isn't up to you!
                         
          Artie falls underneath the wheel. He stands up shoving the
          wheel back the other way.
                         
                          ARTIE
           But I don't know anything about
           being King!
                         
                          SHREK
           You'll learn on the job!
                         
          Donkey and Puss roll across the deck.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Whoaaa!
                         
          Shrek grabs the wheel and swings it around. Artie yanks the
          wheel. They wrestle for control.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm
           going back!
                         
                          SHREK
           Back to what? Being a loser?!
                         
          As soon as the word leaves his lips, Shrek knows he's gone
          too far. Stung, Artie lets go of the wheel, leaving Shrek to
          yank hard on it. He pulls the steering column from the
          decking.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           Now look what you did!
                         
                          ARTIE
           Look what I did? Who's holding the
           wheel chief?
                         
          Donkey climbs up onto the railing. He is seasick and is
          about to puke when he sees jagged rocks ahead.

           Shrek!
                         
          Shrek desperately sets the wheel back down and tries to steer
          the ship clear of the rocks.

          The camera pans past the boat. Off-screen we hear the boat
          crash into the rocks.

          EXT. BEACH - DUSK
                         
          Shrek, holding Puss and Donkey, staggers onto a small beach.
          He glares at Artie who pulls himself out of the surf. Shrek
          drops Puss and Donkey.
                         
          Puss, tired of being wet, shakes himself vigorously. His fur
          puffs up into a fro. He drops his head in shame.
                         
                          PUSS
           How humiliating...
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

           Oh, so now it's "Your highness?"
           What happened to "loser?" Huh?
                         
                          SHREK
           Hey, if you think this is getting
           you out of anything, well it isn't.
           We're heading back to Far Far Away
           one way or another, and you're
           gonna be a father!
                         
          Artie raises an eyebrow. Puss and Donkey stare at Shrek
          uncomfortably.

          Artie shakes his head and marches down the beach toward a
          path into the woods.
                         
                          SHREK
           Where do you think you're going?
                         
                          ARTIE

           mean it!
                         
          Artie keeps climbing.
                         
                          PUSS
           Uh boss, I don't think he's coming
           back and maybe it's for the best.
           He is not exactly king material.
                         
          Shrek looks towards Artie.

                          SHREK
           Oh c'mon, now why would I do that?
           Besides, he'll be ten times better
           at it than me.
                         
          Shrek starts off after Artie. Donkey jumps in front of Shrek.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Hey, woah ho ho, Shrek. Then
           you're gonna have to change your
           tactics if you want to get anywhere
           with this kid.

           You're right, Donkey.
                         
          Shrek picks up a piece of driftwood.
                         
                          SHREK
           What about this?
                         
          Donkey shakes his head in disgust.

          Shrek tosses the log.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh c'mon. It's just a joke.

           Still...
                         
          Shrek walks off, trying to catch up to Artie.

          Artie marches up the mountain trail.
                         
          Shrek thinks for a moment and then tries a different tactic
          with the kid. He catches up to Artie.
                         
                          SHREK
           Listen Artie...
                         
          Artie looks back over his shoulder. He sees Shrek and just
          keeps going.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)
           If you think this whole mad scene
           ain't dope, I feel you dude. I
           mean, I'm not trying to get up in
           your grill or raise your roof or
           whatever, but what I am screaming
           is, yo, check out this kazing
           thazing bazaby.
                         
          Puss and Donkey glance at each other. Artie notices a
          cottage in the distance and heads toward it.
                         
                          SHREK
           I mean, if it doesn't groove or
           what I'm saying ain't straight
           trippin', just say, oh no you
           didn't, you know, you're gettin' on
           my last nerve. And then I'll know
           it's... then I'll know it's whack--
                         
          Passing a tree, Artie nonchalantly releases the branch,
          striking Shrek square in the face and takes off running.

          A boiling soup pot sits over a fire in front of a small
          shack. Artie charges though, pounding desperately on the
          door.
                         
                          ARTIE
           SOMEBODY HELP! I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED
           BY A MONSTER TRYING TO RELATE TO
           ME!
                         
                          SHREK
           Artie! Wait!
                         
                         
          Shrek, Puss, and Donkey run into the camp.
                         
                          ARTIE
           C'mon! C'mon! Help! Help!
           Hello?
                         
          Suddenly, a burst of light shoots through a candle box that
          is hung on the door. A bright, colorful image of an old
          wizard's head is projected out. Donkey is terrified.
                         
                          DONKEY
           AHHHH!
                         
           WIZARD HEAD (MERLIN)
           Greetings cosmic children of the
           universe, and welcome to my
           serenity circle!
                         
          Shrek watches.
                         
           WIZARD HEAD (MERLIN)
           Please leave any bad vibes outside
           the healing vortex. And now
           prepare ...
                         
          With a "FZZZZT" and a "BLOOP", the image disappears.
                         
          The door opens and a tiny old man, Merlin, comes out.
                         
                          MERLIN
           I knew I should of gotten that
           warranty!
                         
          Merlin smashes the security device with his little fist and
          is promptly zapped in the head.

           Mr. Merlin?
                         
                          SHREK
           You know this guy?
                         
                          ARTIE
           Yeah. He was the school's magic
           teacher until he had his nervous
           breakdown.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh, technically I was merely a
           victim of a level three fatigue,
           and at the request of my therapist
           and the school authorities, I have
           retired to the tranquility of
           nature to discover my divine
           purpose.
                         
          Merlin smacks a fly that has landed on his head.
                         
          Shrek and Artie stare in astonishment.
                         
                         
                         
                          MERLIN
           Now, can I interest anyone in a
           snack or beverage?
                         
                          SHREK
           Uh, no.
                         
          Merlin offers up a baking dish full of rocks.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Sure you don't wanna try my famous
           rock au-gratin?
                         
          Merlin takes a bite and chews loudly. His gums are bleeding
          from eating rocks.
                         
                          MERLIN
           It's organic!
                         
          They both stare at him uncomfortably.

                          SHREK
           Oh, thanks, I just ate a boulder on
           the way in. What we need are
           directions back to Far Far Away.
                         
                          ARTIE
           What's with the "we"? Who said I
           was going with you?
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, I did. Cause there's a lot of
           people counting on you so don't try
           and weasel out of it.
                         
                          ARTIE
           If it's such a great job, why don't
           you do it?
                         
                          SHREK
           Understand this kid, it's no more
           Mr. Nice Guy from here on out!
                         
                          ARTIE
           Oh, so that was your "Mr. Nice
           Guy?"
                         
                          SHREK
           I know, and I'm gonna miss him.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You know what? Why don't you go
           terrorize a village and leave me
           alone?
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, is that some kind of crack
           about ogres? You get your royal
           highness to Far Far Away before I
           kick it there.
                          (TO MERLIN)
           Now which way am I kicking?
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oh, I could tell you. But since
           you're in the midst of self-
           destructive rage spiral it would be
           karmic-ly irresponsible.
                         
                          SHREK
           Self-destructive ra...
                          (TO MERLIN)
           Look, are you gonna help us or not?

           Most definitely, but only after you
           take the journey to your soul.
                         
                          SHREK
           Yeah, I don't think so.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Look pal, it's either that or some
           primal scream therapy.
           Ahhhhhhhhhh!
                         
          Shrek grabs Merlin's mouth and closes it.
                         
                          SHREK
           Alright, alright... journey to the
           soul...

          EXT. MERLIN'S CAMP - LATER
                         
          A fire blazes.
                         
          Merlin throws a handful of dirt into the fire, it flares.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Now all of you, look into the "Fire
           of Truth" and tell me what you see!
           Yah! Ha!
           (Wild war cry)
           Woo-looo-looo-looo!
                         
          He points at the smoke and it starts to form objects (i.e.
          Rorschach inkblots).
                         
          Puss and Donkey, excited, sit by the fire.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ooo! Charades! Okay, I see a
           dutch fudge torte with cinnamon
           swirls.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Okay. Monster, go for it.
                         
          Shrek glances at the fire. The stroller from his nightmare
          begins to take shape in the smoke. He blows the image away.
          He covers his fear and changes the subject.
                         
                          SHREK
           I see a rainbow pony.

           Excellent work!

           Now! The boy!
                         
                          ARTIE
           This is lame.
                         
          Merlin whacks Artie on the back of the head.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Ow!
                         
                          MERLIN
           You're lame! Now just go for it.
                         
          He tosses more dirt and flames burst up. Artie studies it.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Okay. There's a baby bird and a
           father bird sitting in a nest.
                         
          Merlin starts beating a drum. Artie's expression starts to
          change as he stays focused.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Yes! Stay with it! Stay with it!
                         
                          ARTIE
           Wait, the dad just flew away. Why
           did he leave the little bird all
           alone?
                         
          Shrek starts to take this in as he watches. Artie gets more
          worked up.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's trying to fly, but it doesn't
           know how to. It.. it's gonna fall!
                         
          Suddenly, Artie catches what he said. As the smoke drifts
          away, he looks and sees everyone else staring back at him,
          stunned.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Whew, proper head case you are,
           aren't you? Really messed up.
           Whoa.
                         
          Merlin goes back inside. They all stare at Artie.

           bird's me. My dad left. So what?
                         
                         
          Donkey gives Shrek a nudge to go over and talk to Artie.
          Shrek hesitates and Donkey insists.

           Look Artie...um-
                         
          Just as he's about to get going, "That's What Friends Are
          For" starts playing loudly from Merlin's security device
          drowning out any conversation. They all turn toward the
          shack where Merlin peeks out.
                         
                          MERLIN

           mood! Y'know for your big heart to

          Everyone stares at him.
                         
          He sheepishly turns off the device and shuts the door. It's
          quiet again.
                         
                          SHREK
           I know what it's like to not feel
           ready for something.
                         
          Artie looks at him.

           I know you want me to be king, but

           I never will be, alright?
                         
          Shrek takes this in.
                         
                          ARTIE (CONT'D)
           Even my own dad knew I wasn't worth
           the trouble. He dumped me at that
           school the first chance he got and
           I never heard from him again.

           My dad wasn't really the fatherly
           type either.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Well, I doubt he was worse than
           mine.
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh yeah? My father was an ogre.
           He tried to eat me.
                         
          Artie looks at Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           Now, I guess I should have seen it
           coming. He used to give me a bath
           in barbecue sauce and put me to bed
           with an apple in my mouth.
                         
          Artie chuckles at this.

           Okay... I guess that's... pretty

          Artie laughs and then pokes at the fire.
                         
                          SHREK
           You know, it may be hard to believe
           what with my obvious charm and good
           looks, but people used to think
           that I was a monster. And for a
           long time, I believed them.
                         
          Artie looks up at Shrek.

           But after awhile, you learn to
           ignore the names that people call
           you and you just trust who you are.
                         
          Artie gently pokes at the embers with a stick for a moment.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You know, you're okay, Shrek.
                         
          He tosses the stick into the fire.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You just need to do a little less
           yelling and use a little more soap.

           The soap's because you stink.
           Really bad.

          is backed up to the edge of the plank and falls into a
          waiting treasure chest below. Several pirates try to shut the
          lid on him.
                         
          Puss, Donkey and Artie are trying to hold off the Villains.
          Suddenly, two Evil Trees come into frame and scoop Puss,
          Donkey and Artie up in a net.
                         
          The pirates aim the cannon at Puss, Donkey and Artie. Artie
          starts to panic. Puss extracts his claws and tries to cut
          through the netting.
                         
          The cannon fuse is lit.
                         
          Shrek bursts open the treasure chest and stands up with the
          chest still stuck to his behind.
                         
                          DONKEY

           Help!
           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 75.
                         
                         
                         
          Shrek sees the lit fuse and quickly formulates a plan. He
          grabs two pirates and shoves them into the treasure chest.
          He tosses the chest onto the other end of the plank and
          catapults himself over to the cannon. At the last second,
          Shrek is able to aim the cannon in the opposite direction.
          The cannon fires and hits Captain Hook's piano, blowing it
          into pieces.
                         
          Realizing their defeat, the Evil Trees drop the netting that
          holds Donkey, Puss and Artie. The Evil Trees and Pirates
          take off running.
                         
          Captain Hook turns and sees his army running off. He shakes
          his hook in the air.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ya cowards!
                         
                          SHREK
           What has Charming done with Fiona?
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           She's gonna get what's coming to
           her.
                         
          He raises his hook threateningly but it gets caught on an
          Evil Tree's branch and is dragged away with the rest of the
          Villains.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           Ahhh.
                          (YELLING BACK)
           And there ain't nothing you can do
           to stop him!
                         
          TIGHT ON SHREK, filled with worry. Nothing else matters to
          him now.
                         
          Artie, Puss, and Donkey run over to Shrek.

                          DONKEY
           But she's so far far away!
                         
          Shrek thinks for a moment.

           No, Shrek. Hold on a second. I've
           got an idea.
                         
                         
          EXT. MERLIN'S CAMP - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Merlin is sitting cross-legged, deep in meditation. Artie
          approaches him.
                         
                          MERLIN
                          (CHANTING)
           I'm a buzzing bee, buzz, buzz,
           buzz...
                         
                          ARTIE
           Mr. Merlin, they need a spell to
           get them...I mean, us, back to Far
           Far Away.
                         
          Merlin stops meditating and looks out of the corner of his
          eye at Artie.
                         
                          MERLIN
                          (GETTING UP)
           Forget it. I don't have that kind
           of magic in me anymore, kid. How
           about a hug instead? Hmm? That's
           the best kind of magic.
                         
          Artie tries a new approach.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Mr. Merlin please. I know you can
                          DO IT-
                         
                          MERLIN
           I said, forget it!
                         
                          ARTIE
                          BUT-
                         
          Merlin turns and starts to walk away muttering under his
          breath.
                         
                          MERLIN (CONT'D)
           Mumble, grumble, interrupt my
           healing. Mumble, mumble.
                         
          Artie thinks for a moment, staring at Merlin. Artie starts
          to sob. Merlin stops and turns around.

                          MERLIN
           Oh. What, what's with you?
                         
          Artie continues to cry.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's just so hard. You know? They
           really need to get back `cause
           their kingdom's in trouble `cause
           there's a really bad man and it's
           just so hard...
                         
          Merlin is visibly uncomfortable.
                         
                          MERLIN
           C'mon, take it easy.
                         
          Artie's blubbering becomes frustrated and unpredictable.
                         
                          ARTIE
           No! I don't think you understand!
           There's a mean person doing mean
           things to good people-

           Oh, have a heart old man!
                         
          Artie grabs him, now desperate.
                         
                          ARTIE
           And they really need your help to
           get them back! So why won't you
           help them?
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oh.
                         
          Artie speaks one last, indecipherable line.
                         
          Merlin is stunned. He doesn't know what to do.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh, Okay... I'll go and get my
           things.
                         
          Merlin goes into his cave. Artie immediately recovers.
          Shrek is impressed.
                         
                          ARTIE

           Well, well, well. You want some
           eggs with that ham?
                         
          Shrek smiles.
                         
          Merlin returns holding a spell book.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Now, I am a little rusty, so there
           could be some side effects.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Side effects!?
                         
                          MERLIN
           Don't worry, whatever it is, no
           matter how excruciatingly painful
           it may be, it'll wear off
           eventually... I think.
                         
          Merlin cracks his knuckles. A bolt of lighting shoots out
          his hands and blows up a rock next to Donkey.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Ah!
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oops.
                         
          Donkey and Puss shoot Shrek a pleading look.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Are you sure this is a good idea?
                         
                          SHREK
           Look, if Artie trusts him, that's
           good enough for me. Even if his
           robe doesn't quite cover his-
                         
                          MERLIN

           get back, um... soon!
                         
          Magic rays shoot out of Merlin's fingers. Shrek, Puss,
          Donkey and Artie disappear in a puff of smoke.
                         
                          MERLIN

          They reappear and fall out of the sky and bounce through the
          canopy of a large apple tree. They ping-pong through the
          foliage and land in a heap at the base of the tree.

           teeth?
                         
          Donkey's eyes widen. He realizes his voice is coming out of
          Puss' body.
                         
                          DONKEY

           Oh no!
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) grabs Puss' hat. He looks down at
          Puss' boots. His tail begins to twitch.

          Puss (in Donkey's body) falls from a tree next to Donkey (in
          Puss' body).

           getting yourself a pair of pants!
           I feel all exposed and nasty.
                         
          Both Shrek and Artie stare at them. A strained smile pasted
          to their faces. They burst out laughing.
                         
          Donkey joins Puss, both of them scowling.

          Puss is fuming.
                         
          Shrek and Artie regain their composure.

           Don't be! You got us back kid.
                         
          Shrek motions to Far Far Away, just a few miles ahead of
          them. He turns back to Artie.
                         
          Artie smiles.
                         
          Donkey takes a few awkward steps in Puss' body.

           Be very careful with those - HEE
           HAW!
                         
          Puss is shocked by this. He tries to recover.

          EXT. ENTRANCE TO FAR FAR AWAY - AFTERNOON
                         
          Shrek, Puss (in Donkey's body), and Artie rush past a welcome
          sign to the town that has been boarded over so it now reads
          "Go Go Away."
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) struggles to walk. His tender new
          feet hurt in their tiny boots.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Seriously man, you need some
           comfort inserts or arch supports or
           something.
           (noticing Rodeo Drive)
           Woah!
                         
          Inside the kingdom, Rodeo Drive is trashed. There is graffiti
          everywhere.
                         
          Suddenly a carriage driven by Evil Witches comes zooming down
          Rodeo Drive.
                         
                          EVIL WITCHES
           Woohoo!!
                         
          The carriage zips around a corner on two wheels. A drunken
          Evil Dwarf is almost hit by the carriage while crossing the
          street.
                         
          Shrek is shocked by what he sees.
                         
          A crash is heard off-screen.
                         
                          EVIL DWARF #1
           Hey... watch it I'm walking here...
           and I'm gonna keep going...
                         
          A large explosion is heard off-screen while Little Red Riding
          Hood pick pockets the Evil Dwarf.
                         
          A carriage wheel on fire rolls by a marionette theatre with
          Pinocchio dancing in it.

           Shrek!
                         
          Shrek and the rest rush over as the curtain starts to go down
          on Pinocchio. He presses his puppet hands against the glass.
                         
                          SHREK

           Help me!
                         
                          SHREK
           What's happened?
                         
                          PINOCCHIO
           Charming and the Villains have
           taken over everything! They
           attacked us but Fiona and the
           Princesses got away. And now she's-
                          -
                         
          The time has run out. The cheesy music stops as the curtain
          goes down.
                         
                          SHREK
           She's what?! She's what!?
                         
          Shrek looks at the marionette theatre and sees how much it
          costs per show.
                         
                          SHREK
           (turns to Puss in Donkey's
                          BODY)
           Puss, loan me five bucks!
                         
                          DONKEY
           C'mon Puss, you heard the man, help
           a brother out.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Do you see any pockets on me?
                         
                          DONKEY
           (in Puss' body)
           Hold on a second.
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) removes his boot, he turns it over and
          a bag of money falls onto the ground.
           Shrek the Third - Final Screening Script 83.
                         
                         
                         
                          DONKEY
           (in Puss' body)
           Aha!
                         
          Donkey (in Puss' body) tosses the money to Shrek.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           I had no idea ...really ...I swear.
                         
          Shrek quickly dumps the change into the machine. The music
          starts and the curtain goes up again and Pinocchio dances.
                         
                          SHREK
           Quick, Pinocchio. Where is Fiona?
                         
                          PINOCCHIO
           Charming's got her locked away some
           place secret. You gotta find him!
           He's probably getting ready for the
                          SHOWWWW---
                         
          The curtain goes down again.
                         
                          SHREK
           Wait, wait, wait! Pinocchio! What
           show?
                         
          Pinocchio's hand comes out from under the curtain and points
          to a poster on the wall. Puss reads the poster out loud.
                         
                          PUSS
           (reading the poster)
           It's A Happily Ever After, After
           All!
                         
                          SHREK
           Shrek's final performance.
                         
          The picture shows Charming, sword raised in the air, with his
          foot pinning Shrek, tongue sticking out of his mouth, to the
          ground.
                         
                          DONKEY
           (in Puss' body)
           Whoa, Shrek! You didn't tell us
           you were in a play.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well I guess I've been so busy I
           forgot to mention it!

           GUARD #1 (O.S.)
           It's the ogre! Get him!
                         
          Shrek turns and sees a large group of Charming's royal
          knights, armed and ready. They drive them back into the
          alley. Puss (in Donkey's body) steps forward.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Don't worry, Jefe. I got this.
                         
          He whips his head towards the oncoming guards. His eyes are
          large and sweet. His lips pout. The guards are momentarily
          hypnotized by his cuteness, until they realize they're
          staring at a donkey.
                         
          The guards recoil.
                         
                          GUARD #2
           Ugh! Kill it!
                         
          Puss (in Donkey's body) immediately retreats.
                         
          Artie glances at the theater poster on the wall and steps
          forward, confronting the guards.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Look, don't you know who he thinks
           he is? How dare you?
                         
          Shrek picks up on his plan.
                         
                          SHREK
           Donkey, we're dealing with
           amateurs.
                         
          The guards are confused. Artie tears the poster off the
          wall. Shrek glances at Artie, who steps forward, yanking the
          poster off the wall.
                         
                          ARTIE
           He's a star people! Hello?! I'm so
           sorry about this Mr. Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           I'm gonna lose it!
                         
                          ARTIE
           I assume you have everything ready
           for tonight! You did get the list
           for the dressing room?
                         
          Donkey marches in.

           Yeah, the breakfast croissants
           stuffed with seared sashimi tuna.
           Oh, and please tell me you at least
           have the saffron corn with the
           jalapeno honey butter cause our
           client cannot get into his proper
           emotional state without his
           jalapeno honey butter.
                         
                          SHREK

                          GUARD #1
           Uh...Maybe they should talk to
           Nancy in Human Resources.
                         
          Shrek pushes the guards aside and continues on towards the
          castle.
                         
                          PUSS

           Oh, we'll have much to say to
           Nancy, I promise!
                         
          The guards look at each other nervously.

          INT. COURTYARD STAGE - DAY
                         
          A group of enchanted trees work on through their dance
          number.
                         
          Two dwarfs on bungee chords helplessly swing back and forth
          in the rear of the stage.
                         
          The camera lands on Prince Charming reading his lines next to
          a Shrek stand in.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

           With this sword, I do- No.
                         
          He starts the line over.

          Without looking, Prince Charming stabs the stand in, who
          falls to the ground.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
                          (TO HIMSELF) )
           Is that the right word? "Smote?"
           "Smooote." Is that even a word
           actually? Maybe I should just
           smite him.
                         
          Unseen stage hands drag the stand-in away.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

          Stagehands shove another stand in onto the stage beside
          Prince Charming.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

           Shrek attacks me, I pretend to be
           afraid.
           (he fake screams)
           Ooh!!!
                         
          Prince Charming does a quick mime of being afraid and
          chuckles.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           I say...

           "Finally the Kingdom will get the
           happily ever after they deserve,
           die Ogre", blah, blah, blah...
                         
          Without looking he stabs stand in #2. He falls to the ground.
          Prince Charming is still frustrated.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oh! It just doesn't feel real
           enough yet!
                         
          He throws the sword to the ground and turns toward the
          dancing villains who are staring at him.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

          INT. CHARMING'S DRESSING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Prince Charming storms into his colossal gold leafed dressing
          room, its walls covered with posters of inspirational sayings
          and portraits of Prince Charming in different acting roles.
                         
          Slamming the door, he plops down in his throne chair in front
          of a dressing table and large 3-way mirror. A statuette of
          his mother is on the vanity. He looks at it intently.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Our happily ever after is nearly
           complete, mummy. And I assure you,
           the people of this kingdom will pay
           dearly for every second we've had
           to wait.
                         
                         
                         
          Charming adjusts the mirror, revealing a reflection of Shrek
          standing in the doorway. Artie, Puss and Donkey stand along
          side him.
                         
          Prince Charming quickly stands up and faces Shrek.
                         
                          SHREK
           Break a leg. Or, on second
           thought, let me break it for you.
                         
          He walks across the room as Prince Charming backs against his
          dressing table.
                         
          Prince Charming fumbles behind his back and pushes a button
          under the counter.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Thank goodness you're here. I was
           beginning to think you might not
           make it back in... time.
                         
          Shrek picks him up by the front of his shirt and scowls.

                          SHREK
           Where's Fiona?
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Don't worry. She and the others
           are safe. For now.
                         
          Shrek strengthens his grip.
                         
          Suddenly, a group of guards burst into the room and quickly
          surround Shrek, Artie, Puss and Donkey.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Ow.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles.
                         
          Shrek looks around and realizes he's beat. He drops Charming
          with a thud.
                         
          Prince Charming brushes himself off as the guards surround
          Shrek.
                         
          Prince Charming walks over to Artie. A smile grows across
          his face.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Let me guess... Arthur?
                         
          Artie looks indignant. He raises himself up.
                         
                          ARTIE
           It's Artie, actually.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           This boy is supposed to be the new
           King of Far Far Away?
                         
          Laughing, Prince Charming draws his sword and holds it up to
          Artie's neck.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           How pathetic! Now, stand still so I
           won't make a mess.
                         
          Shrek steps in.
                         
                          SHREK
           Charming, stop! I'm here now, you
           got what you wanted. This isn't
           about him.
                         
          Artie is confused.

           Then who's it about? I'm supposed
           to be King, right?
                         
          Shrek hesitates and then gathers himself.
                         
                          SHREK
           You weren't really next in line for
           the throne, okay? I was.
                         
                          ARTIE
           But you said the King asked for me
           personally.
                         
                          SHREK
           Not exactly.
                         
                          ARTIE
           What's that supposed to mean?
                         
                         
          Shrek becomes defensive.
                         
                          SHREK
           Look, I said whatever I had to say,
           alright! I wasn't right for the
           job, I just needed some fool to
           replace me, and you fit the bill.
           So just go!
                         
          Artie is stunned.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You were playing me the whole time.
                         
          Shrek fights back tears as he punishes Artie more.
                         
                          SHREK
           You catch on real fast kid... Maybe
           you're not as big of a loser as I
           thought.
                         
          Puss (in Donkey's body) is about to interject when Donkey (in
          Puss' body) covers his mouth and signals him to stay quiet.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You know, for a minute there, I

                          PRINCE CHARMING

          Prince Charming signals the guards to release Artie. He
          stares at Shrek one last time and heads out.
                         
          Shrek lowers his head in shame.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           You really do have a way with
           children, Shrek.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles and the guards lead Shrek off.

          The scene cross-dissolves to Artie's back as he walks away
          from the castle. He gives one last look back, and angrily
          storms away.

          Shrek's ankles and wrists are shackled. Shrek pulls on his
          chains. He sadly looks out the cell window.
                         
                         
          INT. PRISON:

          comes to the window of her prison cell. She stares
          sorrowfully at the castle in the distance.

          Cinderella is frantically scrubbing a spot on the floor to a
          shine.
                         
          Fiona looks out the cell window towards the castle in the
          distance. Behind her, Snow White paces around, complaining.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           Had we just stayed put like I

           Yeah, shut up.
                         
          Cinderella looks down at her reflection in the floor.
                         
                          CINDERELLA (REFLECTION)

                          SNOW WHITE
           Who cares who's running the kingdom
           anyway?
                         
                          FIONA
           I care.
                         
          Fiona steps forward and challenges them.
                         
                          QUEEN
           And you should all care too.
                         
          Suddenly, the cell door flies open. Donkey and Puss (in each
          other's bodies) are tossed in as the door is slammed behind
          them.

           Alright everyone, we need to find a
           way out, now.
                         
          The Princesses nod in agreement.
                         
                          SNOW WHITE
           You're right.
           (to the other Princesses)
           Ladies, assume the position!
                         
          Sleeping Beauty falls asleep standing up. Snow White quickly

          Donkey, Puss, (still in each other's bodies) and the rescued

          Donkey and Puss peek out from behind a bush.

           It's not? I think it seems pretty
           clear. He was using me. That's
           all there is to it.

          glasses, a glass tiara and glass pearls all break in the
          audience.
                         
          Prince Charming smiles. Shrek looks at him with contempt.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well it can't be anymore painful

           giving.
                         
          The audience laughs at Shrek's remark. Prince Charming is
          thrown by their reaction.

          He clears his throat and tries to get back into character.

          The audience laughs. Prince Charming gets in Shrek's face.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Be quiet!
                         
                          SHREK
           Oh, come on, I'm just havin' fun
           with ya. That's actually a very
           nice leotard.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Thank you.
                         
                          SHREK
           Do they come in men's sizes?
                         
          The audience laughs again.
                         
                          HOOK
           He, he. Now that be funny.
                         
          The crowd laughs again. Shrek smiles, enjoying how he's
          screwing up the show. Prince Charming is furious.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           ENOUGH!
                         
          The crowd falls silent.
                         
          Prince Charming turns back to Shrek.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Now you'll finally know what it's
           like to have everything you've
           worked for, everything that's
           precious to you taken away.
                         
          Prince Charming raises his sword.
                         
           PRINCE CHARMING (CONT'D)
           Now you'll know how I felt.
                         
          Suddenly a fireball hits the blade, melting it.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Ahhhhh!
                         
          Another huge fireball spreads across the sky as Dragon flies
          above the theater. The Dronkeys follow behind her.
                         
                          DRAGON

          The Three Pigs come running down the aisle.
                         
                          PIG #1
           Sausage Roll!!
                         
          The Three Pigs leap onto the stage, going into a drop and
          roll move to land in between Shrek and Prince Charming. They
          strike a fighting pose.
                         
          Pinocchio comes flying in on his strings, landing with a
          flurry of kung-fu hands.
                         
          The Wolf unzips the wolf costume, steps out and joins the
          others.
                         
                          WOLF

          Gingerbread Man pops up in the tower window, grabs Rapunzel's
          hair and swings down. Before he hits the ground, the end
          catches and he bounces like a bungee jumper. Her hair falls
          into a pile next to a very surprised Gingerbread Man.
                         
          Rapunzel screams. Her mousy brown hair crammed under a hair
          net. She runs off crying.
                         
          Prince Charming looks around, almost surrounded.
                         
          Suddenly a shadow falls over the crowd and they gasp. Dragon
          and the Dronkeys fly in and land on the stage.
                         
          Puss and Donkey leap off her back to the stage.

           ...Puss!
                         
          He claps his hooves on the stage.
                         
                          DONKEY

          He carves a letter "D" on Pinocchio's bottom.

          The Queen head-butts through one of the backdrops, with
          Sleeping Beauty and Doris. Snow White flies in behind them
          with the help of her woodland creatures ("Crouching Tiger,
          Hidden Dragon" style). Cinderella runs on stage equipped with
          a mop as her weapon. Together, the Princesses strike fierce
          poses and stand next to Shrek.
                         
          The audience applauds.
                         
          Suddenly the front door of the "swamp house" set crashes to
          the floor, revealing Fiona.
                         
                          FIONA
           Hi honey! Sorry we're late. You
           okay?
                         
                          SHREK
           Much better, now that you're here.
                         
                          AUDIENCE
           Awwwwwww!
                         
          The audience applauds. Shrek turns to Prince Charming
          raising his shackled wrists.
                         
                          SHREK
           So Charming, you wanna let me out
           of these so we can settle this ogre
           to man?
                         
          Prince Charming considers this for a second.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Oooh, that sounds fun. But I have
           a better idea!
                         
          Prince Charming strikes an imperious pose and claps his
          hands. Cyclops suddenly emerges from the trap door, knocking
          Puss and Donkey down. He approaches them menacingly.
                         
          The witches fly in and threaten the princesses with their
          brooms. The Evil Queen rises up behind the Queen and puts a
          knife to her throat.
                         
          The Evil Dwarves grab The Three Pigs. Gingerbread Man is
          suddenly surrounded by many Evil Knights. He poops out a gum-
          ball.
                         
          Dragon starts to move forward only to find herself surrounded
          by crossbows. A bunch of pirates grab Fiona and tie her up.
                         
                          SHREK

           No! Let go of me!
                         
          Shrek struggles to free himself of the chains, but it's no
          use.
                         
          Prince Charming's eyes narrow.

           Kill it!
                         
          Prince Charming signals to the villains to attack Shrek. As
          the villains advance towards Shrek, a spotlight shines in
          their eyes, stopping them in their tracks.
                         
                          ARTIE

           Artie?
                         
          Artie jumps from the spotlight.
                         
          Artie lands clumsily on a hanging cloud.
                         
          Artie leaps awkwardly from cloud to cloud. The audience
          stares in awe.
                         
          After one last leap, he swings down on the Cherub's cable,
          sending the little person up in the air.
                         
          Artie lands on the stage in between the Villains and Shrek.
          He stands facing the Villains.
                         
                          ARTIE
           Who really thinks we need to settle
           things this way?
                         
          The Evil Knights think about it and raise their hands. The
          other Villains follow suit.
                         
                          ARTIE
           You're telling me you just want to
           be Villains your whole lives?
                         
          This gives the Villains pause.

           Didn't you ever wish you could be
           something else?
                         
          The Villains aren't convinced.
                         
                          EVIL TREE #2
           Well, it's easy for you to say.
           You're not some evil enchanted
           tree.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING

                          ATTACK THEM-
                         
          Another Evil Tree covers Prince Charming's mouth and then
          motions to Artie.

           What Steve's trying to say here is
           that it's hard to come by honest
           work when the whole world's against
           you.

           Okay, fair enough. You're right.
           I'm not a talking tree. But, ya
           know, a good friend of mine once
           told me that just because people
           treat you like a villain, or an
           ogre...
                         
          Artie shares a look with Shrek.

          Artie points at Rumplestiltskin directly in front of him.
          Rumplestiltskin is alarmed.

          The Headless Horseman breaks through the crowd.
                         
                          HEADLESS HORSEMAN
           I've always wanted to play the

          The Fairy-tale Villains and Creatures look at each other.
          The Evil Queen steps up.

           I`d like to open up a spa in
           France.
                         
          The Villains nod in agreement.
                         
                          CAPTAIN HOOK
           I grow daffodils!

           And they're beautiful!
                         
          Captain Hook looks thoughtfully at his sword, then throws it
          down.

          The pirates throw theirs down, followed by the witches and
          Evil Knights. The evil knight holding Pinocchio is thinking
          about it when Pinocchio reaches over and takes the ax from
          him. The weapons pile up in the middle of the stage. Everyone
          else cheers and starts to mingle, introducing themselves and
          shaking hands.
                         
          Gingerbread Man high fives with an Evil Knight. Fiona is
          untied.
                         
          Mabel walks up to Doris and lightly punches her on the jaw.
          Doris returns the sign of affection by punching Mabel in the
          jaw, but a bit too hard, sending her falling to the ground.
                         
          Suddenly, Prince Charming kicks himself free of the Evil Tree
          and charges them. He grabs a sword from the discard pile and
          raises it up, his aim set at Artie.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Aaaahhhh!
                         
          Despite his fear, Artie faces Prince Charming bravely. As
          Prince Charming charges, Shrek finds the strength to break
          his chains. Just before Prince Charming strikes, a chain
          whips into frame, wrapping around the sword. Shrek pulls
          Prince Charming around in a circle, away from Artie. Furious,
          he charges Shrek and stabs him with the sword. Charming lets
          go and Shrek stumbles back with the weapon impaled in him,
          and falls to the floor, groaning.
                         
          Prince Charming beams, and laughs. He turns to the audience.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           A new era finally begins!
                         
          The audience cowers.
                         
          Shrek looks up smiling and nods at Fiona and Artie.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Now, all of you, bow before your
           king!
                         
          Shrek casually rises up behind him and clears his throat.
                         
                          SHREK
           Ah-hem.
                         
          Charming turns around. Shrek lifts his arm revealing that he
          was never really stabbed.
                         
                          SHREK (CONT'D)

          Charming is stunned.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           This was supposed to be my happily
           ever after.
                         
          Prince Charming is paralyzed. Shrek drops the sword and grabs
          him by the shirt-front, lifting him off of his feet.
                         
          He winces, but is still defiant.
                         
                          SHREK
           Well I guess you need to keep
           looking...
                         
          Shrek looks at Fiona and at his friends and smiles.
                         
                          SHREK
           ...cause I'm not giving up mine.
                         
          Shrek sets Prince Charming down and signals DRAGON. She
          casually tips the tower over with her tail. A shadow falls
          over Prince Charming. He turns and sees the tower falling
          toward him, his body perfectly framed up in the princesses's
          window.
                         
                          PRINCE CHARMING
           Mommy?
                         
          It crashes down and he's trapped inside.
                         
          As the dust clears, the crown rolls across the stage. Artie
          stops it with his foot and slowly picks it up.
                         
                          SHREK
           It's yours if you want it, you
           know, but this time it's your
           choice.
                         
          Artie considers it.
                         
          He looks at Shrek, who is smiling proudly at him.
                         
          Artie turns to the audience and holds out the crown to them.
          They cheer him.
                         
          Artie places the crown on his head. The crowd goes nuts. In
          the audience, Raul sobs with joy.
                         
                          ALL

          Everybody cheers as the Fairy-tale Creatures and Villains put
          Artie up on their shoulders and carry him off. Donkey and
          Puss, still in each other's bodies, watch as Artie gets
          carried away.
                         
          In a puff of smoke, Merlin suddenly appears. He looks around
          confused, clutching his show ticket.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh, excuse me, that's my seat.
                         
          Suddenly he is thrown back against the front of the stage as
          Donkey and Puss confront him.
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Okay, senor hocus-y pocus-y. The
           time has come to rectify some
           wrongs!
                         
                          DONKEY

           Although I have been enjoying these
           "cat baths."
                         
                          PUSS
           (in Donkey's body)
           Please say you didn't.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Uh... alright, alright...look..
                         
          Merlin rubs his hands together.
                         
                          MERLIN
           You're gonna feel a little pinch,
           and possibly some lower intestinal
           discomfort, but this should do the
           trick.
                         
          Merlin rolls up his sleeves, and prepares to make with the
          magic. He lets loose with a bright burst of magic. It takes a
          moment for Donkey and Puss to recover. They eye each other
          cautiously.
                         
                          PUSS
           Are you..?
                         
          Donkey lifts his hoof and inspects it carefully.
                         
                          DONKEY

          Puss checks out his own paws.
                         
                          PUSS
           And I am not you!
                         
          Donkey and Puss give each other a big hug.
                         
                          DONKEY
           Alright!
                         
          The two of them turn and walk away together.
                         
          Merlin is behind them, smoking fingers and all. Suddenly his
          eyes grow wide.
                         
                          MERLIN
           Oops. Ah, never mind.
                         
          We see that Donkey still has Puss' tail and Puss had
          Donkey's. Merlin slips away.
                         
          Shrek and Fiona watch Artie in the distance.

           Well, for what it's worth, you
           would have too.
                         
          Shrek smiles, and touches Fiona's belly.
                         
                          SHREK
           I have something much more
           important in mind.
                         
          They kiss.
                         
          The camera pulls back to see everyone celebrating around
          Shrek and Fiona as they kiss.

          Shrek grabs a "gourd" bottle and creates an ogre shake out of
          slug juice, eye balls and worms. He walk over to join Fiona
          by the fire.

           Ah, finally.
                         
          Shrek gives Fiona the "gourd" bottle and she places a nipple
          on it. Two ogre babies crawl up onto Fiona's lap.

          A third ogre baby appears at Shrek's feet. He bends down to
          pick him up.
                         
          One big happy family of five. Shrek laughs and gives the
          babies and Fiona a hug.
                         
          The front door opens up to reveal Puss and Donkey.

          The Dronkeys come swarming in behind Donkey. Dragon peers in
          through the door.
                         
          Shrek with a safety pin in his mouth is doing his best at
          changing diapers. He twists the diaper around and the baby
          goes flying off screen and lands in a diaper that Fiona is
          holding. She smiles at Shrek.
                         
          The swamp house is overrun with Dronkeys, ogre babies and
          dirty diapers.
                         
          Puss sits next to an ogre baby that has a pacifier in his
          mouth. He takes the pacifier out of his mouth, shoves it in
          Puss' mouth and gives Puss a big hug. Another baby comes
          crawling into frame and starts to tug on Puss' tail. A tug
          of war ensues.
                         
          The ogre babies are bathing in a pot of water (a la a beat
          from the Nightmare scene). One of the babies farts in the
          water as Shrek comes in and scoops them up. Shrek laughs.

          A baby ogre pulls ear wax from Shrek's ear. The baby uses
          the wax to draw squiggly lines on a piece of paper.

          The Queen is bouncing a baby ogre on her lap. The baby pukes
          and the Queen smiles.
                         
          There is a knock at the door. Donkey is laying on the floor
          holding a bottle with all four hooves, drinking the milk.
                         
          Shrek grabs the bottle out of Donkey's mouth.

          Shrek and Fiona are diapering two of the babies in perfect
          unison. They continue diapering, Fiona holds up the third
          baby and Shrek holds up an unhappy, diapered Puss.

          her foot and puts the gourd in the baby's mouth.
                         
          Shrek is burping a baby over his shoulder. The baby burps.
          Fiona has a baby over her shoulder and the baby burps. A
          Dronkey sitting on a chair does a flame-belch and an ogre
          baby crawling by farts which causes a flame thrower effect

Spider-Man 3 By Sam Raimi 
Page 1/32
It's me, Peter Parker. 
Your friendly neighborhood... you know. 
I've come a long way from being the boy who was bit by a spider. Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me. 
Now... 
- Wow, look, it's Spider-Man! 
people really like me. 
Hey, stick around! It's gonna start again in a couple minutes. - Yeah... - That's OK. 
The city is safe and sound. 
Guess I've had something to do with that. 
My uncle Ben would be proud. 
I still go to school, 
top of my class. 
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us 
that the energy levels are perturbed by the electric field. From the form of this matrix, 
we can see...? 
Miss Stacey? 
- That only the m=0 quantum states are affected. 
Correct! Good work, Miss Stacey. 
Parker. 
You got something to add? 
No, sir. 
And I'm in love 
with the girl of my dreams. 
Hi. Um, Miss Watson left a ticket for me? 
Peter Parker. 
Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you. 
It's my girlfriend! 
Harry! 
I need to talk to you. 
Explain things. 
Tell it to my father. 
Raise him from the dead. 
I'm your friend, Harry. 
I cared about your father. 
MJ. 
Peter. 
Was I good? 
- Good? 
You were great. You were... 
- You say great? 
I love my flowers. They're beautiful. 
Page 2/32
And those are from Harry. 
Was he here tonight? 
- Yeah, I ran into him outside. 
What's with you guys anyway? 
It's complicated. 
Tell me again, was I really good? 
I was so nervous. 
My knees were shaking. 
Your knees were fine. 
- The applause was not very loud. 
Yes, it was. 
It's the acoustics. 
It's all about diffusion. 
It keeps the sound waves from grouping. 
You see, when the sound waves, they propagate, then it's like an... - You are such a nerd. 
Did you see that one? 
You know what? 
I'd like to sing on stage for the rest of my life 
with you in the first row. 
I'll be there. 
Tell me you love me. 
I love you. 
I love you so much. 
I always have. 
You can't hide here, Flint. 
I'm just here to see my daughter. 
You are an escaped convict. 
The cops are looking for you. 
You're not getting near her. 
You're nothing but a common thief. 
You maybe even killed a man. 
It wasn't even like that. 
Wasn't. 
I had good reason for what I was doing. 
And that's the truth. 
You and the truth, sitting in prison, having three meals a day together. I live in a prison. It's a great truth. 
And that is the truth that you left behind. 
Right there in that bedrooom. 
I missed you. 
I missed you too, Daddy. 
I promise 
I'll make you healthy again. 
Page 3/32
Whatever it takes. 
I'll get the money. 
- You get out of here. 
Now. 
I'm not a bad person. 
Just had bad luck. 
Peter, what is it? 
It's MJ... 
I'm gonna ask her to marry me! 
Oh, Peter! Oh! 
The day that uncle Ben asked me to marry him, 
he was so scared and excited. 
And very young. 
And I loved him so fiercely. 
Then you said yes, right? 
No. I wanted to say yes, but I said no. 
I wasn't ready, 
neither was he. 
So we took our time. 
Looked forward to it. 
Didn't want to run into something with nothing to count on but love. A man has to be understanding 
and put his wife before himself. 
Can you do that, Peter? 
Yeah. I think I can. 
Then you have my blessing. 
I hope you've considered a proper proposal. 
Your uncle had it all planned. 
He took me to the beach one Sunday. 
He was a knockout in his bathing suit. 
And I, I didn't look too bad myself. 
We were very good swimmers. 
It was a beautiful day, 
and he said: 
And at the island, 
we found a perfect spot by an old tree, 
and we lay down and looked up at the sky. 
And then he said, "Close your eyes, May." 
And I did. And then he said, "Open them." 
And I did. 
And he was holding this ring. 
Dazzling, in front of me. 
I thought it was the sun. 
Page 4/32
We'd be married 50 years 
come August... if... 
So. 
I hope you make it very special 
for Mary Jane. 
Do something she'll never forget. 
Give her this. 
Come on. 
Take it. 
Harry. 
- You knew this was coming, Pete. 
Listen to me! I didn't kill your father! 
He was trying to kill me. He killed himself. Shut up! 
I'm still here, Peter! 
Hate those things. 
Harry. 
Harry. 
Harry! 
Oh my God. 
Harry! 
Come on! 
God! 
- And clear! 
No response. 
- Recharge. Let's go again. 
Clear! 
No response. 
We charge it one more time. And clear! 
Captain Stacey. 
What's this? 
- Flint Marko, the guy we tied to the Ben Paker homicide. What about him? 
- He just broke out of Rikers. 
And? 
- He's on the run. 
He's in the marshlands. I think we got him. There he is! 
"DANGER 
PARTICLE PHYSICS TEST FACILITY 
KEEP OUT" 
Euton, take the west side. Tommy, take the east. Where'd he go? 
That's it. It's charged. 
Page 5/32
- Right. 
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on 1. 
There's a change in the silicon mass. 
It's probably a bird. It'll fly away when we fire it up. Initiating demoleculisation. 
How is he? 
- He's gonna be OK. 
But there's been some memory impairment. 
Particularly his short-term memory. 
Right now, he can't remember the accident 
or anything that happened to him recently. 
Is it permanent? 
It could be. 
Only time will tell. 
He's awake if you want to see him. 
Uh-- maybe I should wait. 
Nah, it's fine. Just keep it brief. Allow him to rest. Hey, buddy. 
- Hey. 
Hit my head. 
Yeah. 
Doctor said I was in an accident. Hit and run. I don't remember much of anything. 
My father-- 
he died, right? 
This is all so weird. 
Hi. I got here as fast as I could. 
I know that face. 
How are you doing? 
I don't know. 
Last thing I remember, I was falling... 
somewhere. 
You're still fine. 
We love you, Harry. 
It feels like 
somehow I've been gone for a really long time. Now I'm back home. 
It's good to have you back. 
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you guys to scoot, OK? OK. 
- All right, thank you. 
Well, I'll see you tomorrow. 
Yeah, great. 
I think he's gonna be fine. 
Page 6/32
Think so. 
And you guys seem great. 
- Yeah. 
You have lovely friends. 
My best friends. 
I'd give my life for them. 
Yeah? 
- It's me. 
- Oh! Hey! 
You know I can't open the door. 
It's stuck again? 
Come on and help me. 
I'm coming. 
The review. 
- Oh! 
The hated it. They hated me. 
Well, they can't hate you. 
"The young Miss Watson is a pretty girl. 
"Easy on the eyes, but not on the ears. 
"Her small voice didn't carry past the first row." 
That's ridiculous. I was right there. 
You were in the first row. 
Yeah, but that's... 
Listen. You were great. 
That's a critic. 
This is something you're gonna have to get used to. 
Believe me, I know. 
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time. 
- This isn't about you. 
It's about me. 
It's about my career. 
- I know, and I'm just saying, 
you can't let it bring you down. 
You just gotta believe in yourself. 
You pull yourself together, 
and you get right back on the horse. 
- Don't give me the horse thing. 
Try to understand how I feel. 
It's just... 
I look at these words, 
and it's like my father wrote them. 
All cars. All cars in the vicinity of 54th and 6th Ave, please report. Crane out of control. Approach with caution. 
Go get 'em, tiger. 
Page 7/32
Sorry. 
Oh my God. 
Seven Atom to central. That crane . 
It's bigger than we thought. We're gonna need a major mobilization right away. 
Just gotta douse the accelerator! Now! 
OK, Gwen. 
I've got a secret. It's my call for ya. 
What is that thing doing in my background? 
Captain Stacey, the guys look out of shot of it. 
They can't shut down the crane. 
Get Edison on the phone. 
Have them kill the power of the whole block. 
Are you all right? 
It's coming back! 
Oh my God. It's Gwen! 
What? 
What's she doing up there? 
I don't know. I just saw her last night. She said she had a modeling gig. Who are you? 
- It's Brock, sir. 
Eddie Brock, jr. 
I work at the Daily Bugle. 
And I'm dating your daughter. 
You OK? 
- Yeah. 
I'm fine. 
Thank you. 
Hey, Spidey, hold on. Bugle needs a photo. 
Thank God you're OK. 
- Daddy! 
Hey. I'm the new guy. 
- New guy? 
From now on, I'm gonna be taking shots of you for the Bugle. So-- smile! Are you smiling? 
Where's the other guy? 
- Peter Parker? 
Yeah, um, look, between you and me-- 
The guy's kind of an amateur. 
Have you noticed, his stuff makes you look a little... bloated. Just a little chunky. 
- OK... 
Don't have to worry about that anymore, buddy. 
Dazzeling. 
Page 8/32
Just a little something the boys in the ad department and I whipped up. As you know, circulation of the Bugle has been pretty good. Though not as good as the New York Times 
or the Daily News 
or the Post or several other smaller... 
- Get on with it, moron! 
What? 
- Your blood pressure, Mr Jameson. 
Your wife told me to tell you to watch the anger. 
- You tell my wife... 
Thank you. 
So, I propose this campaign: 
"DAILY BUGLE" -- that's obvious. 
"IT'S HIP, IT'S NOW" -- I came up with that one. 
"IT'S WOW" -- that's actually Eric's. 
"AND HOW!" -- that's me again. 
Time to take your pill. 
Not that one. 
Not that one. 
Drink plenty of water. 
Thank you. 
Continue. 
He's busy. 
Oh, no, I'm just here to talk to you, babe. 
(- What's that smell?) 
That's a little something called 
"Nice 'n' Easy". 
What's on you? 
- It's called "Go Away". 
That is the dumbest idea you've ever had. You have had some daunting... - Blood pressure. 
Hey, where are you going? 
Who are you? 
- You hired him last week. 
Freelance. 
- I did? What's that smell? 
Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior. 
Wow, I really like that shirt. 
Here. It's a crane accident. Check out the light source. He likes my shirt. 
Hey, Betty. 
- Hey, Pete. You better get in there. 
A new guy. He's trying to sell some Spidey photos. 
Uh. Thanks. 
Page 9/32
Parker! You're late! Maybe too late. Bruckner here beat ya to it. It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior. 
- I got you this. 
But he got me this. 
Wait. How'd you get that? I didn't see you. 
- How'd you get that high? 
Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole. 
A flagpole? 
Which one do we use? 
- I like Bernstein's. 
It's better. 
- Cheaper, too. 
Congratulations, son. We'll use your shot and pay you 50 bucks. Uh-- all right, JJ. I'm your man. 
I know more about what makes a good picture 
than any photographer in this town. 
See, photography, it's not just about 
-- no offense -- flagpoles. Whatever. 
It's about lighting. Composition. Drama. 
I want a staff job, sir. 
I have a girl that I intend to marry, and-- 
I have this stupid little dream of-- working with one of the greatest newspaper editors of our time. 
J. Jonah Jameson. 
Well, we do have an opening. 
Johnson quit, remember? 
- You fired him. 
- Whatever. 
Wait a minute. I know what makes a good picture, 
and I've been here for a long time. If there's a staff job, Mr Jameson, I think I deserve it. 
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us for years. 
He's done a great job. 
You want a staff job, and you want a staff job. 
Anybody care about what I want? 
I do. 
- Shut up. Get out. 
I want the public to see Spider-Man for the two-bit criminal he really is. He's a fake. He's full of stickum. 
Catch him in the act. 
"Spider-Man with his hand in the cookie jar". 
Whoever brings me that photo gets the job. 
What are you waiting for, Chinese New Year? Go, go, go! 
I'm on it, boss. 
Page 10/32
You'll never get that shot. 
We'll see. 
You know, 
I guess one person can make a difference. 
'Nuff said. 
Welcome home, Harry. 
Thank God you're all right. 
Thanks, Bernard. 
Aperitif? 
- Sure. 
Got you a little homecoming present. 
Wha-- It's your old ball! 
- Yeah. 
Thanks, buddy. 
We were pretty good in the backyard, weren't we? We were terrible. And we tried out for the varsity team. Yeah, for the cheerleaders. 
- Right. 
Hey, do I have any girlfriends? 
I don't know. 
- You don't? 
Hey Bernard, do I have any girlfriends? 
- Not that I know of, sir. 
That's a pretty cool pass, huh? 
It's OK. 
Looks like I'm not worrying for money. 
No. 
Well, I bet I can turn this little girlfriend thing around. You know, 
he always appreciated how you helped me through high school. I just wish I could remember more about him. 
He loved you. 
That's the main thing. 
Hey, let's watch the game in the kitchen. 
Get something to eat. 
- OK. 
Whoa, catch that! 
Did you see that? 
Still got the moves. 
Yeah! 
Why are you stopping? 
What is she doing here? 
Gary, you were supposed to call her agent. 
Hi, honey. 
Page 11/32
We tried to reach you. 
I'm sorry. 
One critic? 
- No, all the papers, dear. 
Mary Jane, honey. Sit down. Let's explain it to you. - If you like, we could say you became ill. That was so poorly handled. 
- Yeah. Let's just rehearse. 
All right, Spidey! 
Excuse me, miss. Let me see that gorgeous smile. Hi, Eddie. 
You're so beautiful. 
This is front page stuff. 
I've got to practice. I'll see you later, OK? How about tonight? 
- Not tonight. 
Why not? 
Think of that amazing-- night that we had. We had a coffee, Eddie. 
Hey, beautiful. 
One more. 
Everything OK? 
- Yeah. I'm fine. 
You're not still mad at me, are you? 
No, Peter. I'm proud of you. 
Hey. I'm gonna be swingin' it from over there. So you know where to look. 
Give 'em a good show. 
Don't worry about that review. 
We're gonna be laughing about it tomorrow night. Promise. 
- Yeah. 
Isn't that that guy from that prison break? He fits. 
Hey you! Halt! 
Cover the back! 
Fire! 
People of the city of New York, I am here today because I fell 62 storeys 
and someone caught me. 
Someone who never asks for anything in return. Someone who doesn't even want us to know who he is. Hey, MJ. 
- Harry. 
Page 12/32
Where is Pete? 
Um-- taking somebody's picture, I guess. 
I'm so happy to see you. You look so good. 
I've never felt better. 
It's a weird feeling, not knowing New York. 
Bump on the head, I'm just free as a bird. 
Will you bump me on the head? 
- Bop. 
Hey, Pete said you're in a play. 
You came. You sent me flowers. 
I did? 
I'll come again tonight. 
You can't. 
I--I was let go. 
What happened. 
I wasn't very good. 
You know, this is embarrassing, but... 
I once wrote you a play in high school. 
You wrote me a play? 
Yeah. 
- Harry, that's the sweetest thing. 
I ask you: 
or your store's being robbed 
or your house is on fire, 
who is it that brakes your fall, puts out the flames and saves your children? 
Spider-Man! 
They love me! 
Then let's hear it! For your one and only friendly neighborhood... Spider-Man! 
Kiss him! 
Kiss him! 
Go ahead, lay it right on me. 
Really? 
- Yeah, they'll love it. 
Kiss him! Kiss him! 
- No, Spider-Man, no! 
Right... 
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this. 
Hey, are you OK? 
- Yes, I'm fine. 
Jig's up, pal. 
I don't want to hurt you. 
Page 13/32
Leave now. 
- I guess you haven't heard? 
I'm the sheriff 'round these parts. 
OK. 
Where do all these guys come from? 
Bonsoir. Le monsieur a-t-il un "reservation"? 
I'm sorry, I don't speak... 
- But this is a French restaurant, non? 
Oui. 
Name, please? 
- Parker, Peter. 
Ah. Here we are. 
Table for two. Pekar. 
Parker. 
- That is what I said. 
Pekar. 
Um, I have a request. 
My girlfriend will be coming, 
and I have this ring. 
Ah. All. 
Oh, so you want to pop the question tonight, hein? Yes, and I want to do something very special. 
I love it. 
Romance. 
I am French. 
When I signal you, if you'd bring some champagne with the ring... In ze bottom of her glass? 
Perfect. 
- Magnifique. 
Also I thought, at the same time 
could the musicians 
play this song? 
Their favorite. 
And take good care of the ring. 
Ah oui, with my life, monsieur. 
- S'il vous plat. 
- Oui. 
I like you. 
Thank you. 
"Bon" chance. 
Bonne chance. 
OK, so... How would you like some champagne? 
How'd that get in there? 
Aw, don't cry. 
Page 14/32
Look at you, wow! Beautiful. 
- Thanks. 
Is this place in your budget? 
Oh, it's a special occasion. 
You're on Broadway. 
I don't feel like much of a star tonight. 
Well, you are a star. 
And you've earned it. 
Peter, you have no idea how I feel right now. 
Oh no, I know exactly how you feel. 
Listen. 
I have been through this. 
Happens to me all the time. 
I see Spider-Man posters in the window. 
Kids running around with me on their sweaters. 
Big Hallowe'en item. 
I don't know, I guess I've become something of an icon. Like yesterday. 
They keep screaming: "Spider-Man! Spider-Man!" 
I don't know, I mean, 
I'm thinking to myself, 
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens. Do I deserve this?" 
Hi, Pete. 
- Hi. 
Hi. My parents and I are just having dinner here. 
Hello. 
I'm Gwen Stacey. 
This is Mary Jane Watson. 
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you. Pete talks about you all the time. Gwen is my lab partner in Dr Connor's class. 
Pete's something of a genius. I'd be completely lost without him. Which actually reminds me-- 
Pete, if you got a picture of my kiss with Spider-Man, 
could you bring it to class? 
I'd really love it. 
For my portfolio. 
After all, who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right? 
I can't imagine. 
Well, it was lovely to meet you. 
Good night. 
- Good night. 
Uh, she's in my science class. It's not her best subject. What? 
How come you never mentioned her? 
Page 15/32
She's your lab partner, 
you saved her life, 
she thinks you're a genius and she had her polished fingernails all over you? 
Or didn't you notice? 
And she gave Spider-Man the key to the city. 
I'll never forget that. 
She's just a girl in my class. 
- Let me ask you something. 
When you kissed her, 
who was kissing her? 
Spider-Man or Peter? 
What do you mean? 
- You know exactly what I mean. 
That was our kiss. 
Why would you do that? 
You must have known how it made me feel. 
Do you want to push me away? 
Push you away? 
Why would I want to push you away? I love you. 
You're my girlfriend. She's a girl in my class, MJ. 
I don't feel very well. I'm sorry. I have to go. 
Where are you going? 
- Please don't follow me. 
Here we are. 
Hi, it's MJ. Sing a song at the beep. Beep! 
Hello. Uh... 
I wish you'd pick up the phone. 
I don't know what's going on. 
I don't know if you got the messages, or what. 
But... 
I just want to talk to you. 
OK. Call me, all right? 
Hallo? 
- Mr Parker? 
Yeah? 
- This is Detective Neil Garettfrom the 2nd precinct. 
I'm calling on behalf of Captain Stacey. 
He would like you to come down to the station to speak with him. Originally we thought that this man, Dennis Carradine, 
was your husband's killer. 
We were wrong. 
What? 
- Turns out Mr Carradine was only an accomplice. 
Page 16/32
The actual killer is still at large. 
What are you talking about? 
This is the man who killed your husband. 
His name is Flint Marko. 
He's a small-time crook who's been in and out of prison. You got this wrong. 
Two days ago, he escaped. 
Evidently, he confessed his guilt to a cellmate. 
And we have a couple of witnesses who corroborate the story. No, wait, sir. You don't want to do this. 
Get in! What are you doing? 
Would you put these photos away, please? 
I'm sorry, Mrs Parker. I know this isn't easy, 
but please be patient with us. 
We're doing our job. We will catch him. 
No, you're not doing your job. 
I watched my uncle die. 
We chased down the wrong man. 
Now you're telling me there's suspicions for two years? Witnesses? Why weren't we told about this? 
- Settle down, sir. 
No, I have no intention of settling down! 
This man killed my uncle, 
and he's still out there! 
L-20 Parkway, all officers in the vicinity please report. We have an abandoned vehicle and an abandoned man in the middle of the street. 
Sorry, Wabash Avenue. 
Peter, it's MJ. 
I'm not here about what happened at dinner. Just please open up. Aunt May called me. She told me about what happened. 
She's worried about you. 
I'm worried about you. 
Don't be. I'm fine. 
I don't want you to do something stupid. 
Like try to find my uncle's killer? 
And do something you'll regret. 
Like... 
with that other guy. 
He had a gun on me. 
I made a move, and he fell. I told you that. 
- I'm not accusing you of anything. 
C-22, auto at 566, 9th Avenue... 
- Will you turn that thing off? 
Page 17/32
Peter, I'm here because I care about you. 
And I know that you made a mistake and that you feel guilty, but-- I want to be here for you. 
- OK. 
I get it. Thank you. 
But, uh, I'm fine. 
I don't need your help. 
Everybody needs help sometimes, Peter. 
Even Spider-Man.

Don't hurt me! Just give me a chance! 
- What about my uncle? 
Did you give him a chance? 
Did you? 
Where am I? 
What is this? 
I feel... 
Wow. 
This feels good. 
This is something else. 
What do you think? 
I've never seen anything like it. 
I'm a physicist, not a biologist, but... 
I'll look at it in the morning, run some tests. 
- Can we do that now? 
It seems to like you. 
Don't let any of that get on you. 
- Why not? 
It has the characteristics of a symbiote, 
which needs to bond to a host to survive. 
And sometimes, these things in nature, when they bind, they can be hard to unbind. 
Bank robbery in progress, First Eastern Bank Bismarck. Another sand storm is reported in the vicinity. All cars, proceed with caution. 
Marko. 
Buddy, love the new outfit. 
This is exactly what I need to scoop, partner. Give me some of that web action. 
See you, chum. 
Page 18/32
What the hell? 
Flint Marko? 
What do you want from me? 
Remember Ben Parker? 
The old man you shot down in cold blood? 
What does it matter to you anyway? 
Everything! 
It's time to pay, Marko. 
Good riddance. 
Re-ent! 
Not now. 
This is a free country. It's not a rent-free country. 
Leave me alone. 
Give me rent. 
You'll get your rent when you fix this damn door! 
That wasn't cool. 
He is good boy. 
He must be in some kind of trouble. 
Flint Marko, the man who killed uncle Ben-- 
he was killed last night. 
O my-- 
What happened? 
Spider-Man killed him. 
Spider-Man? 
I don't understand. 
Spider-Man doesn't kill people. 
What happened? 
I... He was... 
I thought that you'd feel... 
He deserved it, didn't he? 
I don't think it's for us to say whether a person deserves to live or die. Aunt May, he killed uncle Ben. 
Uncle Ben meant the world to us. 
But he wouldn't want us living one second with revenge in our hearts. It's like a poison. 
It can take you over. 
Before you know it, 
turn us into something ugly. 
Hello. 
Hey, Harry, it's MJ. 
Hi. 
- I need some company. 
Are you doing anything? Can I stop by? 
Yeah, sure. Come on over. 
Page 19/32
OK. Are you sure it's OK? 
I'm not doing anything. 
Please, come over. 
OK, I'll see you soon. 
Great. 
- Bye. 
Bernard? 
- Yes, Mr Osborn? 
We're having a guest. Can you get some food? 
A guest? 
- Yeah, a guest. 
A guest guest? 
Will you just get some food? 
Rightaway, sir. 
Hey, Mr Ditkovitch. 
An orange? 
No, thanks. 
Listen-- 
I'm really sorry for what happened earlier. 
I shouldn't have yelled about that door. It was nothing to be angry about. Ah, it's not big deal. 
But if you feel that bad about it, 
you can buy me pizza some time. 
Today's good. 
OK. 
Have problem with the phone? 
No, no, I was just-- was trying to figure out what to say. If it's a woman you're calling, 
then you say: 
"I'm good man." 
Hi, Pete. 
- Hi. 
He's calling a woman. 
- Are you calling Mary Jane? 
I think that would be so good... 
- It's none of your business. 
Go! Go. 
Give her a call. 
- Thanks. 
Bye. 
- Bye. 
You hungry? 
Yeah. 
Page 20/32
Come in. 
Hope you like peppers. 
I love 'em. 
Oh, the butter! 
Well, we can use that part. 
"You've been dreaming." 
"Nothing like a little self-deception to get you through the night." All right. 
- When did you write that? 
- It's intense. 
So, do you want the part? 
I'd love to be in your play. 
- Cheers. 
You know, there's not even a scar. 
Barely. 
Sorry. 
- Me too. 
I didn't mean to do that. 
- No, it's OK. Please. 
Forgive me. 
Mary Jane. 
Mary Jane. 
Mary Jane, please! 
- I'm sorry. 
You've taken your eye off the ball. 
What have you done? 
Avenge me! 
My father-- he died, right? 
Yeah. 
Just wish that I could remember more about him. 
Well, he loved you. 
That's the main thing. 
I swear on my father's grave: Spider-Man will pay. 
Harry. 
Remember me? 
Yes, father. 
I remember. 
I was right about her, 
about Peter, 
about everything. 
You know what you must do. 
Make him suffer. Make him wish he were dead. 
First we attack his heart. 
Hi, it's me. Sing your song at the beep. 
Page 21/32
Hey, MJ. 
It's Peter. 
I want to talk to you about last night. I don't know what I was thinking. I know you were just there to help, and-- I, uh-- I don't know, I want to see you. If you want Peter to live, 
you're gonna do something for me. Yeah? 
- It's Ursula. 
Come in. 
Hi, Pete. 
- Hi. 
There's a phone call for you. 
It's Mary Jane, she called back! 
Really? 
- Yeah! 
I put the phone on top of the thing. Thanks. OK. 
Hey. 
- Hi. 
I was so glad you called. 
I've been-- trying to-- 
- Can you meet me? 
You bet. 
- Now? 
OK. Where? 
At the bridge, in the park. 
On my way. 
Hey. I love you. 
You look beautiful. 
Peonies. 
You OK? 
No. 
There's something I have to tell you, Pete. - OK. 
It's not working. 
You and me. 
What? 
I don't want to see you anymore. 
What are you talking about? 
I don't know. 
I'm lonely. 
You aren't there for me. 
Page 22/32
I can't do this. 
It's over. 
- No. Please. 
Please don't say that. 
I know, I've been selfish. 
But I can do better. I can change. 
- It's not that simple. 
We love each other! I love you! 
And we have problems. When people have problems, they work it out. They talk to each other. 
Look, you see? 
You know what this is? 
You know what I want for us? 
- There's someone else. 
I've fallen in love with someone else. 
She says that she's lonely, 
and that I'm not there for her. 
There's another guy. 
How are you holding up? 
Not good. 
Harry, I was going to propose to her. 
Really? 
She's been going through a tough time lately. 
Career. 
I mean, a singing waitress at a jazz club-- 
that's not exactly what she had in mind for herself. A singing waitress? What are you talking about? 
She was fired from the show. 
Didn't she tell you? 
She was fired? 
She was fired and she told you? 
She didn't tell me? 
That's why I asked you here, Pete. 
I'm the other guy. 
What? 
Look, she came to me one afternoon, troubled. 
She needed someone, and I was there for her. 
I've always loved her, Pete. 
You know that. 
It just... 
started. 
I don't believe this. 
I don't believe you. 
I'm really sorry. 
Page 23/32
I just thought you should know. 
Can I warm you up? 
Yes, please. 
How's the pie? 
So good. 
Would you like a drink? 
I'm sorry. 
What was I thinking? Bad for the public image, right, Mr Key-to-the-city? What did you do to her? 
I did what you failed to do. 
I was there for her. 
Mary Jane and I, we understand each other. 
She doesn't know what you are. 
Peter. She knows me very well. 
And when she kissed me, 
it was just like she used to kiss me. 
That taste. 
Strawberries. 
How d'ya like that, Spidey? 
That all you got? 
Stinks, doesn't it? 
I protected you in high school. Now I'm gonna kick your little ass. You gonna kill me like you killed my father? 
I'm done trying to convince you. 
You took him from me. 
He loved me. 
No: 
he despised you. 
You were an embarrassment for him. 
Look at that little Goblin junior. 
Gonna cry? 
"THIEF! Spider-Man shows his true colors" 
- Spider-Man used to make me feel safe. 
Now I'm afraid to walk home from work. 
My son thought the world of this guy. 
I have a 9 year old daughter, loves Spider-Man. 
Who's she supposed to look up to now? 
This is the guy they gave the key to the city to? 
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye. 
Cheers! New staff photographer! 
- I just got lucky. 
This is so wonderful for you. 
Well, you might wanna tell JJ to make a little more wall space. Page 24/32
Good morning. 
- It's a beautiful day, huh? 
What was it you said, I'll never get that picture? There's your hero. 
I never thought he'd really do that. 
See? Right there, 
you made a judgment call. 
You gotta see it as it is. 
It's funny you should say that, 
'cause I was looking through some old photos, and looks very, uh-- similar. 
OK-- Well, I gotta get back to work. 
You're trash, Brock. 
Excuse me? 
Your picture is a fake. 
Parker, you are such a boy scout. 
When are you gonna give a guy a break? 
You want forgiveness? 
Get religion. 
What's going on here? 
- Are you guys all right? 
Yeah, no, we're just horsin' around. 
Look, I'm begging you. If you do this, 
I will lose everything. 
There's not a paper in town that will hire me. 
You should've thought of that earlier. 
What are you doing, Peter? 
Show this to the editor. Tell him to check his source next time. It's a fake! 
Empire State Photographic Department confirms it. Pack your things. Get out of my building. 
I was just... 
- You're fired! 
You know we're gonna have to print a retraction now. Haven't printed a retraction in 20 years! 
"SORRY SPIDEY 
Bugle drops charges" 
Shalom? 
- Mr Parker? 
Dr Connors here. 
- Oh, Dr Connors! 
How are you? 
Quite a specimen you left me, Parker. 
Its chemistry is not unlike the meteorites of the 70s. Page 25/32
Thanks. It's good. 
You know what, Parker? 
Parker? 
Give me some milk. 
It amplifies characteristics of its host. 
Hey, give me another cookie. 
Specially aggression. 
This can be dangerous. 
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you? 
You got any with nuts? 
Um-- I have some nuts, I could make some. 
Go make me some. 
Peter? 
- No, no. Of course not. 
Your shots are so good. 
I'd love to shoot you sometime. 
Peter Parker! Peter... 
Parker! 
Miss Brent, that's not the position I hired you for! Black suit Spider-Man! 
Peter, these are incredible! 
We gotta have these, Jonah. 
I'll pay you the usual rate. 
If you want the shots, I'll take the staff job. Double the money. You are really gonna dig this joint. 
Do you think I'm dressed all right? 
Too fancy or... 
You're looking fine, babe. 
Thank you. 
Love that little giggle. 
Oh, this is so cool! 
I have never been to a jazz club before. 
I hope we can get a table. 
Find us some shade. 
Thanks, . 
Right this way, sir. 
"RESERVED" 
Thank you. 
I'm so loving this. 
- Oh, me too. 
Isn't that your old girlfriend? 
Yeah. 
Do you want to go someplace else? 
No, no. I'll be OK. 
Page 26/32
Mary Jane, show us what you got. 
I'll be right back. 
- Right. 
Peter? 
This is for you. 
Double time! 
Thanks. 
Now dig all this. 
That was all for her? 
I'm so sorry. 
You all right, Mary Jane? 
I'm fine. 
- OK. 
Hey. 
What's wrong with you? 
You. 
Can I help you, sir? 
No. 
- Is everything OK here, Paul? 
Yeah, is everything OK here, Paul? 
Take him out of here. 
- Let's go, sir. 
Take your hand offa me. Now. 
Peter, stop! 
Who are you? 
I don't know. 
It's Brock, Sir. 
Edward Brock junior. 
I come before you today 
humbled 
and humiliated 
to ask you for one thing. 
I want you to kill Peter Parker. 
Parker? 
Hi, Peter. 
- Hi. 
You don't seem to have changed the room around very much. Of course, there's not much you can do, 
is there? 
When we spoke on the phone, 
I sensed something was bothering you, 
so I thought I'd just come by. 
How's Mary Jane? 
I don't know. 
Page 27/32
I never heard from you. 
Did you ever propose? 
You said 
a husband's gotta put a wife before himself. 
I'm not ready. 
But what happened? 
You seemed so sure. 
Yeah. I... 
I heard her, aunt May. 
I don't know what to do. 
You start by doing the hardest thing. 
You forgive yourself. 
I believe in you, Peter. 
You're a good person. 
And I know you will find a way to put it right. 
In time. 
I don't like Spider-Man. 
I want him dead too, Flint. 
That's why I've been looking for you. 
Oh yeah. I know all about you. 
Like the fact that Spider-Man 
won't let you help your poor daughter. 
It's just-- It doesn't seem right to me. 
Look. 
I wanna kill the Spider. 
You wanna kill the Spider. 
Together, he doesn't stand a chance. 
Interested? 
Yeah. 
So-- 
where to? 
"BREAKING NEWS: City in crisis" 
- All New York is holding its breath 
as a hostage crisis continues to unfold. 
Just thirty minutes ago, police came across this startling sight: A young woman held hostage in a taxi 
suspended 80 storeys above the ground 
in what appears to be a giant web. 
Every attempt by the police to rescue the hostage 
has been flaunted by the Sandman. 
Compounding the danger is the appearance of a strange black-suited figure. Early reports had believed him 
to be the black-suited Spider-Man. But he is now been identified as something entirely different. 
Page 28/32
The hostage has been identified 
as Mary Jane Watson, 
an actrice recently seen in a brief stint on Broadway. 
We're now going to take you live to the scene with Jennifer Dugan. Jennifer? 
- We're only about 100 feet away now, Hal, and-- 
Wait. There seems to be some kind of activity in the web. It seems to be creating some kind of gigantic lettering. "SPIDER-MAN, STOP US IF YOU CAN" 
Apparently, Spider-Man is being challenged to some sort of confrontation. And that raises serious questions about what kind of chance he'd stand against such overwhelming... 
Harry. 
I need your help. 
Can't take them both. Not by myself. 
You don't deserve my help. 
Harry, 
she needs us. 
Get out. 
If I may, Sir. 
I've seen things in this house 
I've never spoken of. 
What are you trying to tell me? 
The night your father died 
I cleaned his wound. 
The blade that pierced his body 
came from his glider. 
I know 
you're trying to defend your father's honor, 
but there's no question 
that he died by his own hand. 
I loved your father. 
As I have loved you, Harry. 
As your friends love you. 
Look! 
He seems to have come out of nowhere to answer the prayers of the city, just when all hope seemed to be lost. 
Peter? 
They're gonna kill us both. 
I'm gonna get you out of this. 
Watch out! 
Hey, Parker. 
My God. Eddie? 
Oh, my spider-sense is tickling. 
Page 29/32
If you know what I'm talking about. 
We can find a way to settle this. 
You're so right. 
I'm thinking-- humiliation. 
Kinda like you humiliated me. 
Do you remember? 
Do you remember what you did to me? 
You made me lose my girl. 
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours. 
How's that sound, tiger? 
Hold on, Mary Jane! 
Mary Jane. 
It's hard to believe what's happening. 
The brutality of it. 
I don't know how he can take any more. 
This can be a tragic day 
for the people of New York. 
It could be the end of Spider-Man. 
Awesome! 
- Wicked cool! 
You came. 
Looks like just in the nick of time. 
A couple of minutes ago wouldn't have been so bad either. What're you gonna do. 
I'm needing some help over here. 
I'm a little busy right now. 
Give me your hand! 
Parker! 
Parker, where... 
I need a photographer! 
Hey, kid. You want a job? 
Why would I want a job? 
I'm just a kid. 
All right, how much for the camera? 
One hundred bucks. 
- A hundred bucks? 
All right, you little prick. Here. 
Film's extra. 
Gotcha. 
Pete, watch out! 
You still got any more? 
- Hang on! 
To what? 
Go, buddy! 
Page 30/32
- Got her! 
You OK? 
Yeah. 
Good. 
Hey, Pete. 
Am I interrupting? 
Never wound 
what you can't kill. 
Eddie-- this suit-- you gotta take it off! Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? 
I know what it feels like. 
It feels good. 
The power. Everything. 
But you'll lose yourself. 
Let it go. 
I like being bad. 
It makes me happy. 
Harry! 
Peter, what are you doing? 
No! 
Eddie! 
Harry? 
- Mary Jane. 
I'm going to get help. 
Stay. 
I didn't want this. 
But I had no choice. 
We always have a choice. 
You had a choice when you killed my uncle. My daughter was dying. 
I needed money. 
I was scared. 
I told your uncle all I wanted was the car. What is it? 
- I need your car. 
He said to me: 
"Why don't you just put down the gun and go home?" I realize now he was just trying to help me. Then I saw my partner running over with the cash, and the gun was in my hand. 
Did a terrible thing to you. 
I spent a lot of nights wishing I could take it back. I'm not asking you to forgive me. 
Page 31/32
I just want you to understand. 
I've done terrible things too. 
You didn't choose to be this. 
The only thing left to me now 
is my daughter. 
I forgive you. 
Hey, pal. How are you doing? 
Been better. 
We'll get you through this. 
No. 
You should never forgive... 
...said those things. 
None of that matters, Peter. 
You're my friend. 
Best friend. 
Whatever comes our way. 
Whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice. My friend Harry taught me that. 
He chose to be the best of himself. 
It's the choices that make us who we are, 
and we can always choose to do what's right. 
I'm through with love 
I'll never fall again 
Said adieu to love 
Don't ever call again 
For I must have you 
Or no one 
And so I'm through with love 
I've locked my heart 
I'll keep my feelings there 
I have stocked my heart 
With icy frigid air 
And I mean to care 
For no one...

    MOTION -- flat out -- it's us -- we're running -- stumbling
    -- breathing rushed -- blood in the snow...


    We are JASON BOURNE and we're running down an alley...


    Supered below:   MOSCOW


    BLUE LIGHTS -- from the distance -- strobing through the
    night -- rushing toward us -- POLICE CARS -- three of them -
    - SIRENS HOWLING as they bear down -- closer -- faster --
    until they whip past the alley...


    Up against the wall -- BOURNE is hidden in the shadows.


    BOURNE is badly wounded -- shot through the shoulder --
    bruises and broken bones from the final car chase in
    SUPREMACY...


    With a GROAN, he lifts himself up, staggers across a park
    toward a PHARMACY...

    goes off...


    MACRO ON -- MEDICINE BOTTLE


    VICODIN, as BOURNE grabs it...Then PENICILLIN...


    Then SURGICAL SUPPLIES:


    Scalpel...Forceps...Sutures...Cotton gauze...Betadine...


    BOURNE finds a large sink...Rests his gun there...Lays out
    SURGICAL SUPPLIES...Checks out his back in the
    mirror...Opens the capsules of penicillin and pours the
    powder directly into the wound...Begins treating himself...




5   EXT. NIGHT. PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                                5


    A POLICE CAR pulls up to the curb, lights flashing. One
    POLICEMAN goes to the jimmied DOOR. SECOND POLICEMAN sees
    blood and footprints. He motions to his partner to
    follow...




6   INT. NIGHT. PHARMACY BATHROOM -- MOSCOW                       6


    BOURNE finishing up -- splashes water on his face -- he
    seems a man on a mission. He looks up --


                                                                 2

                   You'll be saving American lives.


       A black sack is thrown over Bourne's head, then:


       (STOCK) A torrent of quick shots of Bourne's kills: the
       Professor, Jarda, the blonde guy in Paris, Mr. And Mrs.
       Neski...


       And finally. BANG -- Marie hit in the head.      The car off
       the bridge. She sinks away dead...




6A     INT.   NIGHT   PHARMACY -- MOSCOW                              6A


       The POLICE enter the back room, guns drawn.


                             POLICEMAN #1
                   Put your hands on your head and
                   turn around slowly!


       BOURNE snaps out of it, doesn't move. POLICEMAN #1 (older)
       approaches him. When BOURNE doesn't respond to his
       questions, the POLICEMAN starts forward. BOURNE turns and
       in one motion grabs his gun from the sink and disables the
       POLICEMAN.


       BOURNE freezes POLICEMAN #2 with his gun and a look.


                             BOURNE
                        (in Russian)
                   Give me your gun and radio.


       POLICEMAN #2's gun and radio skittle across the floor.

                 My argument is not with you.


     BOURNE smashes the radio and takes the gun.


     BOURNE exits...

8C   INT. CIA -- DAY                                              8C


     A workman installs a nameplate that reads:    Ezra Kramer,
     Director, CIA.




8C   INT. KRAMER'S OFFICE -- DAY                                  8C


     Kramer listens to a recording with Landy and Cronin. There
     are unhung pictures and a few other items that indicate he
     has just moved into this job.


                                                          4




Two other senior CIA officials sit in on the meeting.
Kramer looks at a file on Bourne and Abbott.


                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          So we got in the way?   Is that
          why Neski died? Is that why you
          killed Marie?


Kramer glances at a photo of Marie in the file.


                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          You killed Marie the minute you
          climbed into her car.   The
          minute you entered her life she
          was dead!


Kramer looks at Abbott's official photo.


                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          I told you people to leave me
          alone! I fell off the grid. I
          was half way around the world.


                    ABBOTT (V.O.)
          There's no place it won't catch
          up to you. It's how every story
          ends. It's what you are, Jason.
          A killer! You always will be.


THUMP!


                    CRONIN
          We think that's Bourne hitting
          him on the head and then--


He makes a gun with his hand, i.e. Bourne putting his gun
to Abbott's head.


                       ABBOTT (V.O.)
          Go ahead!     Go on! Do it!


                    BOURNE (V.O.)
          She wouldn't want me to. That's
          the only reason your alive.


The tape clicks off.


                    KRAMER
          Who's "she?"


CRONIN puts a picture of MARIE in front of KRAMER.


                    LANDY
          His girlfriend, Marie. She was
          killed in India three weeks ago.


Kramer looks down at another image.     Abbott dead after his
suicide.


                                                        5




                    KRAMER
          A dirty section chief in league
          with a corrupt Russian
          Billionaire commits suicide when
          confronted by Jason Bourne. You
          couldn't make this stuff up.
              (holds up the photo of
               Abbot dead)
          You watched this happen?


Landy nods.   Kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole
situation.


                    KRAMER
          Bourne's last confirmed location
          is Moscow, three days ago?


                       LANDY
          Right.


                    KRAMER
          So what does he do now?


                    LANDY
          I think he's looking for
          something he hasn't found.


                       KRAMER
          Like what?     What's he after?


                     LANDY
          I'm not sure. Maybe he hasn't
          gotten his memory back yet.  Not
          all of it.


A look from Kramer...


                    KRAMER
          Pam, what I need to know is, what
          kind of a threat is he to us?


                    LANDY
          If he just wanted to hurt us he
          could have sent this tape to CNN.


                    KRAMER
          Maybe he still will. Maybe he
          gave it to you because he wants
          to throw you in the opposite
          direction of his real plan. I
          don't know. I just know my
          number one rule is "the only way
          to stay safe is to assume the
          worst."   As far as I'm concerned
          Bourne is a serious threat until
          proven otherwise.

                                                          7




A WORK TABLE, covered with sheet music, music paper,
pencils. And, sitting on the upright piano against the
wall, a framed PHOTO of MARIE...


A KNOCK on a door beautifully, heavily lacquered with
centuries of paint...


MARTIN KREUTZ, late 20s, opens the door and finds BOURNE. A
long look between them -- like two lost brothers who
recognize each other -- each has been waiting for this
moment for a long time.




INT. CONTINUOUS. MARTIN'S APARTMENT


Martin looks out the window.


                    MARTIN
          Where is my sister?


                    BOURNE
          She's dead. She was killed.


                    MARTIN
          I knew it was going to end this
          way. It was always going to end
          this way...


                    BOURNE
          I didn't believe that.


                    MARTIN
          Why did she die?


                    BOURNE
          She was shot. A man came for me.


                    MARTIN
          And then you killed him.


Bourne nods.


                      MARTIN
          Now what?


                    BOURNE
          Someone started all this...and
          I'm going to find them.


Bourne looks at him for a beat and leaves.




EXT. SUBWAY -- DAY


Bourne climbs the stairs.


Bourne rounds a corner and stops, sees a bodyguard at a
door up the street hail a car then go back inside.


                                                            8




     Bourne walks up to the door, the bodyguard comes out again.
     Bourne knocks him aside. Grabs the man behind him,
     ELLATRACHE.


                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Who started Treadstone?


     The bodyguard comes back, gun out--


                           ELLATRACHE
                    (in French, to
                      bodyguard)
                It's OK!
                    (in French, to Bourne)
                They're still looking for you.
                You are taking a big risk coming
                here.


     Bourne shoves him against the wall, hard.


                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                Just tell me what I want to know!


                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                I just provided them weapons.    I
                don't know who started--


                          BOURNE
                    (in French)
                You know something.   Tell me
                where to start looking.


                          ELLATRACHE
                    (in French)
                There's a journalist in London.
                Simon Ross. He seems to know a
                lot about you.   He has a source
                inside the program. Someone
                there from the beginning. What
                should I tell them if they
                contact me?


                          BOURNE
                    (in English)
                They give me the name I want, or
                I burn their entire house down to
                get it.

                               WILLS
                    We tracked the phone. Registered
                    to a London reporter named Simon
                    Ross. He works at the Guardian

                          VOSEN
                You tracking him?


      As they pass through, colleague hands WILLS a file.


                          WILLS
                Yeah, thanks Mike. We have a
                survey team covering him at
                work...and a sneak and peek's on
                their way to his apartment.


                          VOSEN
                Well, who talked to him? How did
                he find out about Blackbriar?


                          WILLS
                We don't know, we pulled his
                background and ran a cross check
                on any known anomalies, but we've
                come up with nothing. But, I
                think if we follow Ross, we are
                going to be able...


                         VOSEN

                  all his phones, his blackberry,
                  his apartment, his car, bank
                  accounts, credit cards, travel
                  patterns...I want to know what
                  he's going to think before he
                  does. Every dirty little secret
                  he has. And most of all, we want
                  the name and real time location
                  of his source.

      BOURNE reads The Guardian. He sees an article written by
      Simon Ross.   Title: "RENEGADE ASSASSIN LOSE IN EUROPE".
      It mentions BOURNE. There is a photo of Marie--

      BOURNE brushes past him and PUTS THE PHONE IN HIS POCKET..


      ROSS feels the contact. Checking himself -- he's okay.
      But now a phone is ringing -- looks around, must be someone
      else.


      But the vibration's coming from his jacket pocket.


      ROSS takes out the phone -- not his -- puzzled.


      ROSS hits "answer."

                    No, no, look...Ross is not on the
                    bus.   Split up the team -- get
                    the guy on the bus and send
                    someone to stay on Ross.

      One AGENT peeling off, to keep ROSS in check.


      The other two AGENTS racing to the bus as it pulls away
      from the lights. Kicking the doors open, leaping on.


      GUNS drawn.     So quick.   Passengers screaming.


                              AGENT ONE
                        (to Hoody)
                    You. On the floor. Down.


      Pushing the HOODY to the floor.

                    Driver, stop the bus!

      SURVEY ONE moving up the steps, only to meet-


      BOURNE coming down. Three quick moves and he's down-
      slumped against a wall- just another drunk to step over in
      the rush hour.


      Pulls the feed. Takes the earbud. Then back up and falls
      into step behind ROSS.


      Listening in to the chaos he has caused -- an ocean away.

      Bourne stops Ross, surprising him.


                          BOURNE
                Why do you know so much about me?


                           ROSS
                What?


                          BOURNE
                The article. You talked to
                someone from Treadstone. Someone
                there at the beginning.  What's
                his name?


                          ROSS
                I can't tell you that.... Who's
                following me?


                          BOURNE
                Whoever they are it's trouble.


                          ROSS
                Are they Blackbriar?


                          BOURNE
                Blackbriar, what's Blackbriar?


                          ROSS
                I don't know. I heard the name
                this morning for the first time.
                Whatever it is, my source said it
                started with you.


                                                                22




                          BOURNE
                 What? What are you talking
                 about?


                           ROSS
                 Look, just help me get away from
                 these people...and we can talk
                 more...we can--


                           BOURNE
                     (spotting approaching
                      operatives)
                 We have to move.


       Bourne moves Ross toward the concourse.

       CAMERAS suddenly alive.   Movement across the footbridge.


       The net's been thrown.




91     INT. CONTINUOUS. CONCOURSE -- WATERLOO                        91


       Into the station concourse.


       ROSS moving fast. Fighting through the crowds of faces.
       Each one a killer in ROSS' tormented mind.


       BOURNE on the periphery looking out across the throng,
       picking out the inconsistencies.


                                                              23




      One AGENT, then another approaching.


      He dials.


                             BOURNE (O.C.)
                  Three o'clock. Female. Blonde
                  black top.


                            ROSS
                  Has she seen me?


                            BOURNE
                  Not yet. Dip left past the photo
                  kiosk.


      ROSS spinning round. Dipping left.   BLACK TOP passing in
      the background missing him.


      BOURNE crossing close behind - marshalling the pieces at
      breakneck speed.


                            BOURNE (CONT'D)
                  Straight ahead. News kiosk.


      ROSS turning.   Weaving through the commuters.


      BOURNE seeing cameras turn.    ROSS heading into their path.


                            BOURNE (CONT'D)
                  Change of plan. Stop. Tie your
                  shoelace.


      BOURNE seeing ROSS dip out of view as a group of TOURISTS
      block the CCTV's line of sight.




64H   INT. DAY. CRI HUB                                            64H


      That same scene -- scores of TOURISTS -- from VOSEN's point
      of view. The TECHS try to get another angle...




94    EXT. DAY. CONCOURSE -- WATERLOO                                94


      ROSS looking through the sea of legs as he finishes tying
      his laces. Cameras sweeping past.


                            ROSS
                  Are we clear?


                            BOURNE
                  Clear. News kiosk. Straight
                  ahead.


      ROSS on the move. Sweating. Paranoid.


      Seeing a BIN MAN coming toward him -- reaching into his
      trolley.


                                                              24




                          ROSS
                Straight toward me.     Bin man?


                            BOURNE
                Negative.


                          ROSS
                He's got a gun.


                            BOURNE
                Negative.    Keep straight ahead.


      But ROSS swerves out of his path as the BIN MAN pulls out --
      a bunch of keys.


      CCTV CAMERAS turn -- ZOOMING IN ON ROSS.

                We're losing him! We cannot
                afford to lose him!


      Frenzied teching as they capture and transmit an image of

                          BOURNE
                Get into cover. Now!

                Get him out of there and have the

                Target moving towards the stores.


                          ANOTHER VOICE

      ROSS moving through crowds around the departures board.


      BOURNE hearing that last exchange in his earpiece too.
      Asset in play?


                          BOURNE
                Keep moving...


      BOURNE's POV: AGENTS closing the box. The departures board.
      Platform 7. A train waiting.


                             BOURNE (CONT'D)
                Faster....


      Commuters waiting for the platform


                          BOURNE (CONT'D)
                The front...

       Suddenly -- CLICK -- PLATFORM 7 displays.


       A wave of commuters flooding away -- sweeping the AGENTS
       back with them towards platform 7.


                           BOURNE (CONT'D)
                 GET IN THE STORE.


       BOURNE'S bought them thirty seconds.

       Towards a ladder.

                 He's in the store -- still moving
                 east.


       ROSS out into the open again. In front of him another STORE
       COMPLEX.


                           BOURNE
                 INSIDE!


       BOURNE searching the concourse. Something bothering him.
       The threat level clicking another notch.




102A/B INT. MAINTENANCE AREA-- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY           102A/B


       PAZ heads up some stairs to a service platform.

101    EXT. CONCOURSE -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY                          101


       ROSS into the store complex. To one side is a service
       doorway.


       BOURNE sees the AGENTS approaching. Looks the other way --
       up at the hoardings above.


       Something's not right. Treadstone instinct.


                           BOURNE
                 Service doorway -- Now!


                                                                27




64H    INT. NEW YORK HUB -- SIMULTANEOUS -- DAY                      64H


       An image of Ross as he enters the store complex appears on
       the screen.


                            TECHY 2
                 Store.   Three means of egress.


                           VOSEN
                 Close him down...




105    INT. STORE COMPLEX -- SIMULTANEOUSLY -- DAY                   105


       ROSS through narrow store corridors. Sheer panic now.
       Two of the AGENTS move in after him.


       BOURNE behind them.


       BANG - takes the first out silently.


                           BOURNE
                 Keep moving.


       ROSS moving out to the light as another AGENT follows.


                           BOURNE (CONT'D)
                 Through the store room.


       ROSS travelling through.   The second AGENT right behind as-


       BOURNE steps out from behind the store room door. The dull
       snap of bones as second AGENT falls to the floor.




64H    INT. DAY -- CRI HUB                                           64H


       On a screen VOSEN watches, transfixed, as BOURNE takes out
       all his agents and then grabs ROBB...


                           VOSEN
                 Jesus Christ, that's Jason
                 Bourne.


                           WILLS
                 Maybe he's the source?


                           VOSEN
                 It doesn't matter, the asset now
                 has 2 targets. Take them both
                 out.


       WILLS taps in the order...




102B   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA-- DAY                               102B


       PAZ moves cross a narrow walkway.


                                                                28




       Now he's behind a mechanical 'tri-panel' hoarding. The kind
       that displays a different advert every 15 seconds. He waits
       for the change and then---


       -- A huge field of vision across the concourse stretching
       out down below him- a sniper's heaven.


       PAZ pulling open the motor-casing from the side panel, goes
       to work on it.


       Slowing the rotation. Rearranging the large triangular
       prisms to give him just the right time-gap to pull the
       trigger- and just enough cover to disappear.


       He takes out rifle parts from his rucksack. Starts to
       assemble them.




102C   INT. BEHIND THRESHERS (BEHIND THE SILVER METAL DOOR)        102C


                              BOURNE
                    I'm going to get you to safety
                    but you have to stay calm do
                    exactly what I say.


                              ROSS
                        (fear-induced autopilot)
                    Sure, okay.


                              BOURNE
                    No, listen to me: Exactly what I
                    say this time. Understand?


       Ross snaps to focus.     Looks Bourne in the eye.


                              ROSS
                    Yes.


                              BOURNE
                    Stay here while I look for an
                    escape.


       Ross nods.

       PAZ puts together the rifle.




103    INT. WATERLOO STATION                                         103


       BOURNE exits from the silver door behind Threshers.    He
       stays on the phone with Ross.


       Hidden from the view of the CCTV cameras by the thick
       crowd, Bourne sees the approaching agents abruptly pulling
       back.


                                                                     29




                            ROSS (PHONE V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  I can see the entrance from here
                  I can make it out--


                            BOURNE
                  No, stay behind that door.

      CCTV view of the silver door behind Threshers that ROSS is
      behind (not Bourne). Wills is on phone.


                            WILLS
                  There. That silver door.
                  Bourne's behind that door?


                               TECH
                  Confirmed.


                            WILLS
                  Okay, pull the agents back and
                  give Bourne's location to the
                  asset.




107   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                               107


      On his cell phone Paz receives a text indicating Bourne's
      location. Paz finds the silver door and aims his rifle at
      it.


      SCOPE POV


      A shape barely visible moving behind the window.           (It's
      Ross but Paz and the Hub think it's Bourne.




111   INT. BEHIND THRESHERS /         WATERLOO CONCOURSE-- DAY            111


      INTERCUTTING BETWEEN ROSS AND BOURNE:


      Bourne spots the agents pulling back per Wills' orders.


                            ROSS (INTO PHONE)
                  If I run now I can make it--


                             BOURNE (INTO PHONE
                  No.   Something's not right.




107   INT. MAINTENANCE AREA                                               107


      Paz awaiting his shot--

       SCOPE POV


       The door comes open slightly, but from this angle Paz
       doesn't have a clean shot at his target (who he thinks is
       Bourne).




111    INT. CONCOURSE -- WATERLOO                                   111


       Bourne searches the rafters, looking for any threats from
       above.


                             ROSS (TEL. V.O.)
                   I'm going to go for it, okay?


                             BOURNE
                   Don't move until I tell you.


       Bourne is distracted by the last of the agents
       disappearing. Something is definitely wrong--


                             ROSS
                   I'm going to go for it.


                             BOURNE
                   No, No not now.


       Ross suddenly sprints out from behind the door--

       Paz sees the shape emerge--

       PAZ fires--




111    INT. WATERLOO -- SERIES OF ANGLES                            111


       But it's Ross, not Bourne. Ross is hit by Paz's shot.    He
       falls, inches from the silver door, dead. Blood has
       splattered on the door.




110A   INT. PAZ'S NEST                                          110A


       Paz snaps his head back to the scope, realizing he's shot
       the wrong person. Then he catches a glimpse of Bourne--


       Bourne ducks behind the gathering crowd, out of Paz's line
       of sight, and goes to the body.


                                                              31

       Vosen and Wills stare at the screen. At the image of Ross,
       dead on the concourse.   The room -- normally full of
       chatter has gone dead silent...


       Vosen puts his head in his hands. This is a monumental
       screw up and everyone here knows it.  He just had the
       wrong man killed....


                            VOSEN
                  Oh...shit...


       Then suddenly Vosen snaps back to focus:


                            VOSEN (CONT'D)
                  Get the asset out of there ...


                            WILLS
                  What about Bourne?


       On the HUB MONITORS we see Police moving in... Vosen
       doesn't need to see anymore.


                            VOSEN
                  Get him out of there - NOW!




111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111


       Bourne feels Ross' body for something.

       Paz is frustrated by the order. He's itching to get another
       shot off at Bourne, but after a beat, packs up quickly, as
       ordered.




111    INT. WATERLOO -- DAY                                        111

       On the screens and in real life, the aftermath of the hit.
       PARAMEDICS try helplessly to deal with ROSS -- killed
       instantly by the head shot meant for BOURNE...POLICE arrive
       and seal off the crime scene...

       BOURNE on the move. Fast --


       Past platforms. On his way up to the Tri Panel.


       Up stairs. On to a walkway.   To his right he sees a figure
       disappearing...


       PAZ.


       BOURNE hammers down the walk - way in pursuit.




114    EXT. PLATFORM AREA -- DAY                                     114


       BOURNE tailing PAZ down on to a parallel platform. PAZ
       dipping down into the underground entrance.




115/116 INT. TUBE STATION -- WATERLOO -- DAY                 115/116


       PAZ moving deliberately through the evening rush hour--
       blending in...


       BOURNE in pursuit. Chasing on instinct.


       There...A glimpse of PAZ at the bottom of an escalator.


       BOURNE fights past people.


       PAZ disappears into the crowd.


       BOURNE rushes to catch him. Rounding a corner...


       A long walkway -- at the end, two staircases lead to
       different tube lines. BOURNE hesitates-- measures the
       choice.


       The sound of a train fills the station--


       BOURNE -- Fast downstairs.


       Watches-- just as PAZ gets onto the car at another door.


       BOURNE lunges to get on the train...But the doors close...


       BOURNE'S POV


       Watching PAZ from the platform as he SAGS down onto a seat,
       nauseated, his skin clammy, his head pounding...He takes
       out the PILLS and dry-swallows them...Looks up...


       CLOSE ON -- BOURNE


       Watching PAZ...As if he's looking in the MIRROR at his old
       self...The self before THE BOURNE IDENTITY...


                                                                33




       CLOSE ON -- PAZ


       He looks straight ahead, just another commuter...


       BACK ON -- BOURNE


       Watching PAZ, as the train pulls away...Then BOURNE is
       immediately in motion...

                   It's Vosen. We have a situation.

       DANIELS watches news of ROSS murder on TV. DANIELS panics,
       opens his safe, packs up papers, takes Blackbriar FILE.
       Sets alarm. Leaves.




120C   EXT. NIGHT. INTERNET CAFE -- LONDON.                      120C


       BOURNE sits at a computer, the ROSS notebook open in front
       of him. He pages through it, finding names, places, "HOW
       DID THIS ALL START?" -- and Blackbriar.   He Googles
       "Sewell and Marbury"-- finds Paris, Berlin, Madrid. BOURNE
       continues to search and finds receipt from Madrid.


       BOURNE leaves.

123A   INT. DAY.   POSH HOTEL -- NEW YORK CITY                   123A


       Vosen's sitting.


                             VOSEN
                       (to waiter)
                   Sparkling. And a "Heart-Healthy"
                   omelet with goat cheese and
                   peppers.


       Landy arrives.


                                                     34




                    VOSEN
          You're late. Traffic?


                    WAITER
              (handing her the menu)
          Ma'am?


                    LANDY
          Nothing for me.


Vosen looks at her, surprised.


                    VOSEN
          I'm buying.


She shakes her head, no. She sits, without taking her coat
off. She's not staying long.


                    VOSEN
          When the Director called, it was
          suggested we bring you on--


                     LANDY
          Suggested?
              (beat)
          Are you sure it was just a
          suggestion?


                    VOSEN
          Funny how different things look
          depending on where you sit. I
          look at this as doing a favor for
          you. Giving you an opportunity
          to complete some unfinished
          business.


                     LANDY
          Meaning?


                    VOSEN
          Jason Bourne.


                    LANDY
          Bourne's finished.


                     VOSEN
          Really?


                    LANDY
          It was finished the moment I
          realized I was chasing him for
          something he didn't do.   The
          case is closed.


                                              35




                     VOSEN
          So what do you make of this?
              (handing her
               surveillance photos of
               Bourne in Paris)
          French intel picked up Bourne
          meeting Pierre Elattrache on
          Tuesday. He threatened to burn
          our house down if you didn't tell
          him who started Treadstone.
          That's a big problem, wouldn't
          you agree?


                    LANDY
          This doesn't feel like Bourne to
          me.


                    VOSEN
          Why's it so hard for you to
          believe?


                     LANDY
          Probably because it's coming from
          you, Noah.


                    VOSEN
          Lets try and be adults okay? We
          all thought he was done, off the
          grid. But Bourne's back. Maybe
          he's a threat. We both want the
          same thing here.


                    LANDY
          So what happened at Waterloo?


                    VOSEN
          We have a leak. Bourne showed up
          in our surveillance. We had very
          little time to react.


                    LANDY
          And the reporter ended up dead?


                    VOSEN
          Bourne saw us coming.


Landy looks at him, suspicious.


                    LANDY
          So what was he doing?


                    VOSEN?
          We don't know. But just the fact
          that he was there means he's up
          to something, don't you think?
          Maybe he's the source?


                                                                  36




                               LANDY
                     The real question is how you
                     managed to get in a fire fight in
                     the middle of a public train
                     station.


                               VOSEN
                     Don't second guess an operation
                     from an armchair, Pam. It's not
                     fair.


                               LANDY
                     I'm going to the office now.
                     I'll make my own introductions.


       Off VOSEN...

                     gonna be quarterbacking our

                     let's go around the room, say who

       LANDY stepping in before this gets going --

125B   EXT. DAY.   SEWELL AND MARBURY -- MADRID                125B


       Bourne arrives, begins to recon the area.


       He goes to the front door finds "Sewell and Marbury" and
       rings the bell. No answer. Two cops come around a corner.


       Bourne sees them, notes the side of the building and
       leaves.

125E   INT. DAY.   CRI HUB -- NEW YORK CITY             125E


                              TECH#1
                   Sir, we just hacked Ross's email
                   account at the Guardian and found
                   a round trip ticket to Turin,
                   yesterday. 0800 arrival, 12:05
                   departure.


                             LANDY
                   I think we can be pretty certain
                   that Bourne's not your source
                   then?


                             VOSEN
                   How?


                             LANDY
                   Ross's call to his editor, where
                   he said he just met the source on
                   Blackbriar, took place just after
                   his flight landed. His met his
                   source in Turin.


                             VOSEN
                   So?


                             LANDY
                   So, what, Bourne met Ross for
                   breakfast and then, at noon the
                   same day Bourne calls Ross to
                   demand a meet at Waterloo?


                             CRONIN
                       (Needling Wills)
                   Maybe they were even on the same
                   flight?


                             VOSEN
                   Cross check the secure cell phone
                   usage of everyone with Blackbriar
                   SCI clearance against all calls
                   in and out of Turin during the
                   morning Ross was there


       TECHNICIANS start pounding keyboards.


                             LANDY
                   The guy you're after is a CIA
                   operative with clearance above
                   Top Secret.   He was committing
                   treason by talking to Ross.   Do
                   you really think, while doing
                   that, he used a cell phone he
                   knows we can track?


                             TECH 3 (JIMMY)
                   Zero results on the cross check.


                                                       39




VOSEN stares daggers at her.


                    WILLS
          Do you have a better idea?


                    LANDY
          Yeah, I'd look at all the people
          whose cell phones were switched
          off the entire period Ross was in
          Turin.


                    WILLS
          Do it Jimmy.


TECHNICIANS start tapping.


                    LANDY
              (looks at Cronin)
          I mean if your people use their
          cell phones as much as mine do,
          the list should be pretty small


                    TECHNICIAN 3 JIMMY
          Three names: Tom Brewster, Jack
          Boulin, Neal Daniels.


The names display on the screen:   Tom Brewster, Jack Boulin
Neal Daniels.


The HUB employees can't help but be impressed by LANDY.
WILLS and VOSEN notice their response.


                    LANDY
          Now check everything in Ross's
          apartment against those names.
          Look for common patterns, look
          for -


                    CRONIN
          Initials .....Bring that up on
          main.


LANDY turns.   CRONIN is leaning down in front of a
computer screen.   Point to something for the tech --- who
puts it on the big screen, blown up.


In a set of handwritten notes by ROSS it says "per
N.D."next to several scrawls.


                    LANDY
          Neal Daniels.   He's Station
          Chief in Madrid now, isn't he?


                    WILLS
          Jesus Christ.


                                                                40




                            VOSEN
                  Call the RSO at the Embassy and
                  have them take Daniels into
                  custody if he's there.   If he's
                  not, get a grab team to the
                  Calle Norte safe house. Send
                  them in heavy and tell them we'll
                  assist with entry.


                            LANDY
                  "Heavy?" Daniels isn't--


                            VOSEN
                  I'm worried about Bourne. If he's
                  not Ross's source, then he must
                  be after Ross's source -- just
                  like us.


       Off LANDY...




125F   EXT.   MADRID STREETS -- NIGHT                             125F


       BOURNE in a TAXI turning a corner into a narrow street.
       The rain has slowed, but the streets are still quiet.


       BOURNE gets out and walks past the SEWELL and MARBURY front
       door, picks the lock and gains entry.




126B   INT.   SEWELL AND MARBURY. -- NIGHT                        126B


       BOURNE up the stairs.   Finds the office.    Jimmies the door.
       Disables the alarm.


       All the signs of a hurried exit. A half filled cup of
       coffee -- cigarette burned down in an ashtray but not
       snubbed out -- a light left on -- files and documents, some
       shredded, some not.




127H   INT. HUB                                                   127H


       Vosen paces back and forth. The hub is MUCH quieter than
       it was in the Waterloo scenes.


                            TECH 1. (LUCY)
                  Parque Vasquez is clean. No sign

       HAMMOND at the wheel.   KILEY with the map. Shutting off his

127B   INT.   SEWELL AND MARBURY -- NIGHT                       127B


       BOURNE checks the office.   Soon he finds a photo of
       Daniels with Albert Hirsch.




FB3    EXT. HOSPITAL ANNEX -- OVERCAST DAY -- FLASHBACK            FB3


       Bourne arrives at a nondescript steel door with two CCTV

127B   INT. SEWELL AND MARBURY -- NIGHT                         127B


       The flashback overwhelms Bourne.




FB3A   INT. SRD CORRIDOR -- DAY -- FLASHBACK                    FB3A


       POV shots of Bourne walking down the long corridor with
       Daniels. Other shots revealing that Bourne is in Army dress
       greens (without hat). Daniels knocks and leads Bourne into-

FB3C   INT. TANK ROOM -- FLASHBACK                              FB3C


       Bourne is dragged into a room with a large water tank. His
       hands have been bound behind his back, the sack's
       drawstring pulled tight, and he has been weighted down.
       Bourne is shoved into the water.




FB3D   UNDERWATER SHOT -- FLASHBACK                             FB3D


       Bourne falls into the water. SPLASH. He starts to sink.
       The wet sack allows us to see the outlines of his face.
       Also POVs as Bourne sinks.


                                                                  42




FB3E   SERIES OF SHOTS FROM ABOVE AND BELOW WATER --FLASHBACK      FB3E


       Bourne struggles wildly at first. Tries to get out of his
       restraints. But to no avail. SRD men watch him from the
       edge of the tank. Perhaps also on monitors.
       Expressionless.




FB3F   UNDERWATER SHOT - FLASHBACK                                 FB3F


       Bourne fights every human instinct to draw a breath.    Also
       shot from Bourne's POV:


                           HIRSCH (FILTERED, EERIE)
                 You're going to drown. There is
                 nothing you can do to prevent
                 this. Stop struggling and accept
                 it.




       Finally Bourne can't hold his breath for an instant longer.
       His mouth opens. Water rushes in. He convulses, begins to
       drown...




FB3G   INT. TANK ROOM -- FLASHBACK                                 FB3G


       Bourne's body goes limp.   SRD men watch.   No reaction.




FB3H   UNDERWATER SHOT -- FLASHBACK                                FB3H

       BOURNE comes out of the FLASHBACK. As he staggers across

       background. Suspicious of Vosen...


                                                             45




                              VOSEN
                    How long?
                        (beat, loud, to the
                         entire hub)
                    Stop! Hang on. I have an
                    idea...




136    INT. NIGHT.    MADRID SAFEHOUSE                             136


       ON A SECURITY MONITOR -- BOURNE sees another figure moving
       up the stairs...Checking his watch, reloading his gun.
       Twisting into the path to shoot as the door opens,
       hesitating because-


       It's NICKY.


       A beat -- long unbroken.


                              BOURNE
                    What are you doing here?


                              NICKY
                    I was posted here after Berlin.


                              BOURNE
                    Where's Daniels?


       The office PHONE goes. Bourne waving her to it.   She picks
       it up. He hits the speaker phone.




127H   INT. HUB                                                127H


                              NICKY (V.O.)
                    Hello.


                              VOSEN
                    Who is this?


                              NICKY (V.O.)
                    This is Nicky Parsons. Who's
                    this?


       Landy reacts to her voice...


       Both Vosen and Landy strongly suspect Bourne is there and
       listening...


       Vosen reads her "Duress Challenge" identity check off the
       screen. It reads:


       Challenge:    "Sparrow"


       Response if Under Duress:       "Ruby"


       Response if Normal:    "Everest"


                                                      46




                     VOSEN
          Nicky, I need to do an ID
          challenge first. Code in:
          "Sparrow."


Vosen looks at the screen to check her response...


                    NICKY
          Response: "Everest".


                    VOSEN
          Nicky, this is Noah Vosen. How
          long have you been on site?


                    NICKY (V.O.)
          I just walked in.


                    VOSEN
          We have two officers on site.
          Are you in contact with them?


                    NICKY (V.O.)
          They're down. Unconscious, but
          alive.


                    VOSEN
          Is there any sign of Daniels?


                    NICKY (V.O.)
          No.


                    LANDY
          Nicky, this is Pam Landy. We
          have reason to believe there is a
          connection between Neal Daniels
          and Jason Bourne.


                    NICKY (V.O.)
          Bourne, are you still looking for
          Bourne? I thought the case was
          closed.


                    LANDY
          No, some people are convinced
          he's still a threat. I disagree
          but to find out I need to talk to
          him.


VOSEN seething because LANDY has interrupted him...


                    VOSEN
          Hold on Nicky.


Vosen hits the mute button.


                    VOSEN
          What are you doing? You know
          Bourne's probably listening.


                                                              47




        Landy doesn't answer.    Vosen to Wills:


                             VOSEN
                   How long till back up arrives.


        Wills holds up three fingers.      Vosen unmutes.


                             VOSEN (CONT'D)
                       (into microphone again)
                   Listen, Nicky. I want you to
                   stay put and secure the premises.
                   It could be an hour until another
                   team arrives.


        LANDY piercing VOSEN with a look...




138     INT. SAFEHOUSE - NIGHT                                     138


        BOURNE continues to hold the gun in her face -- NICKY is
        very calm considering the predicament she is in.


                               NICKY
                   Okay.


        DIAL TONE as the line gets closed at the other end.


                             NICKY
                   They know you're here.


                             BOURNE
                   How long do I have?


                             NICKY
                   Three minutes...

                   My car's outside.    I know where
                   Daniels is.


        BOURNE lowers his gun, grabs the phone and dials "1-1-2"


                                                             48

                  your emergency?


       BOURNE answers her in perfect Spanish with a perfect Madrid
       accent, but worked up, like a civilian would be...


                            BOURNE (SUBTITLE)
                  334 Calle Norte. I hear gunfire.
                  And men shouting. I think
                  they're Americans --


       BOURNE pushes the phone off the desk -- fires four shots
       into the ceiling -- calmly moves Nicky towards the back
       door...

                            VOSEN
                  You "disagree" he's a threat? He
                  just took out two more of my men.
                  Not to mention his ultimatum to
                  Ellatrache?


                            LANDY
                  The only way this has a happy
                  ending, Noah, is if we find a way
                  to bring Bourne in voluntarily.


                            VOSEN
                  He wants revenge, Pam. The only
                  realistic way to deal with this
                  is to eliminate the threat.




139    INT. NIGHT.   BACKSTAIRS                                   139


       BOURNE and NICKY rapidly descend.


                            BOURNE
                  Okay, where is Daniels headed?


                            NICKY
                  8 o'clock this morning, he wired
                  $100,000. to a numbered bank
                  account in Tangier.


                            BOURNE
                  Okay, Tangier is about 300 miles
                  away, we can make the morning
                  ferry.


                            NICKY
                  And then what?


                                                                   49

        Bourne and Nicky exit on to the street.     Suddenly they hear
        tires squealing nearby.


                             NICKY
                   They're coming.


        They continue to walk down the street towards Nicky's car.

        Vosen and Landy are watching this live.




        As they cross the street two MADRID POLICE CARS come around
        the corner the wrong way and screech to a stop.


        Vosen reacts...




139A    EXT. MADRID -- NIGHT                                        139A


        Four cops jump out and take aim at the AGENTS.


                             SPANISH POLICE

        More sirens closing in.      A third police car appears.

        The agents drop their guns and surrender.


        BOURNE and NICKY continue around a corner -- they get in
        her VW GOLF and drive away...

                 We lost Bourne.


                           KRAMER
                 You still think he's after
                 Daniels?


                           VOSEN
                 Yeah. Nicky's just the means.
                 But if we find Daniels, we'll
                 find Bourne.


                           KRAMER
                 Daniels knows way too much.
                 Daniels knows everything. We
                 can't let them meet.


                           VOSEN
                 I'll take care of it.


                            KRAMER
                 Good.
                     (beat)

R145   INT. NIGHT. TRUCK STOP -- SPAIN                            R145


       BOURNE and NICKY sit over coffee.    A long silence...then:


                           NICKY
                 What are you after, Jason?   Why
                 are you looking for Daniels?


                           BOURNE
                 Do you know who this is?


       Bourne puts the photo of Daniels and Hirsch on the table
       between them.    She looks at the photo, points.


                           NICKY
                 That's Daniels.
                     (points at Hirsch)
                 I don't know who that is.


                           BOURNE
                 I have to get back to the
                 beginning...or I'll never be free
                 of this.


                              NICKY
                 Who is he?


                                                                 51




                              BOURNE
                   I think he started Treadstone.    I
                   remember meeting him.   I
                   remember the first day...
                       (beat)
                   Daniels brought me to him.


       Nicky looks back at him....not sure what to say.


                             NICKY
                   What happened?


                             BOURNE
                   An initiation...I guess...

       struggling desperately for breath--




R145   INT. NIGHT. TRUCK STOP -- SPAIN                               R145


       Bourne comes out of the flashback.      Nicky is looking at
       him....


                             NICKY
                   Jason...that wasn't some one-off
                   initiation. Daniels said they
                   did that to you over and over
                   again.   That's how they...


       She doesn't finish.    And Bourne doesn't ask her to.     Just
       a long pause.


                             BOURNE
                   Why are you helping me?


                             NICKY
                   It was difficult for me...with
                   you.


       BOURNE looks up.    Another long pause...


                             NICKY (CONT'D)
                   You really don't remember
                   anything?

                   No.


       NICKY'S face.


       Two SPANISH COPS enter the cafe.


                             BOURNE (CONT'D)
                   We should move.


                                                            52

                    They tracked Daniels' passport to

                              LANDY
                    Since when do you have
                    authorization for lethal action
                    against Daniels?


                              VOSEN
                    Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar
                    safe and fled to Morocco!


                              LANDY
                    So grab him--


                              VOSEN
                    I don't have the people on the
                    ground to do that and I'm not
                    going to risk that file falling
                    into the wrong hands.


                              LANDY
                    What's going on?    What's Daniels
                    got?


                                                            53




                          VOSEN
                What's he got? He ran all of
                Blackbriar's operations in
                Southern Europe and North Africa.


                          LANDY
                I think the world's well aware we
                have a rendition and lethal
                action capability at this point,
                Noah.


                          VOSEN
                For Christ's sake, Pam, he's got
                our entire playbook. Names,
                dates, ghost sites, how we train
                our assets.....


                          LANDY
                You still don't have the
                authority to kill him.


                          VOSEN
                Oh, yes I do, Pam.


      Vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe.
      It is labeled "Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol."


                           VOSEN
                That's what makes us special. No
                red tape. No more getting
                badguys in our sights and then
                watching them escape while we
                wait for some bureaucrat to issue
                the order.


      Landy opens up the file. Sees the words "instantaneous
      lethal action is authorized when..."


                          LANDY
                You just decide? No oversight.
                No checks and balances.


                           VOSEN
                Come on, Pam, you've seen the raw
                intel. You know how real the
                threat is.    We can't afford to
                have our hands tied like that
                anymore.

                  Sir, we have an unauthorized
                  breach. Someone with active

              (going to Vosen, firm)
          Noah, what are you doing?

          Not now.


                    LANDY
          I'm asking on what basis you're
          continuing this operation.


                    VOSEN
          On the basis that Nicky Parsons
          has compromised a covert
          operation. She is up to her neck
          in it.


                    LANDY
          This is about Daniels, not Nicky!


                    VOSEN
          She has betrayed us!


                    LANDY
          You don't know the circumstances!

          She's in league with Jason Bourne
          for Chrissake!


                    LANDY
          You don't have the authority to
          kill her or Bourne!


                    VOSEN
          Yes, I do Pam, it's right here
          and it's legal.


VOSEN slams a document on the desk.   INSERT SHOT:
"Blackbriar: Lethal Action Protocol."


                    LANDY
          She's one of our own.   You start
          down this path...where does it
          end?!


                                                                  60




                               VOSEN
                     It ends when we've won.


       LANDY turns and storms out...

       DESH parks the motorbike and walks around the corner,
       BOURNE follows.


       DANIELS' car coming down the street.     BOURNE stops and sees
       the car -- realizes the danger.


       BOURNE turns back to see DESH with the detonator in his
       hand.


       BOURNE locks eyes with DESH.      Before BOURNE can react --
       DESH detonates.


       BOOM! DANIELS is DEAD.


                                                         61




BOURNE is thrown across the street by the blast.     He lays
MOTIONLESS.


DESH POV. He looks back to see BOURNE not moving, lying in
the street.


DESH gets on his motorbike and heads off to kill NICKY.

NICKY still at that café waiting. Taking out her phone-        *

EXT.   AVENUE D'ESPAGNE -- THAT MOMENT                         *

his papers.                                                  *


BOURNE speaking in Spanish - fishing for his papers.         *
Looking back up the street. Forming a plan. Checking his     *
watch.                                                       *

And DESH has disappeared out of sight.                       *


No time for this.                                            *


BOURNE breaks away. Through the crowds into the traffic.     *
Police whistles- shouting. Confusion.                        *


The chase is on.                                             *


Three policemen turning into his path. No choice. BOURNE     *
taking them down. Sprinting out across the road.             *


A KID and his moped. Caught up in the police dragnet.        *
BOURNE leaping on the bike - kick-starting it.               *


Away into traffic as two squad cars turn and make chase.     *


BOURNE weaving through traffic. One hand on the bike the     *
other on the cell, desperately trying to call NICKY.         *


But now, at least he's got a dial tone.                      *




EXT.   PETIT SOCCO -- CONTINUOUS                             *


NICKY grabbing the cell. Answering.                          *

           to -                                              *


The line goes dead. Looking at the screen - 'SERVICE         *
DENIED'                                                      *


Really spooked now- looking around. Time to move.            *


Dismantling the phone instinctively - scattering it's        *
components.                                                  *


She starts to make her way out of the square.                *

BOURNE picking up the pace. Three more police cars out of a   *
side road just missing him.                                   *


BOURNE choosing his exit.                                     *


Up ahead- a narrow alleyway - taking it.                      *


The squad cars crunching to a halt, behind him.               *

Parking his Vespa at the corner of RUE DES CHRETIENS.         *


Travelling on foot.                                           *

BOURNE arriving - seeing NICKY has left. Seeing DESH'S        *
Vespa parked up.                                              *


More police - on foot now.                                    *


BOURNE parking up. Seeing the crowded streets. Looking up     *
to the rooftops. He needs to get higher.                      *


Starts running up steps.                                      *




INT./EXT.   RIAD/ROOFTOPS -- CONTINUOUS                       *


BOURNE into a riad. Through a courtyard - up more stairs -    *
up a ladder. Out onto the rooftops. Scanning the skyline.     *
A beat. Has he misjudged?                                     *


No, there in the distance at the top of a narrow street-      *
NICKY walking slowly and behind DESH. Moving quickly.         *






BOURNE tailing him - trying to close the gap. Dipping down    *
through another riad - through an alley. Up more stairs.      *
Back up onto another roof. He's gained a few metres on        *
DESH.                                                         *


                                                           64




Desh goes up to the rooftops now. Bourne has him in sight -      *
DESH is prepping his gun with a silencer.                        *


DESH speeding up. BOURNE sees NICKY down below amongst the       *
crowds. In Desh's sights.                                        *


BOURNE knows he has to gain more ground.                         *


CABLE CAM shot - Two trained assassins leaping across the        *
narrow streets - silently effortlessly -- the cops down          *
below searching the alleyways, oblivious to the chase            *
unfolding above them.                                            *


BOURNE nearly on terms with him - then --                        *


DESH dipping down again into the street below.       Avoiding    *
the police -- he melts into the crowds.                          *


STEADYCAM SHOT - following BOURNE as he heads downstairs.        *
More stairs. Through a corridor then a courtyard -               *
bursting out of a door into the street -                         *


A police checkpoint. Right in his path.     Bourne forced to     *
dog leg and take another route.                                  *


BOURNE'S lost him- for the moment.                               *




EXT.   RUE DE CHRETIENS -- CONTINUOUS                            *


NICKY - walking fast up the Rue des Chretiens.       Wondering   *
why there are so many police around.                             *


Suddenly stopping - seeing DESH - knows instantly that he        *
is coming for her.                                               *


Now we see NICKY'S skills.    Has to think on her fee t-         *
TREADSTONE MINDSET --                                            *


Checking the alleyways.     Slipping out of sight.               *


NICKY looking to the rooftops -- taking the advantage.      Up   *
some steps -- into a riad.                                       *


Desh tracking her.                                               *




EXT.   RUE DE CHRETIENS -- CONTINUOUS                            *


BOURNE seeing Desh again - further up the street.      Heading   *
in that direction.                                               *




INT.   RIAD -- CONTINUOUS                                        *


NICKY through one hallway - then another.    Moving up all       *
the time.                                                        *

DESH arriving at the steps. Looks up to where Nicky is           *
going. Takes the entrance to the next building.                  *
Anticipates her next move. Aiming to cut her off.                *




EXT.   RIAD ROOFTOP                                              *


NICKY up steps.    Out onto the rooftops.   Looking for a path   *
across them.                                                     *


Scrabbling across the roof of this crumbling riad.    Knows      *
she can't go back down.                                          *


She makes it across to the next building.                        *


Where Desh is...                                                 *




EXT.   ANOTHER ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS                             *


BOURNE up high.    Seeing NICKY on that other roof.              *


He can't get across to her.    Moving fast now.                  *


Down steps.   Into the riad courtyard.                           *




INT. RIAD                                                        *


BOURNE entering the hallway.                                     *


Moving up the stairs.   Towards Nicky.                           *


And towards Desh.                                                *


Meanwhile NICKY moving down. Looking out into the                *
courtyard below. The sound of POLICE getting nearer.             *


BOURNE hearing the POLICE too as he moves up onto a              *
landing.                                                         *


                                                                 *


BOURNE into a main room - something stirring on a couch - a      *
girl and her little sister having a siesta.                      *


In another room two small boys fast asleep.    TV playing.       *
One wakes.                                                       *


A noise on the stairs above. Quickly arranging a mirror -        *
getting line of sight - Bourne dipping into a corner.            *


It's NICKY.                                                      *


She gives him a look -- DESH is in here somewhere.               *


                                                         66




The door goes below them.   The noise of Police entering the   *
Riad.                                                          *


NICKY signalling to BOURNE - this way.                         *


They climb narrow stairs to the next floor.                    *


Down below Police begin searching rooms. Waking the            *
sleeping family. Shouting, crying. Commotion.                  *




INT./EXT. -- NARROW STAIRWELL                                  *


BOURNE and NICKY creeping up the steps.                        *


Then - suddenly NICKY spinning round as two silenced           *
bullets speed past her - And DESH bursting out of a landing    *
toilet.                                                        *


On to Bourne.                                                  *


Full on Treadstone fighting in the narrow stairwell.           *


Crashing into a tiny disused lift cage- silent constrained-    *
vicious.                                                       *


Downstairs a young POLICEMAN hears the noise- heading for      *
the lift.                                                      *


NICKY seeing the handle turn. Thinking quickly.   She sends    *
the lift up to the next floor.                                 *


The POLICEMAN stepping back from the door -- directing the     *
other cops out to the courtyard.                               *


People are spilling out into the atrium.   It's pandemonium.   *




EXT.   ROOFTOP -- CONTINUOUS                                   *


Bourne and Desh spill out of the elevator and onto the         *
roof.                                                          *


BOURNE kicking the gun - spinning across the floor - he and    *
DESH facing each other.                                        *


DESH with BOURNE - straight over the edge.                     *


DESH still on top - just.                                      *


A brutal exchange. Matching each other's moves like            *
shadows.                                                       *


Relentless. Rolling - falling onto another roof level.         *


And another.                                                   *


                                                                 67




       The two men tiring now. DESH grabbing for the bag.     The            *
       pills. BOURNE kicking them away.                                      *


       BOURNE has the upper hand now.      DESH'S reaction's slowing.        *
       No longer the match he was.                                           *


       BOURNE drags him to the ground.     He's finished.   Bourne's         *
       won.                                                                  *


       DESH- shivering -- convulsing.                                        *


       In the struggle, BOURNE strangles Desh.


194    BOURNE and NICKY hide DESH's body.                              194


                             BOURNE
                   Alright, we need to be dead.    You
                   need to code that in.


       NICKY CODES into DESH'S PDA -- BOTH OBJECTIVES
       ACHIEVED...In the CRI HUB the message comes up...VOSEN and
       LANDY believe NICKY and BOURNE are both DEAD...




196A   INT. DAY. HUB -- CRI -- NEW YORK                             196A


       The code from DESH remains on screen -- BOTH OBJECTIVES
       ACHIEVED -- like an EPITAPH for BOURNE and NICKY...VOSEN
       packs his briefcase. Turns to WILLS.


                             VOSEN
                   I want to be sure. Have the
                   station chief in Rabat confirm
                   the deaths and do a sub-rosa
                   check...And keep and eye on
                   Landy.


       Off WILLS...




197A   INT. DAY.   LANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY                            197A


       Cronin enters.


                             CRONIN
                   The hub just got word Bourne and
                   Nicky are dead.


       Landy looks at him.


                                LANDY
                   Confirmed?


                                CRONIN
                   Not yet.


       Landy looks away...thinking.      Wheels turning.


                                                                  68




                             LANDY
                   Get me a copy of Bourne's
                   personnel file.




195A    EXT. DUSK. PENSIONE                                        195A


        Bourne and Nicky enter.




198A    INT. DUSK PENSIONE -- WASHROOM -- TANGIER                  198A


        BOURNE scrubs the blood from his hands.    REVEAL Nicky
        watching him from the bedroom.




197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197


        Landy sits at her desk reviewing files on Treadstone. Open
        on her desk we see the file she will be looking at in the
        Supremacy phone call.


        The way she examines the papers we get the sense she thinks
        something is missing, some piece, some file.




198A    INT. DUSK. PENSIONE -- WASHROOM                            198A


        Bourne scrubbing the blood from his hands. Nicky comes in,
        touches his shoulder. There's a tenderness to it, a re-
        assurance. For a moment it looks like Bourne might
        react...but the moment passes....




197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197


        Landy opens a new file.   Bourne's operations.




198A    INT. DUSK. PENSIONE -- WASHROOM                            198A


        Bourne is toweling off.


                             BOURNE
                   I can see all their faces. But I
                   can't remember any names....




197     INT. DUSK. LANDY'S OFFICE (LONELY LANDY)                       197


        Landy looks at Bourne's kills. The faces Bourne remembers.
        But there names are here, and who they were, why they were
        killed.




198AC   INT.   NIGHT.   PENSIONE -- BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM          198AC


        Bourne and Nicky sitting together.


                                                                  69




                            BOURNE
                  I was starting to remember who
                  they were...in India...with
                  Marie.


       A beat.


                             NICKY
                  It's just going to lead to more
                  killing, Jason. Are you sure you
                  want that?


       Bourne takes her words in.    But who he is is eating him
       alive from the inside...


                            BOURNE
                  I've killed people and I've tried
                  to apologize for what I've done,
                  for what I am. None of it makes
                  it better...


       Another moment passes between them...then:


                            BOURNE
                  They're going to come for you
                  again. You are going to have to
                  run now.


       She gets up.




198    INT. BATHROOM                                                   198


       Nicky dies her hair BLACK.    Starts cutting it shorter.




199    EXT.   NIGHT.   TANGIER BUS STATION                             199


       Bourne walks with a now dark-haired Nicky. They exchange
       looks for a long beat. She turns towards the bus.


                            BOURNE
                  It gets easier.




197    INT. LANDY'S OFFICE. NIGHT                                      197


       Landy finds a denotation in Bourne's file that he was
       "recruited to Treadstone by Neal Daniels."   Further down
       the   page it says "Bourne was inducted into Treadstone at
       the Special Research Department facility at 415 E 71st,
       New York, NY."    Then "Facility closed by order of
       Director, June 2002."


198C   INT. TANGIER MORGUE                                         198C


       Bourne looks at the tattered remains of Daniels' body and
       belongings.


                                                              70




        He goes through his briefcase and finds a nearly destroyed
        piece of paper with "Noah Vosen - Director of Operations -
        CRI" written on it. Bourne slips the morgue attendant a
        bribe.




198DA   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                198DA


        Vosen is shaving.


                            WILLS
                  Station chief in Rabat just
                  called, they found a body.
                  Bourne?


                               VOSEN
                  Desh.




198DB   INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY                                      198DB


        On final approach to JFK. Bourne looks out the window to
        see the Verizano Narrows bridge.   And beyond it,
        Manhattan.   Bourne is coming home.




A202    EXT. NEW YORK                                             A202

200     INT. LANDY'S OFFICE. DAY                                   200


                            CRONIN
                  Pam, You need to see this.


        Landy follows CRONIN into--




201     INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE -- DAY                                201


        BOURNE'S PASSPORT is displayed on the computer monitor.


                            CRONIN (CONT'D)
                  This passport just cleared
                  Immigration at JFK ten minutes
                  ago. It's an early Treadstone
                  identity registered to Jason
                  Bourne but he never used it and
                  it never went to the grid.
                  Bourne's alive.


                            LANDY
                  They don't know.


                            CRONIN
                  No, if they knew Vosen wouldn't
                  be in his office right now.


                                                             71




202    INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL                                      202


       Bourne moves through the airport.


                           LANDY (O.S.)
                 It's a hell of a risk.


                           CRONIN (O.S.)
                 Yeah. Maybe Bourne wants us to
                 know, just like Naples, maybe
                 he's communicating.




201    INT. CRONIN'S OFFICE                                       201


                           CRONIN
                 Maybe he's trying to communicate
                 with you.


                           LANDY
                 Maybe we should communicate back.
                 Because I think I know what
                 Bourne's looking for.




202    SERIES OF SHOTS                                            202


       Bourne over the 59th Street Bridge -- arrives at CRI --
       goes into the adjacent building --




202A   INT. OFFICE BUILDING ACROSS FROM CRI -- DAY               202A


       Bourne uses his monocular to zoom in on a file Vosen is
       looking at -- he sees the word "Blackbriar." Vosen puts
       the file back in the safe.




203    INT. DAY. LANDY'S OFFICE -- CRI -- NEW YORK                203


       LANDY'S cell phone rings.   She answers it.

                 I hear you're still looking for
                 me.




203    INT. LANDY'S OFFICE                                        203


       LANDY puts down her pencil.   CRONIN watches.


                                                            72

206   INT. VOSEN'S OFFICE                                        206


      His phone rings.    He picks it up.


                          WILLS (TEL. V.O.)
                Get in here! Bourne called
                Landy!


      Vosen jumps up, sprints toward the hub--




203   INT. LANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY                                 203


                          LANDY
                I guess I owe you an apology.




207   INT. HUB -- BACK ROOM                                      207


      Vosen rushes in--


                          BOURNE (V.O.)
                Is that official?


                          VOSEN (OVERLAPPING)
                Are we triangulating?!


                           LANDY (V.O.)
                No. Off the record. You know
                how it is.


                             BACK ROOM TECH (OVERLAPPING)
                Trying--


                             BOURNE (V.O.)
                Good-bye.




203   INT. LANDY'S OFFICE                                        203


                             LANDY

      She opens a file on her desk.

                name.

                 Why the hell did she give him
                 that?


                           LANDY (V.O.)
                 You were born 4/15/71 in Nixa,
                 Missouri.

                 Why don't you come in, and we'll
                 talk about it?
                     (beat)
                 Bourne?

                 You look tired.


      Vosen realizes--

                     (rushing out)
                 He's got line of sight on us!

                  Jason Bourne is alive and at
                  large in New York City. We
                  believe in one thousand yards of
                  this building. I want an
                  immediate twelve block lockdown
                  of the area. Send a FLASH

       Wills walks over to Vosen. The look in his eye indicates
       that he thinks there's something odd about this:


                            WILLS
                  Landy just left the building.


       Vosen looks at Wills.... A beat, Vosen's suspicion
       building, though he can't quite put his finger on what he
       suspects...


                            VOSEN
                  Check Landy's phone.   Is she
                  using it?

                  got a text.

                     I want that goddamn text.   We
                     need to get out in front of her!

                           AGENT 3
                 Copy, we're going to take a left
                 at 41st. One block, settle at
                 the corner.

                           AGENT 4
                 It's a bad place to pick, it's
                 too exposed.


                           VOSEN
                 He wouldn't have chosen it if he
                 didn't have a reason.

                 Okay folks here we go, box at two

                 This is Jason Bourne.


       VOSEN reels for a beat. Then quickly scans the streets,
       trying to see if he can spot BOURNE.


                           VOSEN
                 How did you get this number?


                           BOURNE (V.O.)
                 You didn't actually think I was
                 coming to Tudor City, did you?


                           VOSEN
                 No, I guess not. But if it's me
                 you want to talk to maybe we can
                 arrange a meet.

                               BOURNE (V.O.)
                     I doubt that. If you were in

                     face-to-face.

       Blackbriar" folder Bourne saw Vosen putting into his safe."


       He flips it open. He scans down the page.         His eye
       stopping at the words "US Citizen."


       He flips to another page -- another photo, and again "US

        The passenger side agent sees BOURNE, points--


        BOURNE cuts to the south side of the road so the passenger-
        side agent doesn't have a shot, while controlling the car
        makes it almost impossible for the driver to fire
        accurately.




240C    EXT. 41 STREET -- DAY                                        240C


        The westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the
        sidewalk. But Bourne is too fast. He's already past them.
        The passenger side agent jumps out. But he's still got to
        get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead
        over the hood of his car on Bourne.


        The other CRI car races the wrong way on the street but
        gets immobilized and trapped by the onrushing tunnel
        traffic.

        Bourne races through the tunnel traffic and onto 40th
        street.   He rushes east toward the spaghetti of concrete
        ramps leading into and out of Port Authority.


                                                             82




       He runs across 10th Avenue as a third CRI car screams up

260    EXT. PORT AUTHORITY -- DAY                                  260


       A New Jersey-bound bus exits the complex and heads around
       the corner of the ramp -- it skids to a stop when it sees
       Bourne and the CRI car giving chase heading right at the
       bus.

       jumps out of his car on 8th Avenue and rushes for the

      Bourne races up a set of stairs the rooftop parking lot.
      He surveys every aspect of his environment on the fly
      (which includes his taking a quick peak over the concrete
      railing at the east end of the roof.


      Next Bourne rushes toward the parked cars. Smashes the
      window of one to set off its alarm.   Then a second and a
      third, setting off their alarms.


      The fourth window Bourne smashes in doesn't set off an
      alarm. Bourne pulls the door open and climbs in.


      Inside the car Bourne reaches under the dash and yanks
      handful of wires off the steering column and starts to
      expertly hotwire the car.

      Agents race up stairwells.   Two CRI cars careen up the
      ramp to the passenger parking (a separate ramp to the bus
      ramp we saw Bourne on earlier.) A third CRI car races
      through the parking level just below the roof and up the
      circular ramp to the roof.

      EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY


      Bourne works to hotwire the car.


      A CRI car gets to the roof.   Two agents come from the
      elevator lobby.   The three car alarms distract them. They
      search for Bourne, but can't find him at first...


      Bourne gets the car engine on - but, given the wonders of
      modern anti-theft technology his steering wheel is still
      locked.


                                                                84




      A second CRI car arrives.


      Bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high
      speed.


      He smashes into the car across the aisle from him. With a
      sharp metallic snap the wheel in Bourne's car is suddenly
      free, he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and
      stops.


      Three CRI cars here now. Two head straight for him.   A
      third blocks the exit ramp.


      Bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour
      from the elevator lobby, one carrying the serious firepower
      of an M-4 (an M-16 variant whose bullets can penetrate
      metal and concrete). They move into position to get a bead
      on him.


      Bourne assesses. But he doesn't move. The agents swarm
      toward him. What the hell is he doing? Why is he waiting?

268   EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- PORT AUTHORITY                     268


      The agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels
      toward Bourne--


      But before they can get a bead--


      Bourne slams the car into reverse again.   Petal to the
      metal in reverse--


      The agents open fire.


      Bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield.
      But there's no dodging the shower of broken glass.


      As Bourne disappears below the dashboard, the CRI agent
      adjusts his fire into the car's grill.


      Virtually blind, Bourne races the hard-pressed vehicle
      backwards as the agent's fire decimates the car's
      driveline.


      Bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek
      behind him.


                                                            85




      Steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small
      gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking
      structure.


      Bourne's car splits the gap between the parked cars, hits
      the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his
      car up and over the wall.


      Bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall, a
      second later the front end seesaws over the top, the sudden
      angle change exposes for an instant the bottom of Bourne's
      car, to the shooters.


      Several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past
      Bourne's head just before his car drops upside down for 25
      feet and slams onto a row of parked cars.


      The impact rips Bourne from the seat and slams him hard
      against the roof.


      Bourne struggles out of the car, knowing he has only a
      moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over-
      turned car.


                           CRI AGENT

      The CRI agents race to the spot where Bourne's car
      disappeared over the railing and reflexively fire into
      Bourne's car but they're too late! Bourne's already out.
      He disappears from sight under the covered parking
      structure.

        level Bourne's on.




275     INT./EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- TWO LEVELS BELOW ROOFTOP        275


        Bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and
        pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the
        roof lands hard behind him.


        Bourne's race to the exit is cut off as a 3rd CRI sedan
        slides into view and it's occupants open fire on Bourne in
        a head on charge.


        The just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as Bourne reacts
        instantaneously; thumbing on the cruise control,
        shouldering his door open, and slamming the gas pedal to
        the floor as he dives out of the car.


        The agents react as Bourne's sedan torpedoes them head on.
        Hit hard they're taken out of the fight as metal collapses,
        glass shatters, and airbags explode.


        Bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his
        car implodes against the oncoming agents.


                                                       87




Instantly Bourne is on his feet, moving between the parked
cars to engage another CRI sedan traveling parallel to the
course of the wrecked one.


The agents in this sedan are distracted by the still
echoing crash and are caught off-guard as Bourne steps out
and points his gun at the driver.


The driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate
effort to save his own life. As the sedan suddenly
accelerates, Bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the
sedan's front tire and fires.


The tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams
into a parked car, pitching the driver violently against
the unyielding interior of the sedan.


An instant later Bourne rips the radio off the dazed
drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it.


With the wreck still echoing through the garage Bourne has
to deal with the arrival of the first NYPD sedan.


Bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on
edge cop climbs out of his car but Bourne's performance is
cut short as the agent running from his drop from the roof,
arrives and opens fire.


The police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as
Bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single
shot.


The increasing volume of squealing tires alerts Bourne to a
new threat, he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs
the officer's radio.


                   BOURNE
          10-13. Shots fired. Officer
          down. Port Authority parking
          lot. Level four.


Bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift
tourniquet for the officer.   Then he hands the cop his
radio back.


                    BOURNE (CONT'D)
          Stay out of sight until one of
          your own arrive.


Bourne disappears.


We pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the
engine and heads for the exits.


CRI agents are confused for a second -- until they pick up
the NYPD car exiting Port Authority on one of the ramps.
But that's all the time Bourne needs--


                                                               88

       Bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east,
       followed closely by a CRI sedan.


       As cars yield to Bourne's siren a taxi tries to jump into
       Bourne's wake but a CRI sedan punches the taxi back to the
       right. It ricochets off several parked cars before
       regaining control.

       Bourne struggles to keep his over-matched vehicle ahead of
       the more powerful CRI Sedan which tries to spin Bourne out
       by hitting his bumper.


       Bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car.
       The CRI sedan flanking Bourne's slams into the rear of that
       car, spinning it 180 degrees into the path of the trailing
       CRI sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision
       and blocks the path of the other CRI sedan.




282    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                     282


       Bourne is home free. He looks around and spots a sign that
       indicates a right turn and says "To Holland Tunnel / US
       95." Bourne turns right--


       Suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more
       shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the
       top of Bourne's leg.


       REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As
       Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the
       intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches
       it into the side of Bourne's car.


       Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging
       forward and slams into the back of Bourne's car. With his
       front tires spinning wildly Bourne fights to straighten his
       car as another CRI sedan appears and tries to box Bourne's
       car by sliding into his path.

       Bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of
       the CRI Sedan and race down the Avenue with Paz and the
       slightly damaged sedan in pursuit.


       Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently
       to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of.


       Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the
       intersection completely blocking his path.


       Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues
       on, barreling into the roadblock backwards.


       As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel
       and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the
       other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake.


       Paz and the CRI sedan are all over Bourne as he slides a
       right hand turn onto South St. as Paz and the CRI sedan
       overwhelm Bourne's battered vehicle.

287    INT. BOURNE'S CAR -- DAY                                      287


       On his police radio, Bourne singles out an NYPD officer
       (call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just
       ahead.


       Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right:


       The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate
       through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car
       Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into
       the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car.


       Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy
       SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the
       oncoming traffic.


       Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne
       sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the
       street ahead.


       The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the
       rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches
       it back into the lane as it slams against the front of
       Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked
       cars.


       Bourne's car hits parked cars on the other side of the

                   him.


        Vosen reacts--




289     EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE -- LATE AFTERNOON                       289


        Bourne exits from the subway.   Bourne walks north.

        Wills pacing... Bourne's profile is up on Screen 2. It
        says "David Webb (AKA Jason Bourne)" on the profile.  A
        tech comes to Wills.


                             TECH
                   Sir, this may be nothing but,
                   look at Bourne's birthday.


        Wills looks at the profile.   Bourne's birthdate is listed
        as 9/13/70.


                             WILLS
                   What about it?


                             TECH
                   Well, Landy told Bourne his
                   birthday was 4/15/71 so...


        Wills gets it instantly.

                  Landy gave Bourne a false
                  birthday. Wills thinks it's a
                  code.


       It sinks in for Vosen...oh...shit...

306    INT. HIRSCH'S OFFICE   (NEW BUILDING OF HOSPITAL) -- LATE 306
       AFTERNOON


       Hirsch's office is located in the SRD's "front office",
       which is located covertly on a floor of the new building of
       the hospital. He is the longtime head of SRD and a
       powerful behind-the-scenes official at CIA.


       THE CAMERA FINDS


       DR. HIRSCH, 70, is, put simply, not a man to be trifled
       with. He's a 45 year CIA veteran. One of the great brains
       in the Agency's history, but also a man who knows how to
       wield power silently, invisibly, and to tremendous effect.
       His phone buzzes.


                                                               93

                   Bourne knows everything. I think
                   he's heading for you right now.


       Dead pause.




306    INT. HIRSCH'S OFFICE (NEW BUILDING OF HOSPITAL)-- DAY        306


                             HIRSCH (INTO PHONE)
                   He's coming home, Noah.


       There's a wistfulness in the way he says it. But also the
       sense that this was absolutely inevitable. And he's calm
       about it, doesn't show any fear, doesn't reach for a gun.


                             HIRSCH (INTO PHONE)
                   How long do I have?


                               VOSEN
                   Not long.    Get out of there.


                              HIRSCH
                   No.   I'm going to stay.


                             VOSEN
                   Are you crazy, he'll--


                             HIRSCH
                   He'll come to the training wing.
                   That's what he knows. I'll keep
                   him in play until you arrive.




309R   EXT.   NEW YORK -- HOSPITAL -- LATE AFTERNOON            309R


       Bourne arrives at the "Johnston Medical Center."   He looks

       This is the place... When he looks down Landy steps out of
       the lobby to meet him on the sidewalk.


                                                                94




                             BOURNE
                   They'll kill you for giving me
                   this place.


                             LANDY
                   4/15/71 isn't much of a code. My
                   guess is Vosen's already on his
                   way.


                             BOURNE
                   Why'd you do it?


                             LANDY
                   This isn't us, David. What they
                   turned you into, what they're
                   doing with Blackbriar... This
                   has to stop.


                             BOURNE
                   Then stop it. Everything you
                   need is in there.


       Bourne hands her the black bag and enters the hospital.


                             LANDY
                   David... Come in with me. It's
                   better if we do this together.


                             BOURNE
                       (shakes head)
                   This is where it started for me,
                   this is where it ends.


       She watches the doors close behind him....     Landy lets him
       go.




323    EXT. NYC STREETS -- LATE AFTERNOON                            323

       --She unzips the backpack and looks in at the the
       Blackbriar Operations File.


       --A cover page inside: "utmost secrecy"... "potentially
       explosive public reaction would jeopardize the program"...


       --Another page: "Terminated" stamped across the photos of
       victims. Next to the victim from the inciting incident,

                 Oh, my God...


       --A third page, more photos, no "terminated" on these.
       Future victims. "US citizen" stamped next to each one...




310    INT. HOSPITAL -- LATE AFERNOON                                310


       Bourne uses the card reader he took from Vosen's safe to
       enter a "restricted access elevator."   A guard comes.
       Bourne aims his pistol at him as the elevator door closes.




309R   EXT. FIRST AVENUE -- OUTSIDE HOSPITAL --    LATE AFTERNOON 309R


       Landy walks down the street. She looks up to spot two
       black sedans speeding east on 71st, turns south -- two SUVs
       coming up York.   Shit--

       Vosen and CRI agents rush into the lobby.

       A security guard comes over.


                             VOSEN
                   Do you know who I am?
                       (the guard nods)

       Landy looks around. Finds an open office. She pushes open
       the door and runs to the fax machine. She starts faxing
       the Blackbriar documents Bourne took from Vosen's safe.

       Bourne reaches the end of the hall.       He looks around

       Vosen enters the room.    The last pages have been faxed...


                             LANDY
                   You better get a good lawyer.


       She exits...




322    BACK TO SCENE                                                 322


       Then spins, gun up--


       Hirsch is there, halfway down the corridor behind him.


                             HIRSCH
                   Put the gun down. I wouldn't be
                   here if I didn't want to talk.


                              BOURNE
                   I've spent three years running.
                   Three years trying to find out
                   who I was.


       Hirsch moves toward Bourne, completely unfazed by the gun.


                             HIRSCH
                   You still don't have it all back,
                   do you? You haven't filled in
                   all the pieces?


                             BOURNE
                   Let's start with the moment you
                   found out I wouldn't execute
                   Wombosi. The amnesia wasn't the
                   issue, it was the fact that I
                   didn't pull the trigger....


                             HIRSCH
                   One lapse meant your conditioning
                   had failed.


       Bourne grabs Hirsch and slams him against the wall


                             BOURNE
                   It was always you, behind
                   Conklin, behind Abbott.... They
                   were just following orders.


       Bourne grabs Hirsch and pushes him to the wall.   Searches
       him for weapons.


                                                             98




                             HIRSCH
                       (completely calm)
                   I'm unarmed, Jason.


                             BOURNE
                       (shoving Hirsch hard
                        against the wall)
                   "David." I'm David Webb.


       CLOSE ON Bourne's face--


                             HIRSCH
                   You were David Webb, but not
                   anymore.




322    INT. SRD TRAINING WING CORRIDOR -- LATE AFERNOON           322


       Bourne stands with Hirsch.


                              BOURNE
                   Why me?   Why did you pick me?


       A beat...


                               HIRSCH
                   You really don't remember, do
                   you?
                        (beat)
                   You picked us, Jason.


                             BOURNE
                   What does that mean?


                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered.


       Hirsch uses his free hand to hit the keypad on the wall.
       The "room in use" sign lights up.


       Bourne looks up "flashback style"--




FBA1   FLASHBACK                                                  FBA1


       Bourne remembers that keypad, that "room in use" sign from
       the first day...




322    INT. ROOM WHERE BOURNE FIRST MET HIRSCH                    322


       Bourne and Hirsch enter...


                             HIRSCH
                   You volunteered right here....
                   You didn't even blink, Jason.
                   You just handed me these...


                                                             99




       Hirsch removes a pair of dog tags from his jacket pocket.
       Holds them out to Bourne.


       Bourne takes the dog tags.        Stares at them.


       INSERT of the dog tags:


       Webb, David

       Bourne hands over his dog tags....




                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    Has everything been explained to
                    you.


                                BOURNE
                    Yes, sir.


322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322


                              HIRSCH
                    You were a soldier ready to serve
                    his country. Just like thousands
                    of others, except you were a
                    prodigy with languages...and a
                    perfect shot.


FBB3   FLASHBACK                                               FBB3


                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    Your missions will save American
                    lives.




322    PRESENT DAY                                                 322


                              BOURNE
                    You said I'd be saving American
                    lives. Instead you just turned me
                    into a killer.


       Bourne raises the gun to Hirsch.


                              HIRSCH
                    You could have left at any time.
                    And you knew exactly what it
                    meant for you if you chose to
                    stay.


                                                               100

                              HIRSCH
                    When we're finished with you,
                    you'll no longer be David Webb.


                              BOURNE
                    I'll be whoever you need me to
                    be, sir.




322    PRESENT DAY                                                   322


                              HIRSCH
                    Stop running from the truth,
                    Jason. You chose to come here!
                    You chose to stay! And no matter
                    how much you want to forget
                    it...eventually you're going to
                    have to face how you chose, right
                    there, to become Jason Bourne!






FB10   FLASHBACK:                                                 FB10


       Bourne sitting in a chair, looking terrible.     Hirsch looks
       at him from behind the desk...


                              HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                    You haven't slept for a long time
                    have you David? Have you made a
                    decision? This can't go on, you
                    know. You have to decide.


                                 BOURNE
                    Who is he?


                              HIRSCH
                    We've been through that.


                              BOURNE
                    What did he do?


                               HIRSCH
                    It doesn't matter.
                        (beat)
                    You came to us. You volunteered.
                    You said you'd do anything it
                    takes to save American lives.
                    You're not a liar are you? Or too
                    weak to see this through? This is
                    it. Let go of David Webb. Will
                    you give yourself to this
                    program?


                                                             101




      Bourne looks down, a gun in his hand. He gets to his feet
      swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded
      figure. The man slumps over.


      Bourne stares at what he's done.


                          HIRSCH (CONT'D)
                You're no longer David Webb.
                From now on you'll be known as
                Jason Bourne. Welcome to the
                program.


      Daniels pulls the hood off the figure to show that he is
      dead.


      Just then Kramer walks through the door.


                          KRAMER
                He's ready. Send him to
                Operations.




322   PRESENT                                                      322


      And now, in real time, Bourne comes out of the flashback.
      He stares back at Hirsch....


                          HIRSCH
                Do you remember now?


      Bourne lowers the gun.


                          BOURNE
                I remember. I remember
                everything.


                          HIRSCH
                You can't outrun what you did,
                Jason. You made yourself into
                who you are.


                          BOURNE
                I'm done running.  That's why
                I'm here. To end you, to shut
                this down. I'm no longer Jason
                Bourne.


                          HIRSCH
                So now you're going to kill me?


                          BOURNE
                No. You don't deserve the star
                they give you on the wall at
                Langley.


      Just then Bourne spins -- agents arrive at the door.    It's
      locked.


                                                            102




322   INT. HALLWAY                                                322


      The agents fire at the door handle to get it open.




322   INT. ROOM WHERE BOURNE FIRST MET HIRSCH                     322


      Bourne looks out a window.   Sees the layout of a roof
      several stories below. Then he turns and shoots out the
      room's mirrored observation window. Bourne dives through
      it just as agents rush in and open fire at him.




      SERIES OF SHOTS


      Bourne races through corridors, loosing the CRI agents.




352   EXT. ROOF -- NIGHT                                          352


      Bourne runs out onto the roof. Rushes across it to look
      over the edge.   It's a straight drop to the FDR -- 12
      stories down.


      He races to another ledge -- the East River below him. But
      he has to clear a 10 foot supporting wall at the base of
      the building to hit the water.   He backs up to get a
      running leap.


      As he does, he turns and sees Paz, who is holding a gun on
      him.


                             PAZ
                   Why didn't you take the shot?


      Bourne looks at him.


                             BOURNE
                   Do you even know why you're
                   trying to kill me? Look at what
                   they make you give.


      Bourne turns and runs off the roof.


      Paz fires into the air...


      FOLLOW Bourne as he drops fourteen stories into the
      freezing river--


      MULTIPLE ANGLES -- Bourne goes into the river...




352   UNDERWATER                                                  352

      he begins to sink....

356   INT. BAR -- URUGUAY -- SUNSET                               356


      Nicky goes to the bar of at a low end tourist bar with
      several other customers.   She stands there, eyes fixed on
      a TV behind the bar:


                             ANCHOR 5 (V.O., CONT'D)
                   Webb, who was known inside the
                   intelligence community, as "Jason
                   Bourne" jumped from the
                   fourteenth floor of the CIA
                   facility where he was trained in
                   New York into the East River
                   below.   While experts say it
                   would be nearly impossible to
                   survive the fall, despite two
                   weeks of efforts, his body has
                   still not been recovered.


      PUSH in on the smile that develops on Nicky's face.   As we

FADE IN


EXT. SPACE


A small planet glows in the light of its sun.


Suddenly, we hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic
mist behind the planet...


Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the planet, and we
hear the horrible sounds of destruction.


Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it.




                                                        PUSH DOWN TO:


EXT. THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE


Strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a wild panic.
It looks like Pompeii must have looked as Vesuvius erupted.


ANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING


The creature is KRANIX.  We will meet him later on
in a very different context, but for now, he is
running from the ever-growing mist that threatens to
engulf him.


ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC


As Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him.


                                ARBLUS
                Transform and flee, Kranix!  You must warn
                all you meet of the horror of Unicron!


Suddenly, the pitiful creature is surrounded by the strange
energy cloud and it looks like his body has simultaneously caught
fire and been doused with acid.


                                KRANIX
                Arblus!  No!


ANGLE ON KRANIX


The mist threatens to engulf him too.
He transforms into a small rocket ship and...


TRACK WITH KRANIX AS...


He takes off.


As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere, we see the horror
wrought by the hideous and still mysterious Unicron.


The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava leak out.


The energy cloud surrounds it and...


Dissolves everything...


...  And when the smoke clears, we get our first look at Unicron.


It is horrifying.


A massive, metal orb with a gaping maw and a field of electricity.


PAN FORWARD to SHOW that this hideous planet is on a direct
collision course with...


MOONS ORBITING CYBERTRON IN DEEP SPACE


There are TWO MECHANISTIC MOONS orbiting the huge planet Cybertron.
But we are most concerned with a small, greenish metal one.


                                NARRATOR


                It is the year 2005.  The treacherous Decepticons have
                conquered the Autobots' home planet of Cybertron.  But
                from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron's moons
                the valiant Autobots prepare to retake their homeland.


CLOSER ON GREEN MOON


At first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious.  Then, pulling
closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered with moon
camouflage "netting" and underneath it is a huge cache of
futuristic weapons.


This is the Autobot staging ground for an assault on Cybertron.


DOLLY THROUGH THE COMPLEX until we arrive at a Command Center
where several Autobots peer into monitors,  running constant
surveillance on Cybertron.


ANGLE ON IRONHIDE


He peers into a monitor.


As he speaks, we see the monitor  PAN to an area  where a huge
Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned on Cybertron.


                                IRONHIDE


                Every time I look into this thing, my
                circuits sizzle.  I'm tired of this waiting
                game, Prime.  When are we gonna start bustin'
                Deceptichops?


ANGLE ON OPTIMUS PRIME


He stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion
plans for Cybertron.


                                OPTIMUS PRIME


                We still don't have enough Energon cubes to power a
                full scale assault, Ironhide.


                                IRONHIDE
                Then let me make another run to Autobot City
                on Earth.  I'll bring you back more cubes than
                you'll know what to do with.


ANGLE ON PRIME


He solemnly hands down an order


                                PRIME


                Alright, ready the shuttle for launch.


ANGLE ON IRONHIDE


He raises a fist in a warwhoop!


                                IRONHIDE


                YAHOO!
                        (looking into monitor)
                Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps.


A SMALL MOON "MOUNTAIN"


Ironhide transforms and Races toward a mountain, which stands
about a half mile from the secret Autobot facility.


                                OPTIMUS PRIME (V.O.)


                Jazz,  report security status.


COMMAND CENTER - ANGLE ON THE CONSOLES


                                JAZZ


                No sign of Decepticons in this sector, Prime.


                                PRIME
                What about Moon Base 2?


                                JAZZ


                Jazz to Moon Base 2.


PAN UP  and through the sky to -


ANOTHER MOON


This is the second moon.  It is much closer to Cybertron than the
first one. This is where  Bumblebee and Spike are stationed.


                                JAZZ (V.O.)


                Jazz to Moon Base 2.


ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE


They stand together a communication console.  Spike is now  35
years old.  Bumblebee looks as he has always looked, save for a
couple of funny bumper stickers on his tail: I (heart)
Cybertron.  I (club) Decepticons.


                                BUMBLEBEE


                Bumblebee and Spike here.


                                JAZZ (V.O.)


                We're about to send up the bird.
                Any Decepticon shenanigans in your sector?


                                BUMBLEBEE


                All clear, Jazz.


                        (pause)


                                SPIKE


                Hey, Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I miss him,
                and tell him I'll be coming home as soon as we've
                kicked Megatron's tail across the galaxy.


                                                        CUT TO:


INT. THE SHUTTLE


Ironhide and Prowl sit at the controls, running a series of
pre-launch tests.


                                IRONHIDE


                Will do, Spike.


ANGLE ON PRIME, CLIFFJUMPER, AND THE OTHERS


Standing at the Command Center, watching:


                                PRIME
                Commence countdown, Cliffjumper.


                                CLIFFJUMPER


                Five...Four...Three...Two...


THE  LUNAR  "MOUNTAIN"


Suddenly, smoke starts pouring out of the mountain.


                                CLIFFJUMPER
                One....


Then, the "mountain" which must be made of paper mache or
something blows away revealing --


The shuttle!


                                CLIFFJUMPER (V.O.)


                Liftoff.


Suddenly, the shuttle rips out of the ground in a ball of fire.
As it takes off, we realize this isn't any dinky shuttle, but a
massive ship, capable of carrying all the energon  needed to
fight a war and an army to boot.


The screen is bathed in smoke and fire which slowly clears.


ANGLE ON PRIME


As he watches the shuttle shoot into the distance.


                                PRIME
                Now, all we need is a little Energon
                and a lot of luck.


ANGLE BEHIND PRIME


We see a bank of computers.  Suddenly, a small tape deck pops
open...


a cassette pops out and transforms into...


...Laserbeak who flies away unseen.


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. SPACE  - LATER


The shuttle  hurtles though a massive asteroid field.


                                PROWL (V.O.)


                Slow down, Ironhide.  We
                want to get to Autobot city in one piece.


                                                        CUT TO:


INT. THE SHUTTLE


Ironhide is at the controls.


                                IRONHIDE


                If I can dodge Dececpticon rays,
                I can sure as shootin' dodge a
                couple of asteroids.


Suddenly, there  is a terrible BANG! on the side of the ship, and
the two Autobots are thrown from their seats.


                                PROWL


                You were saying?


                                IRONHIDE (irked)


                That wasn't an asteroid.


There is a blast of light and they turn to see...


ANGLE ON THE SHIP


The most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a gaping
hole in the side of the ship...


Then, when the light clears, a panel of the ship falls in and we
see -


MEGATRON!


In all his glory.


                                MEGATRON


                Die Autobots!


Then, he transforms to Gun Mode, spins into STARSCREAM'S arms and
Starscream fires.


BRAWN


is cut in half by Megatron's blast.


ON PROWL


as SCAVENGER MELTS HIM DOWN.


THE INSECTICONS


...eat away at the hole in the shuttle to make way for...


...an ARMY of other Decepticons including Laserbeak who enter,
firing.


IRONHIDE AND RATCHET


While FIRING back are FUSED TOGETHER...


... then blasted apart and fall in smoking, glowing fragments.


ON STARSCREAM AND MEGATRON


As they enter the now  empty ship, a number of Decepticons flood
past them, taking positions and searching for other living
Autobots.


                                MEGATRON


                This was almost too easy, Starscream.


                                STARSCREAM


                Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than attacking
                the real threat:  the Autobots moon base.


                                MEGATRON


                You're an idiot, Starscream.  Were we simply to
                wipe out that minuscule base, they could build another
                one.  But when we slip by their security systems
                in their own ship and destroy Autobot city, the
                Autobots will be vanquished forever!


                                IRONHIDE


                Fat chance, Megatron!


Ironhide pulls himself up and grabs onto Megatron who flings him
against the wall.


                                MEGATRON


                Such heroic nonsense!


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. EARTH - CLOSE SHOT- MINIATURE RADAR SCREEN


A child's hands hold a scanner device which tracks a TRAVELING
BLIP across a star map towards a pulsing dot which represents the
Earth.


                                DANIEL (V.O.)


                The Shuttle just zipped past checkpoint zeta.


ON DANIEL


Daniel, a classic twelve year old American boy watches the
portable viewer which is like an over-sized Boy Scout compass.


WIDEN SHOT to show he is at an old fashioned "fishin' hole" on
Earth - surrounded by weeping willows, assorted trees and shrubs,
and that his fishing pole is stuck in the dirt, the line floating
lazily out on the water.


                                DANIEL


                Let's watch Ironhide land it, Hot Rod!


As Daniel runs to small skateboard-like device, hits a button,
and watches, it transforms into a hoverboard and rides it, like a
surfer up a steep, grassy hillside we change angle to feature...


HOT ROD


an "adolescent" Autobot.  He is in robot mode, sitting with his
fishing rod held between two fingers, looking bored with it all.


                                HOT ROD


                Talk about dull......!


Then, he tosses the rod into the water.


ON DANIEL RIDING HIS HOVERBOARD UP THE HILL


                                DANIEL


                        (calling excitedly)


                Hurry or we'll miss it!


HOT ROD


lopes up hill after Daniel.


                                HOT ROD


                If you're gonna ride, Dan-O ...ride in style!


Hot Rod catches up with Daniel, scoops him off his hoverboard,
TRANSFORMS to automotive mode and RIDES OVER CREST OF HILL with
Daniel in the front seat.


ANOTHER ANGLE - ON AUTOBOT CITY


FOLLOW Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the perimeter
of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant Hot Rod clears
the rim of a hill.  As they travel, we SHOULD also be getting a
sense of what Autobot City is all about.


(DESIGN NOTE:  Autobot City looks like a federal energy project
gone mad.  Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit every known
means of getting energy.  The mountain is covered with solar
panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks pump, and not
far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions of volts.  Near all
of these various things are energon  compressors, which turn the
raw energy into energon cubes.


IN THE BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel
truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this
energon,  convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then
convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot
City.


In short, it should be  clear that the purpose of Autobot City is
to harvest energy.


All the while, Hot Rod and Daniel are riding recklessly out from
the Autobot City and up into neighboring hills for an overview of
the -


CIRCULAR LANDING AREA


which resides within the "bowl" created by the City structure and
natural surroundings.


                                DANIEL


                Hey!  Let me out.


                                HOT ROD


                Why settle for a peek when you can see
                everything from Lookout Mountain?


                                DANIEL


                But we're not supposed to go beyond City
                limits!


                                HOT ROD


                Chromo-Chicken!


ON KUP AND OTHER AUTOBOTS


KUP - a grizzled, "old Soldier" of an Autobot - is directing the
positioning of a large metal road barricade.


Hot Rod barrels through a sign which reads: "STOP -THIS AREA OFF
LIMITS", almost knocking Kup over in dust and wind


KUP


disgustedly watches Hot Rod drive up the mountain.


                                KUP


                        (to sound like swearing)
                Cam bustin', turbo revvin' young punk.


                                                        CUT TO:


MOUNTAIN ABOVE AUTOBOT CITY- LOOKOUT POINT


Hot Rod arrives at a viewing platform carved in mountainside and
TRANSFORMS back to humanoid mode.


Daniel rushes to a set of PUBLIC VIEWING BINOCULARS and peers
into them.


                                HOT ROD


                This is it!  Now take a squint through those babies.


                                DANIEL


                Hot Rod, look!  There's a hole in the shuttle!


                                HOT ROD


                What!?


DANIEL'S P.O.V - BINOCULAR MATTE - THE SHUTTLE


The hole Megatron blasted in order to get into the shuttle mars
the otherwise perfect exterior of the ship.


ANGLE ON DANIEL AND HOT ROD


Hot Rod looks up and a pair of futuristic binoculars pop out of
his eyes.


HOT ROD'S POV - THE SHUTTLE


Hot Rod's vision, now, infinitely better than human vision, spots
something truly disturbing --


-- Starscream, and several Constructicons inside the ship!


                                HOT ROD (O.S.)


                Decepticons!


ANGLE ON HOT ROD


Drawing his gun, he starts FIRING on the shuttle.


                                HOT ROD
                This is for Ironhide.  As so's this!


ANGLE ON THE SHUTTLE


Rays streak through the hole searing...


STARSCREAM


He ducks away from the door.


                                STARSCREAM


                I'm hit!


ANGLE ON MEGATRON


Standing behind a pair of Decepticons who pilot the shuttle, he
turns to see...


THE CONSTRUCTICONS


Firing out of the hole.


MEGATRON


He's furious.


                                MEGATRON


                You imbecile, our cover is blown!


                                STARSCREAM


                It was your stupid strategy!


                                                        CUT TO:


ANGLE ON KUP, CONSTRUCTION CREW


Kup and the Autobot Construction Crew watch Hot Rod shooting at
the shuttle.


                                KUP


                What's that darn fool doing?


Hound looks up and points.


                                HOUND
                Decepticons!


ANGLE ON THE SHUTTLE


Suddenly it cracks open, and Decepticons shoot out of the
wreckage like toys from a pinata.


CLOSE - MEGATRON


In mid-air


                                MEGATRON
                        (shouting to forces)
                Attack!
                        (he looks down and fires)


HOT ROD AND DANIEL


Hot Rod pulls Daniel back as Megatron's BLAST SHEARS OFF the
VIEWING PLATFORM which crumbles and falls down the steep
mountain!


                                HOT ROD


                Hang on!


Putting Daniel under one arm, he pivots and kicks up at...
...Hook and Scavenger who are descending on him in humanoid
mode...


...causing them both to crash against the mountainside which
starts a...


...landslide which Hot Rod "rides" down the slope, pursued by...


... Decepticon FIRE.


                                HOT ROD


                        (SHOUTING)
                WHoooooooaaah


ANGLE ON BOTTOM OF MOUNTAIN SLOPE - BLITZWING


Blitzwing  flies down in jet mode, transforms to robot
mode, looks up at the "slide riding" Hot Rod and Daniel,
transforms to tank mode and takes aim.


                                BLITZWING


                        (amused)
                Come on down, Autobrat!


ON HOT ROD AND DANIEL


as Hot Rod tumbles, he covers Daniel with his arms and tries
unsuccessfully to slow his fall.


                                HOT ROD


                Yiiiiiiiiii!


ON BLITZWING


about to fire, when...


...Kup's arm descends into SHOT, spinning Blitzwing's turret
around.


Blitzwing's blast, scorches...


SHRAPNEL


who is flying nearby.


BLITZWING


transforms to robot mode and turns as...


Kup comes flying, feet first, into Blitzwing knocking him off the
mountain ledge.




FOLLOW Kup as he lands in front of Hot Rod, who is just coming to
a  stop at the bottom with Daniel.


                                HOT ROD


                Not bad for an old timer!


                                KUP


                        (gruffly)
                Old timer?!  That's something you'll never be if
                you don't get back to the city.  You know what we
                used to do with cocky, insubordinate upstarts?


                                HOT ROD


                        (interrupting)


                Save it.


STARSCREAM


transforming into jet mode, fires on them with laser bursts
which...


... chew up the ground beside them.


HOT ROD AND KUP


with Daniel race toward Autobot City, transforming into vehicle
mode as shots gouge the terrain around them.


                                                        CUT TO:


PERCEPTOR IN MICROSCOPE MODE ON "BATTLEMENT" OF AUTOBOT CITY


he watches...


PERCEPTOR'S POV - THE DECEPTICON ATTACK


Megatron, Insecticons, Constructicons, and other Decepticon
forces attack the city from the sky and ground.


PERCEPTOR


transforms to humanoid and runs toward......


... Three new Autobots, ARCEE, a lovely female Autobot of about
Hot Rod's age, SPRINGER, a very muscular and bantering "Indiana
Jones" type Autobot and ULTRA MAGNUS, the large and soldierly
City Commander.


                                PERCEPTOR


                Ultra Magnus.....a cursory evaluation
                of Decepticon capability indicates a
                distinct tactical deficit!


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                In other words, Perceptor...


                                SPRINGER


                        (translating)
                We're outnumbered!


He turns and FIRES from his hip.


DIRGE IN JET MODE


Zooms in to strafe as...


SPRINGER'S BLAST...


...Explodes on his wing tip.


SPRINGER, ULTRA MAGNUS AND OTHERS


as Decepticon BOMBS AND LASER FIRE pour in on the City.

TRANSFORMS and hovers in robot mode, firing all around
them as they...


..dive for the switch and pull it down.


                                STARSCREAM


                There's no escape...Uuuuh!


Just then, the floor of the courtyard STARTS TRANSFORMING -
- the center line of the floor snaps shut like the halves of a
gigantic steel shelled clam, trapping Starscream's foot.


                                STARSCREAM


                Agggggggh!  My foot!


ANGLE ON SPRINGER AND ARCEE


as they make it through an archway which TRANSFORMS INTO A STEEL
SHIELD as they run through


ON STARSCREAM - HIS FOOT STILL CAUGHT IN "CLAM" OF COURTYARD


He struggles to get free before he is crunched by the still
transforming city.


In the nick of time, he shoots a "shoe horn" like projection from
his wrist  and pulls his boot free,  then...


...dodges away.


... The "clam" shape RETRACTS COMPLETELY and more armored
shielding SLIDES INTO PLACE TO COVER where the Courtyard was.


He winces in mid-air and flies away as the city continues to
transform to a fortress below.


                                                        CUT TO:


ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TRANSFORMING CITY


The towers and buildings of the city, picot and retract..


... withdrawing like periscopes, turning and  vanishing into
steel shield coverings.


ON MEGATRON


as he FLIES OVER SCENE, BLASTING this way and that, shouting


                                MEGATRON


                Breach their defenses!


ON INSECTICONS


who are trailing Megatron, attack the fast CLOSING CITY, trying
to GNAW AND DEVOUR their way through the PORTS and BRIDGES
leading inside.


                                KICKBACK


                        (Chewing on jamb of doorway
                         near bridge)


                Delicious, eh Shrapnel?


                                SHRAPNEL


                        (CHEWING on draw-bridge to
                         City)


                A little heavy on the electrons.  Electrons.


                                                        ZOOM UP TO:


KUP, HOT ROD AND DANIEL


as Kup and Hot Rod are racing down mountain toward the
transforming city's drawbridge.


                                KUP (V.O.)


                The Insecticons are in our way.


                                HOT ROD (V.O.)


                Wrong!  They're our way in!  Yaaaaaaay-hah!


ANOTHER ANGLE


Hot Rod speeds up, passes Kup and...


... rides up and over Kickback's back, using it like a stunt
driver's ramp to...


... hurtle across the open space between Kickback and the doorway
into the city.


ON SHRAPNEL


As Shrapnel looks up and reacts...


...Kup hurtles up and over Kickback's back just as Kickback is
starting to rise to see what knocked him face down onto the
bridge in the first place.


... Kup goes SAILING OT OVER OPEN SPACE between Kickback's back
and the doorway into the city-


-clobbering Shrapnel, who is in the way and landing on the city
doorstep, driving in as...


THE DOORWAY


transforms, shutting down with metal shields with a "clank" sound
as Kickback and Shrapnel both leap at is to...


... bite Kup and Hot Rod and instead BREAK THEIR TEETH on steel
door, falling face down with a grunt as LAST BITS OF CITY
TRANSFORM.


                                                        CUT TO:


INT. CITY SIDE OF DRAWBRIDGE


as Kup and Hot Rod roll in and TRANSFORM where Ultra Magnus is
waiting for them with Perceptor.   Other Autobots are moving into
battle stations in the b.g. and ALARMS SOUND.


Daniel looks on in awe.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                        (sternly)
                You can explain your security violation later,
                Hot Rod!  Now, man your battle station.


                                HOT ROD


                I don't have to explain my so called violation
                to you or anyone...


                                KUP


                        (tugs him along roughly)
                He said "later!"


Kup moves OFF with Hot Rod and Daniel.


                                                        CUT TO:


BLASTER ON FORTIFIED " CROWS NEST" LOOKOUT TOWER


The "Crows Nest" has windows all around and Blaster's
seat rotates so he can watch action and broadcast battle reports
like a Top 40 Deejay.


Perceptor climbs up ladder into "Crows Nest" from lower level.
As Blaster speaks, we see Decepticons FIRING at the windows of
the Crows Nest but the bursts explode harmlessly against the
glass


                                BLASTER


                Lookout and shout!  Yow!


Explosions rock the Crows Nest.


Blaster swivels around and tilts to see...


BLASTER'S POV -  INSECTICONS


Chewing on armor plating at the lower edge of the fortified,
transformed city.


BLASTER

                bugs!
                        (FIRES Laser Cannon)


CANNON SWIVELS


LASER BLAST cooks out and we FOLLOW IT OFF SCREEN to...


THE INSECTICONS


as a Laser BLAST hurls Bombshell up and out of sight and causes
Shrapnel and Kickback to get sucked into the vacuum.


BLASTER


Perceptor joins him.


                                BLASTER


                        (joyful at his direct hit)
                I'm talkin' hits here, Autobuddies! Hits
                with a capital "aitch" like in Hard, Heavy and...
                        (sees Perceptor)
                Hey, Perceptor, what's shakin' other than
                this fortress?


BLASTS of enemy fire continue to rock the crows nest as Perceptor
answers


                                PERCEPTOR


                Blaster, Ultra Magnus sends orders to contact
                Optimus Prime for reinforcements.


                                BLASTER


                Alright!  Cover your receptors, Perceptor!


Blaster transforms to ghetto blaster mode and broadcasts VISIBLE
waves...


THE WAVES

                                BLASTER


                Optimus Prime...  Do you read me?  The Decepticons
                are blitzing Autobot City.  We're really takin' a
                pounding.  Don't know how much longer we can hold out.


ON WAVES SPREADING THROUGH SPACE


                                                        CUT TO:


MEGATRON LEADING ASSAULT ON TRANSFORMED AUTOBOT CITY


He is FIRING at ARMORED DOOR, trying to melt through when he
reacts to SOUND of Blaster's broadcast for help, stops, and looks
up at CROWS NEST.


                                MEGATRON


                Soundwave!  Jam that transmission.


ON SOUNDWAVE


SOUNDWAVE moves forward and starts heaving CASSETTES upwards
toward Blaster's Crows Nest position.


                                SOUNDWAVE


                Rumble!  Frenzy! Ravage! Ratbat! Eject!

                                RUMBLE


                First we crack the shell.  Then we crack the
                nuts inside.


INSIDE CROWS NEST

Blaster stops broadcasting.


                                BLASTER

STRIPES, a tiger, STINGER, a scorpion and BOLTS, a small, tough
robot.

ON STRIPES

making him yowl and run.


PERCEPTOR AND BLASTER

LONG SHOT -AUTOBOT CITY BESIEGED


The city shows gaps, dents, smoking holes and Decepticons continue
to pump fire into it and get back sporadic return fire from
inside as...


... Megatron moves INTO SHOT and fills THE SCREEN


                                MEGATRON


                Constructicons merge for the kill!


IN "PILLBOX" LIKE  GUN EMPLACEMENT IN CITY'S ARMORED WALL


Where Springer and Arcee clear the twisted remains of Autobot
defenders away from a CATAPULT LIKE TORPEDO LAUNCHER.


POV - THROUGH LAUNCHER PORT


we see the mountain where the Decepticons are getting ready for
the final charge.


                                SPRINGER


                Great! Megatron's making his big push
                and we can't even push...
                        (struggling to turn Catapult
                         around to re-aim it)
                ...back!


Arcee starts to push beside him.


THE HUGE CATAPULT


moves slowly as we CHANGE ANGLE and Kup, Hot Rod and Daniel ENTER
SHOT.


                                KUP


                Keep at it, Springer, lad! Help's at
                hand!
                        (to Hot Rod)
                Together now!


Hot Rod joins the others in pushing the huge Catapult into firing
position.


DANIEL


also leans against it, his small legs churning.


THE CATAPULT


starts moving easily now.


ON ARCEE BESIDE HOT ROD


Pushing on the busted catapult.


                                ARCEE


                        (pushing, manages to speak
                         to Hot Rod. She likes him
                         but doesn't want to go too
                         far)


                I was afraid you'd be trapped outside
                the city walls.


                                HOT ROD


                        (likes her, too, but tries to
                         be cool and collected)


                Hey, I wasn't worried for a micro-second, Arcee!


                                ARCEE


                        (enjoying letting him have
                         it)


                Then you probably didn't understand the situation.


Before Hot Rod can react, Kup steps back from repositioned
Catapult


                                KUP


                That did it!


DANIEL AT LAUNCHER PORT (Opening in "pillbox" through which the
Catapult will fire)

THEIR P.O.V. - THE CONSTRUCTICONS


as they start linking themselves together into enormous
DEVASTATOR.


                                KUP (V.O.)


                Devastator!


ON DEVASTATOR


as he rises up and starts FIRING, HAMMERING, TEARING AWAY at
metal shields which create armored walls of the transformed City.


WIDEN SHOT TO INCLUDE MEGATRON, STARSCREAM, DIRGE, ET, AL.


as they line up behind Devastator, FIRING INTO THE CITY, ready to
follow Devastator inside when he has torn the "roof" off.


ON SPRINGER, ARCEE, HOT ROD, KUP AT CATAPULT


as Springer LOADS TORPEDOES ONTO CATAPULT LIKE SLING


                                SPRINGER


                I got better things to do today than
                die.
                        (he FIRES Catapult)


ANGLE ON CATAPULT


as it HURLS FLAMING TORPEDO BOMBS one after the other out the
launch port and we FOLLOW THEM TO


MEGATRON AND OTHER DECEPTICONS


waiting for Devastator to open the way as a succession of
torpedo-bombs explode, knocking them aside, some of the
Torpedo-Bombs strike...


DEVASTATOR


and explode harmlessly as Devastator continues to grunt and tear
off armored layers of the city.  He grabs Hot Rod and Kup and
starts to crush them.


                                ARCEE
                Hot Rod!

INSIDE THE SPACE SHUTTLE - OPTIMUS PRIME WITH DINOBOTS


                                OPTIMUS PRIME


                Dinobots.  Destroy Devastator!

                Uhhhh! Me  Grimlock love challenge!
                Dinobots, transform!


DINOBOTS


transform into humanoid mode, and, with Grimlock at the front...


...fly out of the shuttle in wedge formation, blasting in unison.


FOLLOW DINOBOTS


In as they transform again and, in dino mode, swoop over to
Devastator...


DEVASTATOR


Roars towards the Dinobots.


THEIR BATTLE


shakes the Earth...


...buckling City walls, menacing the Autobots inside.  Hot Rod and
Kup are released during the struggle.


ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS


As they try to destroy Devastator...


...  Their strength is more than matched and soon
they are overwhelmed by him.


                                                        CUT TO:


EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD - MOMENTS LATER


Prime stands outside the dented shuttle with Sunstreaker and
Hound.  As he talks he shoots at a swarm of Decepticons who
battle their way towards him.


                                PRIME


                Megatron must be stopped.


                        (pause)


PRIME'S POV - MEGATRON


The Decepticon leader stands a hundred yards away, vanishing and
reappearing with the shifting waves of Generic Decepticons that
charge back and forth.


                                PRIME (V.O.)


                No matter the cost.


PRIME'S CHARGE:     A SERIES OF SHOTS


          PRIME'S CHARGE - HEROIC BATTLE THEME SONG
            Optimus Prime leader and hero of the Autobots
        charges into certain doom.  As he battles his way
        through the Decepticons, we HEAR an inspiring anthem
        of courage, strength and triumph, like "Eye of the
        Tiger".


        This theme will reprise during the film when the
        Autobots are battling at impossible odds.


He charges headlong into the Decepticon forces which separate him
from Megatron.


Decepticons  fire on  him, but he takes the shots, and...


Spinning and whirling like the Sundance Kid, he takes a lot out.


Then, Decepticons attempt to block his charge and Prime...
...  Like a  powerback, transforms to  Truck Mode and barrels
into them, sending Decepticons  flying around like shards of
glass hit by a .45.


...  finally, he  is engulfed by an incoming swarm, and it
looks like his attack is foiled.


MEGATRON


as he commands his troops.


                                MEGATRON


                Their defenses are broken.  Let the slaughter
                begin.


Then he turns and sees...


                                MEGATRON


                Prime!?


PRIME


smashing through a wall of lesser Decepticons.


                                PRIME


                One shall stand, one shall fall.


CLOSE ON MEGATRON


his eyes blazing with hatred.


                                MEGATRON


                Why throw away your life so recklessly?


ON OPTIMUS PRIME


Dirge takes a sneaky leap at him...


Optimus stiffarms him with a shuddering clank...


...then turns him upside down with one hand and...


...drives him headfirst into the rocky ground, letting him
crumple and fall.


                                OPTIMUS PRIME


                That's a question you should ask yourself.


MEGATRON


hurls himself at Optimus Prime...


.... both tumble into the walls of the City...


...denting the walls and causing the electronic panels inside to
short circuit, surrounding them with a fiery nimbus of crackling
electrical energy.


Ultra Magnus in car carrier mode barrels out of city carrying
several Autobots.  He and the others transform into robot mode
and fire lasers at the Decepticons.


INTERCUT TO HOT ROD, KUP, DANIEL, ARCEE, BLASTER, PERCEPTOR,
fighting their way to the battle of the titans.


                                HOT ROD


                We've got to save Prime!


Punching...


                                KUP


                That's his fight, lad!  Stay away.


Shooting..


...And charging.


ANGLE ON OPTIMUS AND MEGATRON


Megatron attempts to kick Prime in the throat...


...Prime catches his foot, twists it...


... and hurls Megatron backwards into a metal pile.


MEGATRON


grabs a jagged, spearlike piece of steel and hurls it at


PRIME


The steel "spear" pierces his side and sticks in him as...


... he charges Megatron,


...dodging shots from Megatron's gun to...


...deliver a huge UPPERCUT  which...


...lifts Megatron into the air so high that...


... his head butts sharply against overhanging concrete balcony,
mashing him down...


MEGATRON


lands and stealthily slips a laser dagger from his boot, turning
and slashing at...


PRIME


as he comes for him, tearing...


...a gash across Prime's midsection,  which spews smoke and
sparks and...


... dropping Prime to one knee.


                                MEGATRON


                        (gloating)
                Farewell, Prime!


As Megatron hurls the laser dagger as we CHANGE ANGLE to -
OPTIMUS PRIME


as he lifts chunks of broken concrete and catches the laser dagger
on it, tossing it aside as he lunges at-


MEGATRON


who claws his fingers and digs them into Prime's eyes


                                MEGATRON


                I'll rip out your optics!


Optimus grabs Megatron's clawed hand in one of his hands, twists
it in see-sawing test of strength which...


Optimus wins in a judo toss which sends Megatron -


- skidding face first through steel rubble, in a shower of sparks
until he crashes into the side of the city.


ANGLE ON HOT ROD


He dispatches a Decepticon and turns to Prime.


                                HOT ROD


                That's showing him, Optimus!


KUP


knocks two Decepticons on their tails and turns.


                                KUP


                Finish him off, Prime!  Do it now!


ON MEGATRON


as he spots a gun on the ground ahead of him


                                MEGATRON


                No more, Optimus Prime!  Grant me mercy,
                I beg of you!


ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING OPTIMUS PRIME AND HOT ROD


as Optimus Prime warily moves out to look down at the cowering
Megatron, keeping him in his gun sights.


                                OPTIMUS PRIME


                You who are without mercy now plead for
                it. I thought you were made of sterner
                stuff, Megatron!


ON HOT ROD


as he sees Megatron go for the gun and leaps out to grapple with
him


                                PRIME


                Out of the way, Hot Rod.


MEGATRON AND HOT ROD


as Hot Rod grabs for the Blaster -


- Megatron quickly gets Hot Rod in a headlock and using Hot Rod
as a shield, gets the gun and...


BLASTS PRIME IN THE WOUND HE'D MADE WITH HIS LASER DAGGER


ON OPTIMUS PRIME


his midsection now glowing and smoking, a huge hole where the
Blaster has struck.


ON MEGATRON


firing blaster again and again


                                MEGATRON


                Fall!  Fall!


Megatron tosses Hot Rod aside like a rag doll and stands above
the dying Prime.


                                MEGATRON


                I would have waited an eternity for this.
                Crawl, slave!  On your knees!


ON OPTIMUS PRIME


as he gathers his remaining strength and smashes Megatron with
both fists clasped together.


                                OPTIMUS PRIME


                        (gasping painfully)
                Never!


He bashes in Megatron's torso casing, fracturing the sides which
split, spilling wires, fuses, lights, circuitry.  Megatron falls!


Prime falls to his knees, tries to rise, collapses to his side
and falls slowly back.


HOT ROD runs over to him.


                                HOT ROD


                Optimus!  Forgive me!


ANOTHER ANGLE- MEGATRON


Starscream and other Decepticons stand over the smoking body.


                                STARSCREAM


                        (sarcastic, filled with
                         false sympathy)
                How do you feel, Mighty Megatron?
                        (he kicks Megatron)


                                MEGATRON


                        (weakly clutching at
                         Starscream's hand, gasping)
                Enshrine me!


                                STARSCREAM


                        (drops Megatron's hand
                         coldly, calls to other
                         Decepticons)


                Take this scrap to Cybertron!  Astrotrain,
                transform and get us out of here!


ANOTHER ANGLE- ASTROTRAIN


as he MOVES ONTO SCENE in Humanoid mode, showing battle burns
and scars.


Then, he converts to train mode, and rolls through a crowd of
generic Decepticons, crushing many under his wheels, as he makes
his way towards Starscream.


ANGLE ON THE EXODUS


Ramjet, Thrust, Dirge, the Constructicons, Soundwave and his
cassettes, et.al.  run towards Astrotrain.


ANGLE ON KUP AND ARCEE


They fight for a moment, then they notice their attackers are
beating feet...


                                ARCEE


                The Decepticons are retreating.


                                KUP


                Prime did it.  He turned the tide!


He shoots (O.S.) into...


A CROWD OF DECEPTICONS


Who fight each other for a place on the shuttle.


ANGLE ON STARSCREAM


dragging Megatron by one leg, callously disregarding the way
Megatron's head and upper body BUMP AND GET KNOCKED from
dragging.


THE AUTOBOTS


fire after them,  closing ranks on the shuttle, and pouring shots
into the melee.


ANGLE ON ASTROTRAIN


Decepticons make way for Starscream as he tosses the nearly
lifeless Megatron into the shuttle and gets in.


Then, standing at the door, he kicks other Decepticons away.


                                STARSCREAM


                Astrotrain, take off.


ANGLE ON ASTROTRAIN


The shuttle takes off, leaving a number of generic Decepticons
behind, who immediately raise their hands upon realizing that
they are surrounded by Autobots.


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


OPTIMUS PRIME


as he lies on an improvised bier-like platform, a profusion of
electricity discharging tubes and "plasma" bottle devices hooked
up to his arms and into his gaping middle wound.


SCANNERS


emit bleeps and show oscilloscopic patterns but sounds and wave
patterns are steadily growing weaker and weaker.


PERCEPTOR


is bent over Prime, in microscope mode, examining him...  He then
transforms and straightens up, his voice strained and cracking
with emotion.


                                PERCEPTOR


                I fear the wounds are...
                        (he can't finish what he's
                         going to say)


INTERCUT TO HOT ROD, KUP, ARCEE, DANIEL AND OTHER AUTOBOTS as
they react.


                                OPTIMUS PRIME


                        (using remaining strength
                         to makes himself heard)
                Autobots...do not grieve...
                Soon, I shall be one with the matrix.


                                HOT ROD


                        (a flash of hope)
                Prime!
                        (looks off at Prime)


HIS P.O.V. - OPTIMUS PRIME


His head is turned so all assembled can see. His eyes flicker
weakly, his voice RUMBLES with overtone of vast weariness and
resignation


                                OPTIMUS PRIME
                        
                        (reaches up with right hand
                         with great effort)
                Ultra Magnus!  It is to you, old friend,
                I shall pass the matrix as it was
                passed to me ....


ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING ULTRA MAGNUS


as he steps forward unwillingly, mixed grief and surprise on his
face


                                MAGNUS


                Prime, I'm just a soldier.  I'm not worthy.


                                OPTIMUS PRIME


                        (gasping)
                Nor was I, but one day, an Autobot
                shall rise from our ranks and use the powers of
                the Matrix to light our darkest hour.


TIGHT SHOT - ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME


Optimus Prime is tilted into half sitting position by other
Autobots manipulating the platform as Ultra Magnus grasps his
hand with great emotion


                                OPTIMUS PRIME


                        (voice failing, pressing
                         on with it)
                Until that day...
                Until all are one...
                Continue the struggle...
                        (sags, gasps, hanging on)
                Transfer the Matrix of Leadership.


TIGHTEN SHOT ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME


A distraught Ultra Magnus nods, reaches out with free hand and
points his forefinger at Optimus Prime's chest.


Then, pressing a button on Prime's chest, a small, secret doorway
opens, and we see something extremely bright glowing in there.


Ultra Magnus, nearly blinded by the intense light, reaches in,
and lifts out --


THE AUTOBOT LEADERSHIP MATRIX,


-- and holds it for a moment in his hand.


ANGLE ON ALL


The bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal, seems
to blind everybody and washes all color out of the shot.


Then, slowly, Ultra Magnus moves it into his own chest, closes
the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary, and
extremely powerful glow from his eyes.


ON KUP, HOT ROD, ARCEE AND PERCEPTOR


They are all full of great sorrow.


ON PRIME - HE DIES


All of his lights go out, including his eyes.


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


UNICRON


Rotating satellite dishes on the surface spark with electricity.
Dissolve inside Unicron to reveal scenes of Prime's death and the
passing of the Matrix to Ultra Magnus playing on various monitors.
Some of the scenes are in slow motion, others are sped up.  The
effect should be eerie.


                                                        CUT TO:


EXT. ASTROTRAIN


As it whizzes through the Solar System.


                                ASTROTRAIN


                Jettison some weight, or I'll
                never make it to Cybertron.


INT. ASTROTRAIN


The ship is packed with living, dead and wounded Decepticons.
Starscream addresses them like an Athenian Orator.


                                STARSCREAM


                Fellow Decepticons, Astrotrain has
                requested that we lighten our burden!


ANGLE ON BONECRUSHER


                                BONECRUSHER


                In that case, I say it's survival of the fittest.


                                STARSCREAM


                So I hear a second on that?


ASSORTED SHOTS


                                HEALTHY DECEPTICONS


                Aye!


                                STARSCREAM


                And against?


                                NOT HEALTHY DECEPTICONS (weakly)


                NAY!


                                STARSCREAM


                The ayes' have it!


A robotic hand flips a switch, and chaos ensues.  Strong
Decepticons start heave-hoing the weaker ones out into space.


                                DECEPTICONS


                                 (AD LIB)
                Beat it!  Spare me!


ANGLE ON STARSCREAM AND MEGATRON


Starscream picks him up and holds him up by the door.


                                STARSCREAM
                                (sarcastic)
                Oh, how it grieves me to do this.


                                MEGATRON
                Wait, I still function!


Starscream kicks him out.


                                STARSCREAM
                Wanna bet?


MEGATRON IN SPACE - TRACKING


He shakes his fist.


INT. THE SHIP


The last of the weak Decepticons is tossed, and the others dust
off their hands.


                                STARSCREAM


                Well, as Megatron has, how shall we say -
                departed.  I nominate myself as the new leader.


ON THE CONSTRUCTICONS


                                SCRAPPER


                The Constructicons form Devastator, the
                most powerful robot.  We should rule.


                                SOUNDWAVE


                Constructicons inferior.  Soundwave superior.


                                BONECRUSHER


                Who are you calling inferior.


                                HOOK


                Nobody would follow an uncharismatic
                bore like you.


The five cassettes:  BUZZSAW, FRENZY, RUMBLE, RAVAGE AND
LASERBEAK pop from his chest transform, and prepare to attack.


                                RUMBLE


                Hey, nobody calls Soundwave uncrazmatic.


                                FRENZY


                Yeah!  Let's kick tailgate.


THE CONSTRUCTICONS


try to form Devastator, but...


                                HOOK


                Constructicons, unite!


RUMBLE AND FRENZY


quake the ship so hard with their pile-driver arms that, with the
help of Laserbeak, Buzzsaw and Ravage, they keep knocking the
Constructicons off.


                                RUMBLE/FRENZY


                No way!


Over the battle.


                                BLITZWING


                I am a triple changer.  I am worth any
                two of you.  I should run things.


DIRGE


                                DIRGE


                Death comes to anyone who crosses me.


He attacks Blitzwing.


EXT. ASTROTRAIN - SAME TIME


He is flying a very wobbly course past Pluto...


                                ASTROTRAIN


                Stop squabbling or we're gonna crash.


DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. SPACE - LATER


Megatron and the other dented, dinged and dead Decepticon bodies
float through space.


we follow the wailing Megatron and the others down to:


THE SURFACE OF UNICRON


littering the otherwise beautiful technological expanse.


                                UNICRON


                Welcome, Megatron.


                                MEGATRON
                        
                        (looking around)
                Who said that?


                                UNICRON


                I am Unicron.


                                MEGATRON


                Show yourself!


                                UNICRON


                I have summoned you here for a purpose.


                                MEGATRON


                Nobody summons Megatron!


                                UNICRON


                Then it pleases me to be the first.


                                MEGATRON


                State your business.


                                UNICRON


                Bring me the Autobot Matrix.
                It is the one thing - the only
                thing that can stand in my way.


                                MEGATRON


                You have nothing to fear.  I have already
                crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands.


                                UNICRON


                You exaggerate.


                                MEGATRON


                The point is, he is dead!  And the
                Matrix died with him.


                                UNICRON


                No.  It has been passed to their new
                leader.  Get it for me.


                                MEGATRON


                Why should I?  What's in it for me?


                                UNICRON


                Your bargaining posture is highly
                dubious, but very well, I will provide
                you with a new body, and new troops to command.


                                MEGATRON


                And...


                                UNICRON


                And nothing.
                You belong to me now.


                                MEGATRON


                I belong to nobody.


                                UNICRON


                Perhaps I misjudged you.  Proceed
                on your way to oblivion.


The Mist appears and starts to dissolve Megatron.


                                MEGATRON


                        (pleading)
                No, no.  I accept your terms.  I accept!


                                UNICRON


                Excellent!  Behold - Galvatron!


X-ray images: wiring, circuitry, etc. flash on and off as a new
and larger being starts to form, changing from dented Megatron to
a huge, new creation: Galvatron.


THE TRANSFORMATION - CREATION


ends in a blinding flash and Galvatron - who still resembles
Megatron - laughs and flexes his muscles and stretches.  His
voice is deeper, different from Megatron's


                                GALVATRON
                
                Long live Galvatron!


                                UNICRON


                And these shall be your minions...


ANGLE ON OTHER DECEPTICONS


Their bodies are turned from battered Decepticons to...


SCOURGE


SCOURGE (Sweep character) is bearded, fanged and ferocious
looking and as soon as he has been CREATED, he roars and
stretches and an ARRAY OF SIMILAR CREATURES - smaller and all
wearing dark and matching uniforms - are INSTANTLY CREATED
FROM OTHERS behind him


                                UNICRON


                Scourge, the tracker....and his huntsmen...the
                Sweeps....


ON CYCLONUS  (NEW DECEPTICON WITH PLANE TRANSFORM ABILITY)


CYCLONUS is CREATED and then his "armada" of similar, but smaller
and similarly colored and clad creatures are formed.


                                UNICRON


                Cyclonus, the warrior...and his armada.....


ANGLE FEATURING GALVATRON


                                GALVATRON


                To Cybertron!


He roars with a mad power-rush, gets into Cyclonus (who will be
his personal ship) and leading the armada, takes off for the
distant stars.


                                UNICRON


                        (loudly proclaiming over
                         the scene)
                Bring me the Autobot matrix!


DURING UNICRON'S COMMAND we CHANGE ANGLE TO SHOW


LONG SHOT OF UNICRON


as Galvatron and his newly created force FLY UP AND AWAY with
great speed.


                                GALVATRON


                I will rip open Autobot after Autobot until
                it is yours, Unicron.


                                                        CUT TO:


THE DECEPTICON HALL OF HEROES - STARSCREAM


This is the closest thing the Decepticons have to a throne room.
It is a massive, circular room with tombs of old leaders, and a
raised area where Starscream stands.


STARSCREAM AND OTHERS


The Decepticon plane looks slightly ridiculous with cloak on his
shoulders and Thrust and Ramjet at his side, weapons held high,
but ready for action should anybody question Starscream's rule.


In front of him stands Astrotrain holding a huge Metallic CROWN
over his head.


OTHER DECEPTICONS


in neat ranks but their grim expressions show their displeasure.


                                STARSCREAM


                        (preening)


                Get on with the ceremony!


Dirge and others react to EERIE SOUNDS and look up and off.


Starscream looks where others are looking and reacts.


HIS P.O.V. - GALVATRON AND HIS FORCES


as they descend in Hall of Heroes and Galvatron moves out to
confront Starscream


ON STARSCREAM AND GALVATRON


                                STARSCREAM


                Who disrupts my coronation?


                                GALVATRON


                Coronation?  This is bad comedy!


                                STARSCREAM


                Megatron, is that you?


                                GALVATRON


                Here's a clue!


HIS P.O.V -GALVATRON


as Galvatron transforms into cannon, FIRING A HUGE BURST
ON STARSCREAM


as BLAST hits him.  For a moment, he retains his shape then piece
by piece, he falls apart.


Only a pair of boots remain on the floor.


GALVATRON


He transforms back to robot mode and confronts other Decepticons
boastfully.


                                GALVATRON
                
                Will anyone else attempt to fill his
                shoes?

                What did he say his name was.


                He didn't.


                                GALVATRON


                Galvatron.

UNICRON


Bit by bit, we see new sections of the planet being generated.


Then, the sinister mist we saw at the beginning of the film
starts pouring out.


He's about to do the big munch on.. 


THE FIRST MOON OF CYBERTRON -


PUSH IN TO - JAZZ AND CLIFFJUMPER


Standing outside the "netted" complex, looking off at...


UNICRON


A strange, LOUD HUM fills the air and the ground heaves and
SHAKES beneath their feet

                Where'd that come from?!


                                CLIFFJUMPER


                Who cares?  I'm more worried about where it's going!


                                JAZZ


                        (on communicator device)

AUTOBOT CITY- EARTH -LONG SHOT


Autobot City is almost rebuilt, and we see Kup and Hot Rod working
with other Autobots to move large panels into position.  In the
background, two huge SPACE SHUTTLES are almost completed and
Ultra Magnus is directing the work.  During this ESTABLISHING
SERIES OF SHOTS, we HEAR JAZZ'S VOICE OVER


                                JAZZ (V.O.-FILTER)

OUTSIDE OF LARGE SPACE SHUTTLE UNDER CONSTRUCTION


Springer and Arcee fit a hull section in place with Daniel
motioning to them, directing the action.


BLASTER


He reacts to muffled transmission from Jazz.


                                BLASTER


                I'm pickin' up a faint signal!


BLASTER TRANSFORMS to blaster mode and Jazz's VOICE is broadcast
loud and clear causing Springer, Arcee, and Daniel to react


                                JAZZ (V.O.-ON FILTER)


                This is Jazz.  I gi-normous weird lookin'

THE FIRST MOON


is covered by Unicron's energy field, and slowly seems to
dissolve.


ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING UNICRON


a great maw works more intensely crushing bits of the planet.


                                                        CUT TO:


JAZZ AND CLIFFJUMPER ON THAT MOON


as quakes, tremors and cyclonic winds toss and tear at all
structures on the moon and the energy field closes in on Jazz and
Cliffjumper - who, using handholds every step of the way - et
into


AN ESCAPE POD VEHICLE


as Unicron looms larger, larger, the energy field seems to
dissolve the landscape.


                                JAZZ    
                Got ...to....blast free....if we can.....


They get in and start retro blasters, the flame of blasters
whirling in wild winds as moon is engulfed.


                                                        CUT TO:

SOUNDS of torrential winds, quakes, etc as moon is quickly
becoming Unicron's lunch.

                Hit it!


ON ESCAPE POD


as it BLASTS OFF and away from Unicron with an EXPLOSION.


For a moment, it looks like they are going to get clean away,
but...


ANOTHER ANGLE


Suddenly it is pulled deep into Unicron.


ANOTHER ANGLE - THE MOON


as Moon shatters like a hollow egg and is sucked completely into
Unicron's maw which closes around it with a snap.


                                                        CUT TO:


GALVATRON IN DECEPTICON HALL OF HEROES


Silence. No more winds. No more movement.

                How dare Unicron?!
                        (defiant)
                Cybertron and all it's moons are mine!


ANOTHER ANGLE ON GALVATRON


His body starts to twist making him writhe in pain powerless to
resist


                                SCOURGE


                But remember, WE belong to HIM!


                                GALVATRON


                        (gasping for breath,
                         writhing, nods)
                I....will obey, Unicron!  Decepticons, to Earth!


The torture stops and Galvatron clutches his throat and tries to
regain his composure as we...


                                                        CUT TO:


EXT. AUTOBOT CITY -- ULTRA MAGNUS


He has a portable communication device.  Spike and Bumble can be
seen on it.  Springer, Kup, the Dinobots, Blurr, and Hot Rod
look on amid general gathering of Autobots.  Arcee holds Daniel
up on her shoulder so he can see.  Blaster is in b.g.


                                SPIKE


                It's like a terrible nightmare, Ultra Magnus.


                                BUMBLEBEE


                This thing - this juggernaut just ripped the
                first moon to shreds.


                                SPIKE


                And it's heading this way.


                                BUMBLEBEE


                We'll try 'n slow it down...


                                SPIKE


                But you'd better get here fast because...


Suddenly, static obscures the transmission.


                                DANIEL


                Dad!


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Autobots, prepare to board the shuttles.
                This new menace is more dangerous than all the
                Decepticons put together.  Somehow we must
                destroy it before it devours Cybertron.


                                DANIEL


                But what about my dad?  He's on the moon 
                between that monster and Cybertron.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Daniel, I'll do everything I can for Spike.


                                HOT ROD


                And what are we going to do when we get
                there?  If that thing crunches moons, it'll
                make short work of us.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Maybe the Matrix can stop it.


                                HOT ROD


                You're right!  It can.


                                KUP


                What do you know about it lad?


                                HOT ROD


                It's just a feeling.


Hot Rod looks up and sees something.


                                KUP
                
                Look!


THE AUTOBOTS TURN TO SEE


POV - ANGLE ON ATTACKING DECEPTICONS


Decepticon ships seem to dive from nowhere to attack the
Autobots.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                To the shuttles!!!


ANGLE ON DECEPTICON JETS


Galvatron is in the lead.


                                GALVATRON


                There is no escape.  I, Galvatron
                will crush you just as the magnificent Megatron
                crushed Prime!


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                And you'll die trying just like Megatron!


Ultra Magnus fires Laser and hits Galvatron.


                                GALVATRON


                aaaaaaaah!  Autobot cur!!


                                CYCLONUS


                You want me to gut Ultra Magnus for you?


                                GALVATRON


                There are plenty of Autobots for you.
                Ultra Magnus is mine!


THE BATTLE - QUICK CUT


Decepticons dive on fleeing Autobots.


ANGLE - ARCEE AND DANIEL


As Daniel looks up and Arcee moves over to him protectively.


Hot Rod looks at Arcee in the same way she is looking at Daniel.


                                ARCEE


                Stay close to me, Daniel...


                                HOT ROD


                        (to Arcee)
                And you better stay close to me...


Arcee pulls Hot Rod toward her before he gets hit by laser


                                ARCEE


                No, you'd better stay close to me.


Blurr is trying to get Grimlock into Shuttle with the rest of the
Dinobots as Decepticon FIRE COMES IN ALL AROUND. Grimlock is like
a "spooked horse" refusing to be shut in the barn.


                                BLURR


                        (pleading with him, shoving
                         him, talking very, very
                         rapidly)


                Nice Dino, good, Dino, sweet Dino!  Won't
                you step into the nice spaceship for Blurr?
                Please, pretty please.


                                GRIMLOCK


                        (sticking head out past
                         struggling Blurr)
                Me, Grimlock, not "nice Dino!" Me bash brains!


HIS P.O.V. - SEVERAL DECEPTICON JETS COMING AT HIM


GRIMLOCK


He gives FIRE BREATHING BLAST AT JETS as they go by STRAFING THE
SHUTTLE , SHOTS RICOCHETING AROUND GRIMLOCK AND BLURR


THE DECEPTICON JETS


as Grimlock's BLAST SETS THEM ALL ON FIRE and they spin into one


another as we CHANGE ANGLE TO


ULTRA MAGNUS


as Kup, Hot Rod and Arcee MOVE INTO SCENE BEHIND HIM


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Kup, Hot Rod.  Get the Dinobots out of here!


KUP AND HOT ROD


as they run into Dinobot Shuttle, retracting their entry ramp in
HAIL OF FIRE FROM SCOURGE AND HIS SWEEPS.


ON SCOURGE


as he TRANSFORMS to Humanoid mode and shouts orders, FIRING AT
Blurr who BLURRS PAST and then at Arcee who also SHIPS BY


                                SCOURGE


                No survivors!


IN DINOBOT SHUTTLE


as Hot Rod squeezes past   Sludge Swoop, and Slag to join Kup who
is already at control deck where Grimlock sticks his head down to
look out the window. Kup shoves him aside.


                                KUP


                This reminds me of the battle on Alpha 9, when the
                Petro-Rabbits were...(annoyed) Grimlock, get your
                noodle out of my face!
                        (starts throwing switches)


                                GRIMLOCK


                Me, Grimlock, love Kup's war stories!


                                KUP


                You're living one now!
                        (to Hot Rod)
                Engage the boosters for Cybertron's sake!


Hot Rod nods and quickly passes his hand over bank of SWITCHES
all of which GLOW AND PULSE with the action.


ANOTHER ANGLE


as DECEPTICON FIREBALL COMES UP and SPLATTERS AGAINST WINDOW,
sending tongues of fire running across the glass behind Hot Rod's
head


                                HOT ROD


                You got 'em!


BACK TO KUP AND GRIMLOCK


Grimlock still trying to stick his face in the control panel as
Kup works furiously and more DECEPTICON FIRE HITS THE SHIP


                                GRIMLOCK


                        (to Kup)
                Tell Grimlock about Petro-Rabbits again.


                                KUP


                        (muttering, using joystick)
                I'll give you Petro-Rabbits.  Contact!


The Shuttle lurches and shakes


ANGLE ON SHUTTLE WITH DINOBOTS


It takes off amidst a hail of Decepticon fire.


                                HOT ROD (V.O.)


                Yaaaaaaaaho! We're airborne!

ANOTHER PART OF SHUTTLE LAUNCH AREA


Springer springs onto scene with Daniel, Ultra Magnus and
Perceptor are guarding the entry ramp, firing at Decepticons.


                                SPRINGER


                        (to Daniel)
                Looks like we're shipmates, squirt!


                                DANIEL


                All right!


                                SPRINGER


                But if you get space sick, you're gonna
                walk home.


ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING ULTRA MAGNUS AND PERCEPTOR


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Hurry!




Blurr blurs up ramp.  Arcee reaches the ramp as the shuttle takes
off horizontally.


ON BOARD THE SHUTTLE- ANGLE ON SPRINGER


as he reaches down for Arcee.


                                SPRINGER


                Jump.


ON ARCEE


still  going up the ramp while the shuttle slowly leaves the
ground.


Just as the  wind and gravity are about to knock her off, she
jumps up  and...


INSIDE THE SHUTTLE


Springer grabs her hand and pulls her in, narrowly avoiding a
barrage


Daniel is watching, terrified.


                                DANIEL


                That was close!


Concussion of Decepticon hit rocks the shuttle


                                SPRINGER


                Believe it or not, this is the fun part.


IN "COCKPIT" OF ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE


Ultra Magnus is at control deck with Perceptor as they "taxi" for
launch and we see oncoming Decepticon jets firing at them


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                No time to preheat....Can this ship take
                it?


                                PERCEPTOR


                With an accelerated ignition procedure
                the ceramic housings might create a magnetic

                        (baffled)
                What?

                         forward)
                He says "go for it!"


Powerful rockets ignite, and the shuttle  SHAKES with the sound.


ANGLE ON RUNWAY


The Shuttle's rockets surge, melting the pursuing  Sweeps as the
Shuttle hits the sky and soars upwards.


ON DINOBOT SHUTTLE


Cyclonus' Jets  fire on it, as we CHANGE ANGLE


ON ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE


It roars up behind Cyclonus' jets and overtakes and smashes
through them, scattering them as it pulls up alongside the
Dinobot shuttle


INT. DINOBOT SHUTTLE- KUP AND HOT ROD IN "COCKPIT"


Grimlock is peering out of the side ports.


HOT ROD

ANOTHER ANGLE


INCLUDING Ultra Magnus' shuttle through side port as Springer
gives thumbs up signal in return and Daniel waves


ON SPRINGER


as he turns and reacts, looking straight up and ahead


                                SPRINGER


                It ought to be smooth sailin' from here on in.


ON ASTROTRAIN AND DECEPTICON JETS


                                ASTROTRAIN


                Fuse them!


Astrotrain starts diving into upcoming Shuttles BLASTING AWAY.


INT. DINOBOT SHUTTLE - "COCKPIT"


as Kup struggles to hold controls, his shuttle also ROCKING from
direct hits


                                KUP


                        (using intercom)


                Ultra Magnus...what next?


INT. ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE - "COCKPIT"


shuttle ROCKS WITH DIRECT HITS as Ultra Magnus struggles with
controls


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Remember what we did off Beta Four!


                                KUP


                I remember it well.


ON THE SHUTTLES


They fire (O.S.) at...


A LARGE ASTEROID


With incredible precision, the rays strike the asteroid,
splitting it in two parts.


ANGLE ON ONE OF THE ASTEROID HALVES


It shoots through space and strikes another asteroid, which,
breaks into several pieces, many of them angling back towards...


GALVATRON'S SHIPS


which swerve to  avoid them as....


THE OTHER ASTEROID PART


Hits another moon or asteroid  or general rock in space, doing
the same thing...


WIDEN SHOT to show that the pieces are shooting around like pool
balls after an incredibly violent  break...


...  zinging into each other...


....  Narrowly missing Galvatron's ship...


... Filling space with incredible amounts of Dust, lava  from


inside the moons, multi-colored gasses, explosions and generally


making a mess of space.  (Note: think of this scene as the


"Asteroids" video game.)


ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOT SHUTTLES


As all of this is going on, they jam into hyperspace...


... Corkscrewing and arcing off into the galaxy, leaving only


blurred images of themselves as...


GALVATRON'S SHIP


emerges from the chaos.


ON CYCLONUS


                                CYCLONUS


                The explosions jammed my sensors.
                        (pause)
                I have lost track of the Autobots!


ON GALVATRON


                                GALVATRON


                Damn it!!  They did the same thing
                to me off Beta four!


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


DEEP AND SERENE SPACE - ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE AND DINOBOT
SHUTTLE


                Possible song - optimistic adventure
                with the suggestion that all dreams
                might not happen.




as both shuttles soar majestically through the vast depth of
infinite space.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS (V.O.)


                Congratulations Autobots, we've lost
                'em at least for a while.  So rest up.  We'll
                refuel on the Junk Planet and work out our
                battle plan there.


INT. DINOBOT SHUTTLE - KUP


Kup sits spinning yarns, leaning back in chair as Grimlock,
Sludge, Slag and Swoop lie, lounge, sit with chin on hands, all
listening like little kids to a bedtime story - in rapt attention


                                KUP
                Yep, I remember the dust was so thick off Beta 4
                had to use windshield wipers on your optic
                sensors....


                                GRIMLOCK
                        (impatiently)
                Me, Grimlock, know all about wipers!
                Want to hear good part of story!


                                SWOOP
                        (beating wings rapidly,
                         excitedly)
                Good part, Kup! Tell Swoop good part!


         SLUDGE                                  SLAG


     (excitedly)                          (beating tail on
   Unh unh unh....                         floor)
                                          Good part...tell
                                          ...tell...


                                KUP
                Okay, Okay.  The dust was really thick and
                then this gigantic Ick Yak...


ON HOT ROD


He is practicing sparring with a SPINNING AUTO-COMBATANT - a very
high tech quintain with many arms, legs, and weapons that test
the user's skills, and reflexes.


Hot Rod wears sparring gauntlet, and holds a small LASER DAGGER
and special shield.


As he lowers shield and reacts to Dinobot reactions to Kup's
story.


                                HOT ROD


                Don't you think we have better things
                to do now than tell stories Kup?


                                KUP


                Like what?


                                HOT ROD


                Like maybe figure out how we're gonna stay alive.


                                DINOBOTS
                        (ALL SHUSH HIM)


As he is speaking, Auto-Combatant "sees" its opening and gives
Hot Rod a swift kick in the rear, sending him flying (o.s.)


THE AUTO COMBATANT


Then hammers its fists on top of his head...


ON HOT ROD


Irked.


                                HOT ROD
                        (continuing)
                Time out, for Cybertron's sake!


ON AUTO-COMBATANT'S FACE
as it sticks out a metal tongue and gives him a LOUD RASPBERRY


BACK TO SCENE


as Hot Rod  rises and draws his fist back to clobber the


Auto-Combatant


                                AUTO COMBATANT
                        (mechanically, quickly)
                Time out, time out, time out!


Suddenly, the shuttle rocks from impact and SPARKS and flames
shoot out of large hole in wall


ON ULTRA MAGNUS AT CONSOLE INTERCOM


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Kup! Raise your force fields at once!  They're
                armed with.....


ON GALVATRON ON "BRIDGE" OF FLAT TOP


as he presses firing button ...


                                ULTRA MAGNUS (V.O.)
                Moleculon Missiles!


ANGLE ON GALVATRON'S CARRIER


Particularly deadly looking missiles shoot out.


ANGLE ON THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE


It zooms towards a whopper of a planet, surrounded by several
small moons.  We will later learn that this planet is Quintesson,
but for now, it's mysterious.


The moleculon missiles streak after it like sidewinders.


INT. THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE


Kup and Hot Rod pilot the thing for all it's worth.


                                HOT ROD
                They're closing on us!


                                KUP
                Yep, like the shrikebats of Dromedon!


                                HOT ROD
                Yeah, how'd you beat them?


                                KUP
                I'm trying to remember...there were an awful
                lot of casualties that day...


ANGLE ON THE SHUTTLE AND MISSILES


The missiles streak toward them.


                                KUP (O.S.)
                Oh yeah, we inversed polarities.


                                HOT ROD (O.S.)
                That'll tear the ship apart!


                                KUP (O.S.)
                You got a better idea?!!


With that, the ship seems to stop, on a dime, in mid air!


The missiles zoom past it.


INT. THE SHIP (KUP AND HOT ROD)


Hot Rod watches wide-eyed, as Kup watches ahead warily, hands on
the controls.


                                HOT ROD


                Okay, so you were right.


                                KUP


                Don't run your programs until they're debugged.


ANGLE OUT THE VIEWSCREEN


Suddenly, the moleculon missiles, reverse course and start coming
back.


                                HOT ROD
                They're coming back.


                                KUP
                Let's just hope we've screwed up their
                trajectories.


ANGLE ON THE MISSILES


The missiles sidewind towards them, then their paths cross and
BOOOM!


Everything flashes white.


ANGLE ON THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE


                                HOT ROD
                Whew!!!


INT. THE DINOBOT SHUTTLE


Kup and Hot Rod look forward, their eyes, blinking, as if
strained.


                                KUP
                Yep, I thought we'd had it that time
                for sure.


EXT. ANGLE ON THE SHIP


It sits next to a gigantic alien-made moon.  Suddenly, a hatch
opens and a massive grabber that looks like a lobster  claw
shoots out at it.


ANGLE ON HOT ROD


He sees the claw coming out of the viewscreen.


                                HOT ROD
                Dive!


ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN


The claw snaps on the front of the ship, smashing the window
and...


ANOTHER ANGLE


crushing the area between Hot Rod and Kup.


SPACE - ANGLE ON THE SHIP


As it explodes, flinging the Autobots inside down toward the
Quintesson's planet.

Perceptor slowly plots coordinates on light-up table, oblivious
to


SHAKES AND ROCKINGS of their ship.


                                SPRINGER


                Kup and Hot Rod just bought it!


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                I can't deal with that now.


                                SPRINGER


                Face it, Magnus, the Decepticons 're
                gonna dog us until they see us dead!


Ultra Magnus nods solemnly


                                ULTRA MAGNUS
                        (cryptic)


                Then that's exactly what they're gonna
                see.


                                                        CUT TO:


THE DECEPTICON FLAT TOP AND CYCLONUS' ARMADA


ON GALVATRON
as he works controls which eject more Moleculon Missiles.


HIS P.O.V. - ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE


electrical outline envelopes it and there is a...
... blinding flash after which...
..  remnants of the hull and superstructure explode toward camera
and past camera accompanied by explosive sound and then, silence!
... Where the shuttle had been there is now...nothing!  Just loose
asteroids and clouds of space dust


                                CYCLONUS


                The Autobots have been terminated!


                                GALVATRON


                Excellent.  And soon we shall say the
                same of that infernal Unicron.


Suddenly, Galvatron's body begins to twist, and he writhes in
pain.


                                GALVATRON (CONT)


                Aaaah!  Take me to Unicron...Aaaah!


LONG SHOT ON THE HUGE FLAT TOP


as it veers off and away from the space cloud, followed by
Cyclonus' Armada.


Hold for a beat, and then CLOSE IN on the dust cloud as...


... part of Ultra Magnus' shuttle flies into the clear.


ANGLE ON THE COCKPIT


Arcee, Perceptor, Springer, Blurr are crowded together in cramped
remnant of cockpit as Daniel and Ultra Magnus sit at the control
deck


                                ARCEE


                Did we have to detonate three- quarters
                of the ship?!


                                SPRINGER


                Seeing how they would have detonated
                four quarters, I think it was a good choice.


SUDDEN SHUDDER AND THE SHIP DROPS SHARPLY, all holding on to each
other and to any protruding handhold


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Perceptor....can you still locate the Junk Planet?


                                PERCEPTOR


                Gamma waves in this sector of space create
                marginal navigation probabilities, however.....

ULTRA MAGNUS


Holds his head in his hands as Springer grimaces


RESUME ON PERCEPTOR


realizes he's overdoing it again, clears his throat


                                PERCEPTOR


                Ahem.....yes I think I can.


LONG SHOT- SHUTTLE CHANGING COURSE TOWARD LARGE DISTANT PLANET


which we see as dim shadow on the edge of space


                                                        CUT TO:


A small, falling object appears high above Quintesson and hurtles
down, down, over and over until it is in view and we see it is...


HOT ROD


still cartwheeling down toward the planet below, trying to change
the angle of his fall


HOT ROD - TRACKING


He plummets down through layers of atmosphere and continues to
fall past shiny rock pinnacles of unusual construction as we
CHANGE ANGLES TO


AERIAL VIEW OVER A VAST SEA OF LIQUID ENERGY


as Hot Rod falls into the sea, we CUT TO


THE SILVERY ENERGY SEA


Hot Rod sinks to the bottom where he collides with...


... a metallic reef, bounces, manages to right himself, shaking
his head as he regains equilibrium, and...


Then he transforms into auto mode modified for undersea action
and starts riding off as he calls through intercom.


                                HOT ROD


                        (bubbling, filtered voice)
                Kup....Grimlock?   Slag!....Anybody?


WE FOLLOW him through undersea world as he rounds a "corner" of
the Reef Wall and reacts


HIS P.O.V. - A HUGE, MECHANICAL 0 SQUID CREATURE


The ROBOTOID SQUID is tearing Kup to pieces and tossing the
pieces across the ocean floor with its silvery metal tentacles


ON HOT ROD


                                HOT ROD


                Kup!


He transforms and blasts...


THE SQUID


angrily streaks toward Hot Rod.


HOT ROD


Fires at the Squid, but not stopping him.


ANOTHER ANGLE


Hot Rod's shot plinks off a couple of tentacles, but the squid
keeps coming...


... Wraps his tentacles around Hot Rod and starts crushing...


... Hot Rod looks like he's about to be crushed, but he...


... Shoots


... Its hideous Optical Sensor.


THE SQUID


releases a laser print ink stream which boils out in the water in
a series of dots and "x" shapes and retreats.


                                HOT ROD


                Don't worry, I'm not coming after you.


HOT ROD


lowers his head and blows blast of air through head-piece.  The
air blast clears the water, revealing Kup's head and torso half
buried in the "sand"


ON HOT ROD AND KUP'S HEAD


as hot Rod kneels


                                HOT ROD


                Kup!  Say something!


CLOSE ON KUP'S HEAD


as he turns head around to look up at Hot Rod and spits out a
mouthful of sand


                                KUP


                        (bubbling as he speaks)
                Fix me!


                                HOT ROD


                Sure, Kup....right away!


Hot Rod rapidly PULLS KUP'S SCATTERED BODY PARTS TOGETHER.


                                                        CUT TO:


KUP AND HOT ROD ON THE RED DESERT SHORE OF THE ENERGY SEA


Kup stands impatiently while Hot Rod reassembles them.


                                HOT ROD


                Well...what do you think?


Kup feels his elbow joint, twists his neck side to side and gets
creaks and squeaks and moves legs in odd, creaky way as he is
trying himself out.


                                KUP


                        (a beat, then grimaces)
                There's a piece missing.


                                HOT ROD


                No way....
                        (sifts through pile of
                         SCRAP METAL PARTS lying
                         at Kup's feet)


                See, this wasn't yours...it's some kind
                of prehistoric ion cruncher....and this
                doohickey looks like a funky energon
                funnel...  and this...


                                KUP
                        (moving up and back, bending
                         arms and hands, CREAKING,
                         CLUNKING, SQUEAKING)


                Well, I still think I'm short a part!
                        (sees Hot Rod hang his head)
                But all things considered, you did an
                amazing job, lad!  Amazing!


                                HOT ROD
                        (brightening)


                Really?


                                KUP
                        (rotates arm rapidly)


                Yeah, you even got rid of a nasty burr on my
                rotator!  Now, let's find the Dinos and
                get off this twisted planet!


ON KUP


as he transforms it's evident that a fender is misplaced and a
wheel mounted improperly so it wobbles and he rides unevenly with
much chugging and oil spewing


                                KUP (V.O.)
                        (in vehicular mode)


                Of all the circuit glitched diode blowin'
                dim-wittery...  I told you a part was
                missin'.


we watch Hot Rod and Kup move off into the distance as we:


DISSOLVE TO:


ANOTHER PART OF QUINTESSON


Kup and Hot Rod walk along a swampy, marshy area.


Suddenly, there are several loud gurgles, and we can see the
shapes of something terrible emerging through the muck.


Hot Rod spins to fire, but Kup bats down his arm.


PAN TO SHOW


EIGHT SHARKTICONS (in humanoid mode) surrounding them.  The
Sharkticons are smaller than the Autobots, but they look ugly and
vicious.


                                KUP


                Don't act hostile.  I'll use the universal greeting.


                                HOT ROD


                Universal Greeting.


                                KUP


                Watch.  I'll have them eating out of
                my hand.


                                HOT ROD


                Or our faces.


Kup holds out his hands to show that he has no weapon.  Then, he
addresses them...


                                KUP


                Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong...


                                HOT ROD
                        (mocking, mimicking)


                Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong...


The Sharkticons look interested.


                                SHARKTICONS


                        (GROWL VERSION OF THE SAME
                         THING)


                                
                                KUP
                See, the Universal Greeting works every
                time.
                        (pause)
                Now, without making any sudden moves,
                give them an Energon goody.


Kup reaches into his belt, presses a button and pulls out an
Energon cube.  Hot Rod, somewhat suspicious of the whole process
does the came.


They hold out the cubes and two of the Sharkticons take the
Energon cubes, like dogs getting a treat.


Then, the other six show up looking for cubes.


                                HOT ROD
                This is getting expensive.


                                KUP
                Don't worry, they'll reciprocate.


They each hand out three Energon goodies to the remaining six
Sharkticons... The Sharkticons eat them happily.


Then, they back off, eyeing the two Autobots with menace.




                                HOT ROD


                I thought they were supposed to reciprocate.


                                KUP


                        (not sure of himself)


                Customs vary from place to place.


Suddenly, the Sharkticons transform to their vicious mode and
lunge at them.


The two robots, taken by surprise, fall backwards.


PAN FROM the fallen robots to an area behind a tree.  For just a
moment, we see a small yellow Autobot in robot mode.  There, then,
as quickly as we realize what it is, it transforms into automode
and vanishes in a flash.
It was Wheelie.


THE SHARKTICON CAMP ON QUINTESSON - KUP, HOT ROD AND SHARKTICONS


Sharkticons march Kup and Hot Rod into a HOLDING PEN within a
walled compound.


As we FOLLOW THEM INTO PEN we PULL BACK and PAN to establish that
entry procession is being watched by...


THE QUINTESSONS


slender, spindly framed robotic creatures with oversized five
sided heads, each side bearing a different mechanistic face with
a different expression on each - smiling, angry, grimacing,
suspicious and the fifth face is not yet to be seen.


As Hot Rod and Kup are led to certain death in the Quintesson
dungeons, harsh, dissonant, metallic and terrifying music plays,
underscoring the brutal evil they face,


                                KUP (V.O.)


                Reminds me of the Niter Slave Mines on
                Golgonath Seven....


                                HOT ROD


                Every place reminds you of some place
                else.....


                                KUP (V.O.)


                Experience, lad.  You should learn to appreciate
                it.


                                HOT ROD


                A lot of good it's done us so far!


ON HOT ROD AND KUP


as Hot Rod looks around and reacts sharply


HIS P.O.V.- THE QUINTESSONS


as we feature the Leader Quintesson who is taller and wears a
different color robe from others.  He is watching arrival of Kup
and Hot Rod and his faces rotate so it goes from smiling face to
suspicious face to angry face to furious grimace.


RESUME ON HOT ROD AND KUP


as Sharkticons shove and prod them, JOLTING them into the holding
pen and locking the gate.


Then, they install RESTRAINING BOLTS.


                                HOT ROD


                I can't transform!


                                KUP


                They're restraining bolts, lad.


                                HOT ROD


                        (looking around)
                We got to get a new travel agent....  What
                is this place?


PAN FROM HIS P.O.V. - A SHADOWED, ALCOVE LIKE HUT


as a figure moves forward slightly and speaks in a harsh, bass'o
voice.  It is GRANIX.  We saw him in the first scene, escaping
from his planet when Unicron ate it.
  {Note: The script says *G*ranix here.  Not my mistake.}
                                
                                KRANIX


                The world of the savage Sharkticons and their
                cruel masters the Quintessons.  They hunt down
                those who try to escape the wrath of Unicron,
                and put them on trial.


                                KUP


                But what if they're innocent?


                                KRANIX


                Guilty or innocent, the sentence is always the
                same - death!


                                HOT ROD


                Unicron?!  Who's Unicron?


                                KRANIX


                A planet six times the size of this one that
                absorbs everything in its path.


                                KUP


                So that's the monster's name.


                                HOT ROD


                I wonder if there's any connection between
                it and Galvatron.


Suddenly, a Quintesson Guard roars in...


                                QUINTESSON GUARD (V.O.)


                That one!


All turn and look off, reacting as two Guards thunder in, grab
Granix and pull him back out of the door.
  {NOTE: Another instance of the spelling of Granix}


ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE LEAD QUINTESSON


as he points at Kup and Hot Rod


                                QUINTESSON GUARD


                Soon, you too shall receive your sentence.


THEIR POV  - OUT THE WINDOW THE ARENA


Kranix stands on what almost looks like a wide diving board over
a watery (or oily) pit teeming with Sharkticons.


                                LEAD QUINTESSON


                Jury, have you reached a verdict?


                                JUROR #1


                We have your honor.


                                LEAD QUINTESSON


                        (to jury of Quintessons)
                Guilty.....Or innocent.  I repeat.


                                KRANIX


                Spare me this mockery of justice.


                                LEAD QUINTESSON
                
                I repeat, guilty...or innocent.


                                JURORS


                Guilty!!


Jury's faces rotate to fifth expression - a DEATH'S HEAD


ON GRANIX   {NOTE: Yet another, final, reference to Kranix as Granix}


Suddenly, the Robot is dumped into a pit of teeming Sharkticons
and there is a mad frenzy.


In moments, he is no more.


ANGLE ON KUP


He watches grimly through the bars.


                                KUP


                Not the end I'd wish for, lad.


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


THE EDGE OF A HUGE, SHADOWY PLANET IN SPACE


as Ultra Magnus' Shuttle is BUFFETED BY WINDS AND STORMS as it
enters the atmosphere of JUNKION.


INT. THE SHUTTLE


as it SHAKES AND RATTLES VIOLENTLY


                                DANIEL


                Where are we, Springer?


                                SPRINGER


                The place where everything ends up
                after you throw it out.


TIGHT ON BLURR


as he holds up hands and CROSSES fingers.


RESUME ON SPRINGER


Tenses and crouches protectively around Arcee and Daniel as we
see mountains of junk whizz past the window.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Brace for impact!


ON SHUTTLE - TRACKING


It plummets through the mountains and canyons of junk, narrowly
avoiding crashing, but frequently hitting junk pinnacles or sides
of junk walls, and causing avalanches of junk.


By the time the ship lands, it is nearly indistinguishable from
the junk.


INT. THE SHUTTLE


Everyone is in a jumbled tangle - Ultra Magnus beneath Blurr,
Perceptor upside down and hanging from torn end of stairway,
Arcee crouched over Daniel and Springer with half his body
sticking through the hull


                                SPRINGER


                      (pulling himself free of
                       hull wall)


                Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a raise...


Daniel creeps out from under Arcee and shakes bits of broken
metal and dust off his shoulders


                                DANIEL


                Wow!  That was better'n the Roller
                Coaster at Future World!


                                PERCEPTOR


                        (working scanner, computer
                         device, thoughtfully)
                The composition of this planet seems
                to be a chaotic amalgam of discarded
                ferrous and non-ferrous articulations.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                        (baffled)
                How's that?


                                SPRINGER


                        (opening hull door with a
                         RIPPING OF METAL)
                He says the planet's made of junk.


SPRINGER AND PERCEPTOR AT OPEN DOOR


as they look out on landscape of "living" junk


                                SPRINGER


                Yep, this dump is a dump......


ULTRA MAGNUS


as he straps on TOOL BELT


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                We might be able to salvage this thing.
                        (checks LASER DRILL, turns
                         it on, off)


Ultra Magnus starts for door followed by Blurr who takes up a saw
and tool belt and Perceptor who rolls up Shuttle Plans as Daniel
moves out to join them


                                DANIEL


                Can I help, too?


                                SPRINGER


                It's rough out there, kid.  Stay inside
                and play with crayons or something.


ARCEE


as she steps forward with a smile, a strange GRID LIKE "SUIT" in
her hand


                                ARCEE


                I think Daniel can make himself useful
                with....this!  It used to be Spike's.
                        (holds Grid-like metal frame "suit")


                                DANIEL


                Wow!  Dad's exo-suit.  He told me about
                it but I never saw it.


                                ARCEE


                Here, try it on.


She starts helping him into the exo-suit.


ON DANIEL


as he gets inside the "suit" which fits over his body like a
grid-work metal "cage."


Daniel clips "cage" of Exo-Suit shut and stands up inside the
gridwork which makes him taller and broader.  He moves awkwardly,
barely able to advance a step


                                SPRINGER


                Just think about what you want to
                do before you do it!


DANIEL


brows knitted, thinking.


                                SPRINGER


                Don't fight it Dan-O.


He suddenly starts moving rapidly backwards, then sideways, then
forward, then he starts dancing rapidly, then bounces off
walls...


..spinning upside down, then flips over several times and lands
in a splatter, legs spread, arms this way and that - amused,
startled and unhurt.


                                DANIEL


                        (continuing)
                It's kind of tricky....


He suddenly flips around twice in mid-air then regains his feet
and leans way over against Arcee for support.


She laughs and pats his shoulder


                                ARCEE


                For the first time out, you were great!


ON SPRINGER AT DOOR


as he sends down RAMP and motions to the others curtly


                                SPRINGER


                Show time's over!  We've got work to do!
                        (he starts out)


EXT. THE SHUTTLE


as Springer, Arcee, Daniel et.al. come down the ramp and look
around at the lush "vegetation" of growing junk clumps all around
them and a long vista of junk mountains and spires of weathered
junk-rock.


                                DANIEL (V.O.)


                        (whistles)
                This must be the junk capital of the
                universe!


LONG SHOT- DANIEL AND THE OTHERS


as they start DIGGING for parts to repair the ship, sinister
Junkions begin to emerge from the junk to watch them.  Their
leader, WRECK-GAR, speaks to his fellow Junkions.


                                WRECK-GAR


                        (in guttural, rusty,
                         metallic rumble)
                Stop thief!  No welcome-wagon, "hello stranger!"
                that good coffee flavor


                                OTHER JUNKIONS


                Yeah, or your money back!


Wreck-Gar shows large JUNK GUN with all sorts of razor sharp fins
and rusty little rocket missiles mounted around the howitzer
like barrel


                                WRECK-GAR


                Operators are standing by!


They laugh in guttural, clanking sounds and look out at Springer
and the others who keep working as we


                                                        CUT TO:
EXT.  THE GATE TO THE QUINTESSON PALACE


At first, we see only the face of a sinister Quintesson
gatekeeper, backed up by heavily armed Sharkticons.


                                QUINTESSON


                Greetings, noble strangers.


ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS


They stand at the gate, looking more like kids showing up at your
door wondering if you can come out and play, than like serious
robots on a serious mission.


                                GRIMLOCK


                Yes, me, Grimlock, noble!
                Me, Grimlock search for friends.


ANGLE ON QUINTESSON AND GRIMLOCK


The Quintesson, showing his friendly face, smiles.


                                QUINTESSON


                And who might they be?


                                GRIMLOCK


                Autobots.  Hot Rod and Kup.


                                QUINTESSON


                        (feigning recognition)
                Oh yes.  A young one and an old one.


                                GRIMLOCK


                Yes.  You know friends.  Where are they?


                                QUINTESSON


                They went down that path.


He points to...


A PATH


It probably isn't lined with primroses, but it should be.


GRIMLOCK


                                GRIMLOCK


                You good friend to Grimlock.  I reward
                you, sometime.


With that, the four Dinobots head towards the "primrose path."


ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON


His head rotates and he smiles a sinister, evil smile.


EXT. UNICRON


Galvatron stands upon the demonic planet, in an extremely
contorted position.


                                GALVATRON


                Why do you torture me?!


VARIOUS ANGLES ON UNICRON


We have no idea where this godly voice is coming from, but this
place sure is spooky.


                                UNICRON


                You have failed.


                                GALVATRON


                No, Unicron.  Ultra Magnus is dead.


                                UNICRON


                Then where is the matrix?


                                GALVATRON


                Destroyed, with him.


                                UNICRON


                The matrix can not be destroyed.
                        (pause)
                And Ultra Magnus lives on the
                planet of Junk.  Stalk him.  Cut him open!
                And bring the matrix to me.


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. THE PRIMROSE PATH


They step along the primrose path, not noticing as sinister
things start to happen all around them.


ANGLE ON A METAL EATING PLANT


This thing looks like a metal version of a "venus fly trap," and
it has a malevolent red eye which lights up.


Swoop walks past it in humanoid mode.


SNAP!


It misses him by an inch.


                                GRIMLOCK


                Me Grimlock, positive Hot Rod and Kup
                close!  Get thump, thump, thump...
                        (taps his head hard)


ANGLE ON THE GROUND - IN FRONT OF SLAG


Suddenly, a section of stones drop away in front of Slag
revealing a spiked pit...


                                SLAG


                Me, Slag say you are full of beryllium balony.


He is just about to fall in when...


ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK AND SLAG


Grimlock, in dino mode, slaps him with his tail, knocking him
away an instant before he steps into the hole...


                                GRIMLOCK


                Me, Grimlock, say you full of cesium salami!


Slag gets up...


                                SLAG


                Beryllium balony!


                                GRIMLOCK


                Argh!


ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK


He is about to pounce on Slag when a massive tree, which is
actually more like a sword, suddenly is spring and arcs
toward him.


The machete like blade strikes the ground, between Grimlock and
Slag narrowly missing them.  He turns and sees the thing
stocking in the ground.


                                GRIMLOCK


                Me, Grimlock think trees here are
                cheap model.


                                SLAG


                Like your head!  (laughs at own joke)


Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him to the ground.


Suddenly, a SQUEAKY, ODDLY CHILDISH VOICE speaks from o.s.


                                SQUEAKY VOICE (WHEELIE)


                Friends find.  Look behind.


                                GRIMLOCK


                        (furious)
                Who say that?


HIS P.O.V. - WHEELIE


WHEELIE is the Wolf Boy of Quintesson - an Autobot who's been
evading the Sharkticons since his parents' ship crashed, killing
everybody else in his party.  He wears a necklace of Sharkticon
teeth, packs a three bladed laser knife and a special SLING which
hurls FIRE STONES.


He fears nothing, especially the Dinobots, and he cockily struts
into the clear...


... walks right up Sludge's tail onto Sludge's back and then
shinnies up his neck and jumps onto...


... Slag's head where he stands eye to eye with Grimlock


                                WHEELIE


                Friends find.  Look behind.  Many Face
                lie.  You fool!  You buy!


GRIMLOCK AND WHEELIE


                                GRIMLOCK


                        (eyes blaze, furious)
                Me, Grimlock, "fool?"


                                WHEELIE


                        (smiling breezily)
                Picture you got.  Now fool you not!
                        (he laughs in a wild,
                         metallic cackle)


Grimlock raises a claw to swipe Wheelie off Slag's head


                                GRIMLOCK


                Me, Grimlock, no like you!


ON WHEELIE


as he scowls and quickly loads FIRESTONE IN SLING and slings it
onto Grimlock's nose where it EXPLODES making Grimlock yowl and
pull back, feeling his reddened nose and speaking through his
nose angrily


                                GRIMLOCK


                        (continuing)
                Doooooooow! Why boy hit by dose?


                                WHEELIE


                        (folds arms across his
                         chest)
                Wheelie say, find friends today!
                        (nods defiantly)


Grimlock and Slag react as we
                                                        
                                                        CUT TO:


THE QUINTESSON "COURTROOM"


Kup and Hot Rod stand on the platform over the Sharkticon pit.
They are "bound" by restraining bolts.


ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON JUDGE


                                QUINTESSON JUDGE


                Before we deliver your verdict, would you like to
                beg for your lives?


ANGLE ON KUP AND HOT ROD


Kup turns to Hot Rod.


                                KUP


                Remember when you put me together today?


                                HOT ROD


                        (sarcastic)
                Sure, that's all I got to think about.


                                KUP


                I know what part you forgot.


                                QUINTESSON JUDGE (V.O.)


                Silence or I'll hold you in contempt of this court.


                                HOT ROD


                I have nothing but contempt for this court.


ANGLE ON THE QUINTESSON JUDGES


Suddenly, their heads swivel around to deaths heads.


ON KUP AND HOT ROD


The platform drops away and they tumble...


KUP AND HOT ROD - TRACKING


Suddenly, Kup in double-jointed fashion slips out of the
restraining bolt...


                                KUP


                That doohickey you lost was part of my shoulder socket.
                Watch this, lad... without it, I'm double jointed
                as Houdini.


Then, he transforms to humanoid mode and shoots off Hot Rod's
bolt.


                                HOT ROD


                Wish you'd figured that out a little sooner.


                                KUP


                Better late than never!


ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICON PIT


In full humanoid mode, they land, their weapons drawn.


ANGLE ON ALL


Kup and Hot Rod fire, driving some Sharkticons back.


                                HOT ROD


                They've got more Sharkticons than we have
                photon charges!


Kup transforms to Auto mode.


                                KUP


                Let's hold a demolition derby!


Then, he roars into a bunch of them, slamming a massive stack
into the wall.


ANGLE ON HOT ROD


He transforms, too and does the same thing.


ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICON PIT


As fast as the Autobots can run the miserable things over, new
swarms of them come out.


ANGLE ON KUP AND HOT ROD


They clear out a circle in the center of the pit and transform to
humanoid mode.


                                HOT ROD


                Didn't even bend a fender.


                                KUP


                Yeah, but look.  There are a lot more of
                those cam dinging, grill-crackin' things.


WHAT HE SEES


is a wave of larger, more powerful Sharkticons.


                                HOT ROD


                We can't hold out forever, but we
                can give them one whopper of a repair
                bill.


ANGLE ON THE SHARKTICONS


They charge Kup and Hot Rod


Kup and Hot Rod


fire into them, destroying several, but are....


... Soon overrun.


The Sharkticons crawl all over them, munching on their metal.


SUDDENLY --


                                DINOBOTS (O.S.)
                        
                        (WAR WHOOP)


ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS


They fly down and land on the pile, transforming into Dinobot
mode.


ASSORTED SHOTS OF DINOBOT CARNAGE


SLUDGE in brontosaurus mode, swats several around with his tail,
while stomping them with his feet.


GRIMLOCK


Lowers his teeth to devour a much smaller Sharkticon, the
Sharkticon bares his teeth, realizes that he's a second stringer,
and scampers away.


                                GRIMLOCK


                Me Grimlock want to munch metal!


Slag barrels into Sharkticons, making a quick shishkebob out of
them, while...


Swoop picks two up with his claws, flies in the air and drops
them on other Sharkticons.


THE SHARKTICONS


suddenly back off and begin transforming (bowing) to the
dinobots.


ANGLE ON ALL


Kup and Hot Rod dig themselves out of a pile of Sharkticon parts.


                                HOT ROD


                I never thought I'd be so happy to see
                those big bozos.


ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK


He turns to Hot Rod.


                                GRIMLOCK


                Me Grimlock no bozo.  Me king!


ANGLE ON QUINTESSON JUDGES


They look down, their angry faces showing.


                                QUINTESSON JUDGE


                Sharkticons!  Execute them.


ANGLE ON GRIMLOCK


He points to the Quintessons...


                                GRIMLOCK


                Me Grimlock say execute them.


THE SHARKTICONS


for a brief instant, don't seem to know what to do.


Then, they charge the Quintessons.


THE CHASE


The Quintessons start to flee, but it's clear that the
Sharkticons, who climb over the stacked bodies of other
Sharkticons, are going to catch them.


                                KUP


                I think the problems on this planet
                will be solved very shortly.


ON HOT ROD


                                HOT ROD


                But what about our problems.  We need a ship.


WHEELIE


                                WHEELIE


                You get a ship if I get a trip.


ANGLE ON HOT ROD


He turns to the little, feral, robot.


                                HOT ROD


                Who are you.


SLAG AND WHEELIE


The dinobot lifts up Wheelie.


                                SLAG


                Him Wheelie, him friend.


HOT ROD


                                HOT ROD


                He'll be mine too, if he can find a Quintesson ship.


ANGLE ON WHEELIE


He points into the distance...


WHAT WE SEE


is the strangest looking corkscrew ship  we've every seen
sticking out of the ground.


                                HOT ROD


                That's a ship?


EXT. THE SECOND MOON OF CYBERTRON


PAN ACROSS an enormous stockpile of weaponry as we hear the
terrible roar we have come to associate with Unicron.


                                SPIKE


                If this doesn't do it, nothing will.


ANGLE ON SPIKE


He sets a timer to 20 seconds.  The L.E.D. clicks down.


BUMBLEBEE


now with a new bumpersticker which is a Unicron with a red circle
and slash through it, looks very fidgety.


                                BUMBLEBEE


                Let's get out of here.


BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE


They run over to a small space ship as...


... The timer counts down.


THE SPACESHIP


takes off.


ANGLE ON THE SECOND MOON


Now, for the first time, we see what is really going on.  Unicron
looms behind it, about to do the big munch.


ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE


They roar away.


ON UNICRON


His mist surrounds the planet...


ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE


They stop their ship in space.


                                BUMBLEBEE


                Five, four, three, two, one...


ON THE SECOND MOON AND UNICRON


BLAMMMOLA!


An incredible display of fireworks goes off, seemingly blowing
Unicron to smithereens.


ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE


They slap palms.


Then, they look up, horrified.


                                BUMBLEBEE


                It isn't even dented.


                                SPIKE


                Let's get out of here!


ON UNICRON


The great Maw opens and we hear a grand cosmic roar!


Suddenly, the smoke and space junk from the explosion are sucked
into his mouth.


ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE


They try to fly away.


                                SPIKE


                We're being sucked into it!


ANGLE ON THEIR SHIP AND UNICRON


Despite the fact that their thrusters are on full power, they are
still sucked into...


UNICRON...


Whose great mouth shuts when he's got the human and the Autobot.


                                                        CUT TO:


DEEP SPACE - THE PLANET JUNKION               


ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS' SHUTTLE


as Arcee and Springer work on the ship, while Perceptor watches.


                                PERCEPTOR


                Be sure the fittings are securely welded!


ANGLE ON BLURR


as he uses FLAME JETS FROM FINGER TIPS TO WELD joints where new
"canopy" is fitted


                                BLURR


                        (very fast, as usual)
                Absolutely, positively, definitely...


WIDE SHOT TO INCLUDE DANIEL


as he helps Blurr install a junk part.


                                DANIEL


                This exo-suit is fantastic!
                        (to Blurr)
                Want me to do that?


                                BLURR


                Weld? You? Really? Well, why not? Give
                it a try, but think it through first!


Daniel knits his brow, extends FINGER OF EXO-GLOVE which is part
of exo-suit.


CLOSE ON EXO GLOVE AND DANIEL'S HAND


as hand quivers and his finger shoots out a tiny flame which
sputters, sparks and then goes out like a wet match


RESUME ON BLURR AND DANIEL


                                BLURR


                Practice, practice, practice!


WRECK-GAR AND JUNKIONS IN HIDING


Wreck-Gar starts to motion them to the attack, and the Junkions
ready their weapons.


                                WRECK-GAR


                Forward, avanti, apfel and like, go for
                gusto....
                        (stops as OMINOUS ROAR comes
                         from overhead and he looks
                         up)


HIS P.O.V. - GALVATRON AND HUGE DECEPTICON FORCE


                                WRECK-GAR (V.O.)


                Hang on, this be industrial strength
                We watch...


ULTRA MAGNUS


as he, too, hears and then looks up and sees the Decepticon force


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Decepticons!
                        (to Springer)
                We've got to draw them off and then double back
                to the ship!


ANGLE ON CYCLONUS


with Galvatron piloting, races up and launches a particularly
nasty looking missile which streaks INTO SHOT and...


ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS' SHIP


... BLAMMOLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Turns it into junk.


Springer FIRES UP at INCOMING JETS, calling to the others


                                SPRINGER


                Cancel that last order.


ON ARCEE, DANIEL, BLURR


as Arcee transforms and moves off in one direction.  Daniel looks
at Blurr who is starting to transform


                                DANIEL


                What do I do?




                                BLURR


                Transform!  You can do...
                        (TRANSFORMATION complete,
                        he blurs off and, in V.O.
                        adds)
                ...it!


Blurr GOES OFF outblurring past HAIL OF LASER FIRE from Ramjet
scorching by overhead


ON DANIEL


as he reacts, looks around, thinks, brows knitting, looking off,
reacting


                                DANIEL


                Transform....


HIS P.O.V.- SCAVENGER


Coming at him from one side, Shrapnel coming from the other side


ON SCAVENGER


as he starts reaching for Daniel


                                SCAVENGER


                Human germ!


ON DANIEL


as his Exo-Suit SUDDENLY TRANSFORMS INTO auto mode and takes off
and drives through...


...SCAVENGER AND SHRAPNEL, knocking them over.


                                DANIEL (V.O.)


                Wooooh!!


GALVATRON


flies up to a ridge in advance of his forces, motioning to them
to split off and follow...


EXT. JUNKION - THE CHASE


BIRD'S EYE VIEW - THE AUTOBOTS


They dash through the maze-like walls of junk, pursued by Sweeps,
who strike them from above...


SWEEP


He lets out a rayblast...


ANGLE ON PERCEPTOR - TRACKING


... Hitting Perceptor and spinning him around...


... Until he stumbles to the ground.


ANGLE ON PERCEPTOR AND ULTRA MAGNUS


...  Perceptor lies on the ground, stunned.


...  Ultra Magnus stops next to him...


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Perceptor!


... Suddenly, shots tear into the junk all around them as...


ANGLE ON A SWEEP


ROARS towards them...


ANGLE ON PERCEPTOR


He suddenly transforms to cannon mode and fires!


...  Blowing the sweep to protons.


ON PERCEPTOR


He transforms to humanoid mode.


                                PERCEPTOR


                It appears that my lacerations
                were primarily superficial.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Then move it...


ANGLE ON PERCEPTOR


He takes off.


ULTRA MAGNUS


Stays behind, taking a few shots at...


SWEEPS


which streak over in deadly formations.


ULTRA MAGNUS


He stands and shoots.


                                SPRINGER (O.S.)


                Ultra Magnus!


Ultra Magnus turns to see...


THE OTHER AUTOBOTS


several yards down the junk-lined corridor.


                                PERCEPTOR (O.S.)


                Your estimated survival time is 10 seconds.


ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS


He shoots at the junk walls.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Then use that time to escape!  The Matrix
                was designed for an emergency like this.  I'll
                try to unleash its power.


                                SPRINGER


                But what if it doesn't work.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Until all are one!


THE OTHER AUTOBOTS AND JUNK WALLS


Ultra Magnus' ray hits the walls and they tumble down, separating
him from the other Autobots.


ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS


His back to a wall of fallen junk, he pulls out the matrix.


ANGLE ON GALVATRON IN CYCLONUS


Galvatron pops out of Cyclonus and both transform, to land in
front of Ultra Magnus.


ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS


Struggling to open the leadership matrix.  He puts his hand
inside of it and gets a powerful shock!


He pulls his hand out quickly.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                Damn it!  Open it!


ANGLE ON GALVATRON


He laughs.


ON ULTRA MAGNUS


He still struggles.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                        (baffled)      
                Prime, you said the Matrix would light
                our darkest hour.


ANGLE ON GALVATRON


Four sweeps fly  TOWARD CAMERA in formation.  Galvatron pops out
a communication device from his helmet.


                                GALVATRON


                Sweeps, quarter him!


ANGLE ON THE SWEEPS - TRACKING


Four rope-like rays shoot out of them and...


ON ULTRA MAGNUS


wrap around his arms and legs.


ANGLE ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND THE SWEEPS


His arms and legs caught by the four ropes, he knows he's just
about had it.


He struggles for one last moment, then...


ANGLE ON THE SWEEPS AND ULTRA MAGNUS


Pulling their rays taut, the Sweeps fly in four separate
directions, effectively drawing and quartering the Autobot
leader...


ON ULTRA MAGNUS


As all of his limbs are separated from his body and scattered in
the distance, he SCREAMS IN HORROR.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                (SCREAMS IN HORROR)


ANGLE ON THE MATRIX


It tumbles from Ultra Magnus' hands to...


... Galvatron's hands!


ANGLE ON GALVATRON


He holds the Autobot Matrix.


                                GALVATRON


                Unicron, my "master," with this I shall
                make you my slave!


Galvatron gets into Cyclonus and flies off


                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


DANIEL


as he moves out and looks down at Ultra Magnus' remains


                                DANIEL


                        (tearful)
                Ultra Magnus!


ANOTHER ANGLE - BLURR, SPRINGER, ARCEE AND PERCEPTOR


as they move up beside Daniel.


                                BLURR


                Without the Matrix there
                is no hope.  No hope at all!


WRECK-GAR AND AN ARMY OF JUNKIONS


as they are moving in battle array towards the Shuttle.


Junkions are an interesting species.  They ride themselves.  That
is, the Junkions ride transforms of themselves, so that if their
vehicle breaks down, the driver will become the vehicle, and the
vehicle will transform to become the driver.


They are gibbering, singing almost a wild kind of junk-rock,
war-cry song which, like their language, is constructed of bits
and pieces of the museum junk of our culture - a humorous aggressive
song which makes a surreal kind of sense.  "Slice 'em dice 'em...
And that's all folks or your money back..."


ON WRECK-GAR


as he roars into the lead and shows his teeth


                                WRECK-GAR


                Don't look behind door number two, Monty.
                It's time to play End-of-the-line-my
                valentine! Geroni-roni-doo-ron-ron-i-mo!
                        (he charges)


ON SPRINGER AND OUR FRIENDS


as they react


                                SPRINGER


                Get gone!


Springer leads the way and Blurr, Arcee, Daniel and Perceptor


follow and we MOVE TO


A ROAD WARRIOR STYLE CHASE


as Springer and Arcee ride on either side of Daniel and Perceptor


with Blurr bringing up the rear-


- zig zagging back and forth to keep the Junkions from getting


at Daniel.


A JUNKION


roars alongside Springer on his motorcycle and throws out laser
barbed grappling hook, trying to hook Springer.


Springer ducks first pass of hook.


ON JUNKION


as he hurls GRAPPLING HOOK AGAIN


ON SPRINGER


as he catches HOOK BY THE CHAIN AND YANKS IT


THE JUNKION


goes flying off his motorcycle.,,


He transforms into a motorcycle as


The motorcycle transforms into a rider and hops on the new
motorcycle and then...


...turns around to come back.


ON SPRINGER


He looks over, astonished.


                                SPRINGER


                It's not hard to knock 'em down.  It's
                getting them to stay down that's the
                trick.


ON ARCEE


as she fires at a Junkion who is trying to swerve her off the
road knocking him off the motorcycle...


The Junkion looks down at his missing arm, digs around in the junk
for a minute, comes up with another, and then transforms to a
motorcycle.


ANOTHER ANGLE


as Junkion rides over to her, starts belting her with junk sword


                                ARCEE


                They're indestructible!


ON DANIEL


as he skids, stopping his Exo-Suit as he reacts to what's ahead


                                DANIEL


                They're everywhere!


HIS P.O.V. - PILES OF JUNK


as Junkions arise out of every junk pile in sight and, gibbering,
singing their junk-rock battle song, start moving in


ON SPRINGER


as he stops and Arcee, Daniel, Perceptor and Blurr stop around
him.  They close ranks and look out at the Junkions grimly


                                PERCEPTOR


                Perhaps they're not as vicious as they look.


ON WRECK-GAR


as he gnashes his teeth and grins and then BLINKS HIS EYES which
roll to show eyes like ping pong balls.  Wreck-Gar makes blipping
noises as he does this


ON SPRINGER


reacting to Wreck-Gar's noises and eyeball display


                                SPRINGER


                        (to Perceptor)
                Positive thinking gets on my nerves.


Suddenly, all react to sound and wind of passing space cruiser
their P.O.V- HOT ROD, KUP AND DINOBOTS IN CRUISER
as it shoots past and banks, coming back for a closer look


                                SPRINGER (V.O.)


                It can't be....it's.....Hot Rod!  He's alive!


DANIEL


as he looks up at passing Cruiser and waves


                                DANIEL


                And Kup and the Dinobots!  We're saved!


                                PERCEPTOR


                I wouldn't count on that!
                        (indicating Junkions)


HIS P.O.V. - EVEN MORE JUNKIONS ARISING OUT OF THE JUNK HILLS


as Junkions newly risen from Junk look up and point at Cruiser
and make hostile signs toward it, shaking weapons, etc.


INT. THE CRUISER  - MOVING SHOT - VIEW THROUGH CANOPY


Hot Rod and Kup look down on the army of Junkions below
surrounding their friends as they SWOOP BY


                                KUP


                Not since the Crocodillos of Strontero
                have I seen such a sight....


ANOTHER ANGLE GRIMLOCK


as he sticks his face up next to Hot Rod.  Wheelie, riding on
Grimlock's head, slips down to stand on console next to Hot Rod


                                GRIMLOCK


                Maybe they make me king, too!


                                KUP


                Don't hold your breath, your majesty.


WRECK-GAR


as he watches Cruiser descend and start gliding in for a landing


                                WRECK-GAR


                Steady as she goes, mob!  Snoopy visitors
                get mud in the eye bye and bye, and film at five!
                        (gives thumbs up sign, RIDES
                         OFF)


                                JUNKIONS
                
                Everything must go by midnight!


With a SINGING ROAR of musical, tribal excitement, the Junkions
sweep Springer and our friends along with them, following course
of landing Cruiser to


CRUISER LANDING SITE


Cruiser sets down and Junkions line up with weapons aimed at
rampway as they watch door


ON DOORWAY


as Hot Rod steps out with big smile and hand full of energon
sticks followed by a very wary Kup, and the Dinobots with Wheelie
riding Sludge's neck.


INTERCUT TO SPRINGER, DANIEL, ARCEE ET. AL FOR REACTIONS


ON WRECK-GAR AND OTHER JUNKIONS


as they react to hot Rod's smile, Wreck-Gar trying to mimic that
smile to his followers who laugh


ON HOT ROD


as he steps up beside Kup and gently pushes Kup's rifle aside


                                HOT ROD


                        (aside to Kup, still holding
                         smile)
                Guns aren't exactly friendly.


                                KUP


                        (through his teeth to Hot
                         Rod)
                Neither are they in case you haven't noticed.


                                HOT ROD


                        (sotto)
                What was the Universal greeting again?


WRECK-GAR


growls and slips a SNIPPER, BLOW TORCH CUTTING TOOL out of a
holster and starts toward Hot Rod with it


HOT ROD


                                HOT ROD


                        (big smile)
                Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?


WRECK-GAR AND OTHER JUNKIONS


They look at one another, blink, then beam with smiles


                                WRECK-GAR       


                Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?


                                HOT ROD


                        (nodding, smiling)
                Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?
                        (presses energon sticks
                         forward)


As Hot Rod says this...


...Wreck-Gar takes the energon sticks and holds them over his
head and...


...all the Junkions smile and cheer and start chanting the
universal greeting phrase, laughing, clapping their hands and
dancing around, taking Arcee's hand and...


... taking Springer and Perceptor and Daniel out into center


of a square dance type gathering, moving back and forth with them
dancing happily, singing the universal greeting in a melodic,
rhythmic way


                                EVERYBODY


                Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong Bah weep
                graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong!  Bah weep graaaagnah
                wheep ni ni bong....


WRECK-GAR


hugs Hot Rod, and Perceptor who winces and tries to enjoy it, and
then hugs Daniel, Wheelie, Arcee, laughing and dancing as SINGING
goes.


ON GRIMLOCK


as he reacts to Wreck-Gar kissing his leg


                                GRIMLOCK


                Yuck! Me Grimlock, not a kisser!  Me,
                Grimlock, a king!


WHEELIE


claps his hands and gleefully makes noises as he hops about,
dancing with Junkions until we CUT TO


WRECK-GAR


as he stands on top of platform and RINGS JUNK BELLS AND SIRENS
getting silence and smiling as he waves hands all around


                                WRECK-GAR


                Have a nice day and please, close cover
                before striking, friends! Amigos, buddies
                and side kicks, Breep drit, aw rootie!
                So say the Junkions!
                        (holds hands over his head)


ANGLE ON HOT ROD


He looks at them, strangely.


                                HOT ROD


                Where did you learn to talk like that?


ANGLE ON WRECK-GAR


He reaches into his body, and about where a heart or some other
organ would be, he pulls out a Watchman.


THE WATCHMAN


On it is a crazy Eddy-type commercial.


                                WRECK-GAR


                We talk T.V.  You talk some T.V.?


KUP


looks around nervously.


                                KUP


                I talk some TV.  And now, Hot Rod for the news.  Don't
                touch that dial.  Void where prohibited.


JUNKIONS cheer wildly while the Dinobots react with uncertainty


RESUME ON WRECK-GAR


as he points off and shouts happily.


                                WRECK-GAR


                By George kimosabes your smashed
                up, blotto friend, soon like brand new
                with ninety day warranty
                all iciban parts and labor is!


HIS P.O.V. - JUNKIONS WITH ULTRA MAGNUS


The Junkions move Ultra Magnus' mangled body through an amazing
assembly line, quickly piecing together his body parts, using
junk when they can't find a part.


Then, they lube him, dust him, spray him and polish him.


Then, Wreck-Gar hits a switch, and Ultra Magnus' eye lights go on.


                                WRECK-GAR


                Happy motoring!  Cock-a-doodle-do!


ON ULTRA MAGNUS


as he steps away from Junkion line of reconstruction and into
group consisting of Hot Rod, Kup and Springer.


                                SPRINGER AND OTHERS


                        (Ad lib jubilation)
                Ultra Magnus!


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                You're all alive...


                                HOT ROD


                The matrix!


All turn to Ultra Magnus.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                It's gone...


                                KUP


                And with it, all hope.


                                HOT ROD


                No...
                        (inspired)
                The matrix will not fail us.


                                ARCEE


                Didn't you hear Ultra Magnus.  We don't
                have it anymore.  Galvatron does.


                                HOT ROD


                Then we've got to trust in ourselves, and
                no matter what they odds, destroy Unicron.


ON WRECK-GAR


His eyes light up.


                                WRECK-GAR


                Yeah!  Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand poobah....
                Flush cosmic troubles down the drain.


ANGLE ON JUNKIONS


                                JUNKIONS


                        (almost chanting)
                Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand poobah...
                Flush cosmic troubles down the drain.


ANGLE ON SPRINGER


The Quintesson ship in the BACKGROUND.


                                SPRINGER


                Listen, I don't want to rain on anybody's
                parade, but how are we going to move
                the army to Unicron.  We don't have enough
                room on that ship.


                                WRECK-GAR


                No fuss, no muss.
                        (to others)
                Hurry, hurry.  Sale must end!  Rush
                right on down to bridge and test drive
                latest with no obligation.
              
Suddenly, several Junkions scramble to concealed doorways in the
Junk.


                                ULTRA MAGNUS


                You have ships here?


                                WRECK-GAR


                New, improved Junkion planet, is sleek
                sexy import with turbo handling.


                                SPRINGER


                What's he talking about?


ANGLE ON QUINTESSON


Suddenly, boosters fire from the back side of the junk, and
somewhere under all of the junk, we realize is a real space ship.


Maybe the junk is the space ship.


It takes off, bits and pieces of junk flying off as it moves.


                                SPRINGER


                This is what I call traveling in style.


DISSOLVE TO:


LONG SHOT- UNICRON


as Galvatron stands on the surface of Unicron, holding the
Matrix.


                                GALVATRON (V.O.)


                Listen to me, or suffer the consequences.


                                UNICRON


                Aren't we getting pompous?


                                GALVATRON


                I now possess that which you most fear.


Unicron LAUGHS and the force of it rocks the surface of the
planet, knocking Galvatron to his knees.


                                GALVATRON


                You will do my bidding, or...


Unicron roars with laughter.


                                GALVATRON


                ...taste my wrath.


He leans down and starts trying to open the matrix.


ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING GALVATRON


IN THE BACKGROUND, we see Cybertron getting closer.


Galvatron struggles with the Matrix, but gets a big shock.


                                UNICRON


                You underestimate me Galvatron.


ANOTHER ANGLE - GALVATRON ON UNICRON


He desperately struggles to open the matrix.


The planet suddenly starts shaking.


Galvatron is bathed in a reddish light, and looks up in horror!


ANGLE ON UNICRON


A hideous transformation is beginning.  The surface of the planet
in front of Galvatron opens up, and we see that the hideous
light comes from eyes set on a hideous head!


GALVATRON AND UNICRON


Galvatron is maybe the size of a single tooth on the horrible
head before him.


                                UNICRON


                For a time, I considered sparing your measly
                little planet, but now you shall witness its
                dismemberment!


ANGLE ON GALVATRON


Suddenly, the ground he stands on drops away, and he falls
through space...


...  Landing on a protruding plate which sticks out of Unicron's
chest.


GALVATRON - CLOSE


He looks around himself in horror and lets out a loud scream as
he realizes the unimaginable horror that surrounds him.


ANGLE ON UNICRON - LONG SHOT


The massive planet transforms, arms and legs fold out of the
enormous body, hands unfold from the arms, jets from it's back
propel it towards...


... Cybertron, which, now looks lonely and vulnerable in space.


ANGLE ON GALVATRON


He stands on a ledge on Unicron and desperately tries to open
the matrix, but no cigar.


                                GALVATRON


                No!!!


ANGLE ON CYBERTRON


Unicron enters shot and grasps at Cybertron with a hideous
claw...


ANGLE ON A TOWER ON CYBERTRON


Shockwave talks into a communications device, as alarms sound and
troopers run everywhere.


                                SHOCKWAVE


                Decepticons...we're under attack...Scramble -


Then his voice is cut off as...


SHOCKWAVE'S POV - OUT HIS WINDOW


Unicron's hand reaches towards the window, squeezes, and the
walls crash in.


SPACE - UNICRON AND CYBERTRON


Unicron tears off the tower and crushes it as...


A FLEET OF DECEPTICON SHIPS


streak out of Cybertron and begin firing on the enormous planet.


Here, we see the true scale of Unicron.  The fighters are the
size of bees as they attack.


ANGLE ON UNICRON


He looks down on the swarm of fighters and...


...Breathes fire down on them.


The fighters POP and burn like popcorn in a blowtorch.


In moments they disappear like sparks from a fire.


ANGLE ON CYBERTRON


Decepticon troopers man a massive gun emplacement as...


... Unicron's huge hand reaches down...


... scraping buildings and...


... tearing out gun emplacements.


ANOTHER ANGLE- UNICRON'S FACE


as he puts his face down so his mouth will receive all the


rockets, laser blasts, etc.


THE DECEPTICON DEFENDERS


are silhouetted like ants in the foreground as Unicron OPENS HIS
MOUTH and swallows the fire barrage


GALVATRON


                                GALVATRON


                Stop feeding him, you fools!


ANGLE ON UNICRON AND CYBERTRON


As yet more Decepticon fighters rip out of the planet, it
looks like Unicron is going to have a field day tearing it apart.


                                                        CUT TO:


EXT. SPACE - SAME TIME


The massive Junkion ship and the corkscrew cruiser piloted by Hot
Rod and Kup race through the dark void.


                                HOT ROD


                I don't believe it.


INT.  THE QUINTESSON SHIP - SAME TIME


Hot Rod, Kup, Springer, Arcee and Daniel as they also look
through canopy, astonished


                                DANIEL


                Wow!


THEIR P.O.V. - UNICRON Destroying CYBERTRON


                                HOT ROD (V.O.)


                Doesn't it remind you of something, Kup?


RESUME ON KUP, DANIEL AND HOT ROD


as they MOVE CLOSER STILL. Kup is glassy eyed.


                                KUP


                        (entranced)
                Nope, never seen anything like it.


                                HOT ROD


                I knew there had to be a first time....
                        (using intercom)
                Battle stations!


LONG SHOT- HOT ROD'S CRUISER AND THE JUNKION SPACE SHIP


as hatches open and the Dinobots start FLYING OUT.


INT. - CRUISER


Hot Rod shoves joystick forward and Cruiser DRIVES TOWARD UNICRON
whom we see turn to take a swat at it through glass canopy


ON JUNKION SPACE SHIP


as it pulls up beside Hot Rod's Cruiser so they are both in a
line.....The Dinobots behind both ships  ...all diving toward
Unicron's nose


INT. JUNKION SHIP - WRECK-GAR AT CONTROLS


As Wreck-Gar also has joystick shoved down and watches Unicron's
face loom closer, closer, closer


LONG SHOT- CRUISER, JUNKION SHIP AND DINOBOTS IN FORMATION


as Unicron smiles and cups both hands together, preparing to
catch the lot of them as soon as they get within reach


UNICRON'S CHEST


Galvatron, the matrix hanging around his neck.  Transforms to
Cannon and fires up at...


...  A bright panel on Unicron's chest...


BLAAAM!


He hits the panel and lights and sparks fly out, causing the
gigantic robot to flicker momentarily.


ANGLE ON UNICRON


The monster lets out a ROAR!


Then, reaches down, picks up Galvatron and drops him into his
mouth like a raisin.


ANGLE ON GALVATRON


He drops into the deep pit of Unicron's mouth, narrowly avoiding
both a torrent of fire, and his sharp, crushing teeth.


EXT. THE SPACE BATTLE - SAME TIME


As they Junkion cruiser comes close, Unicron lets out a burst of
fire...


... Flames lick the ship, but when the fire subsides, nothing has
happened.


                                WRECK-GAR (V.O.)


                Patented enamel resists fire, rain
                and corrosion.  Five year warranty, satisfaction
                guaranteed.


                                OTHER JUNKIONS


                Or your money back!


The ship fires back, dumping rays into...


... Unicron's face, but not really doing any damage.


UNICRON AND JUNKION CRUISER


Unicron grabs the Junkion cruiser with both of it's hands and...


CLOSER


... tears it in half.


                                WRECK-GAR (V.O.)


                Unshakable, unbreakable, unbeatable.
                And for a limited time we include...


INT. CRUSHED JUNKION SHIP


As Ultra Magnus, Perceptor and the others watch in amazement...


                                WRECK-GAR (CONT'D)


                Free bonus surprise!


                                JUNKIONS


                Free bonus surprise!


THE JUNKIONS RUN AROUND


welding things...


...screwing things together...


... and kicking control panels to make them work...


EXT. SPACE


Both halves of the Junkion ship act as independent space ships.


                                PERCEPTOR (V.O.)


                Most unscientific, but... effective.


EXT THE SPACE BATTLE


As the Quintesson ship shoots toward Unicron's face.


THE CRUISER


Is suddenly struck by a ray from Unicron's eye, and half of it
is knocked off.


INT THE CRUISER


Lights go off, and the Autobots are thrown around like toys.


ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN


They are heading right to Unicron's eye.


ANGLE ON UNICRON AND THE CRUISER


Unicron swipes at the cruiser, but misses.


The Cruiser crashes right through Unicron's eye like a corkscrew!


                                UNICRON (V.O.)


                Graaaaaaaaaaa!


INT. UNICRON'S HEAD - SAME TIME


The cruiser rips through the eye socket and smashes through
several electrical membranes that are, in fact, Unicron's brain.


ANGLE ON THE SHIP


As the ship tumbles through, it dumps off the various Autobots
like rubbish and disintegrates.


ANGLE ON HOT ROD


He tumbles out of the rubbish and down a deep pit (which we can
assume is a robotic sinus or something)


EXT. THE BRAIN AREA


Kup, Springer, Daniel and Arcee are scattered about the floor in
the giant, flickering chamber.


                                DANIEL


                Where's Hot Rod?


SPRINGER


Sees something in the distance.


                                SPRINGER


                I don't know, but I hope they didn't get him.


WHAT HE SEES


Are dozens of hovering Robots that look like floating bear
traps, snapping their jaws as they drift slowly towards the
Autobots.


ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS


                                KUP


                Debugoids!


                                ARCEE


                Quick!  This way.


They run into a long, cave-like chamber which looks like the
central nervous system or something.


                                                        CUT TO:


INT. ANOTHER CHAMBER - LATER


Hot Rod drops through the darkness and lands in a pile of
miscellaneous junk.


ON HOT ROD


He slowly gets up and looks around the chamber.


WHAT HE SEES


Pan as Hot Rod looks over various different bits of junk, until
he sees the glowing shape of the Autobot Matrix apparently
suspended in mid air.


                                HOT ROD


                The Autobot Matrix!


Then, suddenly two red, burning eyes light up above the matrix,
and we see the hideous form of Galvatron.


                                GALVATRON


                It will do you no good, Autobot.  It
                cannot be opened.


ON HOT ROD


He stands up and walks towards Galvatron.


                                HOT ROD


                Not by a Decepticon.


ANGLE ON HOT ROD AND GALVATRON


Hot Rod steps towards Galvatron.


                                GALVATRON


                It is strange that we should find
                ourselves as allies...


ON GALVATRON


Suddenly, his body is violently twisted, and his arms are almost
broken off.


                                GALVATRON


                Uhhhh...


                                UNICRON


                Destroy him, or feel yourself torn from limb to
                limb.


                                GALVATRON


                Of course, my master!


ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD


Galvatron takes a shot at Hot Rod.


... Hot Rod dives away, as electricity seems to flash
everywhere.


ON GALVATRON


He peers into the gloom.


GALVATRON'S POV  -  PANNING THE ROOM


Hot Rod is nowhere to be seen amidst all of the junk.


ON GALVATRON


Weapon drawn.


                                GALVATRON


                Puny Autobot, you lack even Prime's courage.


There is no response.


                                                        CUT TO:


EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE


ASSORTED SHOTS


Unicron now stands atop Cybertron, fighting the various ships
that swarm around him like bees.


... Rays streak from his one good eye.


... His hands smash fighters...


... Fire shoots from his mouth.


THE DINOBOTS


Now reaching Unicron's butt, start kicking.


                                GRIMLOCK


                Me Grimlock kick Butt.


ANGLE ON UNICRON


Suddenly; he looks down, sending down a searing blast of fire.


ANGLE ON THE DINOBOTS


They transform to robot mode and fly away.


                                GRIMLOCK


                Me, Grimlock, need new strategy.


                                                        CUT TO:


INT. THE CORRIDOR IN UNICRON -- SAME TIME


Kup, Arcee, Springer and Daniel dash down the corridor.


Suddenly, Daniel's foot is caught in a maze of wiring.


ANGLE ON THE OTHERS


Not noticing, they keep running.


ANGLE ON DANIEL


He tries to pull his foot out.


No luck.


Then, he looks up.


WHAT HE SEES


The Robotic Antibodies are drawing very close to him.


DANIEL


He looks o.s. towards the others.


                                DANIEL


                Help...


ANGLE ON KUP AND ARCEE


They turn around and see Daniel about to be munched by the
antibodies.


                                ARCEE


                Daniel!


ANGLE ON SPRINGER, KUP AND ARCEE


They dash down the corridor firing on...


THE ROBOTIC ANTIBODIES


Their shots hit some, knocking them to scrap, but there are so
many of them, that they can't hold back the tide as it...


ANGLE UNDER THE ANTIBODIES


Daniel, unscathed by the things, which hover over his head,
munching their way towards the Autobots, gets his foot free.


                                DANIEL


                I'm okay.  They don't even see me.


ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS


It looks like Custer's last stand as they are surrounded by the
vicious antibodies.


                                KUP


                They must not programmed to
                catch flesh creatures.


                                SPRINGER


                Us, on the other hand...


                                ARCEE


                Daniel... Try to find help!


Arcee fires...


HER SHOT   - TRACKING


Misses the Antibodies, but strikes a large tube.


ANGLE ON THE TUBE


When it is hit, it pours a torrent of liquid which...


... Goes over the swarm of Antibodies, but hits Daniel...


... Carrying him away in a flood of glowing liquid.


ON DANIEL - TRACKING


He shouts as he finds himself in a river of flowing goo.


                                                        CUT TO:


INT.  UNICRON - A FLOWING TUNNEL


Daniel rips through what seem to be endless caves on the torrent
of liquid, until he is dumped down a  high waterfall into...


....  A glowing lake.


... He stays under for a moment, and then bobs up to see...


UNICRON'S STOMACH


This is the central processing area for Unicron's "food" and
"energy."  A long conveyer belt drops junk into a clear, bubbling
vat, where it is separated into raw material and energy.


The energy, which comes out in raw form, goes into a machine and
is crunched into energon cubes, while the solid material, is
separated into it's component metals and plastics, formed into
ingots and sent elsewhere in an assembly line fashion.


DANIEL


watches this with awe until he sees...


ANGLE ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE


... Several Decepticon troopers hanging from cables like shirts
at a dry cleaners are dropped into the bubbling vat, and in
moments converted to nothing...


... Then, Cliffjumper and Jazz roll out of the line...


ON DANIEL


He dashes to the shores of the glowing lake...


                                DANIEL


                Cliffjumper!  Jazz!


And then Spike comes rolling down, followed by Bumblebee!


                                DANIEL


                Bumblebee!  Dad!


ON CLIFFJUMPER, JAZZ, AND SPIKE


They look down, but can't move because they are held by massive
pincers.


                                SPIKE


                Shut off the control, Daniel.


Daniel looks around.


Then, he sees.


 A CONTROL


..  which controls the whole thing.


ON DANIEL


He runs up a catwalk towards it....


ANGLE ON DANIEL


He reaches the flickering panel.


                                DANIEL


                What do I do?  It doesn't have any
                buttons or anything.


ANGLE ON SPIKE - TRACKING


He looks down.


                                SPIKE


                Shoot it, Son.


                                DANIEL


                But I don't have a gun.


                                SPIKE


                Use your exo-suit.


ANGLE ON DANIEL


He looks down at his hand and concentrates as hard as he can.


Then, a spark  comes out.


It  grows longer.


ANGLE ON THE MACHINE


Spike and the Autobots are about to go in.


                                CLIFFJUMPER


                Hurry!


DANIEL


Starts frying the command console!


ANGLE ON THE LINE


It keeps moving.


Then, Cliffjumper is dropped in!


ANGLE ON DANIEL


He looks back, and to his horror sees Jazz, Bumblebee and his
father about to be dropped in.


He keeps firing.


The panel starts exploding!


                                DANIEL


                I can't stop it!


ANGLE ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE


Jazz drops in, then Bumblebee, then Spike.


DANIEL


turns around and sees this.


                                DANIEL


                Dad!


There is no answer.


Play the moment.


Then...


                                SPIKE


                Son.


ANGLE ON THE VAT


It is empty.  The Autobots and Spike sit at the bottom, smoking
but alright.




                                SPIKE


                You did it!
                                                        
                                                        CUT TO:


INT.  THE DARK CAVERN WITH GALVATRON AND HOT ROD


Galvatron, the Matrix at his neck, stalks around the room.
Looking everywhere for Hot Rod.


                                GALVATRON


                Come out, Autobot.  We all must die
                sometime.


Suddenly, shockingly, Hot Rod jumps out of the floor and grabs
Galvatron, sinking his fist into the Decepticon's face.


GALVATRON


stumbles backward.


ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD


Galvatron jumps at Hot Rod...


...  Hot Rod transforms to a car and races away...


ANGLE ON GALVATRON


He transforms to cannon mode and fires...


... Hot Rod transforms to humanoid mode and the shot goes through
his legs.


...   Then, he fires back at Galvatron...


...  Hitting him as he transforms back to humanoid mode and
angering him.


.Raises his gun, then lowers it.


                                GALVATRON


                No, I will crush you with bare hands.


Hot Rod transforms back to car and tries to race away...


...  Galvatron jumps after him and catches him...


...  Hot Rod, nearly pinned by Galvatron transforms to humanoid
mode.


...  Galvatron wrestles him to his back..


... The Adolescent Robot tries to fight back, but the other is
stronger.


... Galvatron puts his hands around Hot Rod's neck and starts
squeezing.


...  We hear the crunching of metal.


                                GALVATRON


                First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now you.
                It is a pity Autobots die so easily or I might have
                a sense of satisfaction now.


Hot Rod desperately gasps and pulls at Galvatron's hands...


EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE


Unicron shoots down more Decepticons with his remaining eye,
while he crushes the Junkion ship.


INT. THE JUNKION SHIP


The walls crush in.  The Junkions and the Autobots are  being
smashed together.


                                WRECK-GAR


                Ashes to ashes.  Junk to junk.


INT. THE DARK CAVERN


Galvatron still strangles Hot Rod.


                                HOT ROD


                Gasps.


                                GALVATRON


                Die!


ANOTHER ANGLE


On Hot Rod, his hands, nearly dead, spring to life for a moment
and grasp the Matrix which hangs from Galvatron's chest.


ANGLE ON THE MATRIX


Suddenly, it lights up.


ANOTHER ANGLE


A miraculous transformation takes place.


...  Hot Rod begins to grow at an alarming rate.


...  Age shows on his  face.


...  He is stronger and wiser.


                                OPTIMUS PRIME


                Arise, Rodimus Prime.


                                HOT ROD


                Optimus!


ANGLE ON GALVATRON


He fires at Hot Rod as...


                                GALVATRON


                Nooooooo!


... Hot Rod gets up.


...  The shot doesn't even dent him.


                                HOT ROD


                This is the end of the road, Galvatron.


With that, he picks up the Decepticon and throws him through...


EXT. UNICRON - SAME TIME


... Unicron's side...


                                                        CUT TO:


INT. THE DARK CAVERN


Hot Rod, bathed in the glow of the matrix.  Sticks his hand in
the way we saw Galvatron and Ultra Magnus try earlier.


There is no shock.


Then, like pulling the pin on a hand grenade, he unleashes the
spiritual equivalent of a bomb!


ASSORTED SHOTS -  INVASION OF THE MATRIX


The matrix rips through Unicron's body,  blowing up wires causing
floods and generally causing havoc.


EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE


Unicron suddenly lets out a scream and lets go of the Junkion
ship, sending it hurtling.


INT. THE JUNKION SHIP


It tumbles through space.


                                AUTOBOTS AND JUNKIONS


                (THEY SCREAM WITH EXHILARATION)


ANGLE ON UNICRON


Suddenly,  he starts tearing into his body.


EXT. SPACE


Unicron writhes in space, tearing himself apart, ripping off a
leg, and sending out sparks like a  roman candle.


                                                        CUT TO:


INT. THE CORRIDOR WHERE KUP ET.AL ARE TRAPPED


They are overrun by the antibodies.


One takes a whopper bite out of Springer's chest.


                                SPRINGER


                I'm almost out of energy.


Suddenly, he looks up and sees one of the creatures explode above
HIM.


Then another explodes, then another.


SPRINGER'S POV - A WALL OF ANTIBODIES


Suddenly, every antibody in the wall begins exploding, and through
the carnage, we see Bumblebee, Spike, Daniel, Cliffjumper and
Jazz.


ANGLE ON THE BATTLE


The last of the antibodies is blown away, and Kup, Arcee and
Springer sit up amidst a pile of antibody bodies.


                                SPRINGER


                That's what I call the nick of time.


ANGLE ON ALL


Suddenly, an entire wall vanishes as Unicron's hand tears at
things.


                                JAZZ


                Let's burn rubber!


ANGLE ON THE TUNNEL


They transform.


The humans jump in.


THE CHASE - TRACKING


They race up the tunnel, one step ahead of Unicron's hand which
shoots after them, pulling apart what we know must be pieces of
his brain...


Then, they reach what seems like a dead end.


In fact, it is the  back side of Unicron's good eye.


The hand comes in after them!


ANGLE DOWN THE CORRIDOR


An unbelievably fast and powerful robot races towards the
Autobots.


When it gets there, we realize that it is Rodimus Prime.


                                KUP


                I knew you had potential, lad!


ANGLE ON RODIMUS PRIME


                                RODIMUS PRIME


                Autobots, transform and roll out.


Rodimus Prime transforms into truck mode as the other Autobots
also transform.  Daniel and Spike jump into him.


Then, in a continuous line, he shoots off, the other Autobots
racing behind him.


                                                        SMASH CUT:


EXT. UNICRON


Rodimus Prime shoots out the second eye...  Followed by the
others.


ANGLE ON UNICRON


An arm and a leg dangle uselessly as the Autobot essence spreads
throughout the body, blowing circuits.


Suddenly, Unicron lets out a loud agonized ROAR.


SPARKS seem to shoot out of every part of his body.


Then, he spins in space like some kind of a fireworks display,
shooting off sparks.


And then...


BANG!


We get the big visual explosion.


DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. SPACE - MUCH LATER


Unicron's head orbits Cybertron.


PAN to Cybertron where and PUSH IN on Rodimus Prime, Arcee,
Kup, Springer, Ultra Magnus, Wreck-Gar, Daniel, Perceptor,
Blaster and Spike watch construction being done on Cybertron
below.


                                RODIMUS PRIME


                Let this mark the end of the
                Cybertronian wars as we move forward to
                a new age of peace and happiness....


                                ALL


                Until all are one!


                                THE END
