FADE IN: 
EXT. BURREL PRISON - NIGHT 
Stone walls. Gun towers. Razor wire. A formidable hellhole.  SUPER: BURREL PRISON - ALBANIA 
A KAWASAKI NINJA 300 FLIES UP to the prison gates.  
TWO GUARDS watch as a silky figure climbs off the bike and  removes her helmet to reveal a gorgeous head of red hair.  
Dialogue in ITALICS is in ALBANIAN with ENGLISH SUBTITLES: 
GATE GUARD 
You lose your way?  
GIRL 
No, I’m right where I need to be.  
She unzips her jacket. Is she gonna flash them? But then she  pulls out two ENVELOPES.  
Confused, the guards open them up. They’re filled with  AMERICAN DOLLARS. 
GIRL (CONT’D) 
Aleksander Luga. Inmate 2-1-9-5. I  
want him free.  
The guards trade looks. Go to hand the money back. 
GATE GUARD 
Get the fuck out of here. 
GIRL 
Just know... We gave you the easy  
way out. 
Twin precision shots rip through the guards foreheads. IN A  FLASH: AN EXTRACTION TEAM emerges from the treeline.  
The girl pulls control keys from a guard’s pocket. Steps into  a security shack. Disarms security and opens a side gate. 
Wearing night vision goggles and carrying Geind SMS-65  submachine guns, the gunmen enter the prison with military precision, THE ENTIRE CHARGE SEEN IN NIGHT VISION GREEN. 
INT. BURREL PRISON - ISOLATION WING - CELL - SAME 
An inmate is doing push-ups. With one arm. In a handstand.  His body is lean. Covered in tats. One for each kill. His  head is shaved. He is as dangerous as they come.  
He is ALEKSANDER LUGA.
2.
INT. BURREL PRISON - VARIOUS - SAME 
The extraction team makes their way through the prison. A  gunman attaches an explosive to a lock. BLOWS FREE the door. 
INT. BURREL PRISON - UTILITY ROOM - SAME 
A gunman cuts wires to the electrical grid. 
INT. BURREL PRISON - CELL BLOCK - SAME 
The lights SHUT OFF -- leaving guards vulnerable to the  extraction team, wearing night vision. They CUT THEM DOWN.  
INT. BURREL PRISON - ISOLATION WING - MOMENTS LATER 
The hallway door EXPLODES. TEAM LEADER crosses up to Luga’s  cell. Attaches another charge to the door. It blows open.  Luga steps out. Instantly demands:  
LUGA 
Give me a gun. 
The gunman hands him a Glock 30. Luga sees two guards rushing  up and FIRES -- killing them both. 
EXT. BURREL PRISON - SAME 
A MERLIN HELICOPTER shoots towards the prison.  INT. BURREL PRISON - VARIOUS - SAME 
The extraction team commences exfil. 
EXT. BURREL PRISON - SAME 
The helicopter touches down inside the walls. Luga and the  extraction team hop inside. It flies off. 
EXT. PLG SHIPPING COMPANY - MAGIC (SIX HOURS BEHIND) A large building on the Indian River in Florida.  SUPER: MIAMI - FLORIDA 
INT. PLG SHIPPING COMPANY - OFFICE - SAME 
BARDHA, a tough Albanian, hands a cheap phone to his boss,  ALBERT HESS, 50’s, serious and intelligent. Into the phone: 
HESS 
Put him on.  
INT. MERLIN HELICOPTER - INTERCUTTING 
Luga takes the phone from the Lead Team Member. 
3.
HESS 
You know who this is? 
LUGA 
I got your message. 
HESS 
Good -- then you know I only got  
you out for one reason. This is not 
a personal job. It’s business.  
You’re to do what I hired you to do  
and nothing more. Tell me you  
understand that. 
LUGA 
...I understand. 
Luga hangs up. Stares ahead. Cold eyes. Hard. END INTERCUT.  
HESS 
(to Bardha) 
I need to keep this dog on a short  
leash. Make sure he’s brought to me  
the second he gets off the boat.  
Hess sends the phone down a chute -- into an incinerator. RESUME HELICOPTER:  
flying off -- as RAP MUSIC BLASTS.  
EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT 
SHOOTING over neon-lit water, we pan up to frame the MIAMI  SKYLINE, the sonic WHOOSH of a 6262cc V12 engine as we GO TO: 
A GUN-GRAY FERRARI 599 
THUNDERING past Miami hot-spots. Behind the wheel, dressed  like a GQ cover model: MIKE LOWERY. A Lamborghini Huracan  pulls up beside him at a red light, two IMG MODELS inside.  
IMG MODEL #1 
Sweet ride. 
She REVS the engine. 
MIKE 
You two aren’t silly enough to want  
to race me. 
...Maybe. 
IMG MODEL #1 IMG MODEL #2 
...Depends how big your engine is.  
4.
MIKE 
Big enough for two. What do you  
have under the hood?  
IMG MODEL #1 
Catch us and you’ll find out.  
MIKE 
Would if I could, but I got work.  
I’ll have to find you ladies later. 
IMG MODEL #1 
And how do you plan to do that? 
Mike flashes his BADGE. Girls smile. The light turns green.  They ZOOM AHEAD. Mike mouths “damn” and ROARS forward. 
EXT. AVENTURA MALL - PARKING LOT - LATER 
A luxury shopping center. Mike’s Ferrari pulls up and parks.  INT. FERRARI - SAME 
Mike checks his Hublot King Power Black Mamba watch.  
MIKE 
Alright, it’s almost game time.  
Daltrey, Sanchez, you two set?  
This to a HIDDEN MICROPHONE in the lining of the car ceiling.  INT. CADILLAC ESCALADE - SAME 
Parked a few cars away from Mike. Sitting inside are two next generation cops with MIAMI-DADE PD’S TACTICAL NARCOTICS TEAM:  SCOTT DALTREY (Louisiana-transplant; ex-Marine; Duck Dynasty- beard; the guy you want backing you in a firefight) and MARIA  SANCHEZ (Latina; sexy; teflon-tough).  
Both cops are wired with MICS near their throats so they can  talk without holding up a radio. 
DALTREY 
Ready to rumble, hoss. 
RESUME MIKE: 
MIKE 
Theroux, where are you at? 
CAM (V.O.) 
Right behind you partner. 
Wait, partner? What happened to Marcus Burnett?  
Mike looks in the rear-view at the sweet-looking Dodge  Challenger SRT8 behind him. The driver gives a wave.  
5.
INT. DODGE CHALLENGER - SAME 
Meet Mike’s new partner: CAM THEROUX, young and cocky.  INTERCUT ALL THREE CARS: 
CAM 
Nice of your connection to pick  
this place to meet. I say after we  
bust the bad guys, we do a little  
shopping, a candle from Wicks N  
Sticks, maybe grab some Cinnabon.  
Daltrey, some new bandanas? 
MIKE 
Hey, you wanna do your job or you  
wanna fuck around? 
Cam gets quiet quick. 
MIKE (CONT’D) 
Now let’s go over it again: as soon  
as I agree to the buy, I give the  
call to Theroux to show up with the  
green. Once we got the glass in  
hand: Daltrey, Sanchez, you two  
come in hard and fast, back us up.  
No call, you’re all statues unless  
I give the trouble signal. Any  
questions? 
SANCHEZ 
Yeah. What’s the trouble signal? 
MIKE 
“Oh shit, I’m in trouble.” Now  
let’s get sharp. It’s prove  
yourself time.  
Cam resents Mike’s condescending attitude. Under his breath: 
CAM 
Prove yourself, my ass. 
EXT. AVENTURA MALL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER Stores are closing. Mike and the TNT cops are still waiting. RESUME DALTREY AND SANCHEZ: 
DALTREY 
C’mon, top 3 country songs. Go. 
SANCHEZ 
They’re all the same. If it's not  
about cheating, it's about  
drinking. Or screwing. 
6.
DALTREY 
And that’s different from what you  
listen to? It’s all about Kush,  
bitches and doe.  
Sanchez sits up. Spots a mousey WHITE GUY heading toward  Mike’s car. Into her mic:  
SANCHEZ 
Lowery, heads-up. 
Mike sees the white guy approaching. His connection. 
MIKE 
That’s him. Get ready. 
Cam zips open a gym bag on the passenger seat. A Strayer  
Voight Infinity TIKI handgun rests atop wrapped stacks of  bills. He discretely pulls out the gun.  
Mike gets ready to step out of his Ferrari but the connection  doesn’t slow down. Just keeps walking up to Mike’s car -- 
-- and drops a PRE-PAID CELL onto Mike’s lap. 
Cam, Daltrey and Sanchez are all thrown. Mike was supposed to  meet him in the open. 
Mike sees the connection vanish into the shadows of the  parking lot, then picks up the phone.  
VOICE ON PHONE 
We need to change locations. 
MIKE 
What are you talkin’ about? This is  
where we agreed to meet. 
VOICE ON PHONE 
Not anymore. You want what we’re  
selling, you come to us. Club 
Apagón. Be there in twenty minutes.  
Bring the cash to the VIP section.  
Come alone. 
CLICK. The call ends. Back into his mic: 
MIKE 
Alright, change of plan. We’re  
goin’ clubbing. Meet’s at a place  
called Apagón. 
Sanchez instantly gets on her phone and runs a search.  
SANCHEZ 
After hours joint in Little Havana. 
7.
DALTREY 
Goddamn set-up. 
CAM 
C’mon Mike, you’re not serious.  
That’s an invitation to a hit. 
You gotta call this off. 
MIKE 
Not callin’ anything off. 
(urgent) 
Sanchez, Daltrey: beat us to the  
club. Make sure you got eyes and  
ears in place when the deal goes  
down. 
Daltrey and Sanchez immediately drive away in the Escalade. 
MIKE (CONT’D) 
Theroux, you hold back out front  
with the money and don’t release it  
until you get the call from me. You  
got it? 
Cam’s not happy -- but Mike’s the senior officer here. 
CAM 
Yeah, I got it. 
Mike drives off. Cam shakes his head. 
CAM (CONT’D) 
Goddammit Lowery. 
And starts up his ride. LATIN TECHNO BLASTS as we GO TO:  INT. CLUB APAGÓN - LATER 
An EXPLOSION OF SOUND AND LASER LIGHT. Lots of skin. Miami’s  YOUNGEST AND HOTTEST dance around acrobatic salsa performers  and bikini-clad conga dancers. 
EXT. CLUB APAGÓN - SAME 
Under the I-95 overpass in Little Havana. The Escalade parks.  INT. CADILLAC ESCALADE - SAME 
Daltrey turns to see Sanchez STRIPPING in the passenger seat. 
DALTREY 
What are you doing?  
SANCHEZ 
Same thing you should be. This is a  
club, not a Waffle House. 
8.
Sanchez removes her jacket and shirt to reveal a lacy  
camisole. Daltrey takes off an outer-shirt, throws off his  bandanna and messes up his hair. 
INT. CLUB APAGÓN - MOMENTS LATER 
Looking club-hot, Sanchez and Daltrey step inside. Play the  role of boyfriend and girlfriend. Hands all over each other. 
The two cops take up position so they have line of sight into  the GLASS ENCASED VIP AREA. 
DALTREY 
(into a hidden mic) 
All ready Mike, you’re good to go. 
EXT. CLUB APAGÓN - SAME 
Mike arrives, followed by Cam, who watches Mike enter the  club, still thinking he’s nuts to do so. 
INT. CLUB APAGÓN - MOMENTS LATER 
Mike crosses underneath LATIN DANCERS GYRATING in CAGES to  the VIP SECTION. 
FIVE MEN await him, standing. A beefy SECURITY OFFICER runs a  wand over Mike. He’s clean.  
Daltrey and Sanchez watch as Mike steps inside the VIP area.  But as soon as the glass door closes behind him -- 
-- the glass turns FROSTED. Sanchez and Daltrey can’t see in. 
Shit.  
SANCHEZ 
INT. DODGE CHALLENGER - SAME 
What? 
CAM 
DALTREY 
We can’t see inside.  
Cam shifts, uneasy.  
INT. CLUB APAGÓN - VIP AREA - SAME 
SUDDENLY -- GUNS APPEAR, AIMED AT MIKE.  
The five men are members of a cruel and merciless HOME  INVASION CREW that specializes in ripping off drug buyers. 
LEAD GUNMAN 
Put your fucking hands up mother fucker! 
9.
MIKE 
Whoa, let’s dial this shit down.  
The LEAD GUNMAN steps forward, threatening: 
LEAD GUNMAN 
Where’s the fucking money!?! 
MIKE 
There is no fucking money. 
LEAD GUNMAN 
Call your boy and get us our money  
or we kill your ass!  
A GUNMAN presses a Glock into his temple. 
INT. DODGE CHALLENGER - SAME 
Hearing this, Cam grabs the gym bag off the passenger seat,  throws open his door and crosses the parking lot to the club. 
INT. CLUB APAGÓN - VIP SECTION - SAME 
Despite the guns aimed at him, Mike keeps cool. 
MIKE  
How about you all go fuck  
yourselves instead?  
LEAD GUNMAN 
What the fuck did you say to me,  
asshole? 
MIKE 
The money is what’s keeping me  
alive. You get that, then what? No.  
We do this, we do it my way.  
EXT. CLUB APAGÓN - SAME 
Cam gets intercepted by the bouncer -- his gun bulge visible. 
BOUNCER 
Club’s full, homie.  
Cam drops the bag, grabs the bouncer’s hand and elbow,  presses them together, KICKS out his knee and SLAMS his head  against the wall. The bouncer’s out-cold. He pulls out the  bouncer’s radio headset and pockets his cell phone and gun.  Then picks back up the gym bag and moves into the club. 
RESUME MIKE: 
MIKE 
Now put your guns down, show me the  
glass and we can make this happen.  
10.
INT. CLUB APAGÓN - SAME 
Sanchez and Daltrey see Cam go to the VIP area. 
SANCHEZ 
Where the fuck’s he going? Lowery  
hasn’t given the signal yet. 
RESUME MIKE: 
MIKE 
If not, just shoot me now cause  
you’re not gonna see dime one of  
that fucking money. 
Cam SLAMS his hand on the door outside. 
CAM (O.S.) 
Hey, open up, I got your money! 
Mike rolls his eyes. Asshole. No choice -- 
Mike KNOCKS away the gun that’s pressed to his temple while  quick-drawing a SECOND GLOCK out of the gunman’s pants. 
He aims it at the leader as another CREW MEMBER FIRES. Mike  uses his gunman as a HUMAN SHIELD, trading bullets. The glass  wall SHATTERS! 
INSTANT PANDEMONIUM! EVERYONE IN THE CLUB GOES RUNNING! 
Cam draws the bouncer’s gun and starts laying down cover  fire. Mike escapes the VIP section. 
TWO MORE GANG MEMBERS run from the main area of the club. But  before they can shoot at Mike and Cam -- BANG! BANG! BANG! Daltrey and Sanchez take them out.  
It’s an ALL OUT GUN BATTLE -- bullets shooting electrical  equipment -- CAUSING SPARKS and FIRE. WATER GUSHES out of the  sprinklers. Everyone gets DRENCHED.  
The Lead Gunman goes for an exit. Mike CHARGES after him.  Another SHOOTER takes aim, but before he can fire -- his head  EXPLODES.  
REVEAL: CAM -- having just taken the kill shot. 
Mike gets closer to the Lead Gunman -- who whips around,  FIRING at Mike, who then SLIDES across the wet floor, legs  STRIKING the Lead Gunman, who drops onto his back. 
Mike swings the gun right into his face. 
MIKE 
Like I said: my way. 
11.
EXT. CLUB APAGÓN - LATER 
Aftermath. Fire trucks. Cruisers. A Crown Victoria pulls up.  CAPTAIN LEO HOWARD steps out. Surveys the chaos and zeroes in  on the man responsible: Mike, currently fighting with Cam. 
You disobeyed a direct order!CAM 
MIKE 
They were gonna kill you! 
MIKE 
What you did was put the whole crew  
at risk!  
As tensions reach a fever pitch, Howard comes walking up. 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
Yeah, yeah, this looks about right  
for one of your Thursdays. Wait,  
can that be? Oh my God yes, the  
building’s still standing. You must  
be losing your touch, Mike. 
MIKE 
Captain, before you start in -- 
Over here. 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
Mike follows Howard away from Cam and the others. 
MIKE 
Look it’s not my fault that things  
got out of hand this time. 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
Of course not. It was “ABM’s”  
fault. Anyone But Mike’s. You said  
this was gonna be a routine buy.  
MIKE 
Which it would have been if Theroux  
listened -- 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
Wait, someone didn’t listen to you?  
I’m sorry ‘CAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA  
WHAT THAT’S LIKE! You know, ever  
since the “Bad Boys” broke up,  
you’re like my nephew without  
Ritalin. You weren’t a one man army  
doing everything the way you want.  
So I’m telling you now: you better  
learn how to be part of a fucking  
team again. 
Howard walks away. OFF MIKE -- fuck that, MUSIC and GO TO: 
12.
EXT. MIAMI - MORNING 
Sun breaks, casting morning rays over the city. INT. BURNETT HOUSE - MORNING 
The front door flies open, letting in a walking rack of DRY CLEANING. A dog rushes in and undercuts the mess, tripping  the person in the center: MARCUS BURNETT. 
Oh shit! 
MARCUS 
THERESA (O.S.) 
Baby, that you? 
He falls, and the dog tramples the clothes. 
THERESA (CONT’D) 
Did you remember the dry-cleaning? 
Uh-huh!  
MARCUS 
(to the dog) 
Go, scoot, away. 
Past the open rumpus room door, a phone is ringing. INT. BURNETT HOUSE - “RUMPUS ROOM” - MOMENTS LATER 
Which has been converted into a combination gym/home office.  On the treadmill, JAMES BURNETT, 16, has just answered the  phone. QUINCY, 15, reads a men’s fitness magazine.  
JAMES 
Hello, B.S. Unlimited! 
MARCUS 
(entering) 
James! No, no, man. How many times  
do I have to tell you: it’s not  
B.S. unlimited. It’s “Burnett  
Services Unlimited. Private  
Investigator.” 
JAMES 
I think B.S. makes more sense.  
Marcus snatches the phone. Clears his throat. 
MARCUS 
Good morning. Burnett Services  
Unlimited. 
He scrambles for something to write on. Quincy hands him a  torn-out page from his magazine. It’s an ad for MALE BOTOX.  
13.
“Because you’ve only got one face. BRO-TOX.” The tight face  of a middle-aged man peers back. Marcus leers at Quincy. 
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
You’re adopted. 
(into the phone) 
Yes, ma’am, I got thirty years of  
investigative experience.  
Narcotics, Murder One, kidnapping,  
human trafficking. Seen it all.  
(crestfallen) 
Oh, your husband came home late? 
He begins writing notes onto the BRO-TOX AD. 
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
No ma’am, there is no sin too big  
or too small for Marcus Burnett. 
INT. BURNETT HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Marcus walks in on wife THERESA hugging their 22 year-old  daughter, MEGAN. 
THERESA 
...just make sure you break it to  
dad gently. 
MARCUS 
Break what to dad gently? 
Megan turns to Marcus. Smiles. 
Oh shit. 
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
Marcus!MEGAN 
THERESA 
Dad! 
MARCUS 
I’m sorry, baby. That was just a  reflex. I’m here now... What were  you gonna say? 
I’m -- 
Oh shit! Marcus! 
MEGAN 
MARCUS THERESA MARCUS 
Theresa, what do you want from me?  Our little girl wants to go off and  marry that idiot, Clark. 
14.
MEGAN 
Dad, I’m not marrying Clark. 
MARCUS 
Damn right you’re not.  
MEGAN 
I’m having his baby. 
MARCUS 
Oh hell no. 
Marcus -- 
THERESA MARCUS 
Theresa, excuse me, but no way.  First off, Clark’s unemployed -- 
MEGAN 
He’s not unemployed. He works at  home. He does freelance. 
MARCUS 
You know who also does freelance at  home? Hookers. And I wouldn’t want  them to be my baby’s baby daddy  either. 
MEGAN 
(storming past him) 
You’re unbelievable. 
Megan! 
MARCUS THERESA 
Good one, baby. Real slick.  
Theresa follows her now-crying daughter. Marcus looks down.  He still has the BRO-TOX AD in his hand. 
MARCUS 
What are you looking at? 
A beat as the picture catches his gaze again. Lingers there.  He doesn’t break. Wait, is Marcus considering “Bro-Tox?” 
EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY 
A cargo ship trudges over choppy waters, spewing smoke.  INT. CARGO SHIP - HOLD - SAME 
Ship see-sawing, Luga shaves his beard -- dry. Looks in a  small mirror at his new face, still menacing.  
15.
INT. MIKE’S PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - MORNING 
Panning across the ultimate bachelor pad, we pick up pieces  of clothes. Shoes. Pants. Then a skirt. A bra.  
We hear a shower running as we land on Mike, asleep in bed.  The phone RINGS, waking him. He picks it up, answering: 
MIKE 
Lowery... Yeah, alright. I’ll be  
there in twenty. 
An arm drapes over him. Belongs to IMG MODEL #1 from the  opening, a pair of HANDCUFFS dangling from her wrist. 
IMG MODEL #1 
Don’t tell me you’re leaving me  
again. 
MIKE 
Sorry, baby. Duty calls.  
IMG MODEL #2 (O.S.) 
But we haven’t posted bail yet. 
Mike looks to the BATHROOM where IMG MODEL #2 has just  emerged from the shower, naked and wet.  
But whereas before, Mike would mouth “damn”, now he  looks...bored. Has the bachelor life become too routine? 
EXT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
Mike’s Ferrari roars up. Parks. 
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - ELEVATOR - DAY Mike crosses the lobby to the elevator. As the doors shut -- 
VOICE  
Hold the elevator. 
Mike stops the doors from closing to reveal LT. ELLIE  GARRISON, strong-willed and beautiful. Even her conservative  business suit can’t diminish the luster she gives off.  
ELLIE 
(stepping inside) 
Sergeant. 
MIKE 
Lieutenant. 
Ellie hits the button for 6. Mike has already pressed 8.  Ellie is the only woman in Miami who won’t succumb to Mike’s  charm -- but that hasn’t stopped him from trying. 
16.
MIKE (CONT’D) 
Hear the brass wants you to head up  
Vice. Congratulations. 
ELLIE 
Thank you.  
MIKE 
Sure Howard’s gonna miss having you  
as his #2. If you want I could help  
you celebrate. 
ELLIE 
I don’t think so. 
MIKE 
You know one of these days you’re  
gonna surprise me and say yes. 
ELLIE 
And one of these days you’re gonna  
surprise me and say nothing. 
The elevator stops at Ellie’s floor and she gets out. Mike  smiles. Likes her. She’s a challenge. The doors close and -- 
INT. TNT DIVISION - MOMENTS LATER 
-- re-open on the 8th floor. Mike crosses the busy bullpen to  Howard’s closed office. 
INT. TNT DIVISION - HOWARD’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
MIKE 
(knocking as he enters) 
Hey Captain, they said you wanted  
to see me.  
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
Close the door. 
Mike sees Howard isn’t alone. There’s someone else with him:  FBI SPECIAL AGENT DAN KESSLER, 50’s. Mike closes the door. 
CAPTAIN HOWARD (CONT’D) 
Mike, this is Agent Dan Kessler  
with the FBI Miami field office. 
MIKE 
(sitting down) 
So is this a good meeting or a bad  
meeting? 
AGENT KESSLER 
Aleksander Luga escaped from Burrel 
Prison in Albania. 
17.
Mike reacts. He knows the name well. 
AGENT KESSLER (CONT’D) 
Needless to say, his capture has  
become top priority for both the  
bureau and Interpol. 
MIKE 
I’m sure not everyone is being told  
in person. 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
Mike, the FBI has reason to believe  
Luga’s on his way to Miami right  
now.  
MIKE 
To do what? 
AGENT KESSLER 
To kill you. 
For a second that hangs there -- but Mike is hardly rattled. 
MIKE 
That it? Bad guys try to kill me  
every day.  
AGENT KESSLER 
I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t  
think I was saving your life. We’ve  
got intel that his people back in  
Albania have been running searches  
on you. They have your social  
security number, your home  
address... 
MIKE 
Luga’s not a fool. He’s not gonna  
come all this way, risk all the  
heat, just to kill me.  
AGENT KESSLER 
(deadly serious) 
That’s exactly what he’ll do. You  
and Marcus Burnett killed his  
brother. The Albanians call it  
“Krvna Osveta”. Means he’s made a  
blood oath to get revenge against  
you both. His people have been  
doing this for centuries. Luga’s on  
a vendetta and he doesn't give a  
shit if Miami PD, FBI, Interpol,  
the Goddamn Marines, are after him.  
Now for your own safety, you need  
to be put into protective custody  
immediately —- 
(insulted) My safety? 
MIKE 
18.
AGENT KESSLER (CONT'D) 
-- while the FBI tracks down  
and apprehends Luga.  
MIKE 
If anyone is gonna apprehend him -- 
AGENT KESSLER 
(cutting him off;  
condescending as hell) 
It’s gonna be the FBI. We know all  
about how you operate, Lowery.  
Shoot first, can’t ask a question  
‘cause the suspect’s now dead. Now  
you’re to stand down like a good  
boy -- 
Insulted by “boy”, Mike stands up -- towering over Kessler.  
MIKE 
Boy, who you calling boy? 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
(rising; before things get  
out of hand) 
Thank you, Agent Kessler. I  
appreciate you bringing this to our  
attention.  
A beat, then Kessler, staring back at Mike, turns to Howard,  then leaves. The second the door closes behind him: 
MIKE 
Can you believe that shit, Captain? 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
I absolutely do... That’s why  
you’re going into protective  
custody immediately. 
MIKE 
What? You gotta be kidding -- 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
This guy broke out of a maximum  
security prison. I’m not taking any  
chances.  
MIKE 
There’s no way I’m sitting on my  
ass alone in some Motel 6 while  
there’s a target on my back. 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
First of all... it’s a Red Roof Inn  
and secondly, yes you are. Now go  
pack yourself a bag.  
19.
OFF MIKE -- hating this: 
EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY 
A fleet of POLICE CRUISERS roar past. 
EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - DAY 
The cop cars screech to a stop in front. MIAMI-DADE PD OFFICERS rush the house. Knock until Theresa answers. 
OFFICER 
Is your husband home, ma’am? 
THERESA 
He’s at work. What’s this about? 
The Burnett kids file up behind their mom, curious. 
OFFICER 
I need you and your family to come  
with us right now.  
THERESA 
Why, what’s happened?  
OFFICER 
Everything’s fine. I’ll explain on  
the way. We just need to make sure  
you and your family are safe. 
GO TO: 
A PERSONALIZED LICENCE PLATE.

EXT. MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
A fire red CAMARO Z28 is parked across from a small house. INT. CAMARO - SAME 
Marcus surveils the house of a client, MRS. WALLACE. Through  NIGHT-VISION BINOCULARS, Marcus glimpses TOM WALLACE in the  kitchen, washing the dishes.  
Marcus readies a PARABOLIC MIC, unfolding a satellite dish.  He slips in the earpiece to hear: 
MRS. WALLACE (O.S.) 
Oh, and can you remind me we need  
to get the dog’s dewclaw trimmed?  
He turns down the volume. 
20.
MRS. WALLACE (CONT’D) 
Jesus, Tom. Why are you putting  
those pans in the dishwasher? Are  
you trying to strip the Teflon? 
Marcus grimaces, muttering to himself. 
MARCUS 
Don’t let her punk you like that! 
He sees the Wallaces arguing. Marcus just stares ahead, a  faraway look in his eyes. Suddenly -- THREE BLACK SUBURBANS  WITH TINTED WINDOWS ROAR UP TO THE CAMARO. CAGE HIM IN.  
Marcus sits up. Who are these guys? Off which: 
EXT. RED ROOF INN - MAGIC 
Outside Miami, beside a highway, across from an empty field.  Sun setting, Cam’s Challenger drives up. 
INT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Walking up with Cam, Mike wraps up a call on his cell. 
MIKE 
Crawford. Lowery. Hit me back as  
soon as you get this. 
CAM 
Thought Howard said no calls. 
MIKE 
I’m not gonna sit on my hands. I  
gotta find this guy before he finds  
me. 
CAM 
So this Luga...you and Burnett  
killed his brother? 
(Mike nods) 
And now he wants to kill you.  
(Mike says nothing) 
Happens a lot with you, doesn’t it? 
They round a corner. Cam leads Mike to his room, explaining: 
CAM (CONT’D) 
Alright, you’re in room 124.  
Daltrey and Sanchez have set up a  
surveillance room across the hall.  
Captain’s orders: you are not to  
leave the room under any  
circumstances. You need something:  
food, toothbrush, Q-tip, dial 125.  
Otherwise, try to relax. 
21.
On “relax”, Cam unlocks room 124 and the door opens into: INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 124 - CONTINUOUS 
Where Mike is met by MARCUS -- sitting on the edge of the  bed, flipping through channels in a pair of SKINNY JEANS. 
MIKE 
What’s he doing here? 
MARCUS 
What am I doin’ here? No one said  
anythin’ about you bein’ here.  
CAM 
Captain’s orders -- 
MIKE 
Well, he can un-order it. 
CAM 
Luga wants to kill the both of you. 
MARCUS 
Which is why I need to get as far  
away from this man as possible! 
MIKE 
You need to be away from me? 
MARCUS 
You’re like a magnet for all things  
life-threatening.  
MIKE 
Here we go. 
(to Cam) 
Call down to the desk and get me  
another room. 
CAM 
Can’t do it.  
MIKE 
This is not gonna work. 
CAM 
This is the only secure room in the  
hotel. We got it wired for sound  
and video. We don’t have enough men  
to watch and protect two rooms, so 
what can I tell ya? You’re  
roommates. 
Cam steps out. Mike and Marcus lock eyes. Silence. 
22.
INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 125 (TNT ROOM) - SECONDS LATER Across the hall. Daltrey and Sanchez watch the Mike and  
Marcus reunion on a closed circuit feed. Daltrey packs a can  of dip -- SNAP, SNAP, SNAP. 
Cam enters. Joins them at the monitor. 
SANCHEZ 
Five bucks says Lowery swings  
first. 
RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:  
Mike notices the mess Marcus has already made in the tiny  room: fast food wrappers on the floor; used napkins on the  desk; clothes everywhere.  
MIKE 
Nice to see you’ve learned how to  
clean up after yourself. 
MARCUS 
Don’t start up with me. This is a  
bad situation for both of us.  
MIKE 
So why don’t you -- 
Mike pauses, fully registering Marcus in his skin-tight  skinny jeans for the first time. 
MIKE (CONT’D) 
What the hell are you wearing? 
MARCUS 
What? These are my threads. 
MIKE 
Look at you. You can barely move. 
MARCUS 
They fit just fine.  
MIKE 
They’re painted on! 
MARCUS 
You’re just jealous cause you’re  
not the coolest looking -- 
MIKE 
How the hell am I supposed to take  
you seriously in those? 
23.
MARCUS 
What do I care if you take me  
seriously or not. That’s the beauty  
of not having to work with you  
anymore. 
MIKE 
So why don’t you just walk out? Not  
like you haven’t done that before. 
MARCUS 
Oh so that’s how it’s gonna be,  
huh? 
MIKE 
Wasn’t my call, remember?  
MARCUS 
Yeah, and I know how much that  
bothers you. 
MIKE 
What’s that supposed to mean? 
MARCUS 
It’s the Mike Lowery Show and we’re  
all just guest stars.  
MIKE 
Is it possible for you to not talk  
out of your ass?  
RESUME CAM, DALTREY AND SANCHEZ:  
DALTREY 
My folks used to fight the exact  
same way. 
RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:  
getting loud and tense. 
MARCUS 
I warned you not to screw around  
with these Albanians! You know what  
a blood oath means to these mother fuckers! 
MIKE 
So I should have just let Luga and  
his family traffic coke, H and  
molly all throughout Central  
Florida?  
24.
MARCUS 
Luga’s brother could’ve been taken  
down a whole other way, but no. You  
had to go all Magnum Force on ‘em. 
RESUME CAM, DALTREY AND SANCHEZ: 
CAM 
Magnum Force? 
RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:  
MIKE 
You were a cop. That’s supposed to  
mean something.  
MARCUS 
I was a cop. But you were a fucking  
crazy cop.  
MIKE 
Just admit it: you left ‘cause you  
were scared. 
MARCUS 
Hell yeah, I was scared! And the  
fact that I’m locked up here with  
you ‘cause there’s some super  
villain tryin’ to kill us proves me  
right! 
INT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - SAME 
A FIGURE walks up to Mike and Marcus’ room. 
INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 125 (TNT ROOM) - SAME Seeing the body approach the door: 
SANCHEZ 
Heads up, we got movement. 
RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:  
MARCUS 
You know what you need? You need a  
life coach. ‘Cause sooner or later  
you were gonna get yourself killed  
and me along with you!  
MIKE 
If you hated me so much, why’d it  
take you so long to quit? 
MARCUS 
Question I ask myself every single  
day.  
25.
INT. RED ROOF INN - HALLWAY - SAME 
The figure knocks on Mike and Marcus’ door.  
FIGURE 
Hotel secur -- 
Doors on either side of him swing open and SEVERAL GUNS are  leveled out at the man -- who we now see is a RED ROOF INN  EMPLOYEE, scared shitless. 
RED ROOF EMPLOYEE 
...so yeah, if you can keep it  
down... or not... whatever.  
(backing away) 
Have a nice night. “Hit the Roof.” 
He moves down the hall as if there was a motor on his ass.  
A beat later, both room doors are slammed shut -- and Mike  and Marcus show the other their backs, tenser than ever. 
INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 125 (TNT ROOM) - SAME 
Cam collapses back in his chair, exhaling: 
CAM 
This is gonna be a long assignment. 
EXT. RED ROOF INN - NIGHT 
Hours have passed. Night has fallen.  
RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:  
both in bed -- but only Mike is awake. Can’t sleep. You  couldn’t either -- if you heard how LOUDLY Marcus is SNORING. 
MIKE 
You gotta be kidding me. 
EXT. RED ROOF INN - DAY 
Blinding sun. 
INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 124 - SAME 
Mike plays chess on his iPad. A cockroach skitters across the  floor. Marcus sees it. JUMPS. 
Oh shit! What? 
MARCUS MIKE 
26.
MARCUS 
Did you see that?  
Mike looks up. Doesn’t see the cockroach. A SECOND COCKROACH then appears. Bigger too. Marcus’s eyes go wide. 
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
Oh shit! Fuck me!  
MIKE 
Would you keep your voice down. 
MARCUS 
That’s a fucking armadillo!  
The second cockroach catches up to the first. Starts EATING  it in front of Marcus. (Yes, they do that.) 
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
Holy shit. It’s eatin’ the mother fucka! I gotta get the fuck out of  
here.  
MIKE 
We can’t go anywhere. 
MARCUS 
Not only do they put us together,  
we got the Goddamn -- 
Marcus stops, overcome with an intense scratching fit. 
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
Why the fuck am I itching?!? What  
the hell are they doin’ to me in  
here!?! 
Mike shakes his head. Give me a break. Off which: INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 125 (TNT ROOM) - LATER THAT DAY 
Sanchez and Daltrey are growing bored watching Mike and  Marcus on the monitor.  
DALTREY 
Craziest place you’ve ever had sex. 
SANCHEZ 
Probably the bathroom. 
DALTREY 
Bathroom’s not so crazy.  
SANCHEZ 
It was in a church. 
(off Daltrey’s look) 
Preacher’s daughter. 
27.
Cam comes in with take-out. Hands out lunch. 
CAM 
What’d I miss? 
ON THE SCREEN:  
Mike, on “his side” of the room, kicks Marcus’s trash back  onto “Marcus’s side”.  
MIKE (ON THE SCREEN) 
Would you please clean up after  
yourself!  
Mike swings open the door to the bathroom. Instantly recoils.  
Jesus!  
MIKE (ON THE SCREEN) (CONT’D) MARCUS (ON THE SCREEN) 
Yeah, that’s my bad. 
Cam rolls his eyes.  
EXT. MIAMI DOCKS - NIGHT 
In shadow, a Ford Flex waits, three ALBANIAN GUNMEN in front.  The leader, VIKTOR, looks at the cargo ship arriving. 
Moments later, Luga emerges from the ship.  
VIKTOR 
Welcome, Mr. Luga. I’m Viktor. Mr.  
Hess sent us. We’re to take -- 
LUGA 
Give me your phone. 
Viktor’s caught off guard by the request. Luga just stares  him down, eyes clarifying “give me your fucking phone.”  
Viktor doesn’t know what to do, but he knows better than to  piss someone like Luga off. Wisely hands it over. 
Luga steps away. Pulls a paper with a number on it. Dials.  
But we stay with Viktor and his men, watching Luga. They  trade looks. What the hell is going on? A beat later, Luga  returns. Now wants something else. 
LUGA (CONT’D) 
Give me a gun. 
Viktor trades confused glances with his men. 
VIKTOR 
Mr. Luga...? 
28.
LUGA 
I said give me a gun now. 
Luga locks his eyes into Viktor again. No, he’s not fucking  around. Viktor is stuck.  
He hands Luga a Glock. But it’s not enough. 
LUGA (CONT’D) 
You have more? 
(half-nod from Viktor) 
Get in the car. 
Luga moves past them, to the Ford Flex. Viktor turns back to  his men, who shrug. Who the hell is leading who here? The  trio hop into the car. It drives off, sky GRUMBLING. 
EXT. RED ROOF INN - NIGHT 
A sheet of rain POURS down.  
INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 124 - NIGHT 
Mike and Marcus have now been sharing the same small space  for over 24 hours and it shows. Both look frazzled. On edge.  Mike’s phone buzzes. 
Lowery. 
MIKE 
Marcus looks over, curious as Mike talks -- sotto:  
MIKE (CONT’D) 
Yeah... yeah, no, I hear you. Well,  
get back to me if you do. 
He hangs up. A beat -- then: 
MARCUS 
That about Luga? 
(Mike says nothing) 
You got any leads?  
MIKE 
...Yeah. Few. 
MARCUS 
(in the silence) 
Any you wanna let me in on...? 
MIKE 
Sorry, that’s police business. But  
if someone loses a cat, I’ll get  
you their number. 
MARCUS 
I’m not a pet detective, Mike. 
29.
MIKE 
Right. You’re just a private dick. 
MARCUS 
At least I keep it private.  
Everyone knows you’re a dick. 
Mike gets up into Marcus’s face, tension ESCALATING. 
MIKE 
You know after two days, I’ve had  
just about enough of your bullshit. 
MARCUS 
My bullshit?  
MIKE 
That’s right, your bullshit. Don’t  
forget for one moment: out of the  
two of us, I’m the only one who is  
still a cop, so I’m ordering you to  
sit your ass down and shut up. 
INT. RED ROOF INN - ROOM 125 (TNT ROOM) - SAME 
CAM

Uh-oh. Code red, code-red.

MARCUS 
After all this time, you still  
think you’re the boss of me. 
MIKE 
I should do now what I should’ve  
done a year ago.  
MARCUS 
Yeah, and what’s that Donald Chump? 
MIKE 
Knock you flat on your ass. 
MARCUS 
(rolling up his sleeves) 
Take your best shot, Lowery.  
A beat -- then they both LUNGE AT EACH OTHER! RESUME TNT ROOM:  
Oh fuck! 
CAM 
RESUME MIKE AND MARCUS:  
30.
SLAMMING into walls, THRASHING about the room, CRASHING into  the bathroom -- the shower -- SHATTERING mirrors -- both  intense and funny at the same time -- like two brothers  WRESTLING -- taunting each other in between blows: 
MIKE 
C’mon, mother-fucker, you  fight like a bitch! 
MARCUS 
That the best you got? No  wonder you like shooting  people -- ‘cause you can’t  punch for shit! 
Finally the door BURSTS OPEN. TNT RUSHES IN. Pries them off. EXT. RED ROOF INN - LATER

This ain’t gonna work, Cap’n. 
CAPTAIN HOWARD (CONT’D) 
Ha. Do I know you or what? 
(to TNT) 
Kids. Out. 
Cam, Daltrey and Sanchez file out. When they’re gone: 
CAPTAIN HOWARD (CONT’D) 
Jesus. Look at the two of you. Were  
you guys born assholes or did you  
have to audit a class? 
MARCUS 
Captain, I appreciate you looking  
out for us, but how long do you  
expect us to stay in this room  
together? 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
Not a minute longer, Marcus. That’s  
why I’m here. I’m letting you go. 
You are? 
MARCUS 
31.
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
No, idiot. There’s a psycho out  
there with a vendetta against you  
guys who will not stop until you’re  
in a box! 
Off which, we begin an INTERCUT with: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
The Ford Flex drives past, wheels kicking up rainwater. RESUME HOWARD:  
talking to Mike and Marcus, sounding like someone who’s no  stranger to a couples therapy session.  
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
Look, way I see it, you both have a  
legit beef with the other. 
EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
A propane truck gets re-fueled. The Ford Flex stops behind  it. The TRUCK DRIVER goes back to his seat. 
Luga blows a hole in his chest. Pulls his corpse onto the wet  pavement. Takes his place behind the wheel. Drives off. 
RESUME RED ROOF INN: 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
Mike, you take too many chances and  
sooner or later that way of living  
is gonna kill you or those you care  
about. 
RESUME PROPANE TRUCK:  
speeding down the highway, the Ford Flex following. RESUME RED ROOF INN:

depend on you and you weren’t there  
for Mike when he needed you most. 
INT. FORD FLEX - INTERCUTTING 
Viktor and his men are scared shitless. Viktor is on his  phone, talking to Bardha (Hess’s #2). 
VIKTOR 
He’s out of his fucking mind!  
INTERCUT BARDHA:  
32.
BARDHA 
I don’t give a shit. He’s your  
responsibility. 
VIKTOR 
You don’t understand. He just took  
my gun and is leading us somewhere.  
BARDHA 
He took your gun or you gave it to  
him? 
Viktor doesn’t respond. 
BARDHA (CONT’D) 
Just know: something happens to  
him, something will happen to you, understand!?!  
(Viktor does) 
Now get him and bring him here. 
RESUME RED ROOF INN: 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
But you got too many years together  
just to throw friendship away  
because neither of you has the  
balls to say sorry.  
EXT. HIGHWAY - INTERCUTTING 
The propane truck rockets forward. In the distance, we make  out the Red Roof Inn. 
RESUME RED ROOF INN: 
CAPTAIN HOWARD 
So we’re gonna put this bullshit to  
a stop. Right here, right now,  
you’re gonna apologize to each  
other.

GUNMAN #1 
(to Viktor) 
What the fuck do we do? 
Luga pops open the trunk. Guns inside. He grabs an H&K  machine gun. Viktor gets out of the car.  
VIKTOR 
Luga, get back in the car now. 
But Luga isn’t listening, cocking his gun trigger, ordering: 
LUGA 
Get your fucking guns out!

Luga takes aim. But Mike gets to his feet, SHOOTING, causing  Luga to DUCK BACK.  
Marcus quickly jumps up too. Pulls up Howard. Cam, Daltrey  and Sanchez follow.  
Luga swings back around, SPRAYING SHOTS, but the cops quickly  ESCAPE the corridor, BOMBING into nearby doors -- Mike,  Marcus and Howard in one that leads to a ROOM; Cam, Daltrey  and Sanchez in another that leads to an EMERGENCY EXIT.

C’mon Captain, you gotta get up. 
But Howard doesn’t move -- Marcus soon realizing that his  clothes are stained with blood -- HOWARD’S BLOOD.  
He looks down. Howard’s SHOT, bleeding BAD. Marcus looks up  at Mike, still trading shots with Luga.

RESUME MIKE:

MIKE 
Marcus, stay with him! 
Mike CHARGES after Luga. Marcus takes Howard’s hand.

It’s gonna be okay, Captain. You’re  
gonna be alright.

Mike and Luga trade vicious blows on the ground. Luga reaches  behind his back. Draws a SIX INCH STILETTO.  
He THRUSTS it down -- but Mike grabs his wrist. Luga presses  down HARDER. Mike BITES Luga’s hand. Kicks him off. 
Then -- HEADLIGHT BEAMS hit Mike. He looks up to see the FORD  FLEX SCREAMING UP.  
Mike quickly ROLLS out of the way, the SUV just missing him,  screeching to a sudden stop, on its way to picking up Luga. 
POLICE CRUISERS appear in the distance, coming up fast.  The Ford Flex doors open, Viktor screaming at Luga to: 
VIKTOR 
GET IN THE FUCKING CAR! 
But Luga refuses to go, a man POSSESSED as he grabs a gun  from one of Viktor’s men and hurries around to the other side  of the SUV -- FIRING at Mike, who DIVES behind a parked car,  Luga keeping his finger firmly pressed on the trigger, rounds  ripping open the fuel tank. 
Mike sees the car is about to blow and he quickly RUNS OFF as  Luga continues to shoot until --  
-- BOOOOM! -- the car ERUPTS. Goes AIRBORNE. Mike DIVES.  
38.
The car comes CRASHING down, stopping short of crushing Mike  when it lands atop another car hood, right beside him. 
Luga -- CLICK! -- runs out of bullets. Cam, Daltrey and  Sanchez run up, firing in his direction.  
Luga turns. Sees the cruisers coming. Then whips around,  searching again for Mike -- but he can’t see him through the  rain, smoke and fire. FUCK! He missed his shot.  
He gets back in the Ford Flex. It PEELS AWAY.  
Covered in soot, Mike watches Luga disappear.

(in Albanian; subtitled) 
Do you know what you did? You’re  
all over the fucking news!  
Luga says nothing. Just lets Hess bluster. 
HESS (CONT’D) 
Every law enforcement agent in  
Florida is looking for you now. 
LUGA 
You think I care about your police?  
Back home, they’re the criminals. 
HESS 
You’re not home. We have a way of  
doing things here. And I’m not  
gonna let you further jeopardize  
everything I’ve worked toward -- 
LUGA 
You hide. You fear the police when  
they should fear you.  
HESS 
(not backing down) 
Forager’s here in two days. You’re  
not leaving until then. 
Luga sees he’s surrounded by Hess’s GUNMEN. Trapped. 
He then turns back to Hess. Says nothing. Just smiles. It’s  unnerving as hell. A chill runs down Hess’s spine but he  doesn’t let his anxiety show.  
Moments later, a metal door SLIDES OPEN. Luga steps inside,  disappearing down into the basement.  
Albanians SEAL the door behind him, locking Luga inside.  
BARDHA 
Are you sure about him? 
HESS 
I’m sure he’s essential. I’m sure  
if he wasn’t the only one who could  
do what needed to be done, I’d  
drown him in the river myself.  
(turning to Bardha) 
The three you sent to bring him  
here..?  
BARDHA 
They didn’t show. Luga came alone.  
Viktor and them are probably  
running. Scared for their lives. 
40.
HESS 
They should be. Find them -- and  
kill them. 
Bardha nods. Turns and leaves.  
AGENT KESSLER (V.O.) 
What part of what I’m telling you  
are you not clear about,  
lieutenant? 
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - SITUATION ROOM - MORNING 
Ellie squares off against Kessler, passionate and intense.  Also on hand: MIAMI-DADE P.D. BRASS, including INSPECTOR  ROBERT LUTTRELL of Internal Affairs. 40’s. Tough, but fair.  
AGENT KESSLER 
You and your officers are to stand  
down from this investigation  
immediately. 
ELLIE 
And what part of “I don’t give a  
shit” are you not clear about,  
Agent Kessler? That’s one of our  
own fighting for his life in a  
hospital bed right now. No way FBI  
keeps us out of this! 
AGENT KESSLER 
Do you even know who you’re dealing  
with? Before he was an enforcer  
with the Albanian mafia, Aleksander  
Luga was in the Special Operations  
Battalion. One of the best trained  
units in Europe and part of the  
elite Commando Regiment. He’s also  
an experienced pilot, highly  
skilled in hand-to-hand combat,  
knife training and light and heavy  
artillery readiness. Responsible  
for at least 26 confirmed  
assassinations, so even if we  
allowed Miami PD to go after him,  
you’re not equipped to do so. 
ELLIE 
(not backing down) 
That is total bullshit! 
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - SAME 
Mike moves with purpose up the corridor. He’s still in last  night’s blood-stained clothes. 
RESUME SITUATION ROOM: 
41.
AGENT KESSLER 
(softening) 
Look, Lieutenant, I’m sorry about  
Captain Howard... I am. But this is  
bigger than you know.  
LUTTRELL 
Why? What are you talking about? 
Kessler pauses. Doesn’t want to give up any details, but his  silence betrays him. 
ELLIE 
Luga didn’t just come here to kill  
Lowery and Burnett, did he? 
AGENT KESSLER 
I can’t tell you that. Not until we  
can be sure there are no more  
leaks.  
Leaks?  
LUTTRELL 
AGENT KESSLER 
Luga found out where you were  
keeping Lowery and Burnett. That  
didn’t come from us. What you  
should be focusing on now is  
finding another safe place for them  to wait this out. 
ELLIE 
Because that worked so well the  
first time? Or is it cause you  
think setting up one of ours as  
bait is a good way to flush out  
your fugitive? 
AGENT KESSLER 
Conspiracy theories aside, Luga is  
an FBI matter -- which means Miami  
PD will stand down. All evidence  
relating to last night is under our  jurisdiction.  
LUTTRELL 
Agent Kessler, with all due  
respect, the shooting at the Red  
Roof Inn involved our officers, not  yours. Miami PD Internal Affairs  
has a responsibility to investigate  and every right to look at any  
evidence you have. 
Kessler pauses. He’s right. Can’t shut him out. 
42.
AGENT KESSLER 
Alright... I’ll allow access only  
to Internal Affairs, but our  
cooperation ends there, you  
understand?  
Luttrell nods. Fine. 
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER 
Mike reaches the situation room just as the door opens and  Kessler moves out past him. Ellie sees Mike and walks up.  
MIKE 
Let me guess: stand down and shut  
up? 
ELLIE 
I know how you feel, Mike. No one  
wants to get this asshole more than  
me, but we have to let the Feds 
take the lead.  
But Mike doesn’t buy that, cutting past her, leaving. 
Mike! 
ELLIE (CONT’D) 
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Mike moves with purpose. Down the hall from him is Cam with  the TNT team. He sees Mike coming. Offers condolences. 
CAM 
Mike, about Captain Howard, I just  
wanted to say -- 
But he never gets it out, Mike blowing by him. Shut out, Cam  watches his partner disappear around a corner as we GO TO: 
EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - DAY 
Five Miami-Dade PD cars are parked in front, keeping watch. INT. BURNETT HOUSE - SAME 
Police looking on: Burnetts dump bags and suitcases, packing  for an extended trip. Marcus coordinates from a balcony. 
MARCUS 
Alright Burnetts, you’re just here  
to take what you need and get out.  
You’re leavin’ in ten minutes.  
Jesus, Megan, how many suitcases  
you plan on bringin’? You’re just  
goin’ on a trip, you’re not movin’ 
out. 
43.
MEGAN 
How do I know that? No one’s  
telling me where we’re going or for  
how long. 
MARCUS 
That’s ‘cause you don’t need to  
know. It’s not safe. I’m tryin’ to  
protect you.  
MEGAN 
Then let me bring all my clothes  
with me! 
EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - SAME 
Mike’s Ferrari rolls up. He regards the house. Been a while  since he’s been here.  
A beat and he walks to the door. Gives a nod to the uniform  cops manning the house. 
INT. BURNETT HOUSE - SAME 
Responding to Mike’s knock, Theresa opens the door.  
THERESA 
(surprised) 
Mike. 
MIKE 
Hey, Theresa, great to see you. 
They hug. Unlike her husband, Theresa missed seeing him. 
THERESA 
Great to see you. Even under the  
circumstances... How’s Captain  
Howard? 
MIKE 
Hard to say. Touch and go. 
THERESA 
We’re praying for him. 
Marcus’s kids see Mike. Head over. Thrilled. 
JAMES/QUINCY 
Hey, Uncle Mike!/Yo, Uncle Mike,  
what’s up? 
Seeing them, Mike lights up. He missed them. They slap hands. 
MIKE 
Oh my God, you boys got HUGE!  
Megan, damn, you’re a beauty.  
44.
MARCUS (O.S.) 
What are you doin’ here, Mike?  
Mike looks up to see Marcus, on the balcony above. 
THERESA 
(behave) 
Marcus. 
MEGAN 
Uncle Mike, has my dad told you the  
good news? 
What news?MARCUS 
MIKE 
Megan, zip it! 
MEGAN 
(as Marcus protests:) 
I’m pregnant! 
Mike’s jaw drops.  
MIKE 
WOW!(to Marcus) 
HEY! (to Megan) 
YES!(they hug) 
CONGRATS! 
Thank you! 
MEGAN MARCUS 
Mike. Downstairs. Now. 
INT. BURNETT HOUSE - “RUMPUS ROOM” - MOMENTS LATER Marcus leads Mike downstairs. Mike looks around the “office.” 
MIKE 
Wow. The nerve center. 
MARCUS 
What are you doin’ here, Mike? I  
thought you wanted nothin’ to do  
with me. 
MIKE 
You still tight with Coleman at the  
FBI Miami office? 
MARCUS 
...He owes me a few favors. Why? 
45.
MIKE 
Feds are shutting Miami PD out of  
the Luga investigation. I need  
access to the Feds’ evidence file  
on the shooting last night. 
MARCUS 
So you came here to use me. 
MIKE 
Regardless of what’s going on with  
you and me, I owe it to Howard to  
go after Luga. Not to mention that  
as long as he’s out there, neither  
one of us is safe. No matter how  
far you send your family away.  
Marcus considers him, then: 
MARCUS 
You don’t have to convince me. I  
wanna find him just as badly as you  
do. 
INT. BURNETT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Mike waits for Marcus to say his goodbyes. 
MARCUS 
Alright, y’all say goodbye. Daddy’s  
gotta go to work. 
The Burnetts flock in -- but quickly bypass their dad and go  directly to Mike, hugging him with love.  
JAMES/QUINCY/MEGAN 
Bye, Uncle Mike!/We love  
you!/Please see us again! 
Mike beams, hugging them back -- while Marcus steams. 
MARCUS 
Yeah, keep on showin’ him the love.  
It’s not like Uncle Mike’s the  
reason you-all goin’ into hidin’. 
Marcus sees Theresa, coming down the hall. He crosses up to  her. They hug. A private husband and wife moment.  
THERESA 
I’m scared, Marcus. 
MARCUS 
Don’t be, baby. These cops are  
gonna make sure nothing happens to  
you or the kids. Everything’s gonna  
be alright. I swear.  
46.
Mike watches the couple, close. We catch a flicker of regret  on his face -- then Marcus walks out with him. 
EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
MIKE 
My car’s over here. 
MARCUS 
Oh no, no, this ain’t like old  
times. I’m not riding shotgun in  
Bruce Wayne’s car. We doin’ this,  
we’re taking my ride this time. 
Marcus leads Mike over to his red-hot Camaro.  
Whoa... 
MIKE 
(reading the license  
plate) 
Straight Pimpin’. Huh. They  
couldn’t fit mid-life crisis on  
there?  
Marcus digs into the pocket of his skinny jeans. 
MIKE (CONT’D) 
Sure you can even get the keys out? 
MARCUS 
I can get the keys out! 
Marcus struggles. Clearly he can’t.  
Mike can’t help but smile as Marcus, with some difficulty,  finally gets his hand out of his pocket, pulling out his keys  -- along with his wallet and phone -- which go FLYING.  
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
Not a word. 
MIKE 
No problem, grandpa. 
Marcus pauses, steaming -- then picks up his stuff and gets  in the car without another word to Mike. The two drive off. 
EXT. MIAMI HOMESTEAD SPEEDWAY - DAY 
A BLUR of stock cars ZIP around a race track. Marcus sits  with COLEMAN, an old friend and seasoned FBI agent. 
COLEMAN 
The office already got an e-mail  
about this, warning everyone not to  
cooperate with Miami PD. 
47.
MARCUS 
Good thing I’m not Miami PD 
anymore. 
COLEMAN 
Yeah, but your crazy-ass partner  
still is. 
MARCUS 
Lowery ain’t my partner no more.  
This is for me and Captain Howard. 
Coleman debates, then: 
COLEMAN 
Alright...but this stays between  
us. We ID’d one of the shooters  
with Luga from the hotel  
surveillance footage. His name’s  
Viktor Gojahki. He’s tied into the  
Albanian mob, but he’s pissing in  
the wind. No one knows where he is.  
And if we can’t find him, good  
luck.  
EXT. MIAMI HOMESTEAD SPEEDWAY - PARKING LOT - SAME 
Mike stands in front of the Camaro. A group of hot-looking  SPEEDWAY GIRLS walk past. Give Mike the eye.  
MIKE 
Yup, I can make any car look good. 
Marcus crosses up.  
MARCUS 
I got a name. 
Marcus gets in the car as Mike’s phone buzzes. 
Lowery. 
MIKE 
ELLIE (V.O.) 
Just wanted to make sure I made  
myself clear earlier. 
MIKE 
What, about not wanting to date me?  Yeah, but I didn’t really take that  too seriously. 
INTERCUT: 
48.
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - ELLIE’S OFFICE - SAME 
ELLIE 
About Luga. You’re not going after  
him, correct? 
MIKE 
Absolutely not.  
ELLIE 
‘Cause you need to stay away from  
this case. Cam’s with you, right? 
MIKE 
Of course. We’re attached at the  
hip. I love that kid. 
ELLIE 
Good. I want someone watching your  
back. After last night, you need to  
low. I’ll check in with you guys  
later. 
MIKE 
Always love you checking me out,  
Lt. 
Ellie hangs up. Mike knows he has no choice but to call Cam. 
Shit. 
MIKE (CONT’D) 
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - GYMNASIUM - DAY Cam POUNDS a punching bag, then answers his ringing phone.  
CAM 
What’s up, Mike? 
INT. CAMARO - LATER 
Mike and Marcus ride in front, Cam sits in the back. 
CAM 
(after a beat of silence) 
So, Mike... you gonna tell me where  
we’re going or what? 
MIKE 
I’ll tell you when we get there. 
CAM 
I know you don’t think so, but I  
can probably contribute to whatever  
it is you’re not supposed to be  
doing. (MORE) 
49.
CAM (CONT'D) 
(off Mike’s silence, Cam  
leans forward) 
Come on, I saw your eyes at HQ and  
after your couples therapy session  
at the inn, there’s only one reason  
you’d be sharing a car with  
Burnett. You’re going after Luga  
and you’re worried if Ellie sees me  
without my partner, she’ll stop  
you. 
Mike won’t admit he’s right. Marcus is impressed. 
MARCUS 
Gotta say, Mike, your boy’s quick. 
MIKE 
He’s not my boy. He’s a pain in the  
ass. 
CAM 
Hey Mike, just because I don’t do  
things exactly the way you do -- 
MIKE 
You don’t know how to do things,  
that’s the problem.  
MARCUS 
You know, I don’t know what it is,  
but there’s something very familiar  
about this conversation. 
MIKE 
Don’t start in, Marcus. 
MARCUS 
Cam, let me ask you something: has  
Mike ever canceled SWAT on you  
right before you’re about to go in  
on a bust?  
CAM 
Shit, yeah. He did it twice in the  
same month.  
MARCUS 
Alright, what you gotta do next  
time is call ahead and let them  
know -- 
MIKE 
What are you, his mentor now? 
MARCUS 
That’s right. Professor Marcus X. 
50.
CAM 
Let me ask you something, Marcus. 
MARCUS 
Shoot, my brother. 
CAM 
When you guys were on a stakeout  
and you had to have something to  
eat -- 
MARCUS 
(knows exactly where this  
is going) 
And he won’t let you have food in  
his car. Man, bullshit to that! 
Cam and Marcus laugh. Mike doesn’t. 
CAM 
Man, you’re alright, Marcus.  
MARCUS 
Thanks, Cam. I think you’re cool  
too. 
MIKE 
That definitely means a lot from a  
grown ass man in skinny jeans. 
Before Marcus can strike back: 
CAM 
Yeah, I was gonna ask, what is up  
with those pants anyway? They help  
with posture or...? 
MARCUS 
What the fuck, you’re starting in  
on me, too!?! 
CAM 
I’m sorry, but Mike does have a  
point. 
MARCUS 
I don’t believe this shit. 
MIKE 
Yeah, it’s tough when you think  
someone’s got your back and then  
they don’t.  
CAM 
Mike, come on, that isn’t fair -- 
51.
MIKE 
Shut up, Cam. 
MARCUS 
Yeah, shut up, Cam. 
Cam sits back, giving up. 
CAM 
Man, you guys deserve each other. 
EXT. LIBERTY CITY - DAY 
A violent Miami neighborhood. The Camaro drives through. INT. CAMARO - DAY 
MIKE 
Okay. According to Payton in gang  
intel, Gojahki’s mother lives  
there. #11.  
EXT. LIBERTY CITY STREET - SECONDS LATER 
The Camaro stops across the street from the #11 house.  INT. CAMARO - SAME 
Peering out the window at Viktor’s mom’s house: 
CAM 
You sure this is gonna work? 
MIKE 
These Albanians are nothing if not  
tight with their families. Marcus,  
you got any surveillance equipment? 
MARCUS 
I’m a PI, Mike. What do you think? 
EXT. LIBERTY CITY STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
The trunk pops open. Inside: various audio and visual  surveillance equipment -- along with personal defense  weapons, including a TASER GUN.  
Marcus grabs a phone hacking device called a GYPSY WIRE while  Cam picks up a camcorder. Presses play. His jaw drops when --  
A VERY SHAKY SEX TAPE 
between Marcus and Theresa plays. 
THERESA (ON THE TAPE) 
Come on, Marcus, forget the camera. 
52.
MARCUS (ON THE TAPE) 
Trust me baby, we’re gonna love  
having this when we’re older. 
Husband and wife go at it as Marcus’s eyes light up. Mike  looks over the screen.  
MIKE 
Dude, two words “tri-pod” 
MARCUS 
Give it back! 
CAM 
I think I see the tri-pod. 
Red, Marcus grabs the camera from Cam. Shuts it off. 
MIKE 
Just say the word and I can give  
you a few pointers. 
Marcus tosses the camera back into the trunk. Replaces it  with a pair of SPIKED CLIMBING SHOES.  
MIKE (CONT’D) 
Who are you, Paul Bunyon? 
MARCUS 
How else do you think I’m gettin’ 
up on that pole?  
Marcus slips on the shoes: 
CAM 
So you call up the mom, tell her  
that her son’s been shot. She tries  
calling Viktor, but Marcus cuts the  
line before the call is placed. 
MARCUS 
Mom has no choice but to see if  
he’s alive for herself. She gets in  
her car -- 
MIKE 
And takes us right to him.  
Marcus rises. Grabs the gypsy wire. Puts his “game face” on. 
MARCUS 
Okay. Let’s do this. 
Marcus shuts the trunk and walks off toward the TELEPHONE  POLE, spikes digging into the pavement with each step.  
53.
INT. VIKTOR’S MOM’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
An Albanian soap plays on a TV with rabbit ears.  
MRS. GOJAHKI adjusts her recliner. She’s old and mean as  fuck. In the window behind her, we can just make out -- 
EXT. LIBERTY CITY STREET - SAME 
-- Marcus struggling to climb the telephone pole. INT. CAMARO - SAME 
Same seats as before: Mike, up front. Cam in the back.  
CAM 
You really hate having a partner  
don’t you, Mike? 
Mike says nothing. 
CAM (CONT’D) 
Marcus, me. If it was up to you,  
you’d just do everything yourself. 
MIKE 
Occasionally I need someone to get  
me coffee. 
CAM 
You read my jacket before we were  
partnered up. You know what I can  
do. What I bring to the game. 
MIKE 
Yeah. Headache. Problem with you is  
you have no idea what it takes to  
be a real cop. You got no field  
experience. 
CAM 
I think the only reason you give me  
no respect is because I remind you  
of you -- only you’re a step slower  
and I’m the up and comer. 
MIKE 
Please, if you reminded me of me,  
I’d kick my own ass. Now shut up.  
You may learn something. 
EXT. LIBERTY CITY STREET - SAME 
Sweat POURING, Marcus reaches the phone box. He pops it open  and connects the gypsy wire, tapping into the mom’s line. 
54.
INT. CAMARO - SAME 
MIKE 
... cool. And you’re sure she just  
has the land line, right? No cell  
phone.(beat) 
Thanks, Lisa. I owe you one. 
He hangs up. Dials a new number. 
INT. VIKTOR’S MOM’S HOUSE - INTERCUTTING 
An old-school ROTARY PHONE rings. Viktor’s mom grimaces and  answers the call. With a THICK EUROPEAN ACCENT: 
Yes. 
MRS. GOJAHKI MIKE 
This is Viktor Gojahki’s mom? 
Who this? 
MRS. GOJAHKI MIKE 
I’m the guy who just shot your son!  
He’s dead. 
Mike hangs up. Cam looks at him, shameful. 
CAM 
This is just mean, man. 
MIKE 
Mean, but it works. 
Mrs. Gojahki hangs up, concerned. Is it true? She immediately  picks back up the phone. Dials a new number. 
RESUME MARCUS:  
hearing her dial a new number, but before she can get  connected to anyone, he cuts the call.  
RESUME MRS GOJAHKI: 
MRS. GOJAHKI 
(hearing nothing on the  
other end) 
Hello?... Hello? 
Nothing. She hangs up. Thinks. Then steps out of frame. RESUME MARCUS:  
climbing down the wooden pole. Gets a splinter along the way. 
Ahh fuck! 
MARCUS 
55.
(then another) 
Shit.(and a third for good  
measure) 
Mother-fucka! 
He jumps the last few feet and hits the ground, swallowing a  yell. Then steels himself and gets back in the Camaro. 
Viktor’s mom exits her house, gets into her own car and  drives down off. Marcus follows in pursuit. The plan worked. 
EXT. MIAMI STREET - MAGIC 
Sun setting, Viktor’s mom’s car passes, followed by Marcus.  EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - VIRGINIA KEY - MAGIC 
Built in 1963, the concrete amphitheatre overlooking a man made basin and the Miami skyline was condemned in 1992. It  stands now, completely painted over in graffiti.  
Viktor’s mom pulls up to the street to the stadium. RESUME CAMARO: 
MIKE 
Alright, she’s slowing down. Viktor 
must be hiding out in the stadium.  
Get in front of her. We’ll cut her  
off. Marcus, get to her door. 
Marcus hits the gas. Cuts in front of the mom’s car. She  stops short. Mike, Marcus and Cam explode out of the Camaro.  Marcus is the first to reach the mom -- going up to her door. 
MARCUS 
Ma’am, I need you step -- 
But that’s all he gets out. Viktor’s mom puts a STUN GUN to  his hand. Shocks him with 50,000 volts. 
Marcus CONVULSES. CRASHES. Mike and Cam rush over. Viktor’s  mom BOMBS out of the car, SWINGING her purse in Mike’s face  over and over, kicking the crap out of him. 
MIKE 
Do something! 
CAM 
I have no field experience,  
remember.  
Mike catches the purse. Engages in a TUG OF WAR with the mom. 
56.
MIKE 
Jesus, she’s got a grip! 
Cam gets an idea. Rushes off. Viktor’s mom starts SPITTING  and CURSING at Mike. 
VIKTOR’S MOM 
I kill you! I kill you! 
Marcus staggers to his feet. Grabs the mom from behind. Tries  to yank her back when --  
-- TWO PROBES ATTACHED TO TASER WIRES tag her in the chest.  
Cam hits the trigger on Marcus’s TASER GUN. She gets SHOCKED  and FALLS BACKWARD onto Marcus -- the two HITTING THE GROUND,  Marcus breaking her fall.  
Mike and Cam stand over the pair. Marcus winces. 
MARCUS 
Next time...you get the door. 
CAM 
What do we do with her now? 
MIKE 
Call in a uniform. Get him to take  
her back home. 
OFF MARCUS -- the 75 year old mother SEIZING on top of him: EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - PARKING AREA - LATER 
A few feet beside Viktor’s Ford Flex, Mike and Cam get guns.  Ready for war. Mike sees Marcus doing the same. 
MIKE 
Whoa, hold up, what are you doing? 
MARCUS 
What’s it look like? 
MIKE 
It looks like you’re gearing up for  
police business and in case you  
forgot, you’re not the police  
anymore. 
MARCUS 
I wasn’t the police either when my  
ass was climbing that telephone  
poll. 
MIKE 
That was different. 
Why? 
MARCUS MIKE 
57.
Because I wasn’t gonna do that. 
MARCUS 
So you were just using me. 
MIKE 
Hey, you were the one who didn’t  
want to be a cop, remember? So  
stand back, citizen. 
CAM 
Hey, Mike, come on, three sets of  
guns are better than two. 
MIKE 
Depends who’s doing the shooting,  
and who asked you? 
MARCUS 
I told you: I’m here for Howard.  
Not for you. You’re not my boss, my  
partner or my friend anymore. I’m  
going in. 
Marcus cocks his gun and heads off. Mike can’t help but  respect his loyalty to Howard. Back to Cam: 
MIKE 
And you: better follow my lead. 
Mike heads off after Marcus. Cam follows.  
INT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER 
Abandoned for decades, the metal seats now come in two  colors: rust and graffiti. Mike, Marcus and Cam move quietly  inside. There’s no sign of Viktor. The stadium looks EMPTY.  But -- 
NEW ANGLE: VIKTOR AND HIS TWO GUNMEN 
hiding behind columns a few feet ahead, Glocks ready. When  Mike, Marcus and Cam approach -- they swing around, FIRING. 
Mike, Marcus and Cam take cover behind seats and concrete  pillars, SHOOTING BACK -- GUNFIRE DEAFENING. 
EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - PARKING AREA - SAME Two black Suburbans ROAR UP. Doors explode open.  BARDHA AND A TEAM OF SHOOTERS hop out. Rush the stadium. 
58.
RESUME MIKE, MARCUS AND CAM:  
still trading rounds with Viktor and his men when -- GUNSHOTS COME RAINING IN FROM BEHIND THEM!  
Mike, Marcus and Cam whip around. See Bardha and his shooters  advancing, FIRING.  
The trio return shots in both directions -- but they are OUT MANNED -- caught in a CROSSFIRE between Bardha and his team  and Viktor and his men. 
MIKE 
Fuck, they’re flanking us! Move  
back! 
Mike, Marcus and Cam make a DASH up the aisle, making their  way up to an UPPER LEVEL to escape the gunfire, taking cover  behind a PLASTIC TARP hanging down from the roof. 
But the GUNFIRE CONTINUES.  
Mike quickly re-loads his gun and throws the plastic aside to  see what’s going on below -- and he’s thrown! 
Bardha and his team aren’t pursuing them. They’re ADVANCING  on Viktor and his men. Mike seeing: 
Bardha and his men fire multiple rounds at Viktor and the two  gunman, riddling Gunman #1 -- then tagging Gunman #2. 
MIKE (CONT’D) 
(realizing) 
They’re not here for us. They’re  
here for them! 
Viktor fires back at Bardha and his team -- then TAKES OFF,  RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE.  
Mike gives chase -- following Bardha and his men, racing  after Viktor -- who reaches the end of an aisle and -- 
JUMPS OVER the side of the stadium -- dropping several feet  to the pavement below.  
Bardha and his team run up and FIRE DOWN on him, but Viktor ESCAPES, rushing UNDERNEATH the lowest level of the stadium. 
Mike comes up behind Bardha and his men. Fires. Hits one, but  he’s wearing KEVLAR.  
The others return shots. Mike ducks down behind seats,  bullets PINGING metal. 
59.
EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - SECONDS LATER 
Viktor emerges from underneath the stadium and JUMPS into the  Ford Flex. SLAMS the door. He’s about to turn the key when -- 
Bardha and his team run up. Surround the car. Viktor goes to  duck down. Too late.  
The SUV gets COMPLETELY DEMOLISHED WITH BULLETS that RIP  through the car and Viktor’s flesh, killing him.  
Bardha then turns to the Camaro. Fires a shot into a tire. 
Mike gets outside as Bardha and his team ROAR OFF in their  Suburbans. He goes to run into the Camaro to pursue. Stops  short when he sees the flat front tire. Shit. 
IN THE DISTANCE: police sirens WAIL and cruisers approach. INT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER 
Viktor’s men lie on the cement, dead. Marcus hovers over  their bodies, looking like he’s about to hurl.  
CAM 
Hey... you alright? 
Holding back barf -- but trying to play it off: 
MARCUS 
Yeah. You know. Just... acid  
reflux. 
He gags. Mike comes up. Immediately pats down one of the  bodies, pulling what he can from his pockets. 
CAM 
What are you doing? 
MIKE 
What you should be. Taking whatever  
evidence we can before the Feds do.  
These guys were our best shot at  
gettin’ to Luga. Whatever they  
could tell us, someone made sure we  
couldn’t find out. We need to  
figure out what.  
Marcus and Cam soon join in. Go through pockets. Jackets.  Marcus finds a phone, Cam a wallet.  
But then -- Cam sees something else: a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER  sticking out of the sock of Gunman #2. 
Cam pulls it out and unfolds the paper. Written on it: THREE  SETS OF STRANGE SYMBOLS MIXED WITH CYRILLIC LETTERS AND  RANDOM NUMBERS. A COMPLEX CODE. 
60.
Red and blue lights converge on the stadium and we GO TO: EXT. MIAMI MARINE STADIUM - NIGHT 
Mike, Marcus and Cam give statements to MIAMI PD. Agent  Kessler soon arrives, backed by THREE FBI AGENTS. 
AGENT KESSLER 
(livid) 
I hate to repeat myself, Lowery.  
Now, this is the second time I’ve  
had to warn you not to interfere  
with this investigation. 
MARCUS 
Some investigation. We’re the ones  
who found the hotel shooters.  
AGENT KESSLER 
What are you doing here anyway?  
You’re a Goddamn civilian. 
MARCUS 
(up in his face; pissed) 
“I’m a Goddamn civilian? I’m a  
Goddman civilian.” 
(beat; realizing; backing  
off) 
Yeah, that’s right, I’m a Goddamn 
civilian. 
AGENT KESSLER 
(to his agents) 
I want them searched.  
Mike, Marcus and Cam protest but the FBI agents with Kessler  don’t give a shit, patting them down, finding Marcus’s gun -- 
MARCUS 
I got a permit for that. 
-- and a gunman’s phone in Mike’s pocket. Kessler grabs it. 
AGENT KESSLER 
You got a permit for this? 
Another agent finds a wallet in Cam’s pocket. 
CAM 
Hey, that’s mine. 
The agent shows the ID to Kessler.  
AGENT KESSLER 
(reading the Albanian name  
on the card) 
Enver Biba? 
61.
CAM 
It’s my porno name. I also go by  
Hung Frankenstein. 
AGENT KESSLER 
Detain them. 
The Feds quickly slap on cuffs. 
MIKE 
What the fuck, Kessler!?! 
Mike, Marcus and Cam are pulled over to the FBI sedans. 
LUTTRELL (O.S.) 
Agent Kessler! 
Kessler turns. Sees Luttrell walking up.  
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) 
What are you doing to my  
detectives? 
AGENT KESSLER 
What the hell does it look like?  
LUTTRELL 
A Federal agent detaining Miami PD.  
You don’t want the headlines or the  
headache. Trust me. 
Kessler pauses. He definitely doesn’t. 
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) 
Put them in my custody. Let  
Internal Affairs handle them. 
AGENT KESSLER 
Like you’ve handled them so far? 
LUTTRELL 
They won’t be a problem anymore. 
Kessler considers Luttrell. A beat, then warns: 
AGENT KESSLER 
They interfere again, I’m gonna  
arrest them for willful impeding of  
a Federal Investigation. That  
clear? 
Crystal. 
LUTTRELL 
Kessler orders his men to let Mike, Marcus and Cam free. As  soon as the Feds walk away: 
62.
MARCUS 
Thanks, man. 
LUTTRELL 
Please. I love standing up to those  
Federal pricks. Mike, I know how  
bad you want Luga. I do too. But  
you’re bringing down too much heat. 
MIKE 
Just tell me what else Kessler  
knows about Luga. 
LUTTRELL 
(beat, then:) 
What I’ve managed to piece together  
is: the FBI has intercepted a lot  
of chatter on Albanian organized e mail communications. References to  
something called “Forager.” And  
according to their HUMINT sources,  
they believe someone inside the  
country has brought Luga here as  
talent to pull off some major drug  
operation. 
MARCUS 
We gotta get this guy fast, Mike. 
CAM 
Maybe this will help. 
Cam reaches down and takes off a shoe.  
MARCUS 
Your socks? 
Cam pulls the paper he took off the gunman out of his shoe.  
CAM 
Got this off one of Viktor’s boys.  
Stashed it in my shoe in case we  
had to give the other evidence up. 
Marcus is instantly impressed. Mike is too, but isn’t showing  it. Marcus picks up on this. 
MARCUS 
Okay, I’ll say it: “Fuck yeah.” 
Mike takes the paper. Doesn’t know what to make of it.  
LUTTRELL 
Mike, a word. 
Mike hands the paper back to Cam and walks off with Luttrell. 
63.
LUTTRELL (CONT’D) 
There’s something else. Didn’t want  
to say in front of the others. 
What’s up? 
MIKE 
LUTTRELL 
I’ve been looking into who had  
knowledge that you guys were hiding  
out at the hotel. Only a handful of  
people knew and all of them were  
cops. The leak definitely came from  
inside Miami PD, maybe even your  
unit. Somebody’s gone bad. I’m  
gonna find out who, but in the  
meantime, don’t trust anyone.  
Mike considers that, as we GO TO: 
EXT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - AN HOUR LATER 
ELLIE (V.O.) 
I asked you point blank if you were  
investigating Luga -- 
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - ELLIE’S OFFICE - SAME Ellie tears into Mike and Cam. 
ELLIE 
-- and you gave me your word that  
you were standing down.  
MIKE 
Did you really expect anything  
different? 
ELLIE 
Not from Mike Lowery, no.  
She leans forward. 
ELLIE (CONT’D) 
I know you don’t respect me. But  
you should at least respect that I  
have a job to do. 
MIKE 
And so do I. This asshole’s come  
here to kill me and because of  
that, Captain Howard’s fighting for  
his life. You wanna talk respect?  
(MORE) 
64.
MIKE (CONT'D) 
How ‘bout the respect you owe your  
cops instead of the Feds -- or the  
respect I owe Howard to go after  
Luga and bring his ass down for  
what he did? 
(rising from his seat) 
And I’d do the same if it was you  
in the hospital right now instead  
of him. 
Ellie looks at Mike. He’s telling the truth but despite her  loyalty to Howard, she can’t let him off the hook. 
ELLIE 
I would suspend you, but I don’t  
think that would help. So you -- 
(to Cam) 
-- get your toothbrush, your  
pajamas, whatever you need, cause  
from this moment on, you’re on Mike  
watch. Every move he makes you’re  
gonna tell me about it. And if he  
screws up, it’s on you too. 
(back to Mike) 
This is not gonna end with you dead  
or in jail. This is for your own  
good. Tell me you understand that. 
MIKE 
...I understand. 
ELLIE 
Good. Now get out. 
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS As soon as Ellie’s door is shut: 
MIKE 
I need to know right now: are you  
gonna be a problem?  
Cam locks eyes with Mike. 
CAM 
Howard is my Captain too. 
A beat. Mike nods. The two continue down the hall. INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. - TNT DIVISION - MOMENTS LATER 
Daltrey’s with Sanchez, trying to decipher the paper list of  numbers, letters and symbols. Getting close. 
SANCHEZ 
Penis-sized nipple or a nipple sized penis? 
(beat) 
Nipple. 
DALTREY 
65.
Mike hurries in with Cam, urgent: 
MIKE 
Where you at with those codes? 
DALTREY 
Still working on it. 
MIKE 
Alright, here’s how it goes: Cam,  
you pair up with Daltrey. I wanna  
know what those codes mean. I’m  
headin’ over to Miami General.  
Sanchez: how are your gang  
connections? Any owe you favors?  
SANCHEZ 
I got a guy who’s in ABK. Runs a  
bodega in Miami Gardens.  
MIKE 
Reach out to him. Have him slip it  
to two or three operators in the  
Albanian community that one of the  
hotel shooters survived the hit  
tonight and is listed as a John Doe  
at the hospital. When word travels  
up the chain that one of their  
targets is alive and talkin’ to the  
cops, the Albanians are gonna send  
someone to finish the job. I’ll  
have a heart to heart with him and  
find out where Luga’s hiding his  
ass. Call me when y’all have  
something. 
Mike steps back out into the hallway. Cam hurries after him. INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
CAM 
Dude, what the hell? You’re  
benching me? I thought we had an  
understanding. 
Mike stops. 
CAM (CONT’D) 
You need to trust me. 
MIKE 
I am. With that list. 
66.
CAM 
So while I’m picking up your scraps  
you can go off and do the real cop  
work?  
MIKE 
Look, right now Luga’s out there  
somewhere. I don’t know what he’s  
doin’, but I know it’s not good. If  
I can’t find out on my own, you’re  
gonna have to get something off  
that list. Either way, it’s not  
open for debate.  
Cam considers Mike. The assignment does have importance. 
MIKE (CONT’D) 
Now I gotta go get my decoy. 
INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - ROOM 726 - NIGHT 
Marcus strips out of his clothes to change into an  unflattering hospital gown -- and he’s NOT happy. 
MARCUS 
This is some next level  
embarrassment right here.  
MIKE 
You’re the one who said you wanted  
to be involved. 
MARCUS 
Well, thanks for tossin’ me a  
fuckin’ bone. Any dignity I had  
before today? Gone. 
MIKE 
Would you just get in bed and quit  
complaining? 
MARCUS 
Hey, as long as I’m the one whose  
ass is literally exposed here, I’m  
gonna complain as much as I want.  
He finally gets the gown on and hops into the bed. 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) 
You all good in here, Mike? 
Mike turns to the door to find an ATTRACTIVE NURSE. 
MIKE 
Yeah, Dena. Listen, I can’t thank  
you enough for hooking this up.  
(MORE) 
67.
MIKE (CONT'D) 
If there’s anything I can do to  
repay the favor... 
DENA 
Anything? Gonna keep you to that.  
She smiles seductively and slips out. 
MARCUS 
(yelling out the room) 
Gonna need a bed pan in here! 
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. HEADQUARTERS - TNT DIVISION - DAY 
Daltrey runs the list of codes through a scanner. Pulls the  image up on a wall monitor.  
MONTAGE:  
Over the next SEVERAL HOURS, Cam tries to break down the code  with a pen, re-arranging letters, words and symbols onto a  piece of paper as: 
Daltrey types an algorithm into a computer. Hits ENTER.  Immediately all the numbers, letters and symbols start to  move around and change order. Eventually --  
Daltrey’s algorithm cracks the first cipher.  
DALTREY 
Holy shit, I got it. 
Cam snaps up, alert. 
DALTREY (CONT’D) 
The code’s based off the Albanian  
alphabet. We just need to figure  
out which numbers correspond to  
which letters -- 
CAM 
And then add them to the letters  
that already exist. 
Exactly. 
DALTREY 
Daltrey types more commands into the computer, cross referencing letters in the code with the Albanian alphabet.  
CAM 
Hold up. What about the symbols? 
DALTREY 
The symbols are nothing. Garbage.  
Noise to keep us from seeing the  
real code. 
68.
Cam jots down a few ALBANIAN WORDS as they appear. Then types  into another computer. Translates the Albanian words in the  first coded entry into English. Comes up with: 
CAM 
Morrow Airpark. 
Daltrey does the same routine for the second code.  
DALTREY 
Next code’s an address. 27309  
Fleming Avenue. 
Daltrey enters the address into his computer.  
DALTREY (CONT’D) 
It’s a gas depot.  
CAM 
And the last code? 
Daltrey tries to crack it using the same method as the other  two, but can’t. 
DALTREY 
...I don’t know. This cipher’s  
different from the other two. It’s  
not based on the same alphabet.  
Gonna take some time to break. 
Cam checks his watch. Makes a call. 
CAM 
Okay. Let’s get started on the  
first two. 
MUSIC, MOMENTUM -- as we GO TO: 
EXT. MIAMI GARDENS - ALLEY - DAY 
Sanchez cuts through a back, graffiti-lined street. Draws her  phone while covertly making her way up to the back of a  neighborhood bodega. Sends a text. The back door cracks open  as she arrives. She slips inside. 
INT. BODEGA - BACK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Sanchez sits on a crate. Meets secretly with CARLOS, the  bodega’s owner. Young. Confident.  
CARLOS 
How many people we talkin’ about? 
SANCHEZ 
Two or three. But it can’t get back  
to us. Think you can handle it for  
me? 
69.
CARLOS 
Have I ever let you down before? 
SANCHEZ 
(rising) 
I owe you one, Carlos. 
CARLOS 
(shakes his head) 
I still owe you for helpin’ my  
sister out.  
SANCHEZ 
Make this happen and we’re even. 
OFF CARLOS, nodding, no problem -- MUSIC RESUMES -- LAUNCHING  A SERIES OF QUICK SCENES: 
EXT. MORROW AIRPARK - DAY 
An aircraft “boneyard” filled with retired military and  civilian planes, stripped for parts and gathering rust.  
Daltrey flashes his badge to the AIRPARK FOREMAN. INT. MORROW AIRPARK - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Daltrey speeds through SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE of the airpark. EXT. GAS DEPOT - INTERCUTTING 
A fuel depository for commercial use only. Cam roars up.  INT. MORROW AIRPARK - OFFICE - INTERCUTTING 
Daltrey stops when he sees TWO ALBANIANS pull up in a  familiar-looking Suburban and disappear inside a MILITARY  AIRCRAFT.  
Fast-forwards until the men re-emerge -- now carrying with  them: a HARRIS FALCON MILITARY RADIO. 
EXT. GAS DEPOT - INTERCUTTING 
Cam interviews the DEPOT MANAGER. 
DEPOT MANAGER 
Yeah, that’s right, about two hours  
ago. Two foreign guys purchased  
12,000 lbs of AV fuel.  
AV fuel? 
CAM 
DEPOT MANAGER 
Aviation fuel. 
70.
OFF CAM -- curious -- END SEQUENCE and CUT TO: INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY 
Mike gets a drink out of the vending machine when his phone  rings. It’s the TNT office. 
MIKE 
Yeah. What do you know? 
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. - TNT DIVISION - INTERCUTTING Cam, Daltrey and Sanchez around the speaker phone: 
CAM 
First code was an address for an  
aviation boneyard. Daltrey made two  
Albanians making off with a Harris  
Falcon radio. Foreman says it’s  
used to communicate with military  
aircraft only. 
Mike files that in his head. 
CAM (CONT’D) 
Second code directed us to a fuel  
depot where another set of  
Albanians purchased 12,000 lbs of  
aviation fuel. 
Mike makes another note. 
MIKE 
And the last one? 
CAM 
We don’t know yet. We’re still  
trying to crack it, but it’s a  
different cipher than the others. 
MIKE 
Alright, stay on it. 
INT. PLG SHIPPING COMPANY - MAGIC 
As Bardha wraps up a call on his cell. 
BARDHA 
You’re absolutely sure? 
(beat) 
Okay. Thanks for the call. 
Bardha hangs up. Climbs the stairs to: 
INT. PLG SHIPPING COMPANY - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER Bardha enters. Looks to Hess.  
71.
BARDHA 
We got a problem. 
EXT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Night has fallen. 
INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - SAME 
Marcus eats from a pudding cup in bed. Mike sits in a chair. 
MARCUS 
Man, I hate hospital food. 
Marcus tries to shoot the cup into the trash across the room.  
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
Two points. 
The pudding cup come doesn’t even come close.  
MIKE 
Wow, you really are a genuine slob. 
MARCUS 
It’s not being a slob if it isn’t  
your house. 
Mike shakes his head. A beat, then to break the silence: 
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
Just like old times though. You,  
me, a stakeout. 
Mike agrees, but says nothing. 
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
...You know, you should really give  
your new partner a break. I know  
you hate to admit it but he’s got  
skills. 
MIKE 
He’s a kid. 
MARCUS 
So were we once. 
Mike takes that in as Marcus admits: 
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
You guys make a good team.  
Marcus looks away. Jealous, perhaps? Switching the subject: 
MIKE 
Talk to your family lately? 
72.
MARCUS 
I checked in on them this  
afternoon. 
MIKE 
How they holdin’ up? 
MARCUS 
Good... under the circumstances.  
MIKE 
I missed them. 
MARCUS 
They missed you. 
MIKE 
Must be nice. Having someone to go  
home to. 
Marcus looks at him sideways. 
MARCUS 
Are you jealous, Mike? ‘Cause you  
can have ‘em. 
MIKE 
Just sayin’. It’s been on my mind  
lately is all.  
MARCUS 
Mike Lowery wants to settle down?  
Better get one of those crash  
carts. Think I’m gonna have myself  
a heart attack.  
Now it’s Mike’s turn to look away. A beat, then: 
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
Look, uhh, since we’re sharin’ n’  
shit... I know you don’t think so,  
but I do miss the action sometimes. 
MIKE 
You’re definitely getting your full  
of it this week. 
MARCUS 
Tell me about it. 
MIKE 
You didn’t have to quit. 
Marcus shrugs. What do you want from me? 
73.
MIKE (CONT’D) 
(sincerely) 
Why did you quit, Marcus?  
(no response) 
It wasn’t just Luga and the  
Albanians or the blood oath, was  
it?  
...no. 
Then why? 
MARCUS MIKE 
MARCUS 
You really wanna know? 
I asked. 
MIKE 
Marcus sits up in the bed. 
Respect.  
Mike’s thrown. 
MARCUS 
MARCUS (CONT’D) 
Every time we go into a situation,  
it’s all about what you want. I  
don’t get a say. And when you do it  
all head-on like you do, you’re  
puttin’ my life on the line. And  
after so long, it’s clear that you  
don’t care about me.  
MIKE 
And how do you think I felt? The  
person I counted on to save my life  
wasn’t there for me. “We ride  
together. We die together. Bad Boys  
for life.” That meant something to  
me.  
As Marcus absorbs that -- the two partners finally starting  to reconcile -- MUSIC BUILDS and we GO TO: 
EXT. MIAMI STREET - NIGHT 
A suburban speeds through downtown.  
INT. SUBURBAN - INTERCUTTING 
Bardha drives. An ALBANIAN GUNMAN loads a SIG-Sauer P220R.  
74.
INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - ICU WING - INTERCUTTING 
DING! An elevator opens. Mike steps out. Moves down the hall. EXT. MIAMI STREET - INTERCUTTING 
The suburban approaches the hospital. 
INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - ICU WING - INTERCUTTING 
Mike looks in on a patient through a window: HOWARD -- still  on life support. Mike regards him, quiet.  
EXT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - INTERCUTTING 
The Suburban pulls up. Parks. 
INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - ROOM 726 - NIGHT 
Marcus tries to get some sleep, tossing and turning. DING! INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR - SAME 
The elevator opens up. Bardha and the Gunman exit. The Gunman  continues on alone. Bardha holds back, keeping an eye out. 
INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - ROOM 726 - MOMENTS LATER 
Marcus sleeps. The room is dark. The Gunman comes in. Walks  up to the bed. Aims the Sig when --  
CLICK! Mike appears behind him, gun to the Gunman’s head. He  was in the closet. 
MIKE 
Wrong patient, asshole. Miami PD. 
Marcus turns on the light and sits up in bed, adding:  
MARCUS 
And Burnett Services Unlimited. 
MIKE 
Hands up and drop the gun. 
The Gunman raises his hands and drops the Sig.  
Mike goes to grab his wrist and -- LIGHTNING QUICK: the  Gunman SNATCHES Mike’s -- causing Mike to FIRE at Marcus,  bullet just exploding an IV bag beside him. 
The Gunman SLAMS Mike against the wall -- SHATTERING a TV.  INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - SAME 
Hearing the COMMOTION, Bardha BOOKS toward the room. 
75.
INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - ROOM 726 - SAME Mike and the Gunman go to BLOWS.  
Marcus makes a move for the fallen SIG. Bardha steps into the  room and aims at Marcus -- who quickly rolls off the bed.  
Mike and the Gunman continue to STRUGGLE. A DEATH MATCH.  Moving so furiously that Bardha can’t get a clear shot. 
On the floor, Marcus reaches up. Pulls a TELEPHONE down from  the bedside table. Rips out the cord. 
Bardha finally gets Mike in the cross-hairs. About to fire.  WHAM! Marcus BEAMS him with the telephone.  
Marcus LEAPS over the bed -- ass visible through the gown and  SLAMS himself into Bardha -- the two FALLING to the floor  outside the room -- back into the hall. 
Mike and the Gunman trade punches, knees and elbows. INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - SAME 
Marcus fights Bardha. Gets SLAMMED against a CRASH CART,  impact causing the EKG DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES to CHARGE. 
Marcus drops to the floor. Bardha gets on top. Starts choking  him. Marcus grabs the defibrillator paddles. Puts them to  Bardha’s chest and hits him with 250 volts.  
Bardha FLIES off Marcus, crashing onto his back, body  SIZZLING.  
Clear. 
RESUME MIKE:  
MARCUS 
trapped in a BEAR HUG. He SLAMS his head back into the  Gunman’s nose.  
He DROPS Mike -- who picks up his gun, spins and CRACKS it  over the Gunman’s head -- knocking him out. 
INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER Mike rushes out. Marcus gets to his feet. 
MIKE 
You alright? 
Yeah.  
MARCUS 
Mike looks up. Sees the NURSES at the front desk on the phone  with HOSPITAL SECURITY.  
76.
MIKE 
(re: Bardha) 
This asshole led the hit team at  
the stadium. We gotta get him out  
of here before the uniforms come.  
SMASH TO:  
MIKE -- taping Bardha up in medical tape -- head to toe like  a mummy while: 
EXT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT  
Marcus drives his Camaro to the service entrance.  INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - LAUNDRY CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER  
Mike drags a mummified Bardha to the laundry chute. His eyes  widen as he sees what’s gonna happen to him.  
MIKE 
Don’t worry. You can scream all you  
want.  
With that, Mike puts him inside --  
INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - LAUNDRY CHUTE - CONTINUOUS  
-- and Bardha goes SLIDING down the tube -- into a LAUNDRY  CART in the hospital basement.  
INT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER  
Mike steps into an elevator -- as another elevator opens up  and MIAMI COPS step out, just missing him.  
EXT. MIAMI GENERAL HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER  
Mike and Marcus carry the taped up Bardha over to Marcus’s  Camaro, toss him into the trunk and drive off. SMASH TO:  
A ROARING, HUNGRY LION!  
EXT. MIAMI ZOO - NIGHT 
At the entrance to the LION PIT, Mike unwraps several Big  Macs and stuffs them inside Bardha’s clothes. 
Gagged, Bardha’s eyes do all the screaming.  
MARCUS 
This is some sick ass shit right  
here.  
MIKE 
You didn’t say anything when I  
asked you to go to the drive-thru.  
77.
MARCUS 
I thought you were buying me  
dinner, not no lion! Like “good job  
for not killing your suspect. Love,  
Mike.” I was touched. 
MIKE 
Don’t worry. This is gonna be much  
more satisfying. 
Mike rips off the tape on Bardha’s mouth. He SCREAMS: 
BARDHA 
You better let me the fuck go! 
MIKE 
Where’s Luga? 
BARDHA 
Fuck you! You won’t do shit to me.  
MARCUS 
He taped your ass up and kidnapped  
you from a hospital. All he does is  
do shit to people! 
MIKE 
One last time. 
BARDHA 
(still defiant) 
I’m not telling you shit. 
MIKE 
Your choice. 
Mike shoves the last Big Mac into Bardha’s pants. Bardha  SCREAMS -- AHHHHH! -- as Mike picks him up.  
MIKE (CONT’D) 
Get his legs! 
(Marcus hesitates) 
Get his legs, Marcus! 
Marcus helps Mike hoist their prisoner up -- 
MARCUS 
Don’t ever say I don’t do shit for  
you again! 
-- and over the pit. A nearby lion ROARS! 
MIKE 
Where’s Luga? 
BARDHA 
Pull me up! AHHH! 
78.
Smelling the Big Macs, the lion comes up. LEAPS. Mike and  Marcus yank Bardha up just before the paw can tear him. 
MARCUS 
Oh shit -- did you see that!?! 
MIKE 
(lowering Bardha back  
down) 
WHERE’S LUGA!?!? 
Bardha is TERRIFIED now. 
BARDHA 
I DON’T KNOW! GET ME OUT, GET ME  
OUT, PLEASE! 
MIKE 
Oh, now you want something from me,  
huh? I’m suddenly your best friend.  
Another SCREAM as Mike and Marcus lower him back into the  pit, the lion returning -- Mike yelling over Bardha: 
MIKE (CONT'D) 
WHAT’S HE HERE TO DO!?! MARCUS 
BARDHA 
OH MY GOD!!! 
You better tell the man! That  
lion’s “da-da-da-da-dah -- lovin’ 
it!”  
The lion makes its way over to Bardha -- salivating. 
MIKE 
Your people have been picking up  
equipment all over Miami. Fuel, a  
military radio -- what’s it for!?! 
BARDHA 
I SWEAR I DON’T KNOW! HE DOESN’T  
TELL US! 
Who? 
MIKE 
The lion ROARS. Bardha FREAKS OUT! 
WHO!?! 
The lion CHARGES. 
MIKE (CONT’D) BARDHA 
ALBERT HESS! 
79.
The lion LUNGES -- but Mike and Marcus jerk Bardha out of the  pit and share a look. Alright, they got a name.  
Bardha tries to catch his breath, but he’s SHAKING. 
Mike takes out his phone. Pulls up a picture of the CODED  LIST. Focuses on the final code -- the one that Cam and  Daltrey couldn’t break. 
MIKE 
You’re gonna tell me how to break  
this code. 
OFF BARDHA -- caving: 
INT. PLG SHIPPING COMPANY - NIGHT 
The basement door opens to reveal Aleksander Luga, fired up  and ready to go. 
A team of ALBANIANS hop inside TWO TRUCKS, armed to the  teeth, Luga about to join when Hess grabs his arm, warning:  
HESS 
Remember: you better not fuck this  
up.  
He meant to be intimidating, but Luga isn’t rattled. Never  is. Into his eyes -- showing Hess what intimidating is:  
LUGA 
That’s the last time you put your  
hand on me.  
Hess backs off. Smart move. Luga slams the door. Trucks roll  out -- MUSIC SPIKING as we GO TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
The Camaro ROCKETS up gravel. 
INT. CAMARO - SAME 
This time, Mike drives. Marcus white-knuckles the dashboard.  Into a speaker phone: 
MIKE 
The final code is actually two 
different number sequences. 
INT. MIAMI-DADE P.D. - TNT DIVISION - INTERCUTTING  Camera CIRCLES Daltrey and Sanchez around the speaker phone:

They say, if you wanna
tell a story right,


you gotta start
at the beginning.


Too far? Fine.


This is me, Harleen Quinzel.


When I was a kid, my dad
traded me for a six-pack of beer.


But however many times
he tried to ditch me...


Daddy!
-...I kept coming back.


Eventually,
he found me a new home.


The good sisters of St.
Bernadette's taught me a lot.


But I was never
an establishment kinda gal.


All things considered, I did good.
I even went to college.






Got my PhD.
Had my heart broken once or twice.


Finding love, it's not easy.


So I threw myself into my work,
became a psychiatrist.


That's when I met him.
Mr. J. My Joker.


Oh, I fell hard. Like out
of a plane without a parachute,


right in your dumb
fucking face kinda hard.


I lost all sense of who I was.


I only had eyes for Puddin'.
We all know the saying,


"Behind every successful man
"there's a badass broad."


Well, that was me.
I was the brains behind some of


Mr. J's greatest stunts.
Not that he let anyone know it.


Puddin'?


I guess all good things
have to come to an end.


So...






...we broke up.


I handled it real mature.


But Mr. J was
super broke up about it.


I got an amazing new place
that was all mine.


It gave me the space
to really reflect


on the mistakes of my past.


I had to find a new identity.


A new me.


It wasn't easy. But after a while,
I even opened myself up


to the possibility
of new love.


Hi. Hello, nice baby.


Here's the thing about new love...
- I take payment-in-kind.


...you have to feed it.


Soon enough,
I was back on my feet.


Ready to move on,
to make new friends.


She means fucking business!


- Oh, here we go!
- Whip me!


She has taken a whip from the
pivot, catapulted to the high side!


Oh!


Yeah! Come on!


It was time for Gotham
to meet the new Harley Quinn,


so I really
put myself out there.


Ride that pole
like you ride your man!


God damn it.
Sit the fuck down.


- What?
- I said...


Sit your skinny ass down,
you dumb slut.


Okay.


You broke my fucking legs!


Oh, boo-hoo.


What?


It's not a party without
a little drama, am I right?


Come on! Turn it up!


Shots on the house.


Call me dumb.
I have a PhD, motherfucker.


-Miss Quinn.
-Romy.


- That was my driver.
- Oh, whoops.


Well, I'm sure it was his fault.
Consider him fired.


Consider me grateful. Especially
since I know you don't like me.


I agitate his already delicate
sense of mental equilibrium.


That and his obsessive-compulsive
need to be the center of attention.


Will your paramour
be joining us this evening?


Not tonight, Romy.
Not tonight.


Well, enjoy yourself, Miss Quinn.
And do give the Joker my best.


Okay, fine, so I hadn't
told people about the breakup.


- But you don't understand.
- Find me a new driver.


Being Joker's girl
gave me immunity.


I could do whatever I wanted
to whoever I wanted,


and no one
ever dared to object.


And don't let him give you shit, okay?
You have to stick up for yourself.


Oh, please. I give it a few days
before they're back together.


Even when I did try and tell
people, they didn't believe me.


Come on. She told me they're
really broken up this time.


Sure they are, Shell. That's why she's
still wearing that tacky "J" necklace.


She is going to be running right back into
his arms the minute he snaps his fingers.


If not him, the next closest
alpha male with a pulse.


Some people just aren't
born to stand on their own.


- Oh, girl, let's drink. Come on.
- All right.


I knew I needed to find
some way to show the world


that I'd cut ties with Mr. J
for good.


Harley!


Some people have the
Eiffel Tower, or Olive Garden.


The Joker and I?
Our love bloomed in a highly toxic


industrial processing plant.


And luckily for me,
I have all my best ideas drunk.


I have the best idea!


The fuck?
Hey! Hey! Come back here!


This is
where it all began, Puddin'.


You motherfucker!


It was the closure I needed.


A fresh start.
A chance to be my own woman.


But I wasn't the only dame
in Gotham looking for emancipation.


This is our story.


And I'm telling it,
so I'll start where I fucking want.


- Meet the cop.
- I got 50 says it was turf war.


- Not him.
- Well, as always, you're wrong, Munroe.


Her. Renee Montoya.


Raised on '80s cop shows,
she's always saying cheesy shit like...


There was only one shooter.
Inside.


This guy shot out the glass.
Serrano.


Yo. Hey.


Have Ballistics check for a bullet
in one of those parked cars.


Ten years ago, she broke
a career-making case.


-Did I stutter?
-Go ahead.


But her partner at the time
took all the credit.


So while he made captain, she got stuck
at detective level with this idiot.


- Okay, you think one guy got all four?
- Wait, wait, wait.


I'm just saying, we got four
dead bodies here, you know.


-One guy... Bullet holes.
-I'm trying to work.


I'm sorry.
Go ahead and work. Go ahead.


The shooter got close
before drawing. Six rounds.


- Two for each of these three.
- Yo, mind your debt.


I'm telling you.
That girl, Angelina, she's a princess.


- Look at this. Is it Halloween?
- Hey. How you doing?


And it wasn't about them.


It was all about this guy,
right here.


Do you know who I am?


You fucking bitch.


And this arrow through his throat...


She wanted him to die slowly.


- She?
- We got a hair.


- And he's got a new assassin.
- Who does?


Roman Beauvais Sionis.


Jesus Christ.


This is Montoya.
What the hell was that?


Shit.


Wow.


Detective.
Found this necklace.


Holy shit.


Good work, Officer.


What is it?


- Harley Quinn and the Joker broke up.
- What?


This was their spot. She just publicly
updated her relationship status.


Harley Quinn just called
open season on herself.


She did not
think this one through.


Yeah, no shit
I didn't think it through.


I'm about to learn that a lot of
people in this city want me dead.


And at the top of that list
is this guy.


Mr. Keo and his lovely
wife and daughter.


You kinda forced my hand here.
Gotta say, I'm a little disappointed.


I gave you a great pitch.
Didn't I?


And I thought... Shh!


I thought we could build
something beautiful together.


I thought we could be family.


I'm gonna set you free.


Mmm...


What about her?


I think we can let her go.


I mean, this is a pretty loud
fucking shitshow of a message.


Baby. Aww.


Don't cry.


Thank you.
Thank you.


You're welcome.


Is that a snot bubble?


-Ew. Gross.
-What?


Oh, I've changed my mind.
Peel it off.


No. No!


The wack job with the penchant
for peeling faces is Roman Sionis,


aka Black Mask.


The fact that he wants me dead
hasn't yet hit my radar.


See, I was halfway across town,


hungover,
and thinking about breakfast.


Egg, bacon, American cheese.


Soft, toasted buttered roll.


Just a dash of hot sauce.


Not too much, Sal.
I wanna taste the cheese.


What a way to
start my new life.


With the perfect egg sandwich.


Mmm!


You're a lifesaver, Sal.


And I'm good for the 75 cents,
okay? I promise.


That's all the money I got
in the world, and it's so worth it.


I don't know if it's
the stray Armenian arm hair,


or the fact that his cheese slices
are always six months out of date,


but no one makes
an egg sandwich like Sal.


I mean it, Sal. No one.


Freeze! Gotham PD.


Yeah, I don't think so.


Are you fucking kidding me?


Yo! Police.


It had been six short hours
since my little stunt at Ace Chemicals


announced to the world
that Mr. J and I were dunzo.


The immunity I'd enjoyed
for so long was gone.


Cops who never would've dared
come after me before


were suddenly doing this.


- Ooh!
- Freeze!


And what's worse? Every person
I ever wronged now felt free


to come and
take their pound of flesh.


Turns out
I wronged a lot of people.


Come on, boy. Get him!


Oh...


Finally.


And then...
- We're gonna get through this, okay?


...tragedy struck.


It took losing
something I truly love


for me to see that
the target on my back


was bigger than I thought.


Freeze!


With the walls
closing in around me,


I made a carefully calculated,
highly strategic move.


Fine. It was dumb luck.
But still...


That felt pretty great.


Sorry for busting in on you like that,
but thanks for the shortcut.


- See ya. Oh!
- There she is.


- Harley Quinn.
- Yeah?


- I've waited a long time for this.
- You have?


Oh... I haven't had breakfast yet.


- What did I do to you?
- Are you serious?


Look at my face.


Look at my face!


Oh...


- That wasn't me.
- But you dared him to do it.


Yeah, but I dare a lot of people
to do a lot of things, okay?


Come on. I'm not even
with him anymore. - I know.


That means there's
no one here to stop me.


-Right.
-You're gonna die, Quinn.


Ooh. A penny.


They're shooting arrows now?


Ah, crap. Him, too?


Parley?


Fuck, Montoya, you smell
like a dead rat's asshole.


- Not today, Simpson.
- Hey, it's Detective Montoya.


Respect your elders.
I mean, your elderly.


You're only a few years younger than me,
and you're still behind that desk.


You wanna go there?


Come on. Empty your pockets.
All of it.


Cassandra Cain,
back already?


Thought by now you'd figure
out how not to get caught.


What? No comeback?


You all right?


You smell like shit.


Yo, Simpson.


Any clean clothes
in lost and found?


These are serious accusations,
Miss Montoya.


The Sionis family name is on half
the museums and schools in Gotham.


And that makes him
immune to the law, Captain?


Montoya's day is going
almost as badly as mine.


Remember the guy
who stole her promotion?


That's him. He had four people
killed alone last night.


If Sionis is such a mastermind, how'd he
get fired from his own fucking company?


The Janus Corporation
is his father's company, thank you.


And by the way,
they cut him off.


Where does the DA's office
stand on all this?


To make matters worse, the assistant DA?
That's her ex.


The evidence that Sionis is
linked to these murders...


There's a shipment coming in.


- Drugs?
- A diamond.


Wow, Montoya. Should we call
the Feds for backup?


Listen,
I had a source at the club.


His driver. He said that Roman
couldn't stop talking about this thing.


And he said that he overheard
something about laser-encoding.


Now, I did some research.
I think it's the Bertinelli diamond.


You remember the Bertinelli
massacre, right?


Quick history lesson. Fifteen years
ago, one of the wealthiest


Mafia families in Gotham
was gunned down.


It was a power grab,
but the real target


was the Bertinellis' super-secret
offshore bank accounts,


the details of which were said
to be encoded in the atomic structure


of a 30-carat diamond.
The rock was lost.


And with it, the only key
to the Bertinelli fortune.


Which is exactly why Roman Sionis
is trying to get his hands on it.


That's what makes him so dangerous.
He's already building an army.


If he gets the diamond, he'll
have all the money and connections


to bribe every single judge and cop
he needs to get a monopoly on the city.


You said you had someone on the inside?
- Yes. He's...


- He's no longer there, but...
- So basically, you have nothing.


You are trying to go after


one of the most litigious and
wealthiest families in Gotham,


and all you've got is
rumors and a hunch?


Well, you know, the DA's office
is building a case against him, too.


- Isn't that right, Miss Yee?
- If the DA is willing to throw himself


out in front of this, it's fine with me.
- Captain, no.


Listen, Munroe, find me some tangible
connection to Sionis, all right?


-Yes, sir.
-Wait, wait, wait. Captain.


This is my case, okay? I've been
working on this for six months.


We need something that we
can actually use, Detective.


And, Miss Montoya,
we do have a dress code.


Look, I'm sorry about
that, but I...


That is my job you are fucking with.
What is wrong with you, Renee?


- Me? He gave my case away.
- Oh, poor Renee.


Why don't you pour yourself
a drink? It's almost noon.


Wow.


Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?


Why the fuck haven't you been picking
up your phone? We've got a situation.


- What... What situation?
- You didn't hear this from me,


but you gotta find her
before someone else does.


She's got the diamond, and
trust me, Roman will kill her.


- My diamond? Who? Who's got it?
- This kid.


She's a pickpocket.
Her name's Cassandra Cain.


Holy fuck.


- Can I help you?
- Why, yes. Yes, you can.


I'm here to
report a terrible crime.


And what terrible crime is that?


This one.


Hi, boys.


Meeting's over.


Run, piggy, run.


Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?


Hold up, hold up. I'm telling
this all wrong. Let's rewind.


For you to understand why me,
the cop, and that dame on the toilet...


Her name's Cassandra Cain.


...are all looking for
this Cain character.


I gotta take you back
a few days,


to that night I got shitfaced
at the Black Mask Club.


This is a man's world


This is a man's world...


- This is Dinah Lance.
- But it would be nothing


- But she prefers Black Canary.
- Nothing...


- She's got a killer voice.
- Without a woman or a girl...


But there was some other shit
going down that night.


...short notice like this.


I'm not talking
superficial partnerships.


I'm talking you and me
having each other's backs.


The Golden Lions can't just
wander into Gotham National Bank.


I can.
Loans, liquidity, laundering.


Look, if you bring your boys
into the fold,


there are no limits to what
we could achieve together.


I'm building something special.


I appreciate your offer,
Mr. Sionis.


But with all due respect,


the Golden Lions
are a family business.


Fuck family. All due respect,
but fuck that.


Family's a fucking illusion. You know
what my family gave me? Nothing.


I know what everyone says.
"Here comes Roman Sionis.


"He was handed life
on a silver spoon."


"Gin and tonics at 5:00."
"I'll have the duck."


Blah, blah, blah.
Fake fucking fucks.


But look at me now.


I've located the Bertinelli diamond.
I'm about to own this city.


Not just the East End.
I am thinking big, baby.


And I want you there with me.
We could make our own family.


Mr. Sionis,
the Golden Lions have operated


in Gotham
for nearly 100 years.


We have no need
of your protection.


He's gonna regret that.


Will you sleep on it?
Will you do that for me?


Run it by
that beautiful wife of yours,


and I'll come see you at
the docks, day after tomorrow.


Okay?


This is a man's world


It would be nothing


Without a woman or a girl...


Who's having a good time?
You are.


- Lost in the wilderness...
- Food is good?


- Do you need any more cocktails?
- Lost in the bitterness...


- Your good health.
- He's lost in the loneliness...


He's lost


This is a man's world


It wouldn't be nothing


Without a woman or a girl


Canary's been singing
at Roman's club for years.


- Come on!
- He calls her his little bird,


and he's got her wrapped
right around his fancy little finger.


- Here you go, Canary.
- Thank you.


How do you spell "mercenary"?


Merceninny...


Merceran?


Singer lady woman!


You're really, really good.


Yeah.


Know what a harlequin is?


Janky-ass clown
with bad eye makeup?


Oof!


Ouch!


A harlequin's role


is to serve.


An audience.


A master.


You know, a harlequin's
nothing without a master.


And no one gives two fucks
who we are beyond that.


Yeah, I don't know who you think
I am, lady, but I'm not her.


Puddin' and I broke up.


I haven't told that to anyone.


Yeah.


For good this time.


And for the first time
in a long time,


I'm all on my lonesome.


It's great.


Welcome to the club.


Thanks.


Hey, don't be lonesome.
How about another drink?


-Yes!
-Yeah?


-Yeah.
-It's on me.


-Sure. Drinks!
-Hey, two shots.


Hey.


We're all good here.


-I don't wanna go home.
-Oh, no? No.


No.


Let me know
if you're gonna get sick.


Your chariot's arrived.
Oh, there you go.


- Are we getting breakfast?
- Hey, buddy, I'm gonna need some help.


This is my friend.
I told you all about...


- Hey, get the door, man. There we go.
- Wait.


- Isn't that Joker's girl?
- Not anymore.


- Got room for one more?
- Hey.


Huh?


I don't need your help.
I got this.


You got this?
You sure about that?


Yeah, no wonder
everyone hates you.


Uh...


You got this!


You motherfucker!


Whoo!


Well, well, well,
well, well, well.


Could that be
our little Miss Lance?


All these years,
I thought she was just a pretty face


and a fine set of lungs.


Ooh.


Mr. Zsasz,
I've had an amazing idea.


That's my little bird.


Don't touch
what you can't afford, mister.


Shut up.


Oh, songbird.


You drive
as good as you fight?


- Who's asking?
- The boss.


You're getting promoted.


- You're his new driver.
- Huh. Thanks,


but I think I'm good
with the singing gig.


You'll be good
at the driving gig.


Be here tomorrow.
9:00 a.m. Sharp.


So, that's how Canary
got herself a job


driving around
Gotham's newest Godfather.


A position, I might add,
that wouldn't have been vacant


without the help of yours truly.


Morning.


- You're the one who wanted the kid!
- I never wanted her!


Let me guess. Parents?


- Foster parents.
- Right.


Sorry, kid.


Sorry about your face.


Shit, you do have something
on your face.


You should've seen
the other guy.


Uh...


I want that kid out
of my fucking house!


You know, kid, not every day
is gonna be like this.


You just gotta hang in there.


Get something to eat.


Stay outta that.
It's not worth it.


Don't talk to me like that.


Canary spends the next week


settling in to her new job
as Roman's personal driver.


Ew. Okay.


What she didn't know is that
driving Mr. Face-peely-pants


was gonna put her
right in the crosshairs


of my favorite little piggy.


- Dinah Lance?
- Who the hell are you?


I'm Renee Montoya,
detective with GCPD.


Your predecessor
and I had an arrangement.


Oh, really?


He told me that there was a
shipment coming in. A diamond.


A very special diamond.


Yeah, not interested, lady.
Thanks for the coffee.


Do you know
who you're working for?


Damn right, I do. He's the man who
gave me a job. Took me off the streets.


Yeah, well, he's also
a very dangerous man.


A criminal. A murderer.


What would your mother think of you
working for a guy like that, huh?


You have the same power she had. Don't
you think she would want you to use it?


The hell do you know
about my mother?


Back in the day,
she used to help the GCPD.


-She was a good woman.
-Yeah.


She was a damn good woman.


The kind of woman who put
everyone else's lives before her own.


And when she was found
dead in the street,


where the fuck were you
and your boys in blue then?


Now you wanna come and knock on
my door and ask me to help you out


and make
the same mistake she did?


Yeah. Good luck with that.


That's fair enough.
And I'm sorry for your loss.


For the record,


that would never happen
on my watch.


The Sprang Bridge
Soldiers capituated.


"Capitulated."
Of course they did.


I told you that Keo scene
would send a message.


It sure did, boss.
It sure fucking did.


Crossbow Killer


struck again last night.
Rossi and four of his guys.


People don't kill people I own
without my permission.


Why doesn't this crossbow guy
know that?


-You know that!
-I know it.


Why doesn't this crossbow guy?
Why don't I own the crossbow guy?


-You should own him.
-I mean, I like crossbows.


Oh, good morning.
Good morning.


-Morning.
-Come in. Come in.


We're just finishing up a
little business. Look around.


- You're late.
- It's fine.


Should she come back another
time, 'cause she's late?


No. Isn't this stunning?


That is a Chokwe mask.


I got it when I was embedded
with the Mbangani tribe


in Congo-Kinshasa.
Have you ever been?


I've never been.
I've heard it's beautiful.


It's dirty. Here, look at this.
Genuine tsantsa or shrunken head.


Shuar of Ecuador. They're
amazing people. Surprisingly gentle.


-I think you might like them.
-Really?


They boil the heads of their enemies
and they make these little fellas.


-Exquisite, aren't they? Look.
-Mmm-hmm.


Look at those little ears.
And his little haircut.


-Yeah, he's 1,000 years old.
-Wow.


And now he's just an ornament
in my living room.


-Ew! I love it.
-Yeah?


These are
ancient acupuncture models.


As you can see, they have
all the acupuncture points.


And we found these
buried in the mountains.


Ace Chemicals
got blown sky high last night.


All right, all right, let's find
the Crossbow Killer. I get it.


- Is he an acupuncture model, too?
- He is not an acupuncture model.


This is a statue of me. It was made
by a very famous Gotham artist...


Harley Quinn did it.


Some kind of "fuck you"
to the Joker.


They split.


What's wrong with you, Victor?


-Talk about burying the lede.
-Yeah.


This is spectacular news!


She doesn't belong to him,
she belongs to me.


Have the boys go find her. Round her up,
bring her back. I want her.


You, I have something
I want you to pick me up.


Something super-duper
important, okay?


I'll go with you.
- Yeah, go with Victor.


- It's just a pickup.
- No, he's harmless.


Do as you're told. Go.


- All right. We can go.
- I'll take that.


- Mr. S said for me to hold on to it.
- Go get your car.


That rock. That rock's
about to become the key


to whether or not I live to
enjoy my newfound independence.


- Get off me.
- What the hell are you doing here?


You're not the only one who makes
money off of dumb, rich, white people.


Well, you know what? One day you're
gonna pick the wrong pocket, sis.


Okay. Whatever.


Dumb-ass kids.


Excuse me. Sorry.


- I really like your earrings.
- Why, thank you.


There's the thief.
There's the thief.


- Get off of me!
- That little girl took my watch.


I didn't do nothing.


Where the fuck's the diamond?
I just fucking had it.


Cass!


Wait!


Wait, wait!


Halt!


Fuck!


In the storytelling business,
this dummy swallowing that diamond


is called a complication.


A complication I didn't
exactly need right now.


Parley?


- We lost the diamond.
- What?


We're really sorry, Mr. S.
This kid...


We never even
got our hands on it.


Ow!


Help!


Get out! Get out of here!
You, too! Go!


With your fucking sage
stinking my place up. Fuck off!


- Here she is.
- She's a child!


- She's just a kid.
- She's... What?


We have Harley Quinn
downstairs, as requested.


Fuck off! Get out.
Fucking out!


Fuck! These are my things.
This diamond is my things.


My things! Fucking fuck!
I don't ask for much, do I?


-No.
-Why is this happening to me?


Why?


I'm gonna get your diamond back.
I promise.


Why don't we go downstairs
and kill that Harley bitch?


Blow off a little steam.


Yeah, I have wanted to do that
for quite some time.


Okay. I'll go get changed.


Shit, Cass.


I don't care what it
takes, I want my diamond back.


We're working on it.


Now, let's go have a little fun.


Harleen Quinzel.


Whoo!


Hiya, Romy.


Do you know why you're here?
Hmm?


When it comes to
me and Roman Sionis,


there are a lot of possible
answers to this question.


Breaking his driver's legs. There's
that time I called it an "expresso."


Having a vagina in the first
place pisses this guy off.


Constantly interrupting him,
like I'm doing right now.


-You're here because...
-Oh, God, stop.


You're gonna do that thing where you open
up a weird-ass case of torture devices


while inexplicably detailing your
master plan and how I don't fit into it.


- I'm building a better...
- Seriously, you don't have to. Really!


You're building a criminal empire because
Daddy kicked you out of Janus Corp.


And you think this is a big
"fuck you," but in actuality


it's a very misguided attempt
to win back his respect.


I get it. You're really not
as complicated as you think.


And you're really not as
clever as you think, because


-now I'm gonna slice your...
-Oh, Jesus Christmas.


Now you're gonna say that you
wanna kill me to set an example.


- Christ, you're boring.
-I wanna kill you...


- Shit.
- ...because without the Joker around,


I can.


For all your noise and bluster,
you're just a silly little girl


with no one around
to protect her.


Whoa. Wait.
-What?


-Don't kill me.
-Ha! Right.


No, no, no. Seriously. Romy, Roman.
Come on. There's gotta be something,


something we can figure out.
Hey!


Wait, wait!
You lost something, right?


You lost something.
I heard you say it. A diamond.


Yeah.


I can help you find it.


Seriously. Look in my pocket.


Other pocket.


I'm starting up
my own business.


See what it says?
Second from the bottom.


I know the East End
better than anybody.


You want this diamond back?
I'm your gal.


Mr. J once lost a rare photograph
of a nude Eleanor Roosevelt,


and I found it in a bird's
nest in Robinson Park.


If you let me go,


just for now,
I'll get you that rock back.


What have you got to lose?
If your boys find it first,


swear to God,
you can kill me later.


Pinky swear.
Cross my heart, hope to fart.


You're so tiresome!


If you want my mercy, shut that hole
in the middle of your face and listen.


You're gonna
get me my diamond.


A kiss on the hand
May be quite continental


But diamonds are
a girl's best friend


A kiss may be grand


But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat


Or help you at the automat


Diamonds


I will be waiting.


Diamonds


Diamonds


The diamond.


Diamonds


Romy, Roman.


I will be waiting.


But diamonds


Diamonds are a girl's best


I'll give you till midnight.


And then I'm gonna peel off
that pretty face


and pickle it.


Okay?


Call me old-fashioned,
but I always thought the guy


was meant to
get the girl a diamond.


I won't let you down, Romy.
I promise.


Let's make it half a mil.


It's more fun
if she's got competition.


Send it to
every mercenary in Gotham.


Oh, hey, you're that singer
no one listens to.


Hey, you're the asshole
no one likes.


Jesus. Who the fuck is this?
What?


We've got a situation.
This kid, she's got the diamond.


Her name's Cassandra Cain.


Holy fuck.


Where can I find
Cassandra Cain?


Okay. Now we're good.


Cell seven.


Thanks, doll. You're a peach.


Hey, I know that guy.


Access denied. Access denied.


Access denied. Access denied.


Access denied.
Access denied. Denied.


Denied. Denied. Denied.
Denied. Denied. Denied.


Hmm. Perfect.


- Hold up, hold up. Remember me?
- She stole my car!


- Harley Quinn.
- Hey, Quinn!


-Let us out, see what happens.
-Don't mind me, guys.


-You killed my chinchilla!
-Here for the kid.


What's up, girl?
You're the reason I'm in here!


- Yeah, sorry about that.
- You're dead!


- I'm gonna kill you, Quinn!
- Hey, kid.


You're that psycho from the
roller derby. -Yeah, yeah.


- Are you Cassandra Cain?
- Yeah.


I need to know where...


- Hold, please.
- Harley...


Hmm.


I got you, you little shit.


Who are you guys?


Go, go, go.


Keep the kid alive.


Mmm!


A little help.


Mmm...


Does she have to keep running?


Roman,
you trustafarian fuckbag.


- You!
- You!


Step away from the kid.


- Drop it.
- The phone?


Sure.


Mmm.


Whoa.


Oh, good. You're awake.
Toss that for me, will ya?


What the fuck?


Who did I just blow up?


Either someone
who wants me dead,


or someone looking to collect the
half-million dollar reward on your head.


- Half a million dollars?
- Yeah.


Do I look like I'm
worth half a million dollars?


-Not really.
-You've got the wrong kid.


- Now, uncuff me.
- Oh, sure.


- As soon as you give me the diamond.
- What diamond?


Fuck you!


Look at me.


What? I don't know
nothing about no diamond.


The inflection in your voice,
the way you can't hold eye contact,


and the fact that
you're a filthy little thief,


all suggest that you do. Now, you
can give it to me, or I can give you


to the man that diamond belongs to. But
trust me when I say, you're not gonna like


what he's gonna do to ya.


Now, hand it over.


Yeah, not gonna happen.


-Come again?
-I said I can't.


- One more time.
- I can't give it to you.


- Why not?
- Because I ate it, okay?


Yes.


What are we even doing here?


There are two ways that
diamond's coming outta ya.


This way,


or this way.


That's what I thought.
Also, I'm outta groceries.


So, how long you been
a mercenary?


Hey, where did you get...


You're so busy
looking at my right hand,


you haven't even
thought about my left...


Your left hand is
cuffed to mine.


I'll have to learn that one.


Can we get this?


You're not gonna try
to run, are you?


Look, if there's really
a half mil on my head,


I figure I'm better off with the person
who's not gonna cut me open.


Fine. But if you try to run,
I will kill you.


I do not care
that you're a kid.


I saw that.


Seriously though,
how'd you get to be here?


I mean,
shopping at fancy-ass stores,


you're making bank,
you have your own business.


How'd you do it? Come on, tell me.
Woman to woman.


Being a pickpocket's fine and
all, but I got real potential.


I mean, how do I be like you?


Well, except for the crazy
part. But other than that.


Number one, no one is like me.


If you wanted to even come close,
you would have to go to medical school.


Become a psychiatrist, work in an
asylum. Fall in love with your patient,


break said patient out of said asylum.
Begin a life of crime.


Jump into a vat of chemicals
to prove yourself to a madman.


Get arrested by the Batman.


Go back to jail, get out of
jail with a bomb on your neck.


Save the world, go back to
jail, and break out of jail


before breaking up
with the aforementioned madman


and going out on your own.


Number two...
Six bucks for tap water


with a fucking cucumber stick in it?
That's crazy.


I'm not shopping
at this store.


I'm robbing this store.
Consider this your first lesson.


Paying is for dummies.


Whoa, whoa, whoa!


Move it!


Whoops. Ah...


This is Doc's Place.
And this is Doc.


Lotus flower!


-Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
-Good.


He's the Taiwanese grandpa
I never had.


He knows everything and everyone. Nothing
happens around here, let me tell you,


without Doc knowing about it.
And he happens to be the only person


who actually cares about me.


-I do?
-Yes, you do.


She's been ordering #32
with extra chili for many years.


Lesson number two,
you always want extra chili with #32.


So you don't have
to taste his cooking.


Lotus flower, you have to get
upstairs before someone sees.


- Everyone's looking for you. And you.
- We know.


I'm telling you, if you want
boys to respect you,


you have to show them
that you're serious.


Blow something up.
Shoot someone.


Nothing gets a guy's attention
like violence.


Shut that door. Lock it.


Keep your sticky paws
to yourself, okay?


This place... Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.


...is so fucking dope.


Oh, shit. Is that
a hyena in a bathtub?


I named him Bruce after
that hunky Wayne guy.


He's my little dumpling,
aren't you?


Aren't you, my little baby?
Aren't you, Brucey? Yes.


I love you.


I never said that.
I love you both equally.


Who, that? It's Cass.


You're so pretty.


Who's this?


It's a beaver.


Hmm.


Does Brucey want a treat?
Does Brucey want a treat?


What's this?


It's art. Don't touch.


He your ex or something?


You don't know who that is?


The Joker.


The Clown Prince of Crime?
My former partner in madness?


The Harlequin of Hate?
The Jester of Genocide?


- You've never heard of him?
- Well, sounds like a dick.


Huh.


Milk.


I'm not going soft
or nothing, but I gotta admit,


it was kinda nice
having the kid around.


Give me a #32. Mild.


Uh... Yeah, sure.


- Who are you?
- They call me...


H...


My bad.
I should've introduced you.


I'll make it quick.


Meet the daughter of the richest,
most powerful Mafia don in Gotham City.


Helena Bertinelli.


Yep, that Bertinelli.


One day, she comes home to find
her whole family in the living room.


Momma.


Anyone and everyone with
Bertinelli blood is there.


Oh, and that?
That's Stefano Galante.


The guy making the play
for the Bertinelli turf and fortune.


When one of the goons
finds the kid alive,


the big softy sneaks her outta
there and hides her away in Sicily.


Where she is raised by his own
father and brother.


Both assassins.


She spends the next 15 years
thinking only of revenge.


So, she starts training.


When she was ready,
and by "ready" I mean


a badass motherfucking killing
machine, she moves back to Gotham.


Starts working
on that kill list.


She has the murder stuff down,
but the rest?


Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?


Still a work in progress.


- Do you know who I am?
- The Crossbow Killer.


- They call me...
- The Crossbow Killer.


- They call me...
- The Crossbow Killer?


They call me...


- Huntress.
- She calls herself Huntress.


Fucking fabulous, if you ask me.


And who are you looking for?


- Great club.
- Quinn got the girl.


- And?
- And they disappeared.


Fuck!


Fuck!


What is she laughing at?


- Is she laughing at me?
- She is.


No, she's not. She's...


What are you laughing at,
Erika?


- You gotta hear this. It's hilarious.
- Get on the table.


- Oh.
- Ooh.


You're being a total kook.


Get on the fucking table.


This is my club. Get up now.


- Okay.
- Now.


Whoa.


Now, dance.


Dance. Dance, Erika!


Okay.


This dress is fucking hideous.


Take it off.


Take your dress off.


Get up there
and fucking cut it off her.


Do it now!


Take her fucking dress off.
Just rip it off her. Hurry up!


- Hurry up! Fucking do it.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


Do it.


Yeah. Beautiful.


You wouldn't betray me,
would you?


I was just gonna
go look for the girl.


Oh, no, no, no. I want you to
stay here with me.


I want you to stay here
with me close.


You soothe me, little bird.


Oh, good. You got it.
Did you trace the messages?


You stole evidence
from an active crime scene,


and then had it sent to my office.
Renee, what were you thinking?


Roman is the one that put a price
on the kid's head. Okay? I had to.


- I can't get into it right now...
- Renee, you need help.


- What are you talking about?
- She's right.


You are a good cop, Montoya,
but you've lost your way.


What?


I'm sorry. Okay?
You gave me no choice.


-Did you sell me out?
-I'm sorry.


You're suspended.


Your badge and your gun, now.


If you've ever watched
any cop movie ever,


you know that
this is when shit gets real.


What's the point of the badge,
when it means fuck all anyway?


Right, Captain?


No cop ever gets anything done
until after they've been suspended.


Which would've had me worried,
only I had more pressing concerns.


And that is why you should never
partake in paying federal income taxes.


Hey, you'll ruin your nails.


- Thank you.
- Anyway, lesson 37.


Why...


- You said they wouldn't find us.
- Chillax. No one knows we're here.


Harleen Quinzel,
this is Gotham Police.


Okay. So they know.


Let's scram.


- Open the door.
- Holy back door, Beavy.


This is getting outta hand.
Bruce, come here.


I can hear you!
Open the door.


What is that?


See you in hell, Harley!


Get under the table!


Bruce? Bruce!


Come here! No!


Bruce?


Come here, boy. Bruce?


Bruce?


Bruce?


This doesn't make sense.


It doesn't make sense. I don't
understand. No one knew we were here.


No one knew we were here,
except...


Doc. Oh, my God. Doc?


Doc? Where is he?


Doc?
I can't find Bruce.


I can't find him. I...


No.


- I'm sorry, lotus flower.
- You sold me out?


Too many people offering me
too much money.


I have enough now
to open up a new restaurant.


- A really nice one.
- But, Doc,


it's me.


It's just business.


This next bit
ain't very pretty.


- You're right.
- Harley?


He's right.


Business is business.


I've got the kid.


But I'm gonna need to renegotiate
the terms of our deal.


If I hand her over, I want everyone
who's after me to back off.


Quinn,
bring me the rock now


and I guarantee your safety.


I own this town.
You'll have my protection.


Fine.


Meet me at Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap. In one hour.


Quit judging.


Zsasz!


Come on, kid.
Let's get you somewhere safe.


We got them.


Little bird!


You're gonna be
driving Mr. Zsasz tonight.


Go. Fetch. Amusement Mile.
The Booby Trap.


Do we have to bring them back?


I think you can manage
a couple of little girls.


Just bring me back my diamond.


What is it?


Nothing.


- Pull over.
- What?


Pull the fucking car over now.


I gotta take a leak.


She betrayed you, boss.
She betrayed you.


- Are you sure?
- Your little bird's a fucking rat.


You want me to kill her?


No. No. No.


I'll come to you.


I thought we were friends.
And you...


You saw what it's like for me out there.
I didn't have a choice.


And if you go before he gets here,
everything will be fine.


Harley.


I'm sorry, kid. I am.


That was fast.


She's in...


- Where's Cassandra Cain?
- You? Again?


- Are you drunk?
- Come on.


Okay.


Right in the tit.


Where's Cassandra Cain?


Cass.


You killed my sandwich!


Bye-bye, birdie.


Ow!


No fair.


- Was that really necessary?
- You don't know her like I do.


Cass?


Oh, thank God.
I'm gonna get you outta here.


Did she really tape you
to a damn toilet?


Hmm.


This is nice.


You're still conscious.


You can still feel? Look at me.
Are you a good girl, now?


"I'm a good girl.
I'm a good girl."


I got one
for all the little birds


I helped fly away
from this world.


I'm saving
a special spot for you.


Right here.


- You're gonna have to be quiet.
-Hi.


What are you guys doing?


Oh, I know
where the diamond is.


Is that rock still inside you?


Oh, God.


Stop.


- The hell, Zsasz?
- Cut her open.


- Stop fucking around.
- You heard me.


Cut her fucking open.


Okay. No, no. No, no, no.
See, she's just a kid.


- You're a filthy fucking rat.
- I'm a rat?


I knew you couldn't be
trusted. Roman's little bird.


You little fucking bird.


That's why he needs me
to look out for him.


That's why he needs me
to take care of him.


You know you're just
being paranoid, Zsasz.


-Yeah?
-Mmm-hmm.


Prove it to me.


Rip open her little tummy.


- Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
- Now! Rip it open!


You piece of shit!


Freeze!


Don't fucking move.


Who the fuck are you?


- Go get the kid.
- All right.


- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Back the fuck up!


- Get away from me. All of you.
- Put that shit down.


Shoot them, kid.


You, put that stupid-ass
Robin Hood piece of shit down!


-Cass, it's okay. Just calm...
-Don't move!


Okay.


I don't know
what the fuck is going on.


But I know that this shit stick...
just tried to gut me.


And you.


Thought you were different.


I'm sorry, kid.


I'm just a terrible person,
I guess.


Ooh!


Ooh, I'm back.


Okay, I feel like I've just walked in on
something I don't give two shits about.


This guy's dead, so I'm just
gonna get outta your hair. Cool?


No. Wait. She's lying.
She works for Sionis.


Excuse me? I work for Sionis?


I'm not letting you
sell the kid to him.


I wasn't going to sell the kid.
I was going to trade the kid.


Yeah. To save
your own stupid skin. Huh?


I'm not proud of what I did,
but I had half the city after me.


- Even the fucking Crossbow Killer.
- I'm not the Crossbow Killer!


Whoa.


They call me...
Helena Bertinelli.


For fuck's sake.
As in the Bertinelli massacre?


Sheesh kebab. That is
childhood trauma, right there.


I killed Galante.


I killed his firing squad.


I killed Victor Zsasz.


And now I'm done.


Bravo.


So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna leave now.


Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.


I hate to be the one to break it to
you, sweetheart, but you are not done.


Who do you think funded
Galante's little power grab, huh?


Galante was working with Sionis.


Roman killed your whole family
looking for that rock.


You don't think
he's gonna kill this kid?


That diamond is our
only chance of stopping him.


You guys.
Hey, I think you should see this.


Oh.


It's Sionis.


We're fucked.


He bought himself an army.


They're all here for me.


Aren't they?


-No.
-They're not?


No, they're not.


Do you know what that means? That means
he's not just after the kid anymore.


He's after all of us. He's sure as hell
after me. I just robbed him.


You just betrayed him.
You just killed his BFF.


And you're dumb enough
to be building a case against him.


So, unless we all wanna
die very unpleasant deaths


and let Roman go finger-fishing
in the kid's intestinal tract,


- we're gonna have to work together.
- With you?


Yeah.
We're gonna work together,


and we'll get outta here
in one piece, okay?


Okay.


Yeah. Okay.


- Sure.
- Yes!


But we are gonna need
some serious hardware.


Will this do?


No. Not at all.


We're dead.
We're fucking dead.


That slimy jizznozzle! I can't believe
he took it all! - We're fucked.


-Fuck!
-Uh, there's this.


Okay.


Friends, brothers,
men of Gotham.


I have funded you.
I've protected you.


I've scratched your backs
and kept you outta jail.


Well, now it's time
to say thank you.


Go show those little bitches
you don't mess with Roman Sionis.


Half a mil to whoever
brings me the girl alive.


The rest you can kill.


Dope.


Oh, no, no, no. Not that one.
Sentimental value. Try this.


- You're kidding.
- What? Gotta take care of the girls.


Isn't this fun?
It's just like a sleepover.


We should order pizza.
Make cosmos.


-Harley, focus. Yeah.
-Okay.


Hey, nice. What the hell is up
with this bow and arrow shtick?


It's not a fucking bow and arrow.
It's a crossbow. I'm not 12.


Love this chick. She's got rage issues.
- I don't have rage issues.


You know,
psychologically speaking,


vengeance rarely brings
the catharsis we hope for.


Yeah.


Are we ready?
Bad guys, just outside.


Shit. Get down.


Down here!


Cass!


- Follow me!
- Go, go, go, go!


Go!


Holy shit!


What?


You are so cool.


Okay. This way.


Get ready, ladies.


Don't worry. You're gonna make it.
Okay? Okay.


What the... Go! Go, go, go!


Fuck.


Shit.


Whoa. Shit!


Motherfucker.


Let me go!


Gotcha.


This way!


Come on. Come on. It's okay.
Come on.


You shouldn't
have to see this.


Here, hold on to this for me, okay?
That's all you think about.


Just close your eyes
and hold it tight. Okay?


Here. Get down. Come on.
You'll be safe.


Canary!


You okay?


We gotta go this way!


Ugh. More?


When the fuck did she have
time to do a shoe change?


Come on.


Thanks.


Duck!


-Hair tie?
-Yeah.


Ah, fuck!


I got him!


Get back here, kid!


Who's got the kid?


Get down!


Please, no more.


- So, forgive me yet?
- Get off me!


Anyone else hungry?
I know a great taco spot.


-I'm starving.
-I love tacos.


Really?


Down! Get down!


You're okay.
You're okay.


Just breathe. Just breathe.
Let me check it.


- Get off!
- I got you.


Ooh!


Aren't you glad you wore that?
Sexy and bulletproof.


Harley! No! Get off me!


- Harley!
- They got the kid. Shit!


We can't let them get her.
I trust you.


- One bullet?
- Please help me!


- Has anyone got any bullets?
- Fuck! I'm out.


I can't get out there.
I just need to get through.


- We gotta go. We gotta move.
- Guys, they're in the car.


- They're getting away.
-Get in there! -Get off!


Shit! I'm out.


Guys, come on.
They're closing in.


Canary, you know
what you have to do!


Cover your ears!
You better get her back.


Told ya she had
a killer voice.


Need a ride?


Get her!


Oh!


- Whip me!
- What?


-Whip me!
-Okay.


- Kid!
- Harley!


Shoot her!


- Harley!
- Hit the brakes!


No!


Uh-oh.


Kid!


Harley!


Well, we always did share
a love of the dramatic.


Didn't we?


And look at us now.


But don't you see?
You're trying to kill me.


I'm the only one
who can protect you!


You know you can't
stand on your own, Quinn.


You're not the type!


But me? You need me!


Here's the thing, Romy baby.


Your protection is based on the fact
that people are scared of you.


Just like
they're scared of Mr. J.


But I'm the one
they should be scared of.


Not you, and not Mr. J.


'Cause
I'm Harley fucking Quinn.


Shit.


- That was super embarrassing.
- Hmm. Sure was.


You think you can beat me?
You're a fucking moron.


I'm sorry, kid.


And I'm sorry I tried to sell you.
That was a dick move.


For what it's worth,


you made me want to be
a less terrible person.


Ew.


If we're apologizing for shit,
I should tell you something.


- Excuse me!
- I stole something from you.


- You slippery-fingered little turd.
- I took your ring.


My ring?


Dope.


- Cass! Harley!
- We're okay.


-You okay?
-Yeah.


-He's gone?
-Mmm-hmm.


- Good. Fuck that guy.
- Yeah. Tacos?


No, but seriously.
You were very impressive with that bow.


- Very impressive.
- It's a crossbow.


- I appreciate that. Thank you.
- Morning margaritas!


Thank you. I got you.


- You drink, right, kid?
- I don't think so.


And I love that fucking name, Huntress.
- Really? - Yeah.


- Oh, great name.
- Wow.


Um... I really like
how you were able


to kick so high
in those tight pants.


- Yeah, that is cool.
- Thanks.


Thanks for the car.


You're welcome.


Kid, if that burrito doesn't
make you shit, I don't know what will.


Give me a minute.


Yes!


Right.


I've given her prune juice,
laxatives.


I mean, the kid's got
a stomach made of steel.


And you know what?
I owe you an apology.


Me?


I underestimated you.
And I'm sorry.


I'm used to it.


Uh, Harley!
Bring the colander.


- Ladies.
- Have fun with that.


So, what now?


Sionis is gone, but it's just a matter
of time before some other asshole


- tries to finish what he started.
- Right.


We gotta clean this city
from the inside out.


Does she always talk like the cop in
a bad '80s movie, or is that just me?


- Fuck you. And fuck you.
- What?


- I mean, we were amazing there.
- Yeah! Hell yeah!


I agree completely.
So I'll do that, as well.


- Thank you.
- Right.


Whoa. Whoa, whoa!


- She stole my fucking car!
- What?


- I'm sorry.
- I know what you're thinking.


You think I'm a dick
after all that.


But you heard what the cop
said. Sionis is gone.


And those guys?
They're gonna be just fine.


Montoya's boss picked up
the gangbangers at the Booby Trap.


And took all the credit
while he was at it.


Again.


It was the kick in the balls she needed
to see that she had nothing to prove


to those blowhard assholes.


She quit the same day.


We got the secret bank codes
off the diamond.


And Huntress
got her family money back.


She's using it to fund
a little crime-fighting outfit.


They call themselves
the Birds of Prey.


I call them
dorky little do-gooders.


The rock itself was worth a
chunk of change, so I pawned it.


And I invested the cash
in a little startup


making waves in the East End.


Oh! And I found Bruce.


He was wandering
around Chinatown.


I guess it proves the theory that
hyenas really do have nine lives.


Yeah, yeah.
I made the kid my apprentice.


Call me a softy.


I dare ya.


Mmm!



There once was a peculiar doctor
known for his extraordinary ability.


He could talk to animals.


Doctor Dolittle's reputation
spread far and wide.


Even the Queen of England called on him.


So grateful for his help
she gifted him a wondrous sanctuary


whose doors were opened to all creatures.


His days belonged to the animals,
but his heart belonged to one woman.


Lily the Fearless Explorer.


They traveled the globe
going on great adventures.


Defending creatures
who could not defend themselves.


They made an extraordinary team.






Soon, that team became a family.


With Lily by his side
Dolittle never felt more alive.


Until one day she left on an adventure.


Lily died at sea.


Heartbroken he locked the gates
of the manor


and completely retreated from the world.


As for me, and the animals
whose lives he'd saved,


we were left to wonder,
could anyone save his?


Until one morning, a most unlikely creature
found its way to Dolittle's life.


A very special boy.


In a time when people thought of animals
only as possessions, food, or sport.


Take that one. Shoot! Shoot!


Shoot! Shoot!


- I don't know, I can't.
- Shoot! Shoot!






You can't keep missing on purpose.


Oh, look! There is something that died.


Oh, no. We have to help him.


You don't leave an animal in suffering.


Do you?


He's a very odd boy.


Follow Poly.


Home of Doctor John and Lily Dolittle.


We treat all animals--


Follow Poly.


Secret entrance.


Poly, where'd you go?


Good dog. Big, white--


It's no good.


As far as I'm concerned,
I'm the only human here.


Just ignore them.


There's no getting past the Kalahari snare,
it's an ingenious design.


I think you just caught yourself a boy.


Let me see. Wait,
I don't wanna see.


Just make it go away!


Deep breathes, Doc.
Dab-Dab's got your back.


Don't be afraid, John. It's just a boy.


This is an opportunity.


This ignites me!


Pardon me.


Whatever you're doing up there?


I come from Buckingham Palace
on urgent business.


Can you tell me if this is the home
of John Dolittle?


Who are you?


You may call me Lady Rose.
And you are..?


Stubbins.


Could you... help me down?


This goes against Dolittle's rules.


Why are humans against the rules again?


If you let humans too close
you'll get hurt more


than you would if you didn't let them
at all. Isn't that right, Doc?


That's enough everybody.
Back to our routine!


We have a very fully--


John, pull yourself together!


You can't ignore people
just because they're... people.


What if they need help?


Possum, play dead.


This is ridiculous. Chee-Chee,
will you answer the door?


You're the only one with arms.


I think chess was enough pressure
for one day.


Chee-Chee boy.
This is what we trained for.


Be brave and get to the door.


And don't forget your mantra.


I am not a prisoner of fear?


You are not a prisoner of fear.


Have you been here before?


The Queen told me all about it.
It's the most unusual place.


I'm prepared for anything.


Wonderful! A gorilla
answering the door.


Just as the Queen said.


Wait a minute.


I have an injured squirrel.


I should've never let you go.


Hello?


Oh, look at you!


Aren't you peculiar
posing as a twig?


Go away please!
This is my hiding spot.


Not here.


Are you alright down there?


Yeah. I'm fine. Go on.


- Doctor Dolittle.
- Yeah, right.


You have been summoned
to Buckingham Palace by the Queen herself.


Go on.


You should know.
She's fallen gravely ill.


Do you understand what I'm saying?


Do you understand what I'm saying?


Go... on.


Go on and be gone!


I don't care about anyone,
anything anywhere anymore.


The birds will show you out.


Great. Everything's ready.


Lunch will be served
in a minute now.


- Smells lovely, Doc.
- Thanks very much.


Hey Doc, save some
for us this time.


Sorry, Doc. Guess
I'm scared of kids, too.


Don't worry about that.
Come on. Let's eat.


For that we'll be offering today
a broccoli soup.


You'll never believe
what we caught in the net.


The Queen has asked for you
by name, sir.


Are you hard to hear then?
I told you I'm closed for business.


What business?


Treating humans.


Intruder alert!


- Don't worry, I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not!


My house is descended into chaos.


- Is it yours?
- I don't own anybody.


Yoshi had an issue
that he came to me with.


He's always cold.


I have an injured squirrel.


I don't know what to do.


How was he injured.


- I shot him
- Wha-- I can't hear you.


I shot him, but it was an accident.


Of course! An accidental firing upon.


Humans never change.


He's very hurt.


Please help him.


Take that. And this.


I'm too beautiful to die.


Yes?


He's with us.


Dab-Dab, Jip, light the lamps.
Disinfect the surgery.


You will not tend to a squirrel


while the Queen of England's life
hangs in the balance!


You don't me very well, do you?


Don't drop him.


We have a code red.
Code red. Code red everybody.


The Doctor is back!


Hang on, little buddy.


Haven't done this in a while.


Let's get everything the way Doc likes.


Don't worry, we got you, pal.


Presume to save this squirrel, shall we?


Okay.


You're awake? Everything will be fine.


If I die I swear
I will hunt your house.


Sterilise the scalpel,
do not lick any instrument--


Patient's condition is stabilised.


They are understanding human,
he's understanding them.


In their own languages.


Going through the left ventricle. Breathe!


Dab-Dab, forceps please.


Here you go.


That's a piece of celery.
Forceps, Doctor.


- Sorry. Here you go.
- Still, celery.


- Forceps?
- Carrot.


- Forceps?
- That's a different piece of celery.


- Got it. Forceps.
- No. Still celery.


Never mind. I'll get it myself.


A human talks to the animals?


Chee-Chee, brow.


My brow as well. ---


Right. Sorry.


I'm going to come here
and be Dolittle's apprentice.


Her Majesty has designated this land
in nature preserve.


If she dies...


the deed will be owned by the Treasury,


and this place goes away.


Shut down?


There you are.


Still got it, Doc.


There, Cheech. That's the spot.


Keep an eye on Kevin, should we?


He may be prickly
when the anesthetic wears off.


Revenge!


Okay. Okay. Enough
with the pampering.


You need to go and help the Queen.


There are things I no longer do:


work with humans, or leave the house--


- Or bathe.
- Exercise.


Express emotional vulnerability.


Wake up, John!


If the Queen dies,
the Treasury takes the deed.


And we'll lose this house.


You're talking out of your tail feathers,
Poly.


The deed was for life.


The last time I checked
I was very much alive.


The Queen's life, John. Not yours.


Look at that. It just rolls off the back.


I knew I shouldn't've let monkeys
proofread the contract.


Elliot, Elsie, you are fired!


It gets worse.


We'll be thrown out of the gates
right in the middle of hunting season!


What?!
- No, no. Breathe, Chee-Chee.


We will be kicked out
if the Queen dies?


- We gonna be hunted.
- Calm down.


Look at the state of him now!


Fear not. I have an inn
at Regent Park Zoo.


Everyone pack your bags!


You help the Queen or we are leaving!


You are bluffing!


Don't make me count.


Don't make me count.


- One.
- Three.


Two...


Alright! I'll do it.


Let's get you ready to go, honey.


- I'll go as I am.
- Not looking like that.


- I'll just grab my doctor's bag.
- Get him!


Hold still now.


Get your paws off me!


This isn't gonna hurt a bit.


- Let's clean him up.
- How dare you!


- Hey guys.
- Arthur?


- How long have you been living in there?
- I don't know. What year is it?


Dab-Dab got the razor.


That's still celery.


Nighty night, Doc.


Dolittle used to travel around the world.


Look.


Ravaging through my private projects?


How is he?


First things first.
The squirrel's name is Kevin.


Expect the full recovery.


And after some violent grooming,
it's been decided.


We will come to you,
to Buckingham Palace after all.


You are going back to whatever burrow
you emerged from.


Try not to shoot anything on your way.


Maybe, I should stay here.
I don't do well in crowds.


We'll look after you, Cheech. But we all
going together, just like the old days.


Don't forget that forceps.


That's a leek, Dab-Dab.


Sure it is.


Sticks.


Where are you?


So, would you care to come along?


I know. I had other plans as well.


Hurry up. Hurry up.


Prepare my ride.


Today is gonna be a good day.
I'm gonna do nothing,


just prance around,
pick my own thoughts.


We're not at Great Sign.
He's got no beard, he looks motivated.


Plimpton, don't be alarmed.


People only say that when they are
about to be alarming.


Sorry about this.
And sorry about that.


- Alright.
- I'm unavailable.


Unavailable for the man
who changed your life?


We're going to save the Queen, bro.


I am not your bro!


You should be an Eskimos rag by now.


Out claws! Big claws.


Now now, Gentlemen.


You're getting a ride.


Why are you riding me? There're
like four horses in front of us.


Cheer up, angry bird,
kick back and enjoy the ride.


I am the ride!


Buckingham Palace. We hit the big time.


Full speed no longer required!


Welcome home, milady.


Guards! Guards!


Your Ladyship, Rose.


They are the Queen's own guests.
Treat them accordingly.


You better give me some
wide berth. Big way, boys.


Plimpton!


- Don't! Stop!
- Don't stop?


- Alright, decision affirmative.
- Stop!


Can't see! Oh my God!


Okay.


I bless the hat.


Doctor Müdfly.


Lord Badgley.


I come from the House of Lords.


There is great concern
for Her Majesty's health.


I shall continue to leech,


to circulate the vapors
in the blood stream.


She'll be lucky to last the week.


This is not the first time
Dr. Dolittle's been here.


You got a dying Queen?
Not for long.


Doctor Dolittle is in the...


Wait. Wait for me.


A stowaway, milady.
Who claims to be--


Doctor Dolittle's apprentice.


It's quite alright, Gareth.


But if he was my apprentice,
he should fetch my bags


and keep his gob shot.


Animals in the Queen's chamber?
I demand their immediate remov--


Lady Rose, my apologies.


Please forgive me. I didn't realise
that you were a part of...


John Dolittle.


- Is that Blein?
- Blair.


- Pootling?
- No.


- ---?
- No.


- With an u-umlaut.
- Yes.


- From the German.
- Of course, from the Germans.


Why is he here?


Her Majesty has personally requested
Doctor Dolittle.


Let's get to work.


Alright, Jip, give her a good sniff.


You alright, fellow?


Something smelled wrong.


And that's coming from a guy
who loves the smell of butts.


You do love butt.


I detected a whiff of something else.


Floral with ---


I'm perplexed, Doc.


I've never smelt anything like it before.


Jipsy and I have developed doubts.
May we consult?


Of course, I'd be more than happy
to help illumining...


John and I were students
at Edinburgh years ago.


Some thought he had a gift
for observation.


Sorry about that, Mini.


Stay here.


Dab-Dab, clear up the humans.


Boyo, fetch for botanic index,
and the tea tin.


Everyone out! Few obscene
words coming out of my bill.


What do you smell, Jip?
Aldigareceae? Amoque?


Negative?


Negative.


Aye aye.


What are you about, Dolittle?


Could possibly the answer to everything.


Exposure--


But he was like this in school.


Leaning, leaning...
I'm saying something interesting.


I am interested.


The Queen symptoms are due to the effect
of a rare Sumatran plant


known as the Nightshade flower.


A solar eclipse will occur
on the 17th of this very month.


If she is not received
the antidote by then, she will perish.


Is that a Turner?


Must be. What a fine painting.


I say, Dolittle, what is your plan?


The plan?


I suppose we do need one.


The Queen's only hope is the cure
that's never been tested


from tree that's never been seen
on island that's never been found.


Sounds ridiculous. Say it out loud.


But regardless of that...


We have no choice but to embark
on this spareless journey


to attain the fruit of the Eden Tree.


What?


Eden Tree? Oh my, fantastic!


The Dolittles with their Eden Tree island.


- Isn't it enough that your wife--
- Shut up, Blair!


Sorry, I meant to say,
glad to see you again, Blair.


We are off now, tell her.


Its fruit, is that to cure every malady
known to men, grant eternal life,


even restore the hair on your head.


You must let nothing pass her lips
that hasn't been made and served by you.


- Clear?
- Yes, I'll see to it.


Now it's us to the carriage.


Jip, you need to stay behind
and guard the queen. Very important.


Right. Guard-dog mode.


Stand up everyone
while I secure the perimeter.


Excuse me.


I do so admire how you don't give up.


The Queen is counting on both of you.


Good luck.


Right. Chop chop.
There is a long voyage in front of us.


And the boat isn't gonna sail itself.


Deep breath, Yoshi.


Haven't got all day.


Seems like she's filled up.


Maybe, we could squeeze in one more.


Oh, no.


One more stop, good fellow.


I can't hear you
because I am not here.


I believe it's time
to go our separate ways.


I am going with you.


Certainly not. It's far too treacherous.


- I'm your apprentice.
- You? No. No.


Oh, you have an apprentice. You
don't need an apprentice and an ostrich.


I'll go home.


I didn't want to be embarrassed,
so I pretend you belonged.


I was helpful there, wasn't I?


The animals like me,
I don't take up much space.


I think I belong here.


Don't make me go home. Please.


What is that around your neck? Move.


I'm worried about the boy, Bethan.


Give him time. Time is all.


We're hunters, Bethan. Hunters.


It goes with certain,


we hunt things, he frees things.


A rabbit, mice, --- and spiders outside.


Nobody likes spiders, not even spiders.


---


Poly? What are you doing here?


Making sure you don't miss the boat.


Am I talking to an animal?


Just like Dolittle.


Oh, no. I'm speaking human.
Better than any parrot ever has, actually.


Now, let's pack some clothes. Come on.


But Dolittle said I belong here.


Little help, Tutu.


Well, I've never heard him say
anything of the sort.


There's something special
about you, Stubbins.


Something I've only seen
in two other humans.


You belong with us, kid.


And you let me worry
about Dolittle, that's my job.


So, are you ready for the adventure
of a lifetime?


- I'm in.
- Of course, you are!


Poly, let's move, we got a boat
to catch ---


Fret not, Mon chéri,
we have the perfect plan.


New plan! New plan!


Don't let them get away!


Why are they chasing us?
We're not criminals.


Speak for yourself, we're wanted
in three forests.


And it's not an escape mission
unless you're being chased.


- Which way, Tutu?
- Down!


Clear the way!


This way!


Get off the road, Mon chéri.


See you later, suckers.


We've done it!
We've done it! We...


missed it.


Okay, boss, what's our next move?


We get hair loses, change our identities,
ditch the kid in the river.


Whoa, whoa. Easy.


What about that bridge?


Yes! The Bridge!


- That was my next suggestion.
- Let's go!


Come on, Doc. At least
get out of the hammock.


Your sea sickness will wear off.


Try some of this ginger root.


You'll get your --- back.
You look terrible.


---


Who put me in this hammock?


I am the captain of this ship ---!


Raise that luffing sails, will you?


That's a big bite.


Everyone, look. Is that the boy?


He's coming to finish the job.
He won't rest till I'm dead.


He's obsessed.


John, slow the boat down!


No. I wanna go faster.


Sorry kid, Johnny says no.


---


- I hope they make it.
- Me too, Dabs.


Moment of truth.


Big hole, pull the pluck!


Maybe this is a bad idea.


Let's go Stubbins! Let's go!


---


---


Vive la résistance.


Is that thing up to code?


No!


No!


Jump, murderer. You got this!


I can't look.


No, no!


Yes! Busted, kid.


You made it.


Why y'all cheering for the kid
who shot me?


He's alright.


Poly, can I have a word please?


---


What was she thinking?
The boy nearly killed himself.


Oy, this is my ship, right?


And I'm its sovereign.


- And there are consequences--
- To ignoring me.


Is that what you were going to say?


Don't twist my words.


And stop messing with my routine.


Look at the state of you.
You're sick as a dog.


Actually, I have a medicine.


See? This licorice root ---


Sit down, John!


Don't embarrass me
in front of the crew!


I'm sparing you embarrassment.
You need a trim.


Alright, but quick.
It's important to maintain my ---


This ship is dangerous ---


That's a private conversation.


- Okay.
- Sorry.


I know this particular voyage
is hard for you, John.


It is for me, too.


I brought to you Lily
just when you needed her.


And now you need
one of your own kind again.


Someone without feathers or fur.


Fine, the boy can stay.
But it'll be on my terms.


And I am to keep him quite busy.


You'll do it with a smile on your face.


Crew, it seems you got a new shipmate.


I just told Poly, we are a bit short on
---


- You won't regret it.
- Welcome aboard.


I hear you can be a big help
by clearing this out.


Up to where it belonged.


Oops, those as well. And that.


I got these.


Careful with that medical equipment!


Because the parrot's
in charge of my ship. Brilliant!


He's absolutely thrilled to have you.


Hello there, little squid.
You don't understand me, do you?


That'll be preposterous.


- Müdfly.
- I wasn't talking to the squid!


I'm dispatching a frigate, the Brutenda.


To follow Dolittle.


You must not support him
in his foolishness, My Lord.


England has enemies everywhere
waiting for the slightest sign of weakness.


Entrusting beloved Britain
to a child queen?


That is lunacy.


So, while I remain here ensuring
no one prevents me from taking the throne,


you will be on the Brutenda


making certain Dolittle never returns.


Round two, show me
---, Cheech.


Come on. One. Two.


Jab. Jab. Pass.


That's how you defense his attack.


I really don't wanna fight you.


We are not fighting, are we?
This is a very practic session.


I think I'm getting this.
I'm actually starting to understand.


Stop worrying, John.


Every step is planned out in my journal.


I'll be back before you even miss me.


Are you alright?


I think I'm beginning to understand
a little bit of what the animals say.


Seems you are, boyo.


What kind of polar bear
works on their tan?


What kind of a bird...


- Wait, are you even a bird?
- Of course, I am.


- Can you fly?
- No.


- Can you swim?
- No.


- What can you do?
- I can run.


I can run. What bird stuff can you do?


What bear stuff can you do?


You win this round.


Pickles?


Oh, you are saying warship.


Weird, if you'd asked me for pickles.


Who could eat if we're under attack.


Enemy! ---


Elliot, you and Elsie,
ready the machine.


We gonna need speed,
so do the call.


Secure the lifeboats!
This whole thing is death boat.


Stubbins, boy.


I need you now more than ever.


Just stand still.


I surrender! We surrender!


Hello, Blair, you chinless wanderer.


He said something about my chin,
didn't he?


It's a magnificent chin, sir.


We're in their sights.
Cannons are taking aim.


Let's turn this ship!


I'm on my way.


It is time for me ---


I thought of several seeds of crazy time.


Once Humphrey's been secured
you pull me on Yoshi signal.


Me? I can't handle
that kind of pressure, Doc.


I'm a cheer-quietly-from-the-sidelines
kinda gorilla.


Don't worry, Cheech.
You ---


You're stronger than you know.


And remember,
courage is not the absence of fear.


Wait! You got cut off.
I can't hear you.


- I need the second part!
- No time, Cheech, let's go!


Oh, look, look! They are already
abandoning the ship.


Pull!


This is gonna be cold.
But I'm coming in hot.


Humphrey here.


Let's shook it up.


- Where are we headed?
- South.


Okay. I can do this. I can do this.


- Full spin ahead!
- Go Humphrey! Go!


Are they pulling away?


Do it, whale! Do it!


It's working.


How is this possible?


It appears Dolittle and polar bear
have harnessed the whale--


It was a rhetorical question!


Just fire!


I lost the rope!


I failed, I knew I couldn't do it.


- Yoshi!
- Hang on! I'm coming, kid!


You're doing great.


It's gonna murder my back.


Quit complaining, you oversized flamingo.


Oh, no!


Oh, no! Oh, no!


I let you down, Doc.


Look at me.
I'm fine. We're all fine.


- I froze.
- No, no, Cheech.


It's okay to be scared.


You saved me, did you?
Fair play. Thanks very much.


Well-done everybody.


Do you want to keep along now, kid?


I guess I do.


- I guess I do.
- Great work, kid.


In our deaths Müdfly!


They've gone away, sir.


Oh, really? I thought
they disappeared into thin air.


I'm afraid not, sir. They've escaped.


---, Lieutenant Tucker,
I can see they've escaped.


But not for long.


It's a miracle, that must mean,
I am the chosen one.


I'm gonna change the wor--


Whale power.


Dolittle had to write a paper about it,
which, of course, nobody took seriously.


This one even theorises
the existence of dragons.


Just preposterous.


Sir, I'm afraid your obsession
with Dolittle--


What obsession?!


I'm not obsessed with Dolittle.
You are obsessed with Dolittle.


You're the one obsessing
about my obsession with Dol--


I loathe to admit it,


but he's move valuable alive for now.


But, luckily, I think I know
where he's going.


Kevin's log, day seven.
I'm now totally isolated.


The enemy has ingratiate himself
with the captain and crew.


No sign of promised tropical island,
or its magic fruit.


But I will endure.


Take the wheel, Stubbins.


- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.


I have to coordinate
our route coordinates.


The bees are buzzing about you.


Seems you are getting the rudimentary
grasp of their language.


Thirty five degrees, ---


How I know is just when they fly
in a zig-zag pattern.


They sort of go...


Which means "back off, kid."


But when Dab-Dab goes...


That means "look at this."


- "Look at me."
- Oh, close.


Not bad at all.


When Chee-Chee says...


When Chee-Chee says...


That means... "Where is my blanket?"


Very good.


Is that the map to Eden Tree island?


The Eden Tree cannot be found on any map.


At core it's an island
is as suggestive as the whole world.


---


That is why we must first go
to Monte Verde.


Birthplace of the only person
to ever chart course to the Tree.


Her name was Lily.


She wrote the route legend
of wrong voyage, she was shipwrecked.


The world lost the greatest explorer
I've ever known.


The journal from that expedition
is all that survived.


Elliot, Elsie, do you mind?


So, anyway, bigger picture.


If we to have any chance
of saving the Tree


we have to go to Monte Verde
and steal that freaking journal.


Steal the journal?


Did I say that?


That's the worst that can happen.


Don't worry, I know a no man
when I see one.


And that was not no one.


Stealing the journal is not a big deal.


In fact,


Monte Verde itself is not a big deal.


The stop at Monte Verde
was a very big deal.


After all, this island
of bandits and thieves


was once a place Dolittle,
Lily and I called home.


Until the Doctor made an enemy
of the island's notorious ruler,


King Rassouli.


And just our luck,
his most prized possession


was the very journal
we needed to steal.


So, Dolittle needed a disguise.


While I was left watching over
the rest of the crew,


Dolittle and Stubbins
snuck into the palace.


I don't want to die!


Once inside, their path ended
at a heavily bolted door, naturally.


But, Dolittle still had...


questionable contacts on the island.


The opening bid will suffice.
You have my attention.


Don Carpenterino, I am here
on behalf of these humans,


they will pay you handsomely
for your family's lock-picking skills.


You called on me for this
on a day of my daughter's wedding?


Wait a minute, which daughter?


It's not... Sheila? My Sheila?
She's getting married?!


With scorpion named Dylan.


Sorry, boy scout, I guess Sheila
into bad boys now.


We were gonna spend
the rest of our lifespans together.


Hold on, James. What's
your human's best offer?


Two now, and two later.


Okay, you have yourself a deal.
See you around, boy scout.


Guys. I'm no boy scout.


Also, what that scorpion got
that I don't got?


Besides a massive stinger.


Get over it, James,
they've dated for two weeks.


These bars are new.


Totally messing up my plan.


I can fit through them.


No, no. It's too dangerous.
I can't let you go in there on your own.


Let me take him there, Doc.


I need something to distract me
from this Sheila reveal.


Are you sure your reds
is in the right place, James?


Oh, yeah! I'll get the kid in,
and then fly head first into a brick.


Just kidding, I'm fine.


Alright. James will look after you,
it's fine.


Listen closely, get the journal,
you get out of there.


Go to his room quietly,
look for the tiger's eye.


Go down the hidden staircase,
and most importantly,


keep your disguise on.


There's just one little thing
you should know.


Rassouli loves his cats.


But, that's no problem for us,
because we can just fly right over...


Oh, I see the mistake
I made here. You can't fly.


Watch out, --- on your six.


Oh, God!


Sleek move, kid.


We make a pretty good team.
A real couple of bad boys.


Okay, partner, you know where to go.


I'll keep watch on these lions,
that's what a bad boy dragonfly does.


Would Dylan get this close to a lion?
Would he get this close?


How about this close?


Oh, shit!


This is bad... This is... very bad.


Lily... Dolittle.


We got the journal, open up!


Just kidding, he blew it. Bye.


Stubbins!


Don't let him get to...


- Former resident here.
- Don't move!


Don't touch.


All I wanted was my daughter
to marry wisely,


and instead I got the ring leader
of a circus.


I never understood
what Lily saw in you.


A common complaint to the world
over for fathers of beloved daughters,


but in this instance I think we can
all agree it is particularly accurate.


Come in here.


Come in.


Perhaps, you didn't mean any of that--


It was her journal.


The only thing of hers
my men found in the wreckage.


It belongs here!


All you had to do
was never show your face again.


And even at that you failed.


Now you will pay
for taking Lily away from me!


You knew what will happen
if you returned.


Yes.


Barry!


You should go.


It's my past that caught up with me,
not yours. Yeah?


- You're my friend.
- Go. Don't look back.


You're better off without him, kid.


I'm in compliance.


Yes! Finally, some action down here!
Boy, I was a good boy.


You know, Doc, I hate to tell you,
but you're going down, my friend.


You do well to keep
your --- teeth together.


What is that smell? Hey, fellas, I think
Doctor Dolittle did a little doo-doo.


Did Doctor Dolittle do a little doo-doo?


Perhaps, when I'm out of here
I'll teach you some manners.


And accept your lucky foot as payment.


Oh, this lucky foot?
Don't worry about it, Doc.


'Cause both of my lucky feet
are gonna be tap dancing on your grave


when my guys done with you.


Taking bets over here.


In the right corner,
wearing golden stripes


with a sparkling record of 872 kills,


Barry 'The Butcher' Burnstein.


Doctor Dolittle, remember me,
your old patient?


It's Barry.


Barry, how can I forget you?


Oh, but you did, Doc. We were
just starting to make progress.


And then you ran off
with Rassouli's daughter.


And abandon me.


I'm back now.


Perhaps we should just pick
up where we left--


Enjoy the feast!


What will happen to Dolittle?


Well, he's a dead man.


You think you can talk
his way out of it,


but Barry has gone completely nuts.


But you, you are one of us now.


To Dolittle's death!


Hey! It's you! You made it.


I need you to get the message
to my friends in the boat.


A message? Sure.
When have I ever let you down?


All I hear day after day,
"Oh, Barry, you're such a disappointment.


Why can't you be more like your brother?
He eats poachers for a living, you know."


Yes, Mother, I know!
The whole jungle knows!


Oh, my head.


Your migraines are brought on
by severe maternal issues,


and compounded by sibling rivalry.


Please, make it stop.


Oh, no, no!


- Lie down.
- Oh, my head.


We could resume your treatment.


The stress is unbearable.
I just want to be a good boy.


Just want to make Mommy proud.


Yeah?


No one I eat will ever be good enough.


There's a release, release it.


I will never be good enough.


Unless I eat you.


Every mother wants their son
to grow up and eat a doctor.


You're sick kitty.


Come here, Doc.
I'll make it quick.


I'll get another one within an hour.


Give up, Dolittle. You can't outsmart--


What was that?


Wait. That was over there.


And now it's over here.


There's nothing in there, of course.
And now it's over here.


Oh, I lost it. Of course, I did--


A cat is still a cat. Easily distracted.


New game, Doc. Get back here.


Come on, Doc!


Okay, James, you can't let this kid down.
You gotta deliver this message.


Oh, no. It's James.


From now on no more focusing on ---


Poly? Is that you?


Your feathers really filled down here.


- What happened, James?
- Oh, right! Message. My bad.


The kid's been captured by Rassouli, and
Barry is about to have Dolittle for lunch.


Looks like we are going to show after all.


Be a darling, and grab my dynamite,
will you?


We need to split up
if we are going to pull this off.


Chee-Chee you are coming with me.


Where are we going?
No, don't tell me.


Just tell me when we get there.


Yoshi, create a distraction.


Hope this is enough.


We are being attacked!


Come on down, Doc.


---


Oh, no! Worse than I expected.


I got you Doc.


Back off, Barry!


Poly, don't!


An appetizer?


I got you, Poly.


Any final diagnosis, Doc?


Don't you want to be
the best Barry you could be?


I'm about to.


I am not a prisoner of fear!


- I am not a prisoner of fear.
- Oh, no, no.


It's okay to be scared!


- It's okay to be scared!
- You should be scared!


It's okay to be scared!


Give him a good ---


Okay. We're doing this.
We are doing this!


We're not doing this.


Get him in the low area.


Down there.


That's gotta hurt.


---


That will work.


Cheap shot, ape.


I haven't finished by treatment.


Go to sleep, baby tiger.


Time to put those claws away.


Anyway.


You need this more than I do.


Tell me that I'm enough, Mommy.


I had fifty grand running on that.


Well, I won't pay that.


Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a winner.


Thanks for sticking with me, Doc.


- I have it. I have this.
- Hold!


And now. I'll have it.


She had such a sure hand.


Exactly what the doctor ordered.


What did they offer you Müdfly,
to murder the Queen of England?


Quite a few things, actually.


Knighthood. Windward house.
Chair at the Royal College.


In no particular order.


Oh, and the icing on the Madeleine


will be the scientific accolades that accrue
from the proper study of the Eden Tree.


All thanks to Lily Dolittle.


Actually, no. That's still Madeleine.


The icing is knowing that you know I won.


Oh, and Dolittle, I'm so sorry
for that hole in your boat.


What hole?


Abandon the ship! Everyone out of boat!


Not good.


Hold on!


- Help!
- I'm on it, Doc.


I can't fly... and I can't swim.


I got you, buddy. Plimpton?
I'm not losing you, bro.


Step away from the light!


There is no light! I'm alive! I'm alive.


I'm alive. Thanks to you, Yoshi.


You've always been so kind.


It's difficult to say goodbye.


Please don't say that.


It's alright.


You've done your best.
Your Queen is proud.


Where are you Dolittle?


Hey, big bird, you're doing okay?


No. Nothing about me is okay.


My father was right about me.


I should've been an omelet.


I know how you feel.


My dad said he was going
for a pack of seals one night,


and never came back.


I guess we got something in common
after all, Plimpton.


What is this feeling?
I'm all warm and fuzzy inside.


That's friendship, bro.


Not bad.


Bro.


I'm not crying, you're crying.


Right. Gather around, shall we?


Let's flip where we are now.


That's the spirit, John.


This is gonna be good.


I'm already getting duckbumps.


- We are finished.
- What?


Is this a pep talk?
'Cause it's a weird one.


I can smell defeat like a truffle pig.


This can't be the end.


- Yeah. I suppose.
- We gonna still save the Queen.


- No.
- We can still save your house.


I believe in you.


- We can keep coming.
- You got a point there.


Except the journal's gone.
We have no way to find the Eden Tree.


- And our boat has sunk.
- He makes a strong argument.


On the plus side, you are all cured.


Chee-Chee, you are brave now.


Plimpton and Yoshi are getting along.


- Remember back? Back.
- Sort of.


And Stubbins, you made friends,
and you clearly talk to them.


You don't need me.


I'll stay here and offer medical services
to this island of random bandits now.


- Boss.
- The doctor's here, seeking new patients.


Cash only.


Ladies, Gentlemen,
who would like to dance?


I got a bad case of dancing fever,
so, watch out, it's infectious.


Can't help him.


The explorer you told me about,
she would've never given up.


She was your wife, wasn't she?


You wanna know the ironic bit?


I don't know what ironic means.


Irony is when you find a woman,


and she makes your life more wonderful
than it ever had the right to be.


And the poof, she's gone,
and it's all your fault.


This journey was my chance
to finish what she started.


Lily insisted I care for the animals
at home, so I stayed behind.


Rassouli's right.
I should've been with her.


All I have left of her is a ghost I see
when I look at our rings.


So, you see her, too?


Not only did you lose
my daughter's journal,


but your polar bear blew up my village.


We don't know that.


And your gorilla beat up my tiger.


No good.


Let's go.


No, no.


Irony... is me


wanting to kill you
with every fiber of my being,


but loving my daughter more.


I miss her, too.


She would wanted you to...


to keep going.


So!


Keep going, before
I start feeling sentimental.


She's saying we don't have a ship.


Well...


I have a perfect vessel for you.


Better to fix her up, huh?


The boat.


At least it flows.


We'll just have to make
the best of it, are we?


Help me.


Who's that?


Hi, I'm Jeff.


---


If Lily's research was correct


and Müdfly was well on his way
to Eden Tree island,


all we needed to do was track Müdfly.


But how would we do that?


Whales, boyo. Whales.


- I can't believe you've clipped him off.
- I know, that man has no chin.


We found him. Follow us.


Eden Tree island.


Extraordinary.


This must be it.


The map points us directly
into the centre of this mountain.


Don't look down. Let's keep
our beaks up, shall we?


Trying to stay positive. But
what a heck are we doing up here?


Going the back way my feathered buddy.


What are you complaining about? This is
the widest branch I've ever screwed on.


Don't look down. Look at me.


Whoa. A big cave.


Stay close. Keep quiet.


Kevin's log. Day 12.


Some force beyond my comprehension still
compels me to follow this crew of lunatics,


the squirrel killer,
and their deranged leader.


Perhaps, it's the magic tree
that draws me.


Hide, we're close.


---, Now stay down.


Foxfire rocks.


We must be near it now.


Look, Doc.


It's lighting a path all the way to...


the man who wants us dead.


Stay right there!


Go on then, soldier boy.
Explain it yourself.


Hello, Blair.


- Get over there!
- Looking for a Tree, is it?


Trees are not growing in caves.


Didn't you pay attention to botany class?


No! But pay attention to this, Dolittle.


I beat you.


- Filthy animal.
- Let go!


Order!


So.


- Where is it?
- Where's what?


- The Eden Tree.
- Truth is...


I haven't got a clue.


Don't be ridiculous, you're John Dolittle.
You get everything you want.


Not today I don't.


You really don't have any idea, do you?


How does the ignorance feel?


Very silly, actually.


One must outgo uncertainty,
don't you think?


That's how Lily lived her life.


And place the unknown at,
the answers will be revealed.


You sad, misguided nut Dolittle!


Give that! Give me that!


I will find this damn Tree on my own!


And by God, history will remember me!


Yes. Something interesting
is going on now.


It rather feels a lot larger
than all of us.


Look out!


Down here, all of you! Come on!


---


He saved me. I have a second chance...


to live a life of kindness and generosity.


Take him, not me.
I am a good person now.


That window, can be a run
for that ditch. Once--


- Yoshi!
- Get this off of me.


- Cheech.
- Help me, Plimpton.


I'll save you, bro.


Right, John, think fast.


Take this off of me!


---


No!


Dolittle! Help!


Is he speaking dragon?


You may be able to speak my language,


but that does not make you
worthy of the fruit.


I know protecting the Tree is your duty,


but you won't be able to continue
much longer


considering the damage you've taken,
and the pain you're in.


You know nothing of my pain.


But I do. I lived it as well.


The kind that doesn't come from
bullets or the blades,


but cuts much deeper.


But known in every moment,


in every movement
you feel that pain again.


It's hard to carry on.


But you've lost the ones you love.


Just leave!


What just happened?


Broken hearts.


What the heck are you doing here?


Don't worry guys, I got this.
We're both dragons.


Hey, just wondering,
you know, dragon to dragon.


If you wouldn't mind telling me what...


She's really mad, I'll wait
for whoever survives outside.


John, let's just get out of here
while we still can.


No. I think we are here to help her.


Yeah.


We haven't got much time!


I imagine it's a bit tender here.


I'm unarmed.


I pose no threat to you.


Emotional stress over the years
has done damage to your stomach.


Get away from me!


You have severe infectious colon.


And if I don't manually fragment it,
it will septic.


And you won't be able to incept
anything at all.


- That sounds like some tummy ache.
- I'll tell you what.


Give us five minutes.


If you don't feel better,
you can fry us all--


Stop talking! Just get on with it.


We have to get you on newer side.


We need to perform
an emergency extraction.


Extraction? What are we pulling out?


Go get it, Doc.


- We got your back, Doc.
- It's showtime.


Three, two, one. Turn!


Chee-Chee drop me the forceps.


- Knew it will come in handy. Told ya!
- You realise what to do?


- Just breathe.
- Works for me.


It's okay, just hold on my wind, sweetie.
Dab-Dab's here.


Oy! You are my apprentice.
You keep her calm.


Did you know that leek
is the national emblem of Wales?


Very useful it is, too.


You might feel... a bit of pressure.


I got her.


Oh, ---


- No, you don't.
- Oh my God!


Just clear the way.


Is that hardware?


---


Give us a deep breath. Hold it.


- ---
- What's up, Doc?


We're removing the blockage.


Yoshi, help.


Go way beyond the initial whiff of wind.


Respect.


Nobody heard that?


Nothing to be ashamed of.
We all do it. We are all animals.


I keep tasting it.


I'm back. What did I miss?


Oh my God!


- ---
- We're in the hulk-duck now!


- Chee-Chee, get behind me.
- I'm with you, Doc. On your call.


---


Blood rushing to my head.
Everything turning red.


One last push ---, please.


Thank you.


- We did it!
- Team work makes the dream work.


That was the one. We did good.


To put simply, remove your grievances,
less armor in your diet.


I've seen armies of every kind,
but nothing like you.


What unites such a group of creatures?


Well, we may not ---
but somehow...


- we're just strong together.
- Good boy.


Now let me help you.


Lily would have loved it, John.


We would never have found it without her.


I just got the chills. I'm not cold.


Thank you for showing me
the way, my love.


--- Raise her up


and restore her, to allow her
continuance amongst us.


O Father of mercies
and God of all comfort--


I'm sorry we can't save you, Your Majesty.


It is with great sadness--


Wait a minute, I smell something.
It smells like...


Hope!


...I have to announce...


that the Queen is no longer--


Here they come, Doctor.


My mates!


Very dramatic entrance, boys. Well played.


- We've arrived.
- Dolittle!


Clear path, there's no moment to waste.


I have secured that what you said
does not exist.


Behold, the fruit of the Eden Tree.


I said clear the path.


Seize them!


Sorry.


- Go!
- Seize them!


You were born for this moment.


I was.


Mini, deep flight.


Go! Go!


No! No!


Kevin's log. Day unknown.


The killing is ended. Let there be life.


Lady Rose.


Is that a giraffe in my bedchamber?


Yes!


Oh, yes. And a polar bear, and a gorilla,
and a parrot and a duck, and ostrich.


A humble thanks. Pray to God.


And well done, Doctor Dolittle.


Not quite done, are we?


Interesting, carry on, Sticks.
I'm all ears.


What's that?


Sticks here agreed to stay behind,
keep his 12 eyes on things.


He's was just catching me up.


Like all leaf insects, he speaks
an iterable phrases, and he states,


Lord Badgley did poison the Queen.


What? He did?


Really, Dolittle? This is too much.


You also heard ---


Well, this would be the time.


No, that's alright, Sticks.
Is quite adamant.


In his right pocket the vile.


That would be seven.


In his right pocket the vile
of deathly nightshade.


Let's have a look, shall we?


You can't possibly believe
that he's talking to an insect.


Well, I've spoken to ladybugs,


making a wish before they fly away.


Let's have a look.


No one messes with my family!
Take one more step and I'll rip you a--


To the Tower with him.


- Someone's been a bad boy.
- Come on.


I don't know why you all standing there.


Nobody's died. Leave me in peace.


You too.


Not you, Doctor Dolittle.


A moment, if you would please.


Lady Rose, who is this person
and why is he staring at me?


He's Stubbins.


I want to be an animal doctor.


He saved your life.


Enough, we have
far less important places to be.


Our story ends the way it began.


I have a letter for Doctor Dolittle.
Somebody get me down!


Mostly.


There once was a peculiar doctor.


Who found he was at his best when sharing
his extraordinary ability with others.


Excellent.


Soon, Doctor Dolittle re-opened his gates
as Lily would have wanted.


- Three more in the queue, gang.
- Copy that.


Dolittle discovered his place
in the world once again.


After all, it's only by helping others
that we can truly help ourselves.

Over black. 
DAD (V.O.) 
Long ago, the world was full of 
wonder! 
EXT. FANTASY LANDSCAPE - DAY 
We race over rolling green hills. A unicorn soars into view, whinnies, and banks off into the sky. 
DAD (V.O.) 
It was adventurous... 
The land below is alive with FANTASY CREATURES. We pass through a field of racing CENTAURS. 
DAD (V.O.) 
Exciting... 
Mermaids leap through shimming water and FAIRIES fly through the air, spiraling up into the sky. 
DAD (V.O.) 
And best of all... there was MAGIC! 
We stop on an ELF WIZARD holding a gnarled wooden staff. He turns and thrusts his staff toward the sky, casting a spell. 
ELF WIZARD 
Boombastia! 
Fireworks shoot magically into the air. Fantasy creatures across the land watch in awe. 
EXT. CLIFF - DAY 
A small group of creatures huddle and shiver in the cold. 
DAD (V.O.) 
And that magic helped all in need. 
A SATYR WIZARD approaches.

INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS - NIGHT 
A warrior, rogue, and wizard try to reach a glowing chalice. A dragon breathes FIRE at them. The warrior holds up a shield, protecting them from the flame. 
The BRAVE WIZARD leaps out and casts a spell. 
BRAVE WIZARD 
Voltar Thundasir! 
A lighting bolt zaps the ceiling, crashing rocks down in front of the dragon, clearing their path to the chalice. 
EXT. MUSHROOM VILLAGE - DUSK 
A wizard teaches a young apprentice to conjure a glowing orb. She floats the orb into a mushroom house, filling it with light. The gnome resident of the house emerges, delighted. 
The apprentice attempts the spell, but only manages to catch his robe on FIRE. The wizard quickly puts out the flames and encourages the apprentice to try again. 
DAD (V.O.) 
But it wasn’t easy to master. And 
so the world found a simpler way to 
get by... 
The wizard and apprentice see a satyr INVENTOR in a barn surrounded by fantasy creatures. 
INVENTOR 
I call it: the light bulb! 
The inventor flips a switch and the lightbulb turns on, illuminating the room. The crowd is amazed. 
The apprentice hands the wizard the magical staff, walks toward the crowd, and gives the light bulb a try. 
APPRENTICE 
‘Tis so easy! 
The wizard looks on, disappointed. 
Huh. 
MASTER WIZARD 
An elf on a sales floor lights up a gas stove with a click, click. Everyone reacts in amazement.

Goblins sit in a cozy living room. One of them turns on a gas fireplace using a remote. 
DAD (V.O.) 
Over time, magic faded away... 
A centaur plays “Prance Prance Revolution” in an arcade. A mermaid lounges in a kiddie pool, scrolling on her phone. A sprite, suitcase in hand, approaches an awaiting airplane. A factory assembly line rolls by. 
Traffic crawls along a congested highway. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING 
A troll on a bicycle tosses papers onto doorsteps of mushroom houses with satellite dishes, garages, basketball hoops, etc. 
A feral unicorn roots around in a trash can. Another unicorn approaches and hisses. The first unicorn chases it off. 
We push into the upstairs window of a mushroom house. 
INT. LIGHTFOOT HOUSE - IAN’S ROOM - MORNING 
DAD (V.O.) 
But I hope there’s a little magic 
left... 
A phone alarm beeps. A boy’s hand quickly silences it. Puts on his watch with style. His shoes with flair. 
...in you. 
DAD (V.O.) 
He pulls on his sweatshirt and gets stuck. He pulls harder until his big nose, wild hair, and giant ears pop out of the sweatshirt, revealing a lanky teenage elf: IAN LIGHTFOOT. 
Ian smiles and dusts off the “Willowdale College” sweatshirt. He grabs his backpack and pauses to look at his desk calendar. Today is circled and reads: 16TH BDAY. 
Ian looks into the mirror, smiles, and walks out of the room. TITLE: ONWARD

Ian walks downstairs to the beat of loud, pulsing music. 
LAUREL LIGHTFOOT, a female elf in her 40s, works out in front of the TV. An onscreen FITNESS INSTRUCTOR barks commands. 
FITNESS INSTRUCTOR 
We’re gonna get Warrior Z90 fit! 
Let me hear you say I’m a mighty 
warrior! 
FITNESS MODELS 
I’m a mighty warrior! 
LAUREL 
I’m a mighty warrior! 
IAN 
Morning, Mom! 
A scaly Labrador-sized dragon, BLAZEY, races into the room and tackles Ian to the ground. 
Aahh! 
IAN 
Ian is trapped as the dragon happily licks his face. 
IAN 
Shh! Down girl! Please! 
LAUREL 
(noticing) 
Oh--! Blazey, down! 
Laurel races over, squirting the dragon with a spray bottle. 
IAN 
Ah! Stop, girl, stop! 
LAUREL 
Bad dragon! Back to your lair! 
Blazey blows a small puff of fire at Laurel and runs off. Ian stands and is attacked with Mom kisses. 
LAUREL 
Happy Birthday, mister adult man! 
IAN 
(struggling/laughing) 
Ugh, no, Mom! Ah! gross.

LAUREL 
Hey, buddy, don’t wipe off my 
kisses! 
Laurel looks at Ian, touched. 
What? 
IAN 
LAUREL 
You’re wearing your Dad’s 
sweatshirt. 
IAN 
Oh, you know. Finally fits. 
LAUREL 
Oh, my little chubby cheeks is all 
grown up! 
IAN 
Okay, okay, Mom! I gotta eat 
something before school. 
INT. LIGHTFOOT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Ian looks in the fridge for breakfast. 
LAUREL 
Ugh, we don’t have much food. I 
still have to go to the grocery 
store-- 
Laurel smacks Ian’s hand as he reaches for something. 
LAUREL 
Hands off, Mister! Those are for 
your party tonight. 
Ian takes the milk from the fridge and closes the door. 
IAN 
It’s not a party Mom, it just us. 
Ian empties the last of a box of cereal into a bowl. 
LAUREL 
Well, you could invite those kids 
from your science class. You said 
they seemed pretty “rockin’.”

Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 6. 
IAN 
I’m pretty sure I didn’t say it 
like that. And besides, I don’t 
even know them. 
LAUREL 
Well, your birthday is a day to try 
new things, be the “new you”! 
Laurel makes herself a smoothie, yelling over the blender. 
LAUREL 
SPEAKING OF TRYING NEW THINGS, DID 
YOU SIGN UP FOR DRIVING PRACTICE?! 
The blender stops, but Ian is still shouting. 
IAN 
NO!(quieter) 
No. 
Laurel pours her shake into a glass. 
LAUREL 
I know you’re a little scared to 
drive sweetie-pie, but-- 
IAN 
I’m not scared, Mom. 
(pointing offscreen) 
I’m gonna move Barley’s game. 
LAUREL 
Okay, but you know how he gets when 
someone touches that board. 
Ian walks to the kitchen table, stumbling over a plastic flail on the floor. The table is covered with a game: pewter figures, dice, and miniatures. Ian and begins to move them-- 
IAN 
Well, he’s gotta learn how to clean 
up his toys-- 
--when suddenly a huge, thick arm wraps around his neck. 
HALT! AHH! 
BARLEY (O.S.) IAN 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 7. 
Ian is pulled into the hulking barrel chest of twenty-year old BARLEY LIGHTFOOT. 
BARLEY 
Doth my brother dare disrupt an 
active campaign?! 
Ian’s cereal bowl is knocked to the floor in the scuffle. 
IAN 
Oh, come on! 
BARLEY 
You know, Ian, in the days of old, 
a boy of sixteen would have his 
strength tested in the Swamps of 
Despair. 
IAN 
I’m not testing anything, just let 
me go! 
LAUREL 
Let him go. 
Barley releases Ian. 
BARLEY 
Okay, but I know you're stronger 
than that. There’s a mighty warrior 
inside you. You just have to let 
him out. Riiight, Mom? 
Barley puts Laurel in the same chokehold as she laughs. 
BARLEY 
Oh! That’s good! Keepin’ your head 
down. 
LAUREL 
(laughing) 
Barley, you stink! When was the 
last time you showered? 
Blazey roars and leaps around. Amidst the chaos, Ian picks up his bowl from the floor and retreats to the kitchen counter. 
BARLEY 
If you tried a little harder, you 
actually could probably wiggle out 
of this-- 
Suddenly, Laurel flips Barley onto his back with a CRASH. ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 8. 
BARLEY 
See? Mom knows how to let out her 
inner warrior. 
Barley reaches up to high-five Laurel. 
LAUREL 
Thank you. Now take out the trash. 
EXT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - CONTINUOUS 
As Barley opens the back door, trash in hand, we hear a police radio. 
OFFICER GORE (O.S.) 
(fuzzy, over radio) 
--stay on the lookout for a runaway 
Griffin. 
BARLEY 
(groan) 
Officer Bronco. 
OFFICER COLT BRONCO, a mustachioed, cocky cop with mirrored aviator sunglasses, speaks over the clop of horse hooves. 
COLT 
Barley, Barley, Barley. Every time 
the city tries to tear down an old 
piece of rubble, I gotta drag my 
rear end out here and deal with 
you. 
As he steps closer, we see he’s not a mounted police officer after all. He’s a centaur cop. 
BARLEY 
I don’t know what you’re talking 
about. 
Laurel appears in the doorway behind Barley, irritated. 
COLT 
Oh, really? 
Colt pulls out his phone. A video shows Barley chained to an ancient fountain in front of a laughing crowd of people. 
BARLEY 
I will not let you tear this down 
this fountain! Ancient warriors on 
grand quests drank from it’s 
flowing waters! 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 9. 
As construction workers pull him away, Barley falls into the water with a SPLASH. 
Barley. 
LAUREL BARLEY 
They’re destroying the town’s past! 
COLT 
And last night, someone destroyed 
their bulldozer. 
LAUREL 
Ugh, well come on in, rest your 
haunches for a minute. 
COLT 
Thank you, hon. 
Laurel and Colt kiss. Ian and Barley shudder in disgust. 
INT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - KITCHEN - DAY 
Colt approaches Ian in the kitchen. 
COLT 
Hey there, Birthday Boy... So ya 
workin’ hard or hardly workin’? 
(horse laugh) 
Colt punches Ian on the shoulder just a little too hard. 
IAN 
I'm just, you know... making a 
toast. 
LAUREL 
I’m serious, Barley, you need to 
start thinking less about the past 
and more about your future. 
COLT 
She’s right. 
As Colt turns, his tail knocks Ian’s toast off the counter. It falls to the floor and is promptly snatched up by Blazey. 
COLT 
You can’t spend all day playing 
your board game. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 10. 
Colt awkwardly plops his hindquarters into a chair at the table, toppling Quests of Yore pieces. Barley hustles over to set the pieces straight. 
BARLEY 
Uh, Quests of Yore isn’t just a 
board game, it’s an historically based role playing scenario. Did 
you know in the old days centaurs 
could run seventy miles an hour? 
COLT 
I own a vehicle, don’t need to run. 
BARLEY 
Well, Ian, you could definitely 
learn a lot from Quests of Yore. 
You want to play? 
I don’t. 
IAN 
Ian folds the last piece of toast and starts to take a bite-- 
BARLEY 
You could be a crafty rogue, or... 
ooh, I know! You can be a wizard. 
Barley puts the pewter wizard figure on Ian’s shoulder. 
BARLEY 
(wizard voice) 
I shall cast a spell on thee!! 
IAN 
Hey, careful of Dad’s sweatshirt. 
BARLEY 
I don’t even remember Dad wearing 
that sweatshirt. 
IAN 
Well, you do only have, like, two 
memories of him. 
BARLEY 
No! I've got three. I remember his 
beard was scratchy, he had a goofy 
laugh, and I used to play-- 
--drums on his feet.IAN 
BARLEY 
--drums on his feet. Right. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 11. 
BARLEY 
I used to go... 
Barley hums “Shave and a Haircut” with raspberries for the last two beat, but clumsily knocks Ian’s toast off the counter. Ian lunges for it, but Barley gets it first. 
BARLEY 
Whoops! Five second rule. 
As Barley puts the toast back on the plate, his wrist cuff snags on Ian’s sweatshirt, ripping it. Ian GASPS. 
BARLEY 
It's okay! You just gotta pull it! 
Barley yanks his arm to snap the snagged thread, but only rips the seam even more. 
NO! 
Barley! 
IAN 
LAUREL 
Laurel cuts the thread. Ian walks away, trying to stay calm. 
IAN 
You know what, I’m just gonna get 
some food on the way to school. 
LAUREL 
I’ll sew that later tonight, okay? 
Barley jumps up, puts on a helmet, and grabs a sword. 
BARLEY 
Wait, wait, wait, wait! By the Laws 
of Yore, I must dub thee a man 
today! Kneel before me. 
IAN 
Oh, that’s okay... I gotta get 
going! 
BARLEY 
Alright, well I’ll pick you up 
later and we’ll perform the 
ceremony at school! 
IAN 
NO! No, no, no, no, no. Don’t do 
that. Okay, bye! 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 12. Ian closes the door behind him and lets out a massive SIGH. 
EXT. BURGERSHIRE RESTAURANT - DAY 
People come and go from a typical fast food restaurant. 
INT. BURGERSHIRE RESTAURANT - DAY 
A cash register runs up an order. 
Ian takes his receipt and sits. An elf dad in his forties, GAXTON, and his preteen son sit on the bench next to Ian. 
GAXTON 
Hey! Go Griffins! 
What? 
IAN 
Gaxton points to Ian’s hoodie. 
GAXTON 
You go to Willowdale College? 
Gaxton’s son goes to the counter to wait for their food. 
IAN 
Oh, no. This was my Dad’s. 
Ian points to the name LIGHTFOOT on the hoodie. 
GAXTON 
“Lightfoot?” Wilden Lightfoot? 
Ian lights up. 
Yeah! 
IAN 
GAXTON 
You’re kidding! I went to college with him! 
Really? 
IAN 
GAXTON 
Yeah!(beat) 
Boy, I was so sorry to hear that he 
passed away. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 13. 
Ian nods and smiles. 
IAN 
Yeah... thanks. 
GAXTON 
You know, your dad was a great guy! 
So confident. When he came into a 
room, people noticed. 
(laughing at the memory) 
The man wore the ugliest purple 
socks, every single day. 
IAN 
(laugh) 
What? Why? 
GAXTON 
Hey, that’s exactly what we asked. 
But he was just bold. I always 
wished I had a little bit of that 
in me. 
Yeah. Wow. 
IAN 
(beat) 
I’ve never heard any of this about him before. Do you remember--? 
GAXTON'S SON calls out, waving a bag of food. 
Dad! 
GAXTON'S SON GAXTON 
Oh! Sorry. Gotta get this guy off to school. 
Gaxton holds out his hand to shake Ian’s. 
GAXTON 
Hey, it was nice meeting you! 
IAN 
Yeah, you too. 
Ian thinks to himself for a beat. 
Huh. Bold. 
IAN

Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 14. 
EXT. NEW MUSHROOMTON HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING 
Ian sits outside the school, making a list called “NEW ME.” 
SPEAK UP MORE 
LEARN TO DRIVE 
INVITE PEOPLE TO PARTY 
He thinks to himself for a moment and then adds a final item: BE LIKE DAD 
The bell rings and he heads into the imposing building. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
Ian walks into his classroom. 
TEACHER 
Okay, class, sit down. We’re 
starting roll. 
GORGAMON, a slobby, flip-flop-wearing troll, has his feet on Ian’s chair. 
IAN 
Hey, uh, Gorgamon... um, would you 
mind not putting your feet on my 
chair today? 
GORGAMON 
Sorry dude, gotta keep ’em 
elevated. Gets the blood flowing to 
my brain. 
IAN 
It just makes it a little hard for 
me to fit in there-- 
GORGAMON 
Well if I don’t have good blood 
flow, I can’t concentrate on my 
school work. You don’t want me to 
do bad school, do you? 
Uh... no. 
IAN 
GORGAMON 
Thanks, bro. 
Ian sits, scooting up to make room for the gross feet. ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 15. 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER 
A GOBLIN TEACHER stands next to a student driver car. 
DRIVING INSTRUCTOR 
First road test, any volunteers? 
A single hand raises from the back of a group of students. The crowd parts to reveal a nervous Ian. 
INT. DRIVER’S ED CAR - DAY 
Ian drives. The Driving Instructor sits in the passenger seat. Two other kids are in the backseat. 
DRIVING INSTRUCTOR 
A left here. 
Ian signals and turns. 
DRIVING INSTRUCTOR 
Now take this on-ramp to the 
freeway. 
IAN 
(lacking confidence) 
Okay, yeah. I’m super ready for 
that. 
Ian’s smile fades as he nears the ZOOMING freeway traffic. 
IAN 
(unconvincing) 
It’s nice and fast. 
DRIVING INSTRUCTOR 
Just merge into traffic. 
IAN 
Yup, just any minute... 
He grows more nervous. 
DRIVING INSTRUCTOR 
Merge into traffic! 
Uh... 
IAN 
DRIVING INSTRUCTOR 
MERGE INTO TRAFFIC! 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 16. 
Panicked, Ian tries to merge. A car lays on its horn and Ian retreats back into his lane. 
IAN 
I’m not ready! 
Pull over. 
DRIVING INSTRUCTOR 
Ian pulls the car off the freeway. 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Students are hanging out in front of the school, including four friendly TEENS: SADALIA, GURGE, PARTHENOPE, and ALTHEA. 
SADALIA 
Alright, so what should we do this 
weekend? 
GURGE 
Move to a cooler town? 
We see Ian nearby, alone, rehearsing some lines to himself. 
IAN 
Oh, hey! What’s up, dudes? I’m, uh, 
having a party tonight, and was 
wondering if you wanted to come 
over and get down on some cake... 
Ian's smile drops. Ian checks the writing on his hand. 
IAN 
That’s not something anyone says. 
Okay, don't say dudes. ...Gang? 
"What's up, gang?" 
He crosses out “dudes” and changes it to “gang.” 
IAN 
What’s up, gang?! 
Ian nods, then nervously heads over to the TEENS. 
IAN 
Hey, what’s up, gang? 
The teens turn to Ian. 
SADALIA 
Oh, hey... Ian, right? 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 17. 
IAN 
(surprised) 
Oh, I didn’t know you knew my... 
Ian looks at his hand. The writing is smeared and sweaty. 
IAN 
Uhhh, anyway... if you like 
parties, then I was gonna do a 
party. 
What? 
SADALIA IAN 
What I was trying to say, is if 
you’re not doing anything tonight-- 
but I’m sure you probably are doing 
something tonight--and you like 
cake like I like cake, I’ve got a 
cake... at my house. 
The teens look at each other. 
SADALIA 
Are you inviting us to a party? 
IAN 
That’s the one. 
SADALIA 
Oh, yeah! We don’t have any plans. 
The others all agree. Ian looks up, surprised. 
IAN 
Really? I guess we can just take 
the bus over to my house-- 
Ian is suddenly distracted by metal music in the near distance, a hard-working engine, a backfire. The teens look over as a disaster of a van pulls up, its side painted with a rearing Pegasus surrounded by lightning bolts. 
IAN 
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
It’s Barley. He spots Ian and sticks his head out the window. 
BARLEY 
Ha-ha! Is that the birthday boy I 
see?! 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 18. 
Ian cringes. The van swerves into the school pickup area, and comes to a stop halfway up onto the curb. Barley steps out, in full fantasy garb, and gestures grandly. 
BARLEY 
Behold! Your chariot awaits! 
The group looks at Ian. Ian keeps his back turned to the van. 
ALTHEA 
Do you know that guy? 
Uh... 
IAN 
BARLEY 
Sir Iandore of Lightfoot! 
ALTHEA 
Seems like he’s talking to you. 
HEY, IAN! 
BARLEY 
Barley honks the horn. Ian turns around sheepishly. 
IAN 
Hey, Barley... Yeah, we’re actually 
gonna take the bus... 
BARLEY 
The bus?! Nay! I will give you and 
your companions transport upon 
Guinevere! 
PARTHENOPE 
Um, who’s Guinevere? 
BARLEY 
My mighty steed! 
Barley slaps the hood of the van. The bumper falls off. 
BARLEY 
Oops, that’s embarrassing! That’s 
okay, girl. We’ll patch you back 
up. 
Barley bends to reattach the bumper with duct tape, revealing his butt crack. Ian puts his hand to his face, embarrassed. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 19. 
IAN 
Ugh...(to teens) 
He’s just joking around. 
Ian removes his hand to reveal the ink from his palm is now on his face. 
SADALIA 
You’ve got something on your face. 
Ian wipes his cheek, smearing ink there. 
SADALIA 
Oh no, you just--oh! Right. 
Ian wipes the other side spreading more ink around. 
SADALIA 
No, it’s--nope. 
Ian looks at his hand, then panics. 
IAN 
Oh! Uh... You know what? I just 
remembered that my birthday is, 
uh... cancelled. 
What? 
ALTHEA IAN 
I mean, the party. It was never 
actually happening. It was just 
this huge misunderstanding, so I 
gotta go. Okay, Bye! 
Ian races into Barley’s van. 
INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS 
A pile of parking tickets clutter the passenger seat. 
BARLEY 
Ooh, whoops! Sorry! Let me just 
file those. 
Barley shoves the parking tickets into the glovebox, then notices the smeared letters on Ian’s forehead. 
BARLEY 
Hey! Did those kids write on your 
face? 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 20. 
Barley licks his thumb and starts to rub Ian’s forehead. 
BARLEY 
Here, I’ll get it. 
Ian pushes Barley’s hand away. 
IAN 
Can we please just go home? 
BARLEY 
Okay, we'll perform your birthday 
ceremony later. Then you’ll be 
ready for adulthood and it’s 
gauntlet of challenges! You know in 
ancient times, you celebrated your 
day of birth with a solemn quest. 
Ian looks at the cartoon dragon on the side of the gym, giving an exaggerated thumbs up. Ian slumps in his seat. 
INT. LIGHTFOOT HOUSE - DAY 
Ian enters the house, defeated. 
Mom? 
No answer. 
IAN 
INT. IAN’S ROOM - EVENING 
Ian sits at his desk, looks at his “NEW ME” list, and crosses off SPEAK UP MORE, LEARN TO DRIVE, INVITE PEOPLE TO PARTY. He pauses, then crosses off the last item: BE LIKE DAD. 
Ian crumples the list and throws it in his waste basket. 
He leans back in his chair and looks at the photos on his bulletin board. 
A photo of WILDEN LIGHTFOOT, Ian’s Dad, with three-year-old Barley and pregnant Laurel. 
A photo of Laurel, toddler Barley, and baby Ian. No Dad. 
Ian opens his drawer and pulls out a tape labeled: DAD. He puts it into a stereo on his desk and presses play. We hear timeworn audio of a man and woman in conversation.

Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 21. 
LAUREL 
Will, you’re not gonna get that 
thing working. 
DAD 
I think I’ve got it. 
LAUREL 
I’m gonna watch from over here when 
it blows up. 
Laurel moves out of range of the microphone. We only hear Dad, then pauses for Laurel’s distant, indecipherable words. 
DAD 
(into mic) 
Hello? Hello? 
LAUREL 
I’ll bet good money you can’t get 
it to work. 
DAD 
Oh, is that right? 
LAUREL 
Yup. But you’re doing a good job of 
making it look like you know what 
you’re doing. 
DAD 
Well, I’m trying to. 
(laugh) 
LAUREL 
Did you check if it had batteries? 
DAD 
(laugh) 
LAUREL 
No, I’m serious. 
I know.

Well, let’s find out.

Okay. Bye.

Ian smiles, rewinds the tape, and plays it again.

Will, you’re not gonna get that 
thing working. 
DAD 
I think I’ve got it. 
LAUREL 
I’m gonna watch from over here when 
it blows up. 
Hi, Dad. 
IAN 
We see close-ups of the pictures on the bulletin board as Ian begins to talk over the tape, forming a conversation. 
DAD 
Hello? Hello? 
IAN 
It’s me, Ian. 
DAD 
Oh, is that right? 
IAN 
Yeah. Did you have a good day? 
DAD 
Well, I’m trying to. 
IAN 
Yeah, me too. Although, I could 
clearly use some help. 
DAD 
(laugh) 
IAN 
I sure do wish I could spend a day 
with you sometime. 
I know. 
DAD IAN 
Yeah, there’s so many things we 
could do, I bet it’d be really fun! 
DAD 
Well, let’s find out.

IAN 
Yeah, I mean, I’d love to! We 
could, uh--

DAD IAN 
Yeah... Bye. 
The tape stops. Ian sits back, deflated. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Laurel steps on a pewter warrior figure on the ground. 
AH! MY--! 
LAUREL 
She opens the basement door and calls to Barley over the din of his music. 
LAUREL 
Barley, keep your soldiers off my 
land or our kingdoms will go to 
war! 
BARLEY (O.S.) 
Sorry, Mom! 
LAUREL 
Ugh, this is the world’s longest 
gap year. 
Laurel sees Ian on the couch, sewing his sweater. 
LAUREL 
Honey, I was gonna do that. 
IAN 
That’s okay. 
Laurel watches him. 
LAUREL 
Wow, you must have been taught by 
some kind of sewing master. 
IAN 
Yeah, a very humble sewing master. 
Ian finishes sewing. He holds out the thread and Laurel cuts it with the scissors. They’ve clearly done this a lot.

Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 24. 
Ian rubs his fingers over the word stitched on the breast of the hoodie: “LIGHTFOOT.” 
IAN 
What was Dad like when he was my 
age? Was he always super confident? 
LAUREL 
Oh, no. It took him a while to find 
out who he was. 
IAN 
I wish I’d met him. 
LAUREL 
Oh, me too. But hey, you know, when 
your dad got sick, he fought so 
hard... because he wanted to meet 
you more than anything. 
Laurel watches Ian, heartbroken. 
LAUREL 
You know what, I have something for 
you. I was going to wait until 
after cake but... I think you’ve 
waited long enough. 
IAN 
What is it? 
LAUREL 
It’s a gift... from your dad. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Laurel pulls down the attic ladder and climbs into the darkness. Ian comes up the stairs with Barley. 
BARLEY 
What do you mean it’s from Dad? 
IAN 
I don’t know! Mom said it was for 
both of us. 
BARLEY 
What is it?! 
Laurel descends the ladder with a long, canvas-wrapped item. ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

LAUREL 
He just said to give you this when 
you were both over sixteen. I have 
no idea what it is. 
INT. IAN’S ROOM - DAY 
Ian and Barley set the gift on Ian’s bed. Ian pulls back the cloth to reveal a long, skinny, gnarled piece of wood. 
NO WAY! 
BARLEY 
Barley picks it up in amazement. 
BARLEY 
It’s a wizard staff! DAD WAS A 
WIZARD! 
What? 
IAN 
LAUREL 
Hold on, your Dad was an 
accountant. I mean, he got 
interested in a lot of strange 
things when he got sick but-- 
Laurel and Ian are confused. Ian looks back under the cloth and sees a rolled up piece of parchment. 
IAN 
There’s a letter. 
(reading) 
“Dear Ian and Barley: Long ago, the 
world was full of wonder! It was 
adventurous, exciting, and best of 
all… there was magic. And that 
magic helped all in need. But it 
wasn’t easy to master. And so the 
world found a simpler way to get 
by. Over time, magic faded away, 
but I hope there’s a little magic 
left… in you. And so I wrote this 
spell so I could see for myself, 
who my boys grew up to be.” 
Ian looks at the second page of the letter. 
IAN 
Visitation Spell?

Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 26. 
Barley takes the page from Ian and examines it. It reads VISITATION SPELL and has a diagram of a wizard staff with a beam of light shooting from it, forming a person. 
BARLEY 
I don't believe this. 
(excited) 
This spell brings him back. For one 
whole day, Dad will be back! 
What? 
LAUREL IAN 
Back?! Like back to life? That’s 
not possible. 
BARLEY 
(holding up staff) 
It is with this. 
IAN 
I’m gonna meet Dad? 
Laurel grabs the letter from the boys. She’s beside herself. 
LAUREL 
Oh, Will, you wonderful nut, what 
is this?! 
Barley digs through the cloth. 
BARLEY 
Now, a spell this powerful needs an 
assist element. For this to work 
Dad would’ve had to find a... 
(finding gem) 
Phoenix Gem! 
Barley pulls out an orange gem and exams it. 
BARLEY 
Wow. There’s only a few of these 
left. 
LAUREL 
Hold on, is this dangerous? 
BARLEY 
We’re about to find out. 
Barley puts the gem in the staff, holds out the staff, and gets suddenly serious. Everyone waits in suspense.

Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 27. 
Ah! 
What?! 
Splinter. 
BARLEY LAUREL BARLEY 
Barley grabs the staff, strikes a pose in the center of the room, and begins to read the spell. 
BARLEY 
"Only once is all we get, grant me 
this rebirth. 'Til tomorrow's sun 
has set, one day to walk the 
earth!” 
But nothing happens. 
BARLEY 
Hold on, I was just gripping it 
wrong. 
Barley adjusts his hands. 
BARLEY 
Only once is all we get, grant me 
this rebirth, ‘til tomorrow’s sun 
has set, one day to walk THE EARTH! 
Still nothing. 
In quick cuts, Barley tries again and again, with no success. 
BARLEY 
Only once is all we get, grant me 
this rebirth. 
He tries again. 
BARLEY 
‘Til tomorrow’s sun has set... 
And again. 
BARLEY 
...one day to walk THE EARTH! 
And again, exhausted. 
BARLEY 
One day to walk the earth! 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 28. 
Losing his patience. 
BARLEY 
‘Til tomorrow’s sun has set... 
Again, frustrated. 
BARLEY 
One day to walk the earth! 
With everything he has left. 
BARLEY 
...One day... to walk... the earth! 
One more big attempt. 
BARLEY 
‘Til tomorrow’s sun has set... 
Laurel and Ian have already given up. 
BARLEY 
One day to walk the earth! 
LAUREL 
(gentle) 
Barley. 
He looks back to her, then puts the staff down and sits on the bed. Laurel puts her hand on Barley’s shoulder. All three of them are heartbroken. 
LAUREL 
I'm sorry you guys don't have your 
Dad here, but this shows just how 
much he wanted to see you both. So 
much that he’d try anything. That’s 
still a pretty special gift. 
Yeah. 
Barley leaves. 
IAN 
LAUREL 
(to Ian) 
Hey, want to come with me to pick 
up your cake? 
IAN 
That's okay. Thanks, Mom. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 29. 
As Laurel gets to the door, she looks back at Ian with a sad smile, then leaves. Ian sits on his bed, crestfallen. 
INT. IAN’S BEDROOM - EVENING 
Ian at his desk, looking at all the pictures of Dad on his bulletin board. He examines Dad’s spell, reading it aloud. 
IAN 
Only once is all we get, grant me 
this rebirth... 
Suddenly, an orange light glows on Ian’s face. He turns to see the Phoenix Gem is glowing. He looks back at the spell. 
IAN 
'Til tomorrow’s sun has set... 
The gem glows brighter. Objects in the room raise from the ground. The staff shakes and starts to fall. 
As Ian catches it, the staff lights up. He tightens his grip and reads louder. 
IAN 
One day to walk the earth! 
A beam of light shoots from the staff. Ian holds on with all his might as objects in the room swirl around him. 
Barley opens the door. 
BARLEY 
Hey man, what are you doing in 
here?(startled) 
Holy Tooth of Zadar! How did you--? 
IAN 
I don’t know, it just started! 
Blazey pokes her head in the door but quickly runs away. 
Ian strains to hold the staff. The light from the staff conjures a pair of shoes. 
BARLEY 
Whoa, feet! 
Above the shoes, bright purple socks appear. Then pant cuffs, pant legs, a belt, a shirt, one button at a time... 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 30. 
The gem slowly lifts out of the staff and spins. An ominous red light swells from the gem, overpowering Ian. 
Dad’s body recedes to the waist. Ian braces with all he has. 
BARLEY 
Hang on, I can help! 
Barley reaches for the staff. Ian pulls away from Barley. 
IAN 
BARLEY, NO! 
The red swell explodes. The gem BURSTS into pieces. 
EXT. LIGHTFOOT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
The window of Ian’s room blasts out. 
INT. LIGHTFOOT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Barley helps Ian up. Ian looks around, desperate. There’s no sign of dad in the empty, disheveled room. 
Suddenly there’s a rustling in the closet. The boys perk up. A pair of legs in khaki pants and dress shoes clumsily begin to kick their way out from behind the clothes. 
Dad? 
IAN 
The legs stand to reveal... they have no torso. 
AH! 
IAN 
BARLEY 
AH! He’s just legs! 
Ian and Barley cautiously approach the living pants as Dad’s feet begin to feel their way around the space. 
BARLEY 
There’s no top part. I definitely 
remember Dad having a top part! 
IAN 
Oh, what did I do? This is 
horrible! 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 31. 
The pants start to make their way toward Ian and Barley. Ian calms himself, then approaches Dad’s pants. He reaches out, waving his hand through Dad’s missing torso. 
Hello? 
IAN 
Dad begins to feel around with his foot and walk blindly. 
BARLEY 
It’s really him. 
(beat) 
DAD! You are in your house! 
Dad bumps into a dresser and falls. The boys race over to help him up. 
IAN 
Whoa, whoa! 
Oh boy! 
BARLEY IAN 
Ah, he can’t hear us. 
Barley thinks, then walks over and taps on Dad’s foot: Shave and a Haircut. 
IAN 
What are you doing? 
Dad’s legs suddenly leap back with emotion - as much emotion as legs can have. He stomps the final two beats of the song. 
Dad touches Barley’s feet with his foot, patting gently. 
BARLEY 
That’s right Dad. It’s me, Barley. 
Dad feels around, finds Ian’s foot, and does the same. 
BARLEY 
Yeah, that’s Ian. 
Hi... Dad. 
IAN 
This lands on Ian, and he puts his hand delicately on Dad’s foot. It’s the closest they can get to a hug. 
IAN 
Oh... I messed this whole thing up 
and now he’s gonna be legs forever! 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 32. 
BARLEY 
Well, not... forever. The spell 
only lasts one day. At sunset 
tomorrow, he’ll disappear and we’ll 
never be able to bring him back 
again. 
Barley points to the spell, illustrations of the sun setting and the man vanishing. 
IAN 
Okay, okay, okay. Twenty-Four 
hours...that doesn't give us much 
time, but-- 
Ian looks at his phone, broken in the chaos. He chucks it on his bed and sets his watch. Twenty-four hours counting down. 
IAN 
Well, we’ll just have to do the 
spell again. 
BARLEY 
You mean you have to. 
(beat) 
A person can only do magic if they 
have the gift. And my little 
brother has the magic gift! 
Barley pulls Ian into a playful headlock. Ian pushes away. 
IAN 
But I couldn’t even finish the 
spell. 
BARLEY 
Well, you're gonna have plenty of 
time to practice. Because we have 
to find another Phoenix Gem. 
Barley gets an idea. He flips through his Quests of Yore cards then holds one up to Ian. It shows an old pub: THE MANTICORE’S TAVERN. 
BARLEY 
Ah-ha! We’ll start at the place 
where all quests begin. The 
Manticore’s Tavern! 
Then another card: THE MANTICORE, a fearsome winged beast. ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 33. 
BARLEY 
It’s run by a fearless adventurer. 
She knows where to find any kind of 
gem, talisman, totem... 
IAN 
Barley, this is for a game. 
BARLEY 
Based on real life! 
IAN 
But, how do we know this tavern is 
still there? 
BARLEY 
It’s there. Look, my years of 
training have prepared me for this 
very moment. And I’m telling you... 
this is the only way to find a 
Phoenix Gem. 
Barley holds up a card featuring THE PHOENIX GEM. 
Trust me. 
BARLEY 
Ian looks longingly at Dad. 
IAN 
Whatever it takes, I am gonna meet 
my dad. 
BARLEY 
You hear that, Dad? We’re going on 
a quest! 
EXT. BARLEY’S VAN - SUNSET 
Ian slams his door. Barley slams his door. 
INT. BARLEY’S VAN - CONTINUOUS 
Seatbelt on, keys in the ignition, the gears grind. 
BARLEY 
(straining) 
Come on, Guinevere... 
IAN 
Uh... Maybe we should just take the 
bus. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 34. 
BARLEY 
She’s fine. 
The van starts. Barley grabs a cassette tape labeled “QUEST MIX” and pops it in the stereo. Sweeping fantasy music plays. 
H’YAH! 
BARLEY 
The van backfires and spits black smoke as it heads away from the cookie cutter suburban homes, toward the fantastical purple mountains in the distance. 
EXT. SUBURBAN FANTASY TOWN - NIGHT - MONTAGE 
The van travels past a road sign: “Leaving New Mushroomton.” The van passes through a TROLL BOOTH. 
INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS 
Ian sits in the back, talking to Dad’s legs, working on something we can’t quite see. 
IAN 
Anyway, it’s like this award for 
math, it’s no big deal. But I’ll 
show you when we get back home. 
Barley looks in the rearview mirror. 
BARLEY 
Hey, what are you two Chatty 
Charlies up to back there? 
IAN 
You know, I felt weird talking to 
Dad without a top half, so... 
Ian picks something up and puts it on Dad, he steps aside to reveal it’s a top half made out of stuffed clothes. 
...Ta-da! 
IAN 
BARLEY 
Oh! That’s great! Dad, you look 
just like I remember. 
Dad starts to wander toward the front seat. ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 35. 
BARLEY 
Hey, don’t worry, we’ll have the 
rest of you here before you know 
it. And then, first thing I’m gonna 
do: introduce you to Guinevere. 
Rebuilt this old girl myself, from 
the lug nuts to the air 
conditioning. 
Barley flips on the air conditioning. It BLASTS like a leaf blower. Ian fights against the wind to turn it off. 
IAN 
Showing Dad your van? That’s your 
whole list? 
What list? Oh... 
BARLEY IAN 
BARLEY 
What’s that? 
IAN 
(a little embarrassed) 
I’m just working on a list of 
things I wanted to do with Dad. You 
know, play catch, take a walk, 
driving lesson, share my whole life 
story with him. 
Barley nods, appreciative. 
BARLEY 
That’s cool. 
(beat) 
Oh, but before you cast Dad’s spell 
again, you’re gonna have to 
practice your magic. 
Barley tosses Ian the Quests of Yore book. 
IAN 
This book is for a game. 
BARLEY 
I told you, everything in Quests of 
Yore is historically accurate! Even 
the spells. So start practicing, 
young sorcerer! 
Barley hands Ian the staff. Ian opens the book. ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 36. 
IAN 
Okay, Dad. Let’s try some magic. 
INT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Laurel sees a note taped to Ian’s door: “Back soon with MIND BLOWING surprise!” along with a crude drawing of Laurel with a mushroom cloud blowing from the top of her head. 
She opens the door. 
INT. IAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Laurel GASPS. Ian’s bedroom looks like a bomb went off. 
She notices Ian’s broken phone on the bed. Then walks over to the Quests of Yore cards Barley laid out earlier: The Phoenix Gem and the Manticore’s Tavern. 
INT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT 
Laurel grabs her car keys off of the hook. 
EXT. LIGHTFOOT HOME - NIGHT 
She pulls out of the garage in her car. 
INT. LIGHTFOOT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Headlights shine on a pewter figurine on Barley’s game board: part lion, part bat, part scorpion: THE MANTICORE. 
EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT 
Barley’s van drives through a muddy back road. 
INT. VAN - NIGHT 
Ian points the staff at an empty soda can. 
IAN 
Aloft Elevar. 
Nothing happens. 
IAN 
Aloft Elevar. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 37. 
Still nothing. Ian turns to Barley, picks up the Quests of Yore book gestures to a levitation spell in it. 
IAN 
I can’t get this levitation spell 
to work. Maybe I should try 
something else, like... 
(flipping pages) 
Arcane Lightning? 
BARLEY 
Pfft, yeah, like a level one mage 
could bust out the hardest spell in 
the Enchanter’s Guide Book. 
(nerdy laugh) 
Maybe we’ll stick with the easy 
ones. 
IAN 
Yeah, well, it’s not working. Am I 
saying it wrong? 
BARLEY 
You said it right, it’s just for 
any spell to work you have to speak 
from your heart’s fire. 
My what? 
IAN 
BARLEY 
Your heart's fire, you must speak 
with passion, don’t hold back. 
Ian seems doubtful about this advice. 
IAN 
(trying harder) 
Aloft Elevar! 
Nothing. 
BARLEY 
No, like - Aloft Elevar! 
IAN 
(angry, louder) 
Aloft Elevar! 
BARLEY 
No, from your heart's fire! 
IAN 
ALOFT ELEVAR!

BARLEY 
DON’T HOLD BACK! 
IAN 
ALOFT ELEVAR! 
BARLEY 
HEART'S FIRE! 
Ian tosses the staff in frustration. 
IAN 
STOP SAYING HEARTS FIRE! This just 
clearly isn’t working! 
Ian sits defeated next to Dad. 
BARLEY 
Hey, it was a good start. 
Ian stares at the Visitation spell, then looks to Dad, disappointed in himself. 
BARLEY 
Oh! Gather your courage, we’ve 
arrived. The Manticore’s Tavern. 
Ian looks out the window to see an old tavern, just like the one on the Quests of Yore card. 
IAN 
Wow, it is still here. 
BARLEY 
Yeah! I told you. 
EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT 
Ian and Barley approach the tavern. Ian has to tug on Dad's leash to keep him moving in the right direction. 
IAN 
Come on, Dad! That’s good. 
They approach the ominous entrance, with a carving of the Manticore’s fearsome face above the door. 
BARLEY 
Alright, listen, first: let me do 
the talking.(MORE) 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 39. 
BARLEY (CONT'D) 
Secondly, it’s crucial we show the 
fearless Manticore the respect she 
deserves or she will thirdly, not 
give us a map to a Phoenix Gem. 
IAN 
Whoa, whoa, wait, the map?! I 
thought she had a Phoenix Gem? 
BARLEY 
(nerd laugh) 
You're so cute. 
(to Dad) 
Hear that, Dad? He’s a smart kid, 
he just doesn’t know how quests 
work. 
IAN 
Well, is there anything else you're 
forgetting to tell me? 
Nope. 
BARLEY 
Barley pushes open the door. 
INT. MANTICORE’S TAVERN - NIGHT 
The place is a ridiculous family restaurant, just full frontal Fuddruckers. A large table of revelers sing along with the waitstaff, around a birthday cake. 
WAITERS 
(singing) 
Happy happy birthday, 
Come join us on our quest, 
To make your birthday party, 
The very, very best! HEY! 
Ian looks at Barley, losing faith in his brother. 
BARLEY 
Okay, okay, so the tavern changed a 
little over the years, but the 
Manticore is still the real deal. 
Ian and Barley walk through the restaurant, taking it all in. A TAVERN WAITRESS takes an order at a nearby table. 
TAVERN PATRON 
I’ll have the soup of the day.

TAVERN WAITRESS 
Would m’lord like a Cup or 
Cauldron? 
An elf kid plays a claw drop game with a gauntlet hand picking up treasure. He loses. 
Barley marches up a Hostess. 
BARLEY 
Madame, I request an audience... 
(bowing) 
...with the Manticore! 
HOSTESS 
But of course, m’lord. 
The Hostess blows into a fake horn. 
HOSTESS 
Oh, Manticore! 
A plush COSTUMED MANTICORE leaps into frame. Adorable and silly, it lets out a CHUCKLE and hugs Ian. Barley pushes the Costumed Manticore away from Ian, irritated. 
BARLEY 
No, no, no, no no! The real 
Manticore! The fearless adventurer! 
The costumed Manticore rubs its eyes like it’s crying. 
HOSTESS 
Oh, you mean Corey? She’s over 
there. 
The hostess gestures toward the kitchen. 
INT. MANTICORE’S TAVERN - NIGHT 
The kitchen doors burst open as a frantic Manticore struggles to balance plates. No longer a fearless adventurer, she wears a restaurant uniform, glasses, and a wrist brace. 
MANTICORE 
QUICK, SOMEBODY HELP ME! These 
griffin nuggets were supposed to go 
out minutes ago! 
Waiters rushes in and she scrambles to offload the plates. 
IAN 
That's the Manticore? 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 41. 
Barley leaps forward and takes a knee. 
BARLEY 
Oh, great and powerful Manticore! 
MANTICORE 
Whoah, sir! You’re right in the hot 
zone. 
A GOBLIN COOK passes by her. 
MANTICORE 
You’re late, Adolphus. 
ADOLPHUS 
(goblin language) 
MANTICORE 
I understand there’s traffic, you 
need to plan for that! 
The goblin heads onto the floor for his shift. 
ADOLPHUS 
(goblin language) 
MANTICORE 
Well maybe your mother should get 
her own car! 
BARLEY 
Your fearlessness? 
The Manticore turns toward the boys, startled. 
AHH! 
MANTICORE BARLEY 
My brother and I seek a map... to a 
Phoenix Gem. 
MANTICORE 
Oh, uh, well you've come to the 
right tavern. 
(aside to waiter, handing 
off plate) 
Table 12. 
She quickly races to a host podium and digs around. 
MANTICORE 
I have the parchment you desire 
right here! BEHOLD!

Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 42. 
She presents them with a children’s menu that says “FIND THE PHOENIX GEM!” above a variety of puzzles. 
IAN 
Oh... that’s a children’s menu. 
MANTICORE 
Isn’t that fun? They’re all based 
on my old maps. 
(quick, formal) 
Oh, uh, “The great Manticore sends 
you on your adventure with a hero’s 
blessing.” And here’s some crayons. 
She hurries off, but Barley follows reverently. 
BARLEY 
That’s very amusing your dominance, 
but might you have the real map? 
The Manticore points to a wall of swords, shields, scrolls. 
MANTICORE 
Uh... yeah, it's over there. 
Ian points to a map on the wall with the title: PHOENIX GEM. 
That's it! 
IAN 
BARLEY 
This is perfect! 
Barley reaches for the scroll, but the Manticore grabs it. 
MANTICORE 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you 
doing? You can’t take this. 
BARLEY 
We have to. 
Barley removes Dad’s torso to reveal he’s just legs. The Manticore looks aghast, unsure what she’s seeing. 
MANTICORE 
What is that? 
The Manticore Mascot walks past and sees the legs. Stunned, the mascot bumps into a serving tray and FALLS to the ground. 
IAN 
It’s our dad, and we have a chance 
to meet him, but-- 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 43. 
Barley steps in front of Ian, taking over. 
BARLEY 
Buuuut... we can’t do that without 
a Phoenix Gem. 
The Manticore considers this. 
MANTICORE 
No! My days of sending people on 
dangerous quests are over. 
What? Why? 
BARLEY 
MANTICORE 
Uh, cause they’re dangerous! 
The HOSTESS pops around the corner. 
HOSTESS 
Corey, the karaoke machine is 
broken again. 
The Manticore sees a group of female fantasy creatures in matching shirts surrounding a cyclops in a veil. 
MANTICORE 
(to the boys) 
I’m sorry, but you are not getting 
this map. 
INT. KARAOKE AREA - NIGHT 
The Manticore grovels to the bachelorette party. 
MANTICORE 
(worried, stressed) 
Don’t worry, ladies, your adventure 
will continue momentarily! 
BARLEY 
(to Ian) 
Okay, I can handle this. 
Ian pushes past Barley to approach the Manticore. 
No, Ian!

MANTICORE 
Kid, this is not a good time. 
The karaoke machine lets out a squall of feedback. 
BRIDESMAID #1 
I’m giving this place a one-star 
review! 
IAN 
It’s just, I’ve never met my Dad 
and-- 
MANTICORE 
Look, I’m sorry about that, but if 
you get hurt on one of my quests 
guess who gets sued and loses her 
tavern? I can’t take that kind of 
risk! Now if you’ll just excuse me 
I have important things to do! 
(into mic) 
Testing. 
(singing) 
You haunt my dreams, my in betweens... 
Ian looks at Dad’s purple socks. He steps up. 
IAN 
Please, we need that map! 
MANTICORE 
No, I am not giving you the map! 
That's it! I’m done talking! 
Ian stands up straight and looks determined. 
IAN 
Well... well, I’m not! 
BARLEY 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
The Manticore looks up, surprised. Barley looks at Ian, equally surprised.

IAN 
You say you can’t “risk” losing 
this place? Look at that Manticore! 
Ian points to a heroic painting of the warrior Manticore. 
IAN 
She looks like she lived to take 
risks! 
MANTICORE 
That Manticore didn't have 
investors to look out for. She 
didn't have payroll to cover! 
The Manticore stands up, gesturing wildly. 
MANTICORE 
She could just fly out the door 
whenever she wanted and slay a 
magma beast. 
BRIDESMAID #2 
Are you gonna fix the machine or 
not? 
MANTICORE 
Yeah, in a minute! 
The startled bridesmaid backs off. 
MANTICORE 
Okay, maybe this place isn’t as 
adventurous as it used to be, so it 
isn’t filled with a motley horde 
willing to risk life and limb for 
the mere taste of excitement... 
A pathetic patron blows on his soup. 
MANTICORE 
...but so what?! Whoever said you 
have to take risks in life to have 
an adventure?! 
Ian nervously points behind the Manticore. 
IAN 
Apparently, you did. 
The Manticore looks at her portrait, Above it is a plaque: 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISKS IN LIFE TO HAVE AN 
ADVENTURE. - THE MANTICORE

The Manticore is speechless. 
A ROGUE WAITER walks up with a plate of mozzarella sticks. 
ROGUE WAITER 
Table 32 said their mozzarella 
sticks are cold. 
The Manticore breathes fire on the mozzarella sticks. Terrified, the waiter scuttles away. 
MANTICORE 
What have I done? 
IAN 
Well, it’s not too late. I mean, 
you could just give us the map-- 
MANTICORE 
This place used to be dangerous-- 
The Chuck E. Cheese-style Manticore mascot stands behind the real Manticore and begins to imitate her movements. 
Dangerous!

COSTUMED MANTICORE 
Dangerous and wild! 
The Manticore stares daggers at the mascot moving behind her. She tackles it, rips off its foam head, and holds it up proudly with a mighty roar. 
MANTICORE 
I’m living a lie -- WHAT HAVE I 
BECOME?! 
She torches the mascot head. Parents cover a child’s eyes. 
Oh no... 
BARLEY 
The Manticore throws the smoldering, melting mascot head and it lands on a table between two customers.

MANTICORE 
Everybody out! This tavern is 
closed for remodeling! 
The mascot head ignites a banner that burns into the rafters. 
INT. MANTICORE’S TAVERN - NIGHT 
Patrons watch in terror as the fire spreads. Kids are grabbed and hurried out the doors by their terrified parents. One kid is torn away from coloring her children’s menu. 
EXT. MANTICORE’S TAVERN FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
Terrified patrons stream from the blazing building. 
INT. MANTICORE’S TAVERN - NIGHT 
The Manticore has completely lost it. 
MANTICORE 
Sorry, the karaoke machine is 
broken! 
Manticore throws the karaoke machine against the wall knocking away the dry wall and revealing the stone beneath. 
The Manticore picks up a cardboard standee of herself and throws it to the ground with a yell. She throws the Phoenix Gem map with it. 
Ian watches in horror as the map catches fire. He races to the map, but it’s too late. All that’s left is ashes. 
IAN 
No, no, no, no! No! ...No. 
A beam falls behind them. 
BARLEY 
We gotta go! 
They race through the restaurant, arm-in-arm with Dad, his torso detaches. His legs runs in the wrong direction, bump into a wall, and fall to the ground. 
Ian realizes they’ve lost Dad. He turns and sees Dad 
struggling to stand. The roof above suddenly buckles. The wooden beams CRASH down, headed right for Dad. 
Without a thought, Ian lifts the staff and calls out. ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 48. 
IAN 
ALOFT ELEVAR! 
A blast of light from the staff freezes the wooden beam in mid-air, mere inches from Dad. Ian strains to hold the spell. 
Barley rushes in and grabs Dad, pulling him to safety. Ian releases the spell and the beam CRASHES to the ground. Barley, Ian, and Dad flee from the burning tavern. 
EXT. MANTICORE’S TAVERN - NIGHT 
The van pulls away, past approaching fire trucks. 
INT. VAN - NIGHT 
BARLEY 
Ha-ha! That was unbelievable. You 
were just like... 
(magic sounds) 
And the beam was just floatin' 
there! My brother is a wizard! 
IAN 
I can’t believe that worked. 
BARLEY 
Oh, you’re gonna nail Dad’s spell 
now. 
IAN 
Except we don’t have a map. 
BARLEY 
But we've got this! BEHOLD! 
Barley reveals a kids’ menu he grabbed. Ian sighs. 
BARLEY 
Look, on a quest, you have to use 
what you've got. And this is what 
we've got! 
Barley points to a crayon signature that reads: “KAYLA" 
BARLEY 
Best part is, little Kayla already 
solved the puzzle. 
Ian takes the menu. The puzzle has been solved in crayon. ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

IAN 
Well, according to Kayla, we just 
have to look for “Raven’s Point.” 
Something dawns on him. Ian reaches down and takes out a map. 
IAN 
Raven’s Point... Raven’s Point... 
He slams a roadmap down on the dash and points to a mountain labeled: RAVEN’S POINT. 
IAN 
Raven’s Point! 
BARLEY 
Yes! The gem must be in the 
mountain. We can be there by 
tomorrow morning. 
IAN 
Tomorrow morning? 
BARLEY 
That still gives us plenty of time 
with Dad. 
Ian looks at Dad, disappointed. 
Yeah. 
IAN 
The van comes to a stop at a red light. 
Ian traces a route with his finger, right to Raven’s Point. 
IAN 
Well, it looks like the expressway 
should take us right there. 
BARLEY 
Eh, expressway is a little too 
obvious. On a quest, the clear path 
is never the right one-- 
What? 
IAN 
BARLEY 
During one Quests of Yore campaign, 
Shrub Rosehammer and I took the 
easy route... led him straight into 
the belly of a gelatinous cube.

BARLEY (CONT'D) 
Only reason I didn’t suffer the 
same fate? 
(slaps gut) 
I followed my gut. 
Barley highlights barely-perceptible road on the map. 
BARLEY 
And it’s telling me we take an 
ancient trail called the Path of 
Peril. 
IAN 
But the expressway is faster. 
BARLEY 
Maybe not in the long run. 
IAN 
I know you want this to be like one 
of your adventure games, but all 
that matters is that we get to 
spend as much time as possible with 
Dad. 
Dad breaks free from his seatbelt in back and wanders toward the front of the van, leaving his top half behind. He taps his foot against Barley’s. Barley pats Dad’s foot and sighs. 
IAN 
So, we should just take the 
expressway.Right? 
BARLEY 
Yeah. You're right. 
(beat) 
But if you end up inside a 
gelatinous cube, you are on your 
own. 
Barley steers the van onto an onramp. 
EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT 
Just then, Laurel’s car drives under the onramp just under the van, heading in the opposite direction from the boys.

A phone call interrupts the GPS. It’s Colt. Laurel answers. 
Hey. 
LAUREL 
EXT. FRY FORTRESS - NIGHT 
Colt talks on the phone, carrying a bag of takeout. 
COLT 
I’m just checking in. Did you catch 
up to the boys yet? 
LAUREL 
No, not yet. But I’m a little 
worried because we had a weird 
family issue come up and, well, 
this just isn’t like Ian to run 
off.(beat) 
I mean, Barley, yes, but not Ian. 
COLT 
You know, it’s late, you shouldn’t 
have to be out looking for them. 
INT. LAUREL’S CAR - NIGHT 
LAUREL 
I know, it’s silly, I’m sure 
they’re both probably on fire... 
Laurel sees the Manticore’s Tavern burning to the ground. 
Fire?!

LAUREL 
FIRE! The place is on fire! My boys, oh no, I gotta go! 
Laurel!

Laurel gets out of the car and sees people from the tavern: ©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

The headless Manticore mascot, patting her smoking costume. 
COSTUMED MANTICORE 
Get it off, get it off, get it off! 
The bachelorette party, disheveled and crying. 
LAUREL 
Excuse me? Hello! Please, I’m 
looking for two teenage elves?! 
MANTICORE 
Okay, okay, I told you already, 
there were two teenage elves... 
LAUREL 
Oh! Those are my sons! Where did 
they go? 
The Manticore sits on the side of the curb, wrapped in a silver emergency blanket, holding a mug. 
MANTICORE 
Oh, they went on a quest to find a 
Phoenix Gem. But don’t worry, don’t 
worry. I told them about the map, 
and about the gem, and about the 
curse.(standing/dawning) 
I forgot to tell them about the 
curse! 
The what? Hoo boy... 
LAUREL 
OFFICER AVEL 
A police officer, OFFICER AVEL, leans in to talk to Laurel. 
OFFICER AVEL 
Listen, this one’s gone a little 
(whistle) 
MANTICORE 
Your boys are in grave danger! But 
I can help-- 
The Manticore starts to move toward Laurel. Officer Avel pulls the Manticore toward the police car. 
OFFICER AVEL 
Whoa, heyyy. You’re not going 
anywhere. We got questions for you.

MANTICORE 
(calling to Laurel) 
I know where they’re going! We can 
still save them! 
Laurel looks around, concerned. She’s sees a first aid kit in the back of an ambulance and gets an idea. 
EXT. TAVERN - MOMENTS LATER 
The Manticore talks with Officer Avel by a police car. 
MANTICORE 
Last name “Manticore.” First name, 
“The.” 
Laurel walks up to Officer Avel and the Manticore. 
LAUREL 
Hold on! You’re right, she has gone 
a little-- 
(whistle) 
It’s no wonder with a wound like 
that. 
Laurel points dramatically to a slight scrape on the 
Manticore’s leg. 
OFFICER AVEL 
That’s just a scratch. 
Laurel pulls out the Quests of Yore card about the Manticore and waves it around like it’s an official document. 
LAUREL 
Oh, I'm sorry, are you an expert on 
minotaurs? 
MANTICORE 
(correcting) 
Manticores. 
LAUREL 
--Manticores? 
Well, no.

I don’t think that’s true. 
LAUREL 
See! She’s already losing her grip 
on reality. So why don’t you let me 
save her life before it costs you 
yours? 
Officer Avel throws his hands in the air. 
Okay! 
OFFICER AVEL LAUREL 
Thank you! Could we have a little 
privacy here, please? 
Officer Avel steps away. 
LAUREL (O.S.) 
Just lie back. That’s good. 
OFFICER AVEL 
Just don’t take too long back 
there, okay? 
(beat) 
Hey, you hear me? 
Officer Avel turns and looks at the Manticore’s silhouette, then carefully walks back toward the police car. 
OFFICER AVEL 
I said, don’t take too long back 
there, because I-- 
As he gets closer, he sees the source of Manticore’s silhouette: The melted mascot head, propped up as a decoy. 
Ahh! 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
OFFICER AVEL 
Laurel’s car drives away, the back dragging sparks. 
INT. LAUREL’S CAR - NIGHT

MANTICORE 
Oooooh, I’m gonna like you! 
EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT 
The van passes through a city. 
INT. VAN - NIGHT 
Barley drives as Ian and Dad sit on bean bags in the back. Ian stares at the list he’s made. 
BARLEY 
Radio... headlights... brakes, 
tires, rims... I mean it’s hard to 
tell now, Dad, before I replaced 
her parts, Guinevere was actually 
kind of a piece of junk. 
Ian looks over at Dad and crosses things off his list. 
IAN 
Looks like we’re not gonna get to 
do everything today, Dad. But, 
that’s okay, I just wanna meet you. 
Dad rubs his foot against Ian’s. Ian smiles. 
IAN 
But don’t worry, we’ll have you 
fixed up and back home to see... 
(dawning) 
Oh man, Mom! Barley, we’re not 
going to be able to get Dad back in 
time to see Mom. 
BARLEY 
Oh...(beat) 
Well, Dad... at least you won’t 
have to meet the new guy. 
Barley puts his finger up to his face to create a mustache. 
BARLEY

there’s trouble, I gotta deal with

BARLEY 
Is that your Colt?! 
Yeah? 
IAN 
BARLEY 
You’re gonna wanna work on that. 
Suddenly the van begins to SPUTTER. 
BARLEY 
No, no, no, NO! Come on, old girl! 
Barley pulls the van off the expressway and lurches it to a stop on the side of the road. 
INT. VAN - NIGHT 
IAN 
I thought you said you fixed the 
van. 
BARLEY 
Relax, Guinevere is fine. Her 
stomach is just a little empty. 
Ian looks over at the gas gauge. The needle is on “F.” 
IAN 
But it says we have a full tank. 
BARLEY 
Oh, that doesn’t work. 
EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT 
Barley gets out, goes to the back of the van, pulls out a gas can, and shakes it next to his ear. 
BARLEY 
Only a few drops left. 
Ian gets out. Barley climbs on top of Guinevere.

BARLEY 
Maybe there’s a gas station... 
There’s nothing within sight. Ian looks at the staff. 
IAN 
Is there a magic way to get gas? 
BARLEY 
Oh! I like your thinking young 
mage. 
Barley scrambles down from the van and shows Ian a page in the spell book: an illustration of a wizard growing an apple to five times its size. 
BARLEY 
Growth Spell! We grow the can and 
then the gas inside will grow with 
it. 
IAN 
Uhh... that’s kind of a weird 
idea... 
BARLEY 
I know! I like it too! 
Ian mutters to himself as he holds the spell and the staff. 
IAN 
Okay, loosen up, heart’s fire. Here 
we go. 
BARLEY 
Whoa, it’s not that simple. 
(to Dad) 
This one learns a little magic and 
thinks he’s Shamblefoot the 
Wondrous, am I right, Dad? 
(to Ian) 
A growth spell is a bit more 
advanced. Not only do you have to 
speak from your heart's fire, but 
now you also have to follow a magic 
decree. 
IAN 
A magic what? 
Barley shows Ian the book. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL

BARLEY 
It's a special rule that keeps the 
spell working right. This one 
states: “To magnify an object, you 
have to magnify your attention upon 
it.”(beat) 
While you cast the spell, you can’t 
let anything distract you. 
Barley puts the gas can on the ground. Ian points the staff. 
IAN 
Okay...(exhale) 
Ow! 
What? 
BARLEY IAN 
Splinter! Can we sand this thing 
down? 
BARLEY 
No! It’s an ancient staff with 
magic in every glorious fiber, you can’t “sand it down.” 
IAN 
Alright, alright. Here we go. 
(sotto) 
Focus... 
Ian holds out the staff and tries to focus. 
Uh... 
BARLEY IAN 
Something wrong? 
BARLEY 
Sorry, it’s just, your stance is 
uh... Here. 
Barley poses Ian awkwardly, all over his personal space. 
BARLEY 
Chin up, elbows out, feet apart, 
back slightly arched... Okay, how’s 
that feel?

Okay! Okay. 
Barley tries to adjust Ian’s elbow one more time. Ian shoots him a look. Barley throws up his hands and steps back. 
Ian focuses hard and recites the spell. 
IAN 
Magnora Gantuan! 
The staff throws off violent, flashing sparks. Ian winces, but does his best to stay focused. The can begins to grow. 
BARLEY 
Don’t let the magic spook you. 
Okay. 
Elbows! 
What?! 
Elbows up! 
IAN 
BARLEY IAN 
BARLEY 
Ian lifts his elbows as high as possible. 
BARLEY 
No, no, no, too high. That’s too 
high. 
IAN 
I’m trying to focus here!

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! Focus on the 
can!

Ian lowers the staff, frustrated. 
BARLEY (O.S.) 
It worked! The can is huge! 
Ian looks down to see that Barley is now TINY. 
BARLEY 
And the van is huge! 
(to Ian) 
And you’re-- 
Barley looks at his tiny body. 
Oh, no... 
BARLEY IAN 
What happened? 
BARLEY 
Looks like you shrunk me. 
IAN 
Wha-- how?! 
BARLEY 
Well, if you mess up a spell, there 
are consequences. 
IAN 
I only messed up because you 
wouldn’t stop bothering me! 
BARLEY

As the boys argue, Dad taps Ian’s foot then searches for Barley. Dad taps Barley’s head, nearly stepping on him. 
BARLEY 
Whoa, ow! Dad, it’s me! 
Barley does “Shave and a Haircut” on Dad’s foot. Dad freaks out, recognizing him and reacting to his shrunken size. 
IAN 
Whoah, Dad, it’s okay, don’t worry, 
I’m going fix this! 
Ian grabs Dad’s leash and picks up the gas can. 
BARLEY 
Well, where are you going? 
IAN 
To find a gas station. 
BARLEY 
Well, I’m going too. 
Fine. 
IAN 
Ian tries to pick up Barley, but Barley refuses. 
BARLEY 
Hey, I don’t need your help! 
IAN 
Fine with me. 
Ian struggles to carry everything as Barley runs after Ian.

Ian with Dad. A tiny, shrunken Barley tries to keep up. 
BARLEY

I just need a little break. My baby 
legs can’t go that fast.

Oh, good. 
IAN 
BARLEY 
Oh wait, I forgot.

You don’t need my help. 
Ian drops Barley into his pocket and charges ahead. 
BARLEY 
Hey! I don’t need you to carry me! 
I’m a grown man! 
EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 
Ian approaches the gas station, Barley and Dad in tow. He walks past a gas pump. Dad searches the ground with his foot. 
IAN 
Dad, come on, it’s okay, Barley is 
with me. 
Barley looks at his reflection in the gas pump. 
BARLEY 
Yeah, I’m fine, Dad. The side 
effects are supposed to wear off 
eventually. Do I look any bigger 
yet? 
A group of loudly revving, seemingly unmanned motorcycles park in front of the gas station. Suddenly, a sprite in a leather jacket, DEWDROP, pops out from behind the bike. Other sprites appear. They were all collectively driving the bikes. 
They hop off and swagger into the gas station. 
An elf walks out of the gas station drinking a slushie. He unknowingly hits Dewdrop with the door on his way out. 
DEWDROP 
Hey! Did you just bump into me? 
GAS STATION VICTIM 
Oh, I’m terribly sorry, I didn’t 
see you there-- 
DEWDROP 
Do it again, and you’ll see me in 
your nightmares!

Ian slinks into the station, Dad in tow, Barley in pocket. 
Sprites climb the shelves, throw things to their cohorts, drink from the soda fountain. A sprite on the counter scratches a lotto ticket. Another throws money at the clerk. 
COBWEB 
Gimme a bag of Extra Sours. 
The clerk hands over a bag. 
COBWEB 
Keep the change. 
The sprites pass Ian, carrying a box of candy-filled straws. 
COBWEB 
Outta the way, beanstalk. 
Ian tries to keep a low profile as he talks to the CLERK. 
IAN 
Uh, ten on pump two, please. 
Barley leans out of Ian’s pocket, reaching for a bag of snacks, but knocks over the entire rack. 
IAN 
What are you doing?! 
BARLEY 
I’m getting us food. 
Ian pushes a few bags of cheese puffs forward. 
IAN 
Alright, I got it. And a couple of 
these, thank you. 
BARLEY 
Pssst! I have to go to the 
bathroom! 
IAN

The clerk hands them a bathroom key attached to a license plate. Ian takes Barley out of his pocket and gives him the key. Tiny Barley has to carry the key over his head. 
IAN 
Okay, be quick. I want to get out 
of here. 
BARLEY 
Okay, I’m going. 
Barley runs to the bathroom. Dad searches around with his foot for little Barley and just misses him. 
GAS STATION CLERK 
That’ll be twelve ninety-nine. 
Ian hands money to the cashier. Dad continues to search for little Barley, and taps the head of one of the sprites. 
MUSTARDSEED 
Hey! Watch it! 
Dewdrop leaps over to Dad and puffs out her chest. 
DEWDROP 
You got a problem, Shades?! 
Dad stares at her. 
DEWDROP 
Answer me when I’m talking to you! 
Ian turns to see that Dewdrop staring down Dad from high on a shelf. Ian grabs Dad and pulls him away. 
IAN 
Sorry, I don’t really know where

Laurel’s car speeds down the highway, the passenger side drags along the ground, sparks shooting out.

Laurel drives. The Manticore is tight in the passenger seat.

aren’t what they used to be. 
LAUREL 
Oh, that’s fine. So, about this

The Manticore wiggles her wings a little.

It’s my own fault. I should be 
doing my wing exercises every

goes... 
LAUREL 
Please, the curse. What does it do? 
MANTICORE 
Right! Sorry. It’s a Guardian

The Manticore rips off her sleeve to reveal an arm full of tattoos. She points to an image of a red cloud. 
MANTICORE 
If your boys take the gem, the 
curse will rise up... 
She points to the red mist holding rocks together to make a beast attacking someone.

No, no. You mean the big one. 
Barley. 
MANTICORE 
No, the little guy. Woo, he really

LAUREL 
What? No, look... You said you 
could help them. Right? 
The Manticore points to a glowing circle in the “heart” of one of the beasts. 
MANTICORE 
Every curse has a core, the center 
of its power. And only one weapon 
forged of the rarest metals can 
destroy it: my enchanted sword... 
The Manticore rips off her other sleeve to reveal a tattoo of a glowing yellow sword that reads: THE CURSE CRUSHER. 
MANTICORE 
...the Curse Crusher! 
LAUREL 
Okay, but you don’t seem to have 
that on you. 
The Manticore looks a Laurel, embarrassed.

trouble a few years back. But don’t 
worry, I know just where to find 
it. 
Laurel nods, determined.

Ugh, what is taking you so long? 
Then he hears something off in the distance. 
DEWDROP (O.S.) 
Who you calling whimsical? 
Ian looks over to see Barley in talking to two sprites. 
Oh no. 
IAN 
BARLEY 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
DEWDROP 
You got a lotta nerve. 
Ian makes his way toward Barley while struggling with Dad. 
BARLEY 
I’m just saying sprites used to fly 
around spreading delight. That’s a 
good thing. 
DEWDROP 
Sprites can’t fly! 
BARLEY 
Well, your wings don’t work 'cause 
you stopped using them. 
DEWDROP 
You calling me lazy? 
She throws down her candy straw on the ground and stomps it. 
BARLEY 
No, no, no. Not you. Your 
ancestors. 
DEWDROP 
What did you say about my 
ancestors?! 
BARLEY 
I didn't mean lazy, I--

But Ian swoops in and GRABS Barley while also holding the full gas can and a wandering Dad. 
IAN 
I’m sorry! Very sorry! He’s sorry, 
too. You don’t need to fly, who 
needs to fly? I mean you’ve got 
those great bikes! 
BARLEY 
What are you doing? I was just 
discussing history! 
IAN 
Barley, I’m trying to take care of 
you and Dad, and you are not making 
it any easier! 
(struggling with Dad) 
Dad, come on! 
Dad has wandered to the other side of the line of motorcycles and Ian unwittingly pulls him into the bikes. They CRASH like dominoes, blocking the gas station door. 
Oh no. 
IAN 
The Sprites inside the gas station SLAM into the door and windows of the station. They are SEETHING caged animals. 
DEWDROP 
HEY! YOU’RE DEAD! 
Ian RACES Dad and Barley out of there as fast as he can. 
EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT 
Ian runs, terrified. 
IAN 
We’re dead! We’re dead! We’re dead! 
We’re dead! We’re dead! 
Ian frantically fills the van with gasoline. 
BARLEY 
Relax, they won’t be able to lift 
those bikes-- 
One motorcycle ROARS to life in the distance. 
BARLEY 
Oh, they are strong...

Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 69. 
IAN 
We’re gonna die, we’re gonna die, 
we’re gonna die! 
Barley jumps up and down on the door handle. 
BARLEY 
It’s locked! 
IAN 
What?! Where are the keys? 
They see the keys still in the ignition. 
BARLEY 
I got this! 
Barley slides his tiny body through the cracked window. He struggles to try to lift the lock. 
IAN 
C’mon, Barley! 
The lock pops up, sending Barley flying backwards. 
Whoa! 
BARLEY 
Ian climbs in the passenger side and slams the door. 
INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS 
Ian points out the windshield. 
IAN 
Okay, Go! Go! Go! 
Ian looks at Barley, tiny and useless on the drivers seat. 
IAN 
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No way... 
BARLEY 
You’re gonna have to! 
Ian slides over into the drivers seat. He carefully buckles his seatbelt, but then sees the motorcycles coming. Ian turns the key. The engine whines, but nothing happens. 
IAN 
Come on, why won’t it start?!

Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 70. 
BARLEY 
There’s a sweet spot... not in the 
middle, but not quite at the end! 
Ian wiggles the ignition, leaning into it. 
IAN 
Comeoncomeoncomeoncomeon! Come. On. 
Guinevere! 
The van sputters to life. 
BARLEY 
Put it in “O” for “onward!” 
Ian pulls the screwdriver gear shift down to the handwritten letter “O”. The van lurches forward just as a sprite SMASHES out Ian’s window with a flail. 
AHH! 
DRIVE!!! 
IAN 
BARLEY 
Ian’s unintentionally cuts off the sprites. Their bikes get tangled up as the van speeds away. 
EXT. EXPRESSWAY/INT. VAN - NIGHT 
The van races up the on-ramp onto the expressway. 
BARLEY 
Okay, you’re gonna have to merge! 
Cars ROAR past the van as Ian cautiously picks up speed. A huge truck barrels up beside him. Ian tentatively steers the van closer to the freeway. The truck lays on its horn. 
Speed up! 
BARLEY IAN 
I can’t do this! 
BARLEY 
Yes you can! 
IAN 
I’m not ready! 
BARLEY 
You’ll never be ready! MERGE!! 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 71. 
AHHH!!! 
IAN 
Ian floors it and cuts in front of the giant truck. 
BARLEY 
Ha-ha! Nice job! 
In the rearview mirror, Ian sees the motorcycles gaining on them. They pull up on both sides of the van, surrounding him. 
A biker pulls out a flail and hits the van. Barley leaps up to the window, yelling out at the sprites. 
BARLEY 
Hey, don’t hit Gwinny! 
Barley! 
IAN 
Ian quickly comes up behind a slow moving car. 
Oh, no! 
IAN 
BARLEY 
Get around ’em! 
IAN 
They're not letting me in! 
SIGNAL! 
BARLEY IAN 
You don’t have a signal-er! 
BARLEY 
Stick your arm straight out the 
window to signal left! 
Ian holds his arm straight out the window. A sprite immediately wraps a chain around it. 
AH!! 
IAN 
Ian turns the wheel one-handed and merges into the next lane. Barley climbs out on Ian’s arm to untangle the chain. 
IAN 
Get back here! 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 72. 
BARLEY 
Just keep driving! 
The sprites cheer as they gain on the van. 
Barley! 
IAN 
Barley successfully untangles the chain. It recoils and almost knocks a number of sprites off their motorcycle. 
Ian looks ahead and sees the freeway splitting EAST and NORTH. Barley crawls back onto Ian’s shoulder. 
BARLEY 
The mountains are north. You need 
to get all the way over! 
Dad stumbles to the front of the car and face plants into the steering wheel, blaring Guinevere’s horn. 
EXT. EXPRESSWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Dewdrop sees Dad’s body flapping out the window, his stuffed arm waving as if he’s shaking a fist. 
DEWDROP 
What the-- Oh it is on, Shades! 
(to sprites) 
Get 'em! 
A motorcycle races up to Ian’s window. A group of sprites LEAP from their bike and into the van, attacking Ian. 
INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS 
A sprite tackles Barley. Barley pulls the sword from the hand of a nearby bobblehead warrior and brandishes it at the sprite. Ian, covered in sprites, causes the van to swerve. 
Barley and his sprite are thrown onto the passenger seat. The sprite pins Barley down with the seatbelt buckle. 
BARLEY 
Ian! Stay focused! 
I can’t! 
IAN 
BARLEY 
You HAVE to focus or we're all 
dead! 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 73. 
Ian sees the NORTH sign out the window rapidly approaching. 
BARLEY 
Just stay cool! 
Ian gets an idea. 
He frantically reaches and turns on the AC. Strong air blasts from the vents, blowing the sprites out the windows. 
The sprite that was fighting Barley is blown into the windshield of the car behind Guinevere. 
Barley clings to the seatbelt, flapping in the wind. 
BARLEY 
Way to go, Guinevere! 
He loses his grip and is suddenly blown out the window. But Ian manages to grab him at the last minute. 
The sprites rev their bike for another attack. 
Hit it! 
DEWDROP 
Ian sees his exit ahead, across several lanes. 
BARLEY 
We’re not gonna make it! 
With determination, Ian crosses several lanes of traffic, just barely making it onto the NORTH fork of the freeway. 
The sprites don’t have time to correct their course. They crash their bike and hurtle toward the ground. But their wings flap until suddenly... they’re flying. 
Huh. 
INT. VAN - NIGHT 
DEWDROP 
Tiny Barley perches on Ian’s shoulder, celebrating their success. Ian pants heavily, still riding the adrenaline. 
IAN 
Dad, are you okay?! 
BARLEY 
He’s fine, thanks to the skillful 
driving of Sir Ian Lightfoot! High 
Five! 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 74. 
Barley raises his hand to high five, but it bulges to full size and smacks Ian in the face. 
IAN 
Ow! What is happening? 
BARLEY 
I think the spell is wearing off. 
Barley’s torso expands to full size on Ian’s shoulder. Ian can’t even see out the window to know where he’s going. 
IAN 
Get off my face! 
Barley’s right leg grows, slamming onto the gas pedal. 
EXT. ROADWAY - NIGHT 
The van lunges forward, swerving past a hidden police car. Its lights come on and it gives chase. 
INT. VAN - NIGHT 
Barley, now fully-grown, climbs into the passenger seat. 
IAN 
Oh, Chantar’s Talon! Cops! 
Pull over! 
BARLEY IAN 
I don’t have a license. 
Barley pulls a small piece of folded leather from his pocket. 
BARLEY 
Ah! My wallet’s still tiny! 
EXT. FREEWAY SHOULDER - NIGHT 
The van pulls over. 
There are two cops in the car behind them. An imposing cyclops, OFFICER SPECTER, and a boorish satyr: OFFICER GORE. Officer Specter speaks into the P.A. 
OFFICER SPECTER 
Step out of the vehicle.

Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 75. 
INT. VAN - NIGHT 
The boys struggle to remain calm. 
IAN 
What are we gonna do? 
BARLEY 
I don’t know! 
In the background, Dad’s dizzy legs stumble around, then lean against the open back doors of the van and begin to step out. 
IAN 
How are we gonna explain-- 
(seeing Dad) 
Oh no. DAD! 
EXT. FREEWAY SHOULDER - CONTINUOUS 
The cops watch Dad slowly stumble from the van, then share a knowing look. They step out of the car and walk over to Dad. 
OFFICER GORE 
You have a long night there, buddy? 
OFFICER SPECTER 
Sir, I'm gonna ask you to walk this 
straight line. 
Meanwhile, Ian and Barley confer in front of the van. 
IAN 
They’re gonna take Dad! 
Barley thinks for a moment. 
BARLEY 
Oh! I got it! The disguise spell! 
You can disguise yourself to be 
anyone you want. 
Barley draws the spell in the dirt. 
IAN 
What if I mess up again? 
BARLEY 
According to the spell, “Disguising 
yourself is a lie, so you must tell 
the truth to get by.” As long as 
you don’t tell a lie, the spell 
will be fine. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 76. 
IAN 
Okay... who are we gonna be? 
The cops watch a wandering, meandering Dad. 
OFFICER GORE 
Okay, we’re taking you down to the 
station. 
There’s a flash followed by the sound of hooves. The cops turn to see Officer Colt Bronco walk out from behind the van. 
COLT 
(nervous/uncertain) 
What seems to be the problem here 
fellow... police folk? 
Colt’s back legs walk out of sync, nervous and awkward. 
OFFICER GORE 
Officer Bronco? 
OFFICER SPECTER 
Were you in that van? 
To the side of Colt we see a new point of view: The boys are masked by a ghost-like shell of Colt, Ian in the front, Barley in the back. We hear Colt’s voice turn into Ian’s. 
COLT/IAN 
Affirmative! And we will, I mean, I 
will take full responsibility for 
that fella right there, so you can 
just release him over to me. 
BARLEY 
(whispered to Ian) 
Hey, I wanted to be the front. 
IAN 
(whispered to Barley) 
No way, I’ll do the talking. 
OFFICER GORE 
Bronco, I thought you were working 
on the other side of town. 
COLT 
I, uh, changed my mind. 
Suddenly Colt’s right ear vanishes. Ian quickly turns, blocking the missing ear from view. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 77. 
OFFICER SPECTER 
Something wrong? 
COLT 
(panicking) 
Just a little... neck... cramp! 
And with that, Colt’s left hand goes away. Ian quickly and awkwardly bends his arm behind his body. 
BARLEY 
(whispered, to Ian) 
You have to stop lying. Answer 
every question with a question! 
OFFICER SPECTER 
What exactly are you doing out 
here? 
COLT 
Uh... What am I doing out here? 
What are any of us doing out here? 
OFFICER GORE 
Whoa... I never thought about it 
like that. 
BARLEY 
Nice! 
(whispered, to Ian) OFFICER SPECTER 
With all due respect, you didn’t 
answer my question. 
COLT 
Well, we were just exercising some 
driver’s education drills for... 
Ian. 
OFFICER SPECTER 
Who is Ian? 
OFFICER GORE 
(pointing back to Dad) 
Oh, is that Laurel’s kid? 
COLT 
Ian is Laurel’s kid. 
OFFICER SPECTER 
Your stepson was swerving all over 
the road. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 78. 
COLT/IAN 
Yeah, well... that guy’s not all 
there today. 
They all look to see Dad slump on the hood of the police car. 
OFFICER SPECTER 
Yeah, he does seem a little off. 
(suspicious) 
You seem a little off yourself. 
Behind the illusion, Ian is nervous and sweating. 
IAN/COLT 
Uh, actually, if I’m being 
completely honest... I’m not super 
great in this kinda situation... 
and I’m starting to freak out a 
little bit. I’m all sweaty and 
weird and I don’t know what to say 
and I just feel like I can’t do 
anything right and I’m a total 
weirdo-- 
Specter and Gore share a look. Specter takes Colt aside. 
OFFICER SPECTER 
Whoa, whoa, hold on, okay hold on, 
hold on. I think I know what’s 
going on here. 
IAN 
Uh... You do? 
OFFICER SPECTER 
Yeah, it’s not easy being a new 
parent. My girlfriend’s daughter 
got me pulling my hair out, okay? 
IAN 
(relieved) 
Oh... uh, yeah. 
OFFICER SPECTER 
(to Gore) 
Alright, we can let him go. 
COLT 
Oh, okay... I'm just gonna take him 
to the van. 
OFFICER SPECTER 
Hey, it gets better, alright? Good 
luck, Bronco. 
©2020 DISNEY•PIXAR - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
Onward - 6/5/2020 - Full Script 79. 
COLT 
You too, Officer. Keep workin’ 
hard... or hardly workin’... 
(horse laugh) 
The boys, still disguised as Colt, put Dad back in the van. 
BARLEY 
(whispering) 
Now that was a good Colt! 
Ian grins at Barley. 
OFFICER GORE 
I don’t envy you, Bronco. That 
Lightfoot kid is a handful. 
COLT 
I'm gonna have to disagree with you 
there, I think Ian's a pretty stand 
up citizen. 
OFFICER GORE 
Not him, the older one. 
What? 
IAN 
OFFICER GORE 
I mean, the guy’s a screw up. You 
can’t say you don’t agree? 
IAN 
Um... I don’t. 
Colt’s right leg instantly vanishes. Right in front of Barley’s face. 
BARLEY 
What? 
(hurt, stunned) IAN/COLT 
I mean, um, uh, okay, well, um, I 
have to get going, gotta get Ian 
home. 
Colt’s other arm vanishes. Ian quickly shuffles back to the van. The cops watch, baffled by Colt’s behavior. 
COLT 
Ah, I mean, I’m late for work. 
Colt’s back legs vanish.

Sonic the Hedgehog (2020) By Pat Casey 
Page 1/5
[ Ring Chimes ] 
[ Groans ] 
[ Man ] So, I know what you're thinking.  
Why is that incredibly handsome hedgehog being chased by a madman with a mustache... 
- from the Civil War? 
- [ Truck Horn Honking ] 
Well, to be honest, it feels like i've been running my whole life. Is this too much? 
I going too fast? 
It's kind of what do-- 
You know what? Let's back up 
[ Imitates Videotape Rewind Backwards ] 
[ Sonic Narrating ] This is the island where I'm from. 
It had everything. 
"Sandy beaches, cascading waterfalls... 
public access to loop-de-loops. 
And I never had to catch a school bus because I could run... across the entire island in less than two seconds. 
Also... 
there was no school... 
- I know, pretty sweet island, right? 
- Yeah! 
I was born with extraordinary powers and was told to keep them secret. And like any kid, I did the exact opposite. 
- That's Longclaw. She took care of me. 
- [ Laughing ] 
She was basically Obi-Wan-Kenobi.  
If Oni-Wan Kenobi had a beak and ate mice. 
- [ Longclaw ] Sonic?, someone could have seen you. 
- [ Young Sonic ] No one saw me. 
I'm too fast! 
- And, I wanted to bring you this.  
- [ Sighs ] 
[ Gasps ] 
Get down! 
[ Narrator: 
comes great-power-hungry bad guys. 
And I led them right to us. 
[ Window Shattering ] 
- [ Groaning ] 
- [ Exclaims ] 
Listen carefully, Sonic. 
Page 2/5
You have a power unlike anything i have ever seen. And that means someone will always want it. 
The only way to stay safe is to stay hidden. 
This world is on the far side of the universe. 
- You should be safe there. 
- [ Young Sonic ] I don't want to go without you?! You must. 
These Rings will be your most important possession. If you're ever discovered, use one. 
Never stop running. 
Now, go! 
- [ Gasping ] 
- [ All Yelling ] 
- Longclaw! 
- Good-bye, Sonic. 
No! 
[ Shouts ] Noo! 
[ Panting, Whimpering ] 
Come on, one car? 
[ Mocks Whooshing ] 
[ Groans ]  
I'm bored. 
- [ Radio On Over ] Tom, do you read me? Are you there? - No, Wade, I'm actually on a yacht in Bardbados. With Rihanna. 
O.M.G.  
[ Clears Throat ] 
- That's amazing. Please send pics. 
- No, Wade. I'm at the speed trap. 
Already? How did you get back so fast? Barbados is in the ocean! Hang on, I think I got something. 
[ Beeping ] 
Hey, buddy!  
Where's the fire? Got kids living around here?! 
I thought it was kinda funny. Sorry. [ Chuckling ] [ Whooshing ] 
What? 
[ Whooshing ] 
[ Radio On Over ] Tom, we need you down on Main Street. There's been a violent gang shoot-out. 
[ Laughing On Radio ] Just kidding. A duck stole a bagel. But they do need it back. 
[ Sonic ] Whoa!, buddy?! You almost got killed out there. What are you, some kind of adrenaline junkie? 
Page 3/5
It must be rough being slow all the time. 
Tell you what. Today is your lucky day. 
## [ Singing: 
[ Whoops ] 
Have you ever felt so alive?! 
This is great! You're doing amazing! 
[ Gasps ] Oh, geez! 
Good recovery! 
[ Exclaiming ] 
Let's keep this our little secret... 
okay? 
You never saw me. 
[ Whispers ] I was never here. 
[ Songs Resumes ] 
[ Sonic Narrating ] So what did you expect? 
A dirty little hedgehog eating berries and struggling to survive? Think again? 
Because I am living my best life on Earth. 
I've got a library... 
a home gym... 
and a state-of-the-art security system. 
Aaah! 
[ Rings Clattering ] 
Oh, no! 
And if I'm ever discovered... 
I'll follow Longclaw's instructions and use my Rings to escape to a new planet. 
A nice, safe world filled only with mushrooms. 
Gross... 
smelly mushrooms. 
[ Sighs ] I hate mushrooms. 
[ Sonic Narrating ] But let's not worry about all that. This is Green Hills... 
the greatest place on Earth. 
These are my people, and, dare I say... 
I am their loveable space creature. 
So what if they don't know I exist? 
My favorite person is the Donut Lord... 
protector of this town and defender of all creatures... big and small. 
- Morning. Donald, Daisy, Daffy. 
- [ Quacking Sounds ] 
Donut Lord lives with Pretzel Lady. 
Page 4/5
She is super nice to animals and stangely was born without bones. [ Exclaims In Pain ] Ouch, ouch. Ouch! 
[ Sonic Narrating ] There is one person in town who's actually onto me. He calls me the blue devil? 
[ Crazy Carl ] I almost caught him last night. 
- Say hello to Crazy Carl. 
- [ Whooshing ] 
We have fun together. 
[ Exclaiming ] 
I know you're out there! 
And I know you're real! 
[ Sonic ] No, I'm not! 
Movie night is my favorite. 
Please, please, please, please. 
[ Gasps ] Yes! Keanu! 
You are a national treasure. 
[ TV: 
[ TV: 
There's a bomb on the bus. 
[ Sonic Mocks Howard Payne ] Pop quiz, hotshot. 
[ Kisses ] 
[ Sonic Narrating ] Basically, we're like a family. 
Even though we haven't met yet. 
[ German Accent ] You don't zink your prolonged isolation is making you a bit crazy, perhaps? 
[ Laughs ] Crazy? Me? No way... Doc. 
You got me all wrong. 
And despite all these so-called friends of yours... 
deep down... 
you're still rather lonely? 
[ TV: 
Perhaps afraid you'll be alone forever. 
[ Crickets Chirping ] 
[ Truck Horns Honking ] 
[ Horns Honking ] 
Uh-uh! Hey! No, no. 
Get out of there. 
- Oh, come on! Get out of there! 
- [ Raccoon Chatters ] 
Get out of there, you trash pandas.

Landing on the floor next to an unconscious coat-check girl.  He spots another bomb – ‘4:23’, ‘4:22’... the Protagonist  checks the number on the coat-check ticket and efficiently  moves across numbered racks until he finds a SPORTS BAG.  
He unzips it to find a BLACK METALLIC OBJECT the size of a  softball. 
He stuffs it into his pack and SCRAMBLES over the counter... 
INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS 
– the Protagonist RUNS, checking numbers on doors... he STOPS  at a door, THROWS it open, JUMPS in low – 
INT. UTILITY ROOM – CONTINUOUS 
THREE ‘SWATS’, guns trained, and the Well-Dressed Man. The  Protagonist throws a bomb to SWAT 2, then shows the OBJECT to  the Well-Dressed Man – 
PROTAGONIST 
I’ve never seen encapsulation like  
this. 
WELL-DRESSED MAN 
We don’t know how old it is. It’s  
the real deal. 
PROTAGONIST 
Did you have an out? 
WELL-DRESSED MAN 
Service tunnels to sewers. 
5.
PROTAGONIST 
Swap clothes. 
The ‘SWAT’ and the Well-Dressed Man start changing. The  Protagonist hands SWAT 3 the object – 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
Take this, take him, take his exit.  
I don’t trust ours any more. 
(to SWAT 2) 
Can you defuse it? 
SWAT 2 
(shakes head) 
Centrally synchronized. Are there  
more? 
The Protagonist nods, STUFFS the bomb in his pack – 
PROTAGONIST 
Covering their tracks. 
SWAT 2 
Taking out the audience? 
PROTAGONIST 
Just the cheap seats. 
SWAT 3 
Not our mission – 
Mine, now. 
PROTAGONIST 
The newly dressed ‘TARGET’ steps up – 
‘TARGET’ 
I’m with you – the Ukrainians are  
expecting a passenger. 
INT. THEATRE, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist and the ‘Target’ race through the SLEEPING  AUDIENCE COLLECTING BOMBS – the TIMERS tick down – ‘1:58’,  ‘1:57’. 
Crouched at a bomb, the Protagonist notices a BULLET HOLE in  the side of the chair – a TINY WHIFF OF SMOKE GATHERING... 
CLICK – a gun is to his head – he spins around to see a  SWAT... ‘0:34’, ‘0:33’... The ‘Target’ has his own gun on the  SWAT – A STAND-OFF – all around them, UNCONSCIOUS  CIVILIANS... 
PROTAGONIST 
Walk away – you don’t need to kill  
these people. 
6.
The Protagonist turns back to the bomb... ‘0:32’, ‘0:31’. At  the bullet hole the PUFF OF SMOKE THICKENS... the  Protagonist, confused, REACHES towards it... the SWAT COCKS  his weapon... 
BLAM! With EXPLOSIVE FORCE THE BULLET HOLE DISAPPEARS – A  NICK HAS APPEARED IN THE PROTAGONIST’S UNIFORM – he SPINS –  the SWAT is SHOT THROUGH THE CHEST AND DROPS... revealing a  FIGURE, also in a gas mask and tactical gear...  
The Figure TURNS – the Protagonist sees, on the Figure’s  pack, a small TALISMAN – a COIN with a hole tied to a zip by  ORANGE AND YELLOW THREAD – the Protagonist turns back to grab  the bomb – 
‘TARGET’ 
That wasn’t one of us. 
PROTAGONIST 
I’ll take the help. 
The Protagonist GRABS the last bomb: ‘0:03’... he looks up to  the boxes, where REAL SWATS EVACUATE THE HIGH OFFICIALS...  THE PROTAGONIST LOBS THE BOMBS UP INTO THE BOXES... 
EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN KIEV – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist and ‘Target’ emerge – an EXPLOSION above them  - 
INT. THEATRE, CONCERT HALL – CONTINUOUS 
INNOCENT CIVILIANS STIR under the EXPLOSION IN THE BOXES – 
EXT. PLAZA, DOWNTOWN KIEV – CONTINUOUS 
The van PULLS UP – rear door open – they JUMP INSIDE – 
INT. VAN – MOMENTS LATER 
The Protagonist pulls off his mask. BREATHING. The Passenger  turns – grabs the ‘Target’s face, SOMETHING WRONG... the  Protagonist turns to the Driver – WHO HAS A GUN POINTED AT  HIM ... 
BLACK SCREEN: 
SCREAMING. The Protagonist’s screaming. Close on his eyes –  FLICKERING, SWEATING, PLEADING, DEFIANT... and we are – 
7.
EXT. RAIL YARDS – DAY 
The Protagonist, tied to a chair, in a windswept rail yard.  In front of him, the ‘Target’, also tied to a chair, back to  us. The Driver steps back, SWEATING. BLOODY PLIERS in hand. 
DRIVER 
(breathless) 
A man can be trained to hold out  
for about eighteen hours. 
The Driver gestures at a CLOCK on a table – 
DRIVER (CONT'D) 
So your colleagues will clear by 7. 
The Driver PUSHES the ‘Target’s chair over. The ‘Target’  lands hard on his side on the gravel. Groaning. 
DRIVER (CONT'D) 
He didn’t last eighteen minutes. 
The Driver pulls out a KNIFE. Leans in to the Protagonist – 
DRIVER (CONT'D) 
But he didn’t have anything to  
hide. You were smuggling a nobody. 
The knife moves towards the Protagonist’s throat... 
Risky. 
DRIVER (CONT'D) 
...then to his collar – which he CUTS – 
DRIVER (CONT'D) 
Or were you counting on this? 
...pulling out a SILVER CAPSULE. The Protagonist stares. 
DRIVER (CONT'D) 
Death, CIA issue. 
The Driver TOSSES the pill, WAVES the pliers at the clock – 
DRIVER (CONT'D) 
Spare yourself once they’re clear. 
The Protagonist looks at the clock – ‘5:38’. A FREIGHT TRAIN  RUMBLES PAST, CLOSE... As we close in on the clock, THE  PROTAGONIST’S SCREAMS ARE DROWNED OUT BY THE FREIGHT TRAIN... 
The Driver steps back. The Protagonist breathes heavy, blood  dribbling... the Driver follows his gaze to the clock –  ‘6:53’ – then checks his watch. Frowns theatrically, picks up  the clock, SHAKES it – 
8.
DRIVER (CONT'D) 
Running fast... 
The Driver SETS THE HANDS BACK ONE HOUR. The Protagonist  
watches, DESPAIRING... as the Driver puts the clock back on  the table, the Protagonist notices the ‘Target’s FINGERS  WIGGLING... in them is a SILVER PILL... 
Freight trains rumble past in opposite directions, sound  BUILDING... The Driver approaches, bloody pliers in hand – 
PROTAGONIST 
We were alone. 
DRIVER 
I didn’t ask. Which means we’re  
finally getting somewhere. 
The Protagonist HURLS himself onto the ‘Target’s hands – face  SMASHING – gets the PILL into his mouth – BITES DOWN –  DEAFENING TRAIN NOISE... 
Arms GRAB at him – HANDS PRY his jaw as he SEIZES, MOUTH  FOAMING... the Protagonist’s EYES GLAZE and we – 
CUT TO: 
Black screen. 
Supertitle: 
TENET 
FADE IN: 
The Protagonist opens his eyes. A man stands beside his bed.  SWAYING gently. This is FAY. 
FAY 
Welcome to the afterlife. 
The Protagonist lifts his head and we are – 
INT. BOAT AT SEA – DAY 
The Protagonist sees the STEELY OCEAN SWELL... 
FAY 
You’ve been in a medically induced  
coma while we got you out of  
Ukraine and rebuilt your mouth. 
PROTAGONIST 
The pills are fake? 
FAY 
We swapped yours for a sedative. 
Why? 
A test. 
PROTAGONIST FAY 
9.
The Protagonist runs a finger around his mouth. REALIZING. 
PROTAGONIST 
Test? They pulled my teeth out. 
Fay lets that dissipate. The Protagonist closes his eyes. 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
Did the team get clear? 
FAY 
No. Private Russians, we think. 
PROTAGONIST 
Somebody talked. 
FAY 
Not you. You chose to die instead  
of giving up your colleagues. 
EXT. DECK OF THE BOAT – LATER 
The Protagonist stands in the wind, contemplating the  horizon. 
FAY (O.S.) 
We all believe we’d run into the  
burning building, but until we feel  
that heat... we can never know. You  
do. 
I resign. 
PROTAGONIST FAY 
You don’t work for us – you’re  
dead. 
The Protagonist turns to Fay, confused. 
FAY (CONT'D) 
Your duty transcends national  
interests. This is about survival. 
Whose? 
PROTAGONIST FAY 
Everyone’s. There’s a cold war.  Cold as ice. To even know its true  nature is to lose.  
(MORE) 
10.
FAY (CONT'D) 
This is knowledge divided – all I  
have for you is a gesture – 
(interlaces his fingers) 
– in combination with a word –  
‘tenet’. Use it carefully, it’ll  
open the right doors, but some of  
the wrong ones, too. 
PROTAGONIST 
That’s all they’ve told you? 
FAY 
The test you passed? 
(beat) 
Not everybody does. 
Fay breaks eye contact with the Protagonist. The boat  continues to nose into the swell. 
EXT. LAUNCH, WIND FARM AT SEA – DUSK 
The Protagonist is driven away from the boat on a launch,  towards the GIANT WHITE TURBINES of the ocean wind farm. 
The launch SLIPS amongst them, seeking the ladder of a  particular one... 
The Protagonist climbs the ladder to a door. He tries it –  it’s open. He turns to see the launch move off into the  gathering dark. The Protagonist ENTERS the wind turbine. 
INT. WIND TURBINE – CONTINUOUS 
In the bare space, the Protagonist finds a SPORTS BAG, a COT,  a pallet of WATER and PROTEIN BARS. He opens the sports bag  to find passports, cash, credit cards and a HI-VIZ VEST. 
Under the vest is a small black cylinder. He unscrews the top  to find three SILVER SUICIDE PILLS. The Protagonist shakes  his head as he tosses them back into the bag. 
INT. WIND TURBINE – LATER 
The Protagonist EATS, DRINKS and EXERCISES by CLIMBING the  endless interior ladder of the turbine. The stash of food and  water SHRINKS... 
The Protagonist does PULL-UPS at the very top of the ladder,  FEET DANGLING over the VERTIGINOUS DROP... 
INT. WIND TURBINE – MORNING 
The Protagonist is woken by a repeated AIR HORN. He pulls  himself off the cot, opens the door to find – 
11.
EXT. WIND TURBINE – CONTINUOUS 
A large CATAMARAN nosed up to the windmill, ladder in place,  MAINTENANCE CREW in HI-VIZ VESTS moving on and off the  turbine. Other boats service other turbines. The Protagonist  pulls on his VEST and CLIMBS down onto the catamaran. 
EXT. EUROPEAN PORT – DAY 
The Protagonist disembarks with the rest of the wind-farm  crew. As they file past a car the driver, also in hi-viz,  steps out into line, leaving the door open, engine running.  The Protagonist gets in. The GPS is already set... 
EXT. OFFICE COMPLEX – LATER 
A bland suburban office park. The Protagonist gets out of the  car, wearing his hi-viz and carrying a clipboard. Heads  inside, passing numerous STAFF coming out... 
INT. LOBBY, OFFICE COMPLEX – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist moves through the lobby unimpeded. Checking  the tenant listings he sees – ‘WINDFARM TRANSITIONS – B-2’. 
INT. CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist walks up to B-2. 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) 
With a hi-viz vest and a clipboard,  
you can get almost anywhere.  
Almost. 
The Protagonist turns to find a brusque young woman. This is  BARBARA. He joins his hands, interlacing the fingers... 
PROTAGONIST 
A pretty obscure tenet. 
Using a key card, she ushers him through a door into – 
INT. OFFICE, LABORATORY – CONTINUOUS 
Barbara hands the Protagonist a cup of tea. 
BARBARA 
No small talk, nothing that might  
reveal who we are, or what we do. 
PROTAGONIST 
I thought I was here to find out  
what we do. 
12.
BARBARA 
You’re not here for ‘what’, you’re  
here for ‘how’. ‘What’ is your  
department. And not my business. 
PROTAGONIST 
Well, to do what I do, I need some  
idea of the threat we face. 
Barbara considers the Protagonist. Sips her tea. 
BARBARA 
As I understand it, we’re trying to  
prevent World War Three. 
PROTAGONIST 
Nuclear holocaust? 
BARBARA 
No. Something worse. 
INT. SHOOTING RANGE – MOMENTS LATER 
Barbara hands the Protagonist a semi-automatic. He  reflexively checks the chamber and magazine – EMPTY. 
BARBARA 
Aim it and pull the trigger. 
The Protagonist SHRUGS, lifts the empty pistol, sights a  target 25m away with several holes in it... 
He squeezes the trigger – BAM! – a shot. He is CONFUSED... 
BARBARA (CONT'D) 
Check the magazine. 
The Protagonist checks the clip – THERE IS A ROUND IN IT. 
How? 
PROTAGONIST 
Barbara pulls on PROTECTIVE GLOVES and removes the round from  the clip, placing it next to an identical one on a table. 
BARBARA 
One of these bullets is, like us,  
travelling forwards through time.  
The other one’s going backwards.  
Can you tell which is which? 
The Protagonist shakes his head. Barbara reaches forward – 
BARBARA (CONT'D) 
How about now? – 
13.
One of the rounds FLIES UP INTO HER HAND, FALLING IN REVERSE.  The Protagonist is taken aback. Barbara holds the round  towards him so he can inspect it – 
BARBARA (CONT'D) 
It’s inverted – its entropy runs  
backwards. So, to our eyes, its  
movement is reversed. We think it’s  
a type of inverse radiation,  
triggered by nuclear fission. 
PROTAGONIST 
You didn’t make it? 
BARBARA 
We don’t know how. Yet. 
PROTAGONIST 
So where’d it come from? 
BARBARA 
Someone’s manufacturing them in the  
future. They’re streaming back at 
us. 
Barbara places the round on the table, in front of a CAMERA. 
Try it. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) 
He puts on a glove – moves his hand over it, nothing. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) 
You have to have dropped it. 
The Protagonist reaches out again – it LEAPS UP INTO HIS  HAND. 
PROTAGONIST 
How can it move before I touch it? 
She cues up the recording of what he just did – 
BARBARA 
From your point of view you caught  
it, but from the bullet’s point of 
view... 
She plays it BACKWARDS – 
BARBARA (CONT'D) 
...you dropped it. 
ON THE SCREEN: the round FALLS from his hand. 
PROTAGONIST 
But cause has to come before  
effect. 
14.
BARBARA 
No. That’s just how we see time. 
She PULLS the round towards herself using one finger – the  round follows her finger as if MAGNETIZED... 
PROTAGONIST 
What about free will? 
BARBARA 
That bullet wouldn’t have moved if  
you hadn’t put your hand there. 
Either way we run the tape, you  
made it happen. 
She LAUNCHES it up into her other hand – 
BARBARA (CONT'D) 
Don’t try to understand it. Feel  
it. 
Barbara PLAYS with the round in increasingly IMPROBABLE,  BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENTS... The round SHOOTS AWAY FROM HER – the  Protagonist CATCHES IT... 
PROTAGONIST 
Instinct. Got it. 
Barbara smiles, swaps him the round for the pistol. She then  places a TRAY COVERED IN SHELL CASINGS beside him.  
The Protagonist aims at the target – a shell casing LEAPS  into the gun – he FIRES, and a bullet hole near the bullseye VANISHES – 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
Why does it feel so strange? 
BARBARA 
You’re not shooting the bullet,  
you’re catching it. 
Whoa. 
PROTAGONIST 
The Protagonist examines the target – no bullet holes. 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
I’ve seen this type of ammunition  
before. 
BARBARA 
In the field? 
PROTAGONIST 
I was almost hit. 
15.
BARBARA 
Then you are exceedingly lucky... 
The Protagonist turns to her... 
BARBARA (CONT'D) 
An inverted bullet passing through  
your body would be devastating. The 
inverse radiation would spread  
through your body. Like polonium 
poisoning. Not pretty. 
The Protagonist examines the rounds... 
PROTAGONIST 
These look like today’s. 
BARBARA 
They may have been made today, then  
inverted years from now. 
PROTAGONIST 
Where did you get them? 
BARBARA 
They came with the wall. I was  
assigned it, like all the material  
I’m studying here. 
PROTAGONIST 
Do you have an analysis of the  
metals? 
Sure. Why? 
BARBARA 
PROTAGONIST 
The mixture of alloys can tell me  
where they might have been made. 
Look, I know you said that ‘what’  
is my business – 
BARBARA 
Let’s not go off-topic. 
PROTAGONIST 
I’m not seeing Armageddon here. 
Barbara takes the round from him, and beckons him to follow – 
INT. ARCHIVE – CONTINUOUS 
Between tall sets of DRAWERS... 
16.
BARBARA 
A bullet may not seem like much,  
but it’s a simple machine – lead  
bullet, brass casing, gunpowder. If  
they can invert this – I see no  
reason they couldn’t invert pretty  
much anything. Even a nuclear  
weapon can only affect our future.  
An inverted weapon might be able to  
affect our past as well. 
Barbara stops at a drawer. Gestures around herself – 
BARBARA (CONT'D) 
Now that we know what to look for,  
we’re finding more and more  
inverted material... 
She opens a drawer, revealing a VARIETY OF RUSTED BITS AND  PIECES – SCREWS, CRACKED LENSES, METAL RODS, BUTTONS... 
BARBARA (CONT'D) 
...remnants of complex objects. 
The Protagonist reaches out and lets a RUSTED BUCKLE leap  into his hand. 
PROTAGONIST 
So what do you think we’re seeing? 
BARBARA 
The detritus of a coming war. 
The Protagonist looks around at the MULTITUDE of DRAWERS. 
EXT. CROWDED STREET, MUMBAI – DAY 
The Protagonist walks out of an electronics store, opening a  new phone, and slips into the throng. He dials – 
MALE VOICE 
Yup? 
(over phone) 
PROTAGONIST 
We live in a twilight world. 
MALE VOICE 
(over phone) 
No friends at dusk. I was told  you’d left the building. 
PROTAGONIST 
Even the dead need allies. 
17.
MALE VOICE 
(over phone) 
Specifically? 
PROTAGONIST 
An assist in Mumbai. To get to  
Sanjay Singh. 
MALE VOICE 
(over phone) 
Singh? He never leaves his house,  
and his house... well, it’s – 
PROTAGONIST 
Yes, it is – I’m looking right at  
it. 
Above the bustling street, a HIGH-RISE HOUSE, at least twenty  storeys tall, with two large balconies, towers over... 
MALE VOICE 
(over phone) 
I’ll see who’s on deck. Bombay  
Yacht Club, two hours. 
As the Protagonist hangs up, he spots a figure, on the top  balcony. A WOMAN IN A SARI, standing high above the city. 
INT. BOMBAY YACHT CLUB – EVENING 
The Protagonist enters the quiet ex-colonial establishment.  Takes a seat. A BUSINESSMAN sits down next to him. 
BUSINESSMAN 
It seems you need an introduction  
to a prominent Mumbai local on  
short notice. I’m Neil. 
Neil offers his hand. The Protagonist takes it – 
PROTAGONIST 
I need an audience with Sanjay  
Singh. 
NEIL 
Not possible. 
PROTAGONIST 
Ten minutes, tops. 
NEIL 
Time isn’t the problem. Getting out  
alive’s the problem. 
(thinks) 
Would you take a child hostage? 
The Protagonist shakes his head. 
A woman? 
NEIL (CONT'D) PROTAGONIST 
18.
If I had to. I’m not looking to  
make much noise here. 
Neil keeps thinking. Signals a waiter – 
NEIL 
Vodka tonic. 
(gestures at the  
Protagonist) 
Diet Coke. 
The Protagonist stares at Neil. Neil looks up, confused. 
NEIL (CONT'D) 
What? You never drink on the job. 
PROTAGONIST 
You’re well informed. 
NEIL 
It pays to be in our profession. 
PROTAGONIST 
Well, I prefer club soda. 
NEIL 
(grins) 
No, you don’t. 
Neil raps his knuckles on the table, thinking. 
NEIL (CONT'D) 
How’s your parachuting? 
PROTAGONIST 
Broke an ankle in basic training.  
Singh’s house isn’t tall enough to 
parachute off of. 
NEIL 
(thinks) 
But it’s bungee-jumpable. 
PROTAGONIST 
I don’t think ‘bungee-jumpable’ is  
a word. 
NEIL 
It may not be a word, but it may be  
your only way out of that place. 
(a thought occurs) 
Or into it, for that matter. 
19.
EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – EVENING 
ARMED GUARDS patrol the balconies. 
INT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS 
Inside one of the magnificent rooms, a middle-aged Indian man  mixes drinks. This is SANJAY SINGH. 
EXT. LOW ROOFTOP NEXT DOOR TO HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS 
Neil and the Protagonist race across the roof carrying a  sports bag. Neil pulls out a WINCH, the Protagonist pulls out  a large CATAPULT, loops it around two pipes, glancing down  into the WALLED YARD at the foot of the high-rise house.  
Neil BOLTS the winch to the roof, the Protagonist sights the  upper balcony of the high-rise house, FIRES a ball with a  line up and over the balcony railing... 
EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist and Neil lie next to each other as the WINCH  RUNS, TENSIONING THEIR ELASTIC LINES... they LAUNCH  themselves, FLYING UP to land against the side of the  building –  
They RUN SILENTLY UP THE BUILDING, onto the UPPER TERRACES,  SHOOTING TWO GUARDS with silenced pistols... 
INT./EXT. HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS 
Sanjay Singh hands a drink to the Woman in the sari. They  move out onto the balcony – 
EXT. BALCONY – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist surprises Sanjay, holds him at gunpoint – 
PROTAGONIST 
(to the Woman) 
Stay back. 
(to Sanjay) 
I was almost taken out by a very  
unusual type of ammunition in  
Ukraine. I want to know who  
supplied it. 
SANJAY 
My name’s Sanjay. And you are? 
(silence) 
No chit-chat? 
20.
The Woman pushes a RED BUTTON on the wall – 
PROTAGONIST 
There’s no one at the other end. No  
one who’s going to help you,  
anyway. 
INT. SECURITY STATION, HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS 
An alarm buzzes, the Security Guards are frozen, Neil has a  gun on them, a finger to his lips... 
EXT. BALCONY, HIGH-RISE HOUSE – CONTINUOUS 
Sanjay tries to turn to see the Protagonist – 
SANJAY 
Why would I know who supplied it? 
The Protagonist pushes his head back around with the gun – 
PROTAGONIST 
The combination of metals is unique  
to India. If it’s from India, it’s  
from you. 
SANJAY 
A fair assumption – 
Deduction. 
PROTAGONIST SANJAY 
Deduction, then. Look, my friend,  
guns are never conducive to a  
productive negotiation. 
PROTAGONIST 
I’m not the man they send to  
negotiate... 
He COCKS his weapon – puts the gun to Sanjay’s head – 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
But I am the man people talk to. 
SANJAY 
(charm curdles) 
I can’t. I can’t tell you. 
PROTAGONIST 
You’re an arms dealer, friend –  
this may be the easiest trigger  
I’ve ever had to pull. 
21.
WOMAN (O.S.) 
To say anything about a client  
would violate the tenets he lives  
by... 
The Protagonist GLANCES at the Woman... whose fingers are  casually INTERTWINED. The Protagonist brings his free hand up  to hold the gun in both hands, fingers INTERLACED... 
PROTAGONIST 
If tenets are important to you,  
then you can tell me. Everything. 
WOMAN 
Not while you have a gun to my  
husband’s head. 
The Protagonist releases him. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) 
Sanjay, make us a drink. 
INT. TERRACE OVERLOOKING MUMBAI, SANJAY’S HOUSE – LATER 
Overlooking the extraordinary bustle of the city. Sanjay has  left. His wife hands the Protagonist his drink – 
PRIYA 
I’m Priya Singh. 
PROTAGONIST 
This is your operation? 
PRIYA 
A masculine front in a man’s world  
has its uses. The dealer you’re 
looking for is Andrei Sator. 
PROTAGONIST 
The Russian oligarch? 
PRIYA 
You know him? 
PROTAGONIST 
Not personally. Made his billions  
in gas, moved to London and married 
an English girl. Said to be on the  
outs with Moscow. 
PRIYA 
Very good. Except the ‘gas’ he made  
his billions from was actually 
plutonium, and he’s said to be on  
the outs so he can feed British  
Intelligence whatever the Russians  
want them to think they know. 
22.
PROTAGONIST 
None of which explains how or why  
you sold him inverted munitions. 
PRIYA 
When I sold him the rounds, they  
were perfectly ordinary. 
PROTAGONIST 
So how did he get them inverted? 
PRIYA 
We believe he’s functioning as some  
kind of broker between our time and  
the future. 
PROTAGONIST 
He can communicate with the future? 
PRIYA 
We all do. Credit cards, email,  
text – anything that goes into the  
record speaks directly to the  
future. The question is – can the  
future speak back? And, if so, what  
are they saying? 
PROTAGONIST 
And I’m supposed to find out? 
PRIYA 
To get anywhere near Sator would  
take a fresh-faced protagonist... 
She reaches up to touch his cheek. 
PRIYA (CONT'D) 
Fresh as a daisy. Get close, find  
out what he’s receiving and how. 
PROTAGONIST 
Is it safe to involve British  
Intelligence? 
PRIYA 
I have a contact who’s out of  
Sator’s reach. 
One of us? 
PROTAGONIST PRIYA 
No, he thinks we’re chasing  
plutonium. 
SIRENS. BANGS! Priya looks over to see POLICE CARS arriving  far below, in the WALLED YARD at the foot of her house... 
23.
PRIYA (CONT'D) 
You’d better get out of here. 
PROTAGONIST 
Can’t you explain things? 
PRIYA 
You have to start looking at the  
world in a new way – this conflict  
runs backwards and forwards  
simultaneously. Your name on a  
police report reveals your identity  
to the future – they pass it back  
to Sator – 
PROTAGONIST 
My cover’s blown before I get near  
him. 
PRIYA 
You got in – you must’ve had a plan  
for getting out.  
The Protagonist pulls a CLIP and cord from his harness – 
PROTAGONIST 
Not one I loved. 
Priya watches him clip onto the balcony rail. Neil FLIES  PAST, dropping from the balcony above.  
The Protagonist JUMPS, SLOWING as he DROPS BEHIND THE WALL,  OUT OF REACH OF THE POLICE, into a MARKET STREET and RELEASES  his harness – disappearing into the crowd... 
EXT. MEMBER’S CLUB, LONDON – DAY 
The Protagonist walks down the busy Mall, and up the steps... 
INT. MEMBER’S CLUB, LONDON – DAY 
The Protagonist enters, is approached by a STEWARD. 
STEWARD 
Can I help you, sir? 
PROTAGONIST 
I’m Mr Crosby’s lunch. 
STEWARD 
I presume you mean Sir Michael  
Crosby’s lunch? 
PROTAGONIST 
Presume away. 
24.
STEWARD 
If you’ll follow me. 
INT. LOUNGE, MEMBER’S CLUB – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist is shown to a table where a distinguished  middle-aged man is already eating. CROSBY. 
CROSBY 
Started without you, hope you don’t  
mind. 
PROTAGONIST 
I’ll catch up. 
(to the Steward) 
Same for me. 
STEWARD 
I’ll send the waiter. 
PROTAGONIST 
No, just pass on the order. 
Crosby smiles at the Protagonist’s handling of the Steward. 
CROSBY 
I gather you’ve an interest in a  
certain Russian national. 
PROTAGONIST 
Anglo-Russian. So I’ll have to  
watch my step. 
CROSBY 
Indeed. He’s tapped into the  
intelligence services – I’ve warned  
them he’s feeding them rubbish, but  
they don’t seem to care. 
PROTAGONIST 
Tell me about him. 
CROSBY 
I assume you’re familiar with the  
Soviet-era secret cities? 
PROTAGONIST 
Closed cities, not shown on maps,  
built up around sensitive  
industries. Most of them have been  
opened up and renamed as regular  
towns. 
CROSBY 
Not the one Sator grew up in.  
Stalsk-12. (MORE) 
25.
CROSBY (CONT'D) 
In the seventies our people  
estimated its population at almost  
200,000. Unacknowledged to this  
day. Thought to be abandoned. 
Abandoned? 
PROTAGONIST CROSBY 
Some kind of accident. After which  we think it became a site for underground tests. Just two weeks  ago, same day as the Kiev Opera  siege, our satellites detected a  detonation in north-west Siberia,  about where we think Stalsk-12 was. 
Nuclear? 
PROTAGONIST CROSBY 
Big enough to be noticed. Sator  emerged from this blank spot on the  map with an ambition that  
eventually led him here, to buy his  way into the British establishment. 
PROTAGONIST 
Through his wife? 
CROSBY 
Katherine Barton, eldest niece of  Sir Frederick Barton. She works at Shipley’s, met Sator at an auction. 
PROTAGONIST 
He’s into art? 
CROSBY 
Like a lot of wealthy criminals, he  thinks if he covers his walls with tasteful, expensive things it’ll  distract from the bloodshed.  Judging by the lovely girl he  married, there might be something  in it. 
PROTAGONIST 
Happy marriage? 
CROSBY 
No. Practically estranged. 
PROTAGONIST 
How do I get to Sator? 
CROSBY 
Through her, of course. 
26.
PROTAGONIST 
You may have an inflated idea of my  
powers of seduction. 
CROSBY 
Hardly. We have an ace in the  
hole... 
Crosby slides a SHOPPING BAG over to the Protagonist’s feet.  The Protagonist looks inside: a small FRAMED DRAWING. 
PROTAGONIST 
You’re carrying a Goya in a Harrods 
bag? 
CROSBY 
It’s a fake, by a Spaniard named  
Arepo. One of two we confiscated  
from an embezzler in Bern. We hung  
on to this one for a rainy day – I  
felt the first drops when India  
called. 
PROTAGONIST 
What happened to the other one? 
CROSBY 
A Rubens. It turned up at  
Shipley’s, where it was  
authenticated by Katherine Barton  
before going under the hammer. And  
who do you suppose bought it? 
PROTAGONIST 
Her husband? Does she know it’s a  
forgery? 
CROSBY 
Hard to say. Rumour had it that she  
and Arepo were close. 
Crosby looks the Protagonist over – 
CROSBY (CONT'D) 
Look, no offence, but this is a  
world where someone claiming to be  
a billionaire gets asked if they’re  
just a dollar billionaire. 
And? 
PROTAGONIST CROSBY 
Brooks Brothers won’t cut it. 
PROTAGONIST 
I’m assuming I have a budget. 
27.
CROSBY 
(tosses him a credit  
card) 
Save the world, then we’ll balance  
the books. Can I recommend a  
tailor? 
PROTAGONIST 
I’ll manage. You British don’t have  
a monopoly on snobbery, you know. 
CROSBY 
Not a monopoly. More of a  
controlling interest. 
The Protagonist rises, taking the credit card and the bag. 
PROTAGONIST 
Thanks for this. By the way, is she  
a Kate or a Kathy? 
CROSBY 
A Kat, I believe. 
The waiter arrives, bearing food, supervised by the Steward. 
PROTAGONIST 
Could you box that for me? 
STEWARD 
Certainly not. 
The Protagonist smiles at Crosby, who nods goodbye. 
PROTAGONIST 
Goodbye, Sir Michael. 
EXT. WEST LONDON PRIVATE SCHOOL – DAY 
Mothers stand at the railings waiting for their kids. One of  them, a smart YOUNG WOMAN, stands a little apart from the  group. SCHOOLKIDS pile out of the school... 
INT./EXT. CAR – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist watches from across the road as the Young  Woman SPOTS her son. She offers him her hand, but he reaches  up to take his NANNY’S. She moves her hand to pick something  off his jumper before he is put into the back of a BLACK  RANGE ROVER with tinted windows.  
The Protagonist watches the Young Woman wave at the departing  car carrying her child. Utterly alone. 
28.
EXT. SHIPLEY’S, LONDON – DAY 
A BENTLEY pulls up – a DOORMAN opens the rear door, the  Protagonist emerges, IMMACULATELY TAILORED, holding a  beautiful leather briefcase. 
INT. SHIPLEY’S – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist is approached by a REPRESENTATIVE – 
REPRESENTATIVE 
How can I help, sir? 
PROTAGONIST 
I have an appraisal with Ms Barton. 
REPRESENTATIVE 
(to receptionist) 
Tell Kat her client is in the  
Fallow Room. 
INT. APPRAISAL ROOM – MOMENTS LATER 
The Protagonist admires the paintings on the walls. The door  opens and the Young Woman from the school gates comes in,  dressed for business. This is KAT BARTON. She looks bemused,  but gives him a genuine and friendly smile – 
KAT 
I’m sorry, I wasn’t notified of any  
appointments, Mr... 
Goya? 
Mr Goya? 
PROTAGONIST KAT 
The Protagonist opens his briefcase... 
PROTAGONIST 
No, I’m told you’re the person to  see about... 
Offers the drawing to her... 
...Goya. 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
She takes it, suddenly interested... 
KAT 
Wow. It’s extraordinary. 
She lays the drawing on the table and grabs a loupe – 
29.
PROTAGONIST 
What’s it worth? 
KAT 
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.  
There’s a lot of work before any  
kind of valuation – provenance,  
microscopic examination, X-rays... 
She is bent over the table, peering through the loupe.  The Protagonist studies her reaction as he – 
PROTAGONIST 
But what does your heart tell you? 
She steps back. Something about the drawing BOTHERS her... 
KAT 
I’m sorry, where did you say you  
acquired this drawing? 
PROTAGONIST 
Tomas Arepo. 
Kat rises and turns to face the Protagonist. Cold. 
KAT 
What do you want? 
PROTAGONIST 
What I want is complicated. 
KAT 
Do you work for my husband? 
PROTAGONIST 
I’ve never met your husband. That’s  
the reason I’m here. Is there  
somewhere we can talk? 
KAT 
In London? Not really. 
INT. RESTAURANT – NIGHT 
The Protagonist and Kat sit at a corner table. 
PROTAGONIST 
I bought my Goya for cents on the  
dollar from an irate Swiss banker. 
Traced it to Arepo, and realized  
I’d scored a bargain when he told  
me who’d paid top dollar for  
another one of his pictures. Your  
husband. 
30.
KAT 
Where’s the bargain? Your drawing’s  
an obvious fake. 
PROTAGONIST 
My drawing’s a very good fake – you  
know that better than anyone. The  
information’s the bargain. 
KAT 
The information that I helped  
defraud my own husband? 
PROTAGONIST 
He and I are in related businesses,  
but he’s a hard man to meet. If you 
and I were to make an arrangement – 
KAT 
Arrangement? You mean blackmail.  
Don’t be afraid of the word – my  
husband isn’t. And I’m sorry to  
tell you he got there first. 
PROTAGONIST 
He knows? And he’s never done  
anything about it? 
KAT 
Why would he? 
PROTAGONIST 
He paid nine million dollars – 
KAT 
Which would barely cover the  
holiday he just forced us on. 
PROTAGONIST 
Where’d you go – Mars? 
KAT 
Viet Nam. On our yacht. His yacht. 
Kat looks the Protagonist up and down... 
KAT (CONT'D) 
You’ve got the suit. The shoes, the  
watch. But I think you’re a little  
out of your depth. 
PROTAGONIST 
(sharp) 
People who’ve amassed fortunes like  
your husband’s aren’t generally 
okay with being cheated out of any  
of it. 
31.
Kat sips her wine. Wanting to talk. Knowing she shouldn’t. 
KAT 
The drawing is his hold over me. He  
threatened me with the police,  
prison, the works. He controls me,  
my contact with my son, everything.  
Leaving him would never have been  
easy, now it’s impossible. My life,  
now... You can’t fight. Just beg.  
Or worse. In Viet Nam I tried to  
love him again. If there were still  
love, he might give me my son. We  
sat on that bloody boat and watched  
the sunsets, imitating an earlier  
time. He seemed happy, so I asked.  
And he made me an offer. To let me  
go if I agreed to never see my son  
again. I expressed myself – 
INSERT CUT: a CRYSTAL BOWL of RASPBERRIES SMASHES onto the  polished wood of a yacht’s deck – 
KAT (CONT'D) 
Then took Max ashore. He called us,  
contrite. But when we came back... 
INSERT CUT: Kat and Max on a launch – Kat follows Max’s gaze  to see a FEMALE FIGURE SLIDE into the water... 
KAT (CONT'D) 
I glimpsed some other woman diving  
off the boat. And he’d vanished. 
I’ve never felt such envy. 
PROTAGONIST 
You don’t seem the jealous type. 
KAT 
Of her. You know how I dream of  
just diving off that boat? Of  
freedom? 
PROTAGONIST 
But you share a son. 
KAT 
And that’s my life. 
PROTAGONIST 
Did you know the drawing was a  
fake? 
KAT 
The authentication took months –  
Arepo and I became close, maybe too 
close. Maybe my judgement was  
clouded. I failed.  
(MORE) 
32.
KAT (CONT'D) 
But Andrei can’t conceive of  
failure, only betrayal. I didn’t  
betray my husband. In retrospect,  
maybe I missed my chance. 
PROTAGONIST 
And he let Arepo walk free? 
KAT 
If you’d actually met Arepo, as you  
claimed, you’d understand that he  
no longer walks anywhere. 
PROTAGONIST 
We spoke on the phone – 
KAT 
He can’t do that, either. 
The Protagonist considers this. 
PROTAGONIST 
Where’s the drawing? 
Why? 
KAT 
PROTAGONIST 
Get me the introduction, I’ll take  
the drawing out of the equation. No  
picture, no prosecution. No hold  
over you. 
Kat looks at the Protagonist. Not daring to hope. 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
I might just be your second chance  
– 
KAT 
(snaps) 
I don’t need redemption. 
PROTAGONIST 
At betrayal. 
A LARGE, WELL-DRESSED THUG sits down at the table. He takes a  green bean from the Protagonist’s plate and chews it  vacantly. This is VOLKOV. The Protagonist looks at Kat – 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
Friend of your husband? 
(she nods) 
You knew this would happen? 
33.
KAT 
They won’t kill you. Andrei 
dislikes tangling with local law  
enforcement on that level. 
PROTAGONIST 
You must really not have liked the  
look of me. 
KAT 
(rising) 
The look of you is fine. It’s  
better to get to the nasty part  
before I care one way or the other. 
He takes her hand, pulls her forward to kiss her cheek. 
PROTAGONIST 
(whispers) 
There’s a number in your left coat  
pocket. Don’t call from home. 
A Thug puts a MEATY HAND on the Protagonist’s shoulder. 
KAT 
You won’t be taking my call. 
PROTAGONIST 
I might surprise you. 
She leaves, BREEZING out through the kitchen... at Volkov’s  nod, two Thugs escort the Protagonist from his chair, heading  towards the kitchen – a WAITER moves to object – Volkov,  eating the Protagonist’s leftovers, pulls the Waiter up  short, shaking his head. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – MOMENTS LATER 
Kat exits the restaurant, DISTRAUGHT, walking past a waiting  THUG, then sliding into the back seat of a MERCEDES. 
INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS 
The driver is a GAUNT RUSSIAN. 
KAT 
Please, let’s go. 
The Gaunt Russian does not react, but watches through the  rear-view mirror as a THUG enters the kitchen – 
KAT (CONT'D) 
Can we get going? 
34.
INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist enters the kitchen, followed by the two  thugs. CHEFS and BUSBOYS retreat as the other thug  approaches... 
INT./EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS Kat turns from the window – 
Please! 
KAT 
GAUNT RUSSIAN 
He wants you to see... 
INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist JACKKNIFES HIS LOWER LEG UP into the crotch  of the thug behind him – SPINS him into the Thug next to him  – POTS and Pans flying – 
INT. RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS 
Volkov wipes sauce with bread, enjoying noises from the  kitchen... 
INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN – CONTINUOUS 
The Third Thug SWINGS – the Protagonist DODGES, takes the  blow on the shoulder – SLAMS his head into the Third Thug’s  neck, leaving him GASPING – the Protagonist GRABS the Third  Thug, RACING for the WINDOW... 
INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS 
Kat FLINCHES as, with a CRASH of plates, a body TUMBLES down  the stairs... 
GAUNT RUSSIAN 
And he gets what he wants. 
Then she sees something else... the Protagonist exits. 
KAT 
Not always, apparently. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND RESTAURANT – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist brushes himself clean, SPOTS the Mercedes,  starts moving towards it – 
35.
INT./EXT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS 
The Gaunt Russian SCRAMBLES to get the car moving. Kat looks  back at the Protagonist as the car ROARS away... 
EXT. SCHOOL GATES – DAY 
Kat is crouched, talking to her son, MAX. The Nanny hovers – 
MAX 
Anna says we’re going to Pompeii  
and see lava. 
KAT 
We’ll go together. I’ll be there,  
too. 
Max looks up at the Nanny. Kat hugs him, tight. The Nanny  TAPS Kat on the shoulder. Kat smiles at her son, tears in her  eyes, as the car pulls away. She pulls out her phone,  dials... hears a RINGTONE behind her –  
The Protagonist is there. 
PROTAGONIST 
I said I’d surprise you. He’s a  
cute kid. 
KAT 
Max. He’s everything. 
PROTAGONIST 
Where’s the drawing? 
KAT 
Oslo. At the airport. 
PROTAGONIST 
The airport? 
INSERT CUT: a Rotas car drives across an airport apron, and  down a ramp... 
KAT 
Do you know what a freeport is? 
PROTAGONIST 
A storage facility for art that’s  
been acquired – 
...into a SLEEK facility – the OSLO FREEPORT – as a STAFF  MEMBER stands ready to greet a new CLIENT... 
36.
KAT (V.O.) 
But not yet taxed. We started a  
network – Rotas, his construction  
company, built them, I brought in  
clients. The facilities are tax  
havens... 
The client is NEIL... he takes in the security  arrangements... 
PROTAGONIST (V.O.) 
The clients can view their  
investments – 
EXT. OSLO OPERA HOUSE – DAY 
The Protagonist is standing on the roof of the Oslo Opera  House, briefing Neil... 
PROTAGONIST (V.O.) 
– without importing them, so they  
avoid paying tax. 
NEIL 
Sort of a transit lounge for art? 
We go back to Kat, on the street, briefing the Protagonist... 
KAT 
Art, antiques, anything of value,  
really. 
Anything? 
PROTAGONIST KAT 
Anything legal... 
Then back to the Protagonist briefing Neil... 
PROTAGONIST 
But it’s not unlike the Swiss  
banking system. Opaque. 
Back to Kat – 
KAT 
Rotas has assets in the Oslo  
Freeport. I’m guessing it’s there. 
Guessing? 
Back to Oslo – 
Guessing? 
PROTAGONIST NEIL 
37.
Back to Kat – 
KAT 
We make trips there four or five  
times a year. 
PROTAGONIST 
To view art? 
KAT 
And whatever he does – it turns out  
art is of no importance to Andrei. 
PROTAGONIST 
But the freeports are. 
Kat nods. 
INT. FREEPORT – DAY 
A STAFF MEMBER brings Neil into a LUXURIOUS GALLERY – 
STAFF MEMBER 
Some freeports are just warehouses  
– here, you can actually enjoy your 
possessions... 
Then through doors into an ANGLED INNER CORRIDOR... 
STAFF MEMBER (CONT'D) 
The structure of the vaults is  
based on The Pentagon – each vault  
a separate structure within the  
others. Damage to one structure  
won’t compromise the others. 
They arrive at a door in the corridor. The Staff Member uses  his thumb to unlock a door – 
STAFF MEMBER (CONT'D) 
Clients have biometric access  
straight in off the tarmac. 
NEIL 
From the terminal? 
STAFF MEMBER 
(confused) 
From their private planes. 
Of course. 
NEIL 
Neil checks the locks as the Staff Member opens the door into  – 
38.
INT. FREEPORT SHIPPING AREA – CONTINUOUS 
A VAST SHIPPING AREA filled with SHIPPING CONTAINERS – 
STAFF MEMBER 
Our logistics department ships to  
and from other freeports without 
customs inspection... 
Neil notices ROTAS containers marked for delivery to TALLINN. 
NEIL (V.O.) 
What’re you hoping to find? 
EXT. OSLO OPERA HOUSE – DAY 
PROTAGONIST 
You really want to know? 
NEIL 
I’m not sure. 
PROTAGONIST 
Bring some lead-lined gloves. 
NEIL 
Jesus. Nuclear? 
PROTAGONIST 
When you’re on the tour – 
INT. FREEPORT – DAY 
Neil is shown back into one of the vaults... 
PROTAGONIST (V.O.) 
Pay attention to the fire  
precautions. 
NEIL 
Documents are vulnerable to – 
STAFF MEMBER 
Fire. Absolutely – 
NEIL 
I was going to say, water damage  
from sprinkler systems. 
STAFF MEMBER 
We don’t use sprinklers. 
(points to vents) 
The facility is flooded with halide  
gas, displacing all the air within  
seconds. 
39.
NEIL 
Can you show me? 
STAFF MEMBER 
If I did, we’d suffocate. 
NEIL 
What about the staff in here? 
STAFF MEMBER 
Halide only fills the vaults – they  
just have to get into the corridor. 
There’s a ten-second warning. 
NEIL 
You only give them ten seconds? 
STAFF MEMBER 
Our clients use us because we have  
no priorities above their property. 
Blimey. 
NEIL 
STAFF MEMBER 
Well, sir, you asked. 
INT. OSLO AIRPORT – DAY 
The Protagonist and Neil walk through the terminal. 
NEIL 
Vault doors are fireproof,  
hydraulic closers, simple key and  
electronic triggers. Surprisingly  
easy, once there’s a lockdown. 
PROTAGONIST 
Why a lockdown? 
NEIL 
Power switches to fail-safe,  
sealing outer doors, but inner  
doors revert to factory settings  
and pickable locks. Child’s play,  
really. 
PROTAGONIST 
Child’s play? They’re inside  
airport security. They have to  
worry about climate control, not  
armed raids. 
NEIL 
So how do we get fire power through  
the perimeter to trigger a 
lockdown? 
40.
EXT. CROWDED AIRPORT BUS, OSLO AIRPORT – DAY 
The Protagonist and Neil look across the tarmac to the  freeport structure. 
NEIL 
Back wall of the freeport... 
The Protagonist notices Neil start to smile... 
PROTAGONIST 
You’ve got something? 
NEIL 
You’re not going to like it. 
EXT. OSLO STREET – DAY 
The Protagonist looks at Neil in disbelief. 
PROTAGONIST 
You want to crash a plane? 
NEIL 
Not from the air, don’t be so  
dramatic. I want to run a jet off  
the taxiway, breach the rear wall,  
start a fire. 
PROTAGONIST 
How big a plane? 
NEIL 
Well, that part is a little  
dramatic. 
They approach a MAN sitting on a harbour-front bench. 
NEIL (CONT'D) 
This is Mahir. His team will work  
the plane. 
PROTAGONIST 
There can’t be passengers – 
MAHIR 
Norskfreight. They use the hangar  
on the west side of the freeport. 
PROTAGONIST 
You want to crash a transport  
plane? What about the crew? 
MAHIR 
We’ll pop the slides, chuck ’em off  
– 
41.
PROTAGONIST 
On the move? 
MAHIR 
What’s the problem? They’ll be  
fine. 
PROTAGONIST 
It seems... bold. 
MAHIR 
(smiles) 
‘Bold’ I’m fine with – I thought  
you were going to say nuts. 
PROTAGONIST 
And if you get caught? 
We won’t. If you do? 
MAHIR 
PROTAGONIST MAHIR 
Everyone assumes terrorism, but no  one’s died. Swift extradition, then lost in the system. It’ll barely  make the news. 
NEIL 
That may depend on the size of your  explosion. 
MAHIR 
Actually, the gold bars might get  some play. 
Gold bars? 
PROTAGONIST NEIL 
Norskfreight ships treasury gold  
once a month. 
MAHIR 
We blow the back, drop the gold out  
on the runway. 
NEIL 
No one’s going to be looking at  
your building, I guarantee you. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM, OSLO – DAY 
Neil takes LUNGFULS of air, hyperventilating – Mahir starts a  stopwatch. The Protagonist studies some plans... 
42.
PROTAGONIST 
The space at the centre of the  
pentagon’s too big... there’s  
something there, not marked. 
Neil runs out of air. Mahir checks his watch. 
NEIL 
A vault within a vault? 
Maybe. 
PROTAGONIST MAHIR 
Eighty-five seconds. 
Ample. 
NEIL MAHIR 
Won’t you be running? 
(turns to the  
Protagonist) 
Start packing. 
The Protagonist starts BREATHING HARD... 
EXT. FREEPORT – NIGHT 
The Protagonist and Neil, carrying BRIEFCASES, head inside. 
EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS 
Two WORKERS (Mahir and his associate, ROHAN) back up a MEAL  TRUCK to a TRANSPORT PLANE. They LIFT the cargo until it is  level with the front side door... 
INT. FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist follows Neil through security. Their  briefcases are examined, finding FRAMED DOCUMENTS... 
INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS 
Mahir and Rohan carry crew meals through the door and into  the galley, where they stack them into the catering units,  supervised by a GUARD... 
INT. GALLERY SPACE/LOUNGE, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
The Staff Member brings Neil an espresso. The Protagonist  subtly checks his watch... 
43.
INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS 
Mahir points past the Guard – 
MAHIR 
You gonna eat that? 
The Guard turns – Mahir GRABS him from behind, Rohan stuffs a  COTTON PAD over the Guard’s face, rendering him unconscious.  They ROLL him into the catering-truck lift... Mahir pops out  and signals ANOTHER GUARD... 
THREE GUARDS have been dumped into the truck lift – Rohan sends it DOWN, SEALS the plane door. Mahir approaches the  cockpit as the PILOTS perform checks – SHOWS THEM HIS GUN... 
MAHIR (CONT'D) 
Alright, lads? 
INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
The Staff Member leads Neil and the Protagonist into the  vaults... 
INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS 
At gunpoint, the Pilots nervously pull back from the hangar.  Rohan checks the stacks of GOLD BARS secured in the rear. 
EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS 
The plane is TOWED back onto the taxiway and lifts its  engines, easing forward... 
INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS 
Rohan SLASHES the restraining straps – CROUCHES behind the  pile of gold – pulls out a GRENADE – GRABS the nearest gold  bar and STUFFS it into his waistband before PULLING THE  PIN... 
INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
The Staff Member shows Neil and the Protagonist into a vault.  Neil puts down his briefcase – pulls out the framed  documents. 
EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS 
The transport plane BARRELS down the taxiway... 
44.
INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS 
Rohan TOSSES the grenade behind the gold at the tail of the  plane and DUCKS as it BLOWS –

BLASTING a hole in the rear of the plane... GOLD BARS POUR  OUT, CLATTERING ACROSS THE TARMAC... 
INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
Hearing the distant explosion, the Protagonist and Neil start  PACKING AIR... the Staff Member stares at them, quizzical – 
NEIL 
Yoga. 
(between breaths) 
INT. COCKPIT, TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS 
Mahir forces the Pilots from their seats – 
EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS 
The INFLATABLE SLIDE BURSTS OPEN, DRAGGING on the asphalt, as  the Pilots roll onto it, SCRAMBLING DOWN to the ground,  ROLLING AWAY from the giant plane... 
INT. COCKPIT, TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS 
Mahir TURNS the stick HARD LEFT, AIMING AT THE REAR WALL OF  THE FREEPORT – 
INT. TRANSPORT PLANE – CONTINUOUS 
Rohan lowers a ladder behind the forward landing gear – he  and Mahir climb down – 
EXT. TAXIWAY, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS 
Mahir and Rohan jump down onto the asphalt, racing back  between the wheels as the giant plane SMASHES INTO THE BRICK  WALL OF THE FREEPORT, ERUPTING IN A MASSIVE EXPLOSION... 
INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
The vault is ROCKED by the explosion – ALARMS SCREAM – DOORS  START CLOSING – Neil looks, panicked, at the Staff Member – 
45.
NEIL 
Ten seconds, right?! 
The Staff Member BOLTS – PUSHING PAST THEM – they take a last  gulp of air – GAS HISSES IN. They pull apart the frames of  the documents, BREAKING THEM INTO LOCK-PICKING APPARATUS –  lockpicks, small crowbar – they go to work on the INNER DOOR,  PRYING open a panel – HOT-WIRING it – the door SLIDES UP – 
INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
They BURST into the corridor, GASPING – the door SLAMS DOWN  behind them – they HUSTLE down to the next vault door – get  to work. The door opens, they GULP AIR, then RACE inside – 
INT. VAULT 2, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
– round the corner past RACKS, CRATES, some BROKEN – stop at  the next door, the Protagonist picks the lock – his PICK  BREAKS – Neil BOLTS back to where they entered – the  Protagonist STRUGGLES, pulling out pieces of the pick – Neil  gets to the first door –  
NO HANDLE – the Protagonist uses a different tool – Neil  SMASHES the door, full-blown PANIC – he looks to the end of  the vault where the ROLLER DOOR is BROKEN at the bottom,  halide gas HISSING OUT –  
Neil races towards it – the Protagonist gets his door OPEN –  Neil STUMBLES past – the Protagonist DRAGS him through the  door – 
INT. INNER CORRIDOR – CONTINUOUS 
They lie GASPING. Neil hears something, looks around – 
NEIL 
(urgent whisper) 
There’s someone in here with us! 
The Protagonist is up, moving down the corridor... 
They arrive at two doors, side by side: the Rotas vault. They  each work on a door. Neil’s OPENS – 
NEIL (CONT'D) 
Need a hand? 
The Protagonist works his door... nothing. 
PROTAGONIST 
Actually, yes. 
Neil leans over, hits ‘ENTER’, the door OPENS. 
46.
INT. ROTAS VAULT – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist enters a room, one side of which is a LONG  GLASS WINDOW. Neil is on the other side of the glass, in an  IDENTICAL ROOM. There are BULLET HOLES in the glass. At the  end of each room is a tube, like a sealed in REVOLVING DOOR.  The Protagonist’s feet crunch BROKEN GLASS... 
Neil examines BULLET HOLES in the wall opposite the glass.  WISPS of SMOKE gather near the holes – Neil reaches up – 
PROTAGONIST 
Don’t touch them – 
NEIL 
What the hell happened here? 
The Protagonist sees a STRIPPED AUTOMATIC PISTOL on the  floor. He picks it up, thinking – 
PROTAGONIST 
It hasn’t happened, yet.  
Neil looks at the Protagonist, quizzical – A LOUD HUM STARTS  UP from the revolving door... the Protagonist looks down –  MOVEMENT beneath his feet – the DEBRIS – SMOKE GATHERS – the  revolving doors ROTATE, OPENING – a BLACK-CLAD FIGURE in a  GAS MASK LEAPS BACKWARDS from the tube – reaching behind  itself to GRAB the stripped automatic in the Protagonist’s  hand – 
On Neil’s side an identical BLACK-CLAD FIGURE LEAPS out  FORWARDS – knocks Neil over, moving for the vault door – 
A SLIDE jumps into the Backwards Figure’s hand – he  REASSEMBLES the gun in the Protagonist’s hand – a MAGAZINE  jumping up to LOAD IT – BLAM! 
A bullet is SUCKED OUT OF THE WALL – THROUGH THE GLASS –  ‘HEALING’ THE BULLET HOLES – the Protagonist STRUGGLES with  the Backwards Figure – whose REVERSE MOVEMENTS seem ALIEN and  IMPOSSIBLE – 
Neil gives chase – RACING out of the vault door – 
The Backwards Figure pulls the Protagonist sideways, lining  up his head with the next bullet hole – BLAM! GLASS FLIES UP  as the shot JUST MISSES the Protagonist’s head – 
INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
Neil CHASES the Forwards Figure down the corridor – 
47.
INT. ROTAS VAULT – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist STRUGGLES – the Backwards Figure PUSHES him  towards the next bullet hole, STRANGE REVERSE GROANING  building in its throat, behind the black gas mask, the GROAN  PEAKING AS the Protagonist takes his PICK and STABS the  Backwards Figure in the arm and SMACKS the Figure’s gun out  of its hand – it BOUNCES out the door – 
The Figure RISES into the Protagonist’s arms – PULLS him  backwards – we can’t tell if it’s PUSHING or the Protagonist  is PULLING as they move backwards through the door – 
INT. CORRIDOR, VAULT – CONTINUOUS 
The Figure PUSHES/PULLS the Protagonist down the corridor – 
INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
Neil RACES around a corner, GRABS the Figure’s MASK, which  COMES OFF – he looks, SURPRISED, at the Figure’s face, WHICH  WE CANNOT SEE, then TURNS, RACING back the way he came... 
INT. CORRIDOR, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist and the Backwards Figure struggle into – 
INT. VAULT 2, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
They SMASH into the racks and crates – the Protagonist GRABS  the gun – raises it to the Figure’s head – 
NEIL (O.S.) 
NO! Don’t kill him! 
The Protagonist freezes – Neil steps up, DESPERATE – 
NEIL (CONT'D) 
We need to know if you’re  
compromised. 
The Protagonist THROWS the Figure to the ground – 
PROTAGONIST 
Why are you here?! 
The Protagonist tries to rip off the gas mask, but it is  strapped tight – the REVERSE KEENING gets LOUDER and LOUDER.  The Protagonist STEPS onto the Figure’s injured arm... 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
Who sent you?! 
48.
The Figure’s reverse screaming gets louder – the Protagonist  KICKS its arm, HARD, AGAIN AND AGAIN – 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
HOW DID YOU KNOW WE’D BE HERE! 
A BOOM! from outside – AIR starts BLOWING ACROSS the  Backwards Figure, SUCKING underneath the broken roller door –  the Backwards Figure SLIDES impossibly across the floor and  underneath the door which SLAMS shut, unbroken behind him. 
The Protagonist and Neil look at each other... 
NEIL 
We have to go. 
EXT. APRON, OSLO AIRPORT – CONTINUOUS 
One of the plane’s JET ENGINES has come loose, STILL  THRUSTING, SWINGING AROUND, wreaking HAVOC for the EMERGENCY  SERVICES – an AMBULANCE SKIDS SIDEWAYS, avoiding the  THRUST...  
Mahir and Rohan stand at a distance, watching the MAYHEM  along with DOZENS of other UNIFORMED AIRPORT WORKERS... 
INT./EXT. FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
EMTS race in past the Staff Member... 
INT. VAULTS, FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS 
Neil moves to the other door – works the lock – SIRENS sound  – 
PROTAGONIST 
What happened to the other guy? 
NEIL 
I took care of him. 
The door opens – they slip into the outer vault – 
INT. OUTER VAULT, FREEPORT – MOMENTS LATER 
They reassemble the document frames, then LIE DOWN,  ‘unconscious’ – EMERGENCY SERVICES BURSTS IN... 
INT. HOTEL ROOM, OSLO – DAWN 
Neil hangs up his phone – 
49.
NEIL 
Mahir and Rohan slipped out clean. 
(turns to the  
Protagonist) 
I’ve seen too much and I’m still  
alive. Which means you’ve decided  
to trust me. 
PROTAGONIST 
Or I’ve lost my edge. 
NEIL 
Oh, your edge is intact. 
The Protagonist looks at Neil. 
PROTAGONIST 
There’s a cold war. 
Nuclear? Temporal. 
NEIL 
PROTAGONIST NEIL 
(skeptical) 
Time travel? 
PROTAGONIST 
No. Technology that can invert an  object’s entropy. 
NEIL 
You mean reverse chronology. Like  Feynman and Wheeler’s notion that a positron is an electron moving  backwards in time. 
PROTAGONIST 
Sure, that’s exactly what I meant. 
NEIL 
I’ve a master’s in physics. 
PROTAGONIST 
Well, try to keep up. 
NEIL 
The implications of this are – 
PROTAGONIST 
Beyond secret. 
NEIL 
Then why’d you take me in? 
50.
PROTAGONIST 
I thought we’d find the drawing and  
a couple boxes of bullets. 
NEIL 
You were as surprised as I was. 
PROTAGONIST 
I’m going back to Mumbai for  
answers. I’ll set you up as go between. But remember – to you, all  
this is about plutonium. Or when  
we’re done, they’ll kill you. 
NEIL 
Won’t you have to anyway? 
PROTAGONIST 
I’d rather it was my decision. 
NEIL 
So would I. I think. 
INT./EXT. FERRY BOAT, MUMBAI – DAY 
The Protagonist boards, approaching Priya at the rail. 
PRIYA 
I don’t like to leave my house. 
PROTAGONIST 
And I don’t like bungee jumping.  
But we need to talk. 
PRIYA 
What about? 
Inversion. 
PROTAGONIST PRIYA 
We spoke about it – 
PROTAGONIST 
I don’t remember anything about  people being inverted – 
PRIYA 
We’re trying to do with inversion  what we couldn’t do with the atomic  bomb – uninvent it. Divide and  contain the knowledge. Ignorance is  our ammunition – the more any one  of us knows, the greater the risk  that we’re actually making the  situation worse. 
Risk more. 
PROTAGONIST 
51.
Priya gestures at the paper. A headline: ‘OSLO GOLD FREIGHT  CRASH – TERRORISM? ROBBERY? BOTH?’ 
Your work? 
PRIYA 
The Protagonist nods. 
PRIYA (CONT'D) 
What did you find in the vaults? 
PROTAGONIST 
Two antagonists, one inverted. We  took out the regular one, the  
inverted one got away. 
PRIYA 
Both emerged at the same moment? 
Yeah. 
PROTAGONIST PRIYA 
They were the same person. You saw  someone re-inverting. Sator’s built a turnstile in that vault. 
Turnstile? 
PROTAGONIST PRIYA 
A machine for inverting. 
PROTAGONIST 
You told me the technology hasn’t  been invented, yet. 
PRIYA 
It hasn’t. He’s been given it by  the future. 
For what? 
PROTAGONIST PRIYA 
You’ve the best chance of finding  out. 
EXT. MUMBAI STREET – MOMENTS LATER They walk, BODYGUARDS at a discreet distance. 
PRIYA 
Have you met him? 
52.
PROTAGONIST 
I was close. 
PRIYA 
Get closer. 
PROTAGONIST 
I’ve been compromised. Unless that  
antagonist was a coincidence. 
PRIYA 
The wife set you up? 
PROTAGONIST 
Maybe. There’s a good chance I get  
killed as soon as I go back in. 
PRIYA 
This was always a suicide mission –  
that’s why they recruited a corpse. 
PROTAGONIST 
Who did? Who are we working for? 
PRIYA 
Everyone. Survival. You need more,  
consider yourself working for me. 
PROTAGONIST 
Well, Boss, I need a way to  
succeed. 
Priya thinks. Looks at the Protagonist. Deciding. 
PRIYA 
What if you have something he  
needs? 
Such as? 
PROTAGONIST PRIYA 
Plutonium 241. Sator tried to lift  the only loose 241 from under a CIA  team at the opera siege in Kiev. He  got the team, but not the 241. 
Who did? 
PROTAGONIST PRIYA 
Ukrainian security services. It’s  moving through Tallinn in a week. 
53.
PROTAGONIST 
Helping an arms dealer steal  
weapons-grade plutonium is  
unacceptable. I’m just gonna take  
him out. 
PRIYA 
No. Sator has to stay alive until  
we know his part in things.  
Leverage the situation without  
losing control of the 241. 
PROTAGONIST 
It’s too dangerous. 
PRIYA 
A terrorist bomb, even one that  
kills millions, is nothing compared  
with what happens if we don’t stop  
Sator. 
PROTAGONIST 
From. Doing. What? 
Priya looks up the road at the cars STREAMING past... 
PRIYA 
We’re being attacked. Not by  
terrorists or rogue states... 
Who, then? 
PROTAGONIST PRIYA 
We’re being attacked by the future.  And we’re fighting over time. 
Time? 
PROTAGONIST PRIYA 
Theirs is running out, so they’re  
coming for ours. And Sator is  
helping. You have to find out how. 
EXT. TERRACE, AMALFI COAST – DAY 
The Protagonist leaves the tourists behind, heading down a  leafy path to emerge at a terrace overlooking the sea. Kat  stands there, alone. The Protagonist falls in beside her. 
KAT 
I saw the news from Oslo. Do you  
have the drawing? 
54.
PROTAGONIST 
You don’t have to worry about it  
any more. 
KAT 
You destroyed it? 
PROTAGONIST 
I didn’t think you’d want it back. 
KAT 
Does he know? 
PROTAGONIST 
Not yet, so sit tight. 
KAT 
Sit tight? Why? Every day my son  
spends with that monster, he thinks  
a little less of me. 
PROTAGONIST 
It won’t be long. In the meantime,  
introduce me. 
As what? 
KAT 
PROTAGONIST 
I’m a former First Secretary from  the American Embassy in Riyadh, we met at a party last June – 
KAT 
We were at a party in Riyadh, but I  don’t think it was June – 
PROTAGONIST 
June 29th. 7 for 7:30, salmon on  the printed menu swapped for sea  bass on the night. Sator left  early, that’s when we met. Don’t  offer any of this, it’s there if he  asks. I came into Shipley’s in  London, you ran into me here and  want to show me the yacht. 
KAT 
He’ll think we’re having an affair. 
PROTAGONIST 
And he’ll want to meet me. 
KAT 
Or have you killed. 
PROTAGONIST 
Let me worry about that. 
55.
KAT 
Did I look worried? 
EXT. DOCK, AMALFI – DAY 
The Protagonist and Kat look out at an enormous yacht. 
KAT 
Sleeps 70, with crew. Four tenders,  
two helicopters, missile defences – 
PROTAGONIST 
Jesus. Worried about pirates? 
KAT 
Andrei loves playing one government  
off another. The day they turn,  
that’s his refuge. 
PROTAGONIST 
What if I joined you? 
She nods at Volkov, holding the launch’s line. 
KAT 
I’m not sure Volkov’s taking  
passengers just now. 
PROTAGONIST 
Then let’s take mine. 
The Protagonist nods at Volkov as they walk past. EXT. HARBOUR, AMALFI – MOMENTS LATER 
The Protagonist GUNS his boat hard, carving a GLITTERING PATH  across the calm harbour. Kat sits, enjoying the speed. 
The Protagonist pulls up alongside the yacht, CREW MEMBERS  SCRAMBLE, unaccustomed to unauthorized approaches. The  Protagonist follows Kat’s gaze to a FIGURE above, but the sun  is behind it. Kat steps onto the yacht. 
The Protagonist gives the figure a JAUNTY SALUTE. No  response. The Protagonist ZIPS back towards shore, passing  the yacht’s launch. He waves at Volkov. 
INT./EXT. YACHT – MOMENTS LATER 
Follow Kat into the enormous lounge. She drops her bags – 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) 
Who’s the American? 
56.
She turns. A middle-aged man with cold eyes and a thin beard  stands in the doorway. THIS IS SATOR. 
A friend. 
KAT 
SATOR 
The man from Shipley’s? 
KAT 
Who you tried to have beaten up? 
SATOR 
I ask again. Who is he? 
KAT 
We met in Riyadh. In June at the  
American Embassy. 
SATOR 
Good with fists for a diplomat... 
KAT 
Paranoia’s your department. He  
seems nice, I invited him to the  
dinner.(turns away) 
Max?... Max?!... 
SATOR 
He’s visiting Pompeii and  
Herculaneum. 
KAT 
Overnight? You just sent him off?! 
SATOR 
He’s my son. 
KAT 
Our son. I told him I’d go with him  
– 
SATOR 
I explained you were busy. With  
your friend. 
He turns, walks away. She watches him leave. 
INT. RESTAURANT, AMALFI COAST – EVENING 
The Protagonist walks towards a table where Sator, holding  court, attacks some crabs. Volkov stops the Protagonist and  FRISKS him, in full view of the diners. 
57.
PROTAGONIST 
Where I’m from, you buy me dinner  
first. 
Without looking, Sator gestures at a seat, Volkov lets the  Protagonist pass. He sits. 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
Mr Sator? I’m – 
SATOR 
(quiet) 
Don’t bother. Just tell me if  
you’ve slept with my wife, yet. 
The Protagonist glances up at Kat, opposite, chatting. 
PROTAGONIST 
No. Not yet. 
A glance from Sator between buttery mouthfuls of crab. 
SATOR 
How would you like to die? 
Old. 
PROTAGONIST SATOR 
You chose the wrong profession. 
Sator returns a toast from a grinning guest. Reaches a greasy  palm to the Protagonist’s cheek, as if in friendliness... 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
There’s a walled garden up the  
road. We’re going to take you  
there, cut your throat, not across,  
in the middle, like a hole. Then we  
take your balls, stuff them in the  
cut, block the windpipe. 
Complex. 
PROTAGONIST SATOR 
It’s gratifying to watch a man you  don’t like try to pull his own  balls out of his throat before he  chokes. 
PROTAGONIST 
Is this how you treat all your  guests? 
SATOR 
The ones using my family to get to  me. 
58.
PROTAGONIST 
How else is someone supposed to get  
to you? 
SATOR 
Only a fool wants to be near me. 
PROTAGONIST 
Or someone who has something worth  
delaying your gratification for... 
Sator signals Volkov – Kat glances over as Volkov RISES – 
SATOR 
We’re finished. 
PROTAGONIST 
Do you like opera? 
At this, Sator pauses. Waves off Volkov. 
SATOR 
Not here. You sail? 
PROTAGONIST 
I’ve messed around on boats. 
SATOR 
Be on the dock at eight. Ready to  
do more than mess around. 
Kat, relieved, watches the Protagonist leave. 
EXT. DINING ROOM, YACHT – MORNING 
Kat enters, dressed in sailing gear. Sator is already seated,  similarly dressed, reading his phone, with a cup of coffee. 
KAT 
Max has missed too much school this  
year. I’m taking him back to 
England. 
SATOR 
No, you’re not. He has a tutor  
here. 
KAT 
The school won’t be okay with – 
SATOR 
Yes, they will. 
KAT 
Can I finish?! 
59.
SATOR 
Look around you – he has everything  
he needs here. 
A SERVANT places a plate with a silver cover in front of Kat,  then pours her coffee. 
KAT 
You don’t care what he needs. You  
bought the trappings of a king, but 
we both know you’re a grubby little  
man playing power games with a wife  
who doesn’t love him any more. 
Sator looks at her. 
SATOR 
You seem spirited today. 
KAT 
Do I? 
(defiant) 
Sator barely nods at the servant, who pulls off the lid... 
SATOR 
Yes. You do. 
On the plate, instead of breakfast, is a small drawing. A  ‘Rubens’. Kat freezes. 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
Were you worried it had been  
destroyed? Rest assured, instinct  
told me to remove it from the  
vault. I’ve always had instincts  
about the future. That’s how I  
built this life you no longer  
value. 
Kat looks up at him, not knowing what to say or do. 
EXT. DOCK, AMALFI – MORNING 
The Protagonist stands on the dock, dressed for sailing,  watching the launch approach... 
Morning. 
PROTAGONIST 
As he gets on, Kat ignores him. Sator enjoys this. 
EXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI – MOMENTS LATER 
The Protagonist tries to catch Kat’s eye, but she will not  look his way.  
60.
Sator hands the Protagonist a HARNESS and a HELMET... he  looks at them, taken aback, then looks ahead – towards TWO  GRAPHITE DARK, HIGHEST TECH AMERICA’S CUP SAILING YACHTS,  trimmed and ready. 
PROTAGONIST 
(impressed) 
When you said sailing... 
EXT. SAILING YACHT DECK – MOMENTS LATER 
Kat gets on, followed by Sator and the Protagonist. The  rigging crew departs. Kat checks the sheets and winches.  Sator indicates the harness. 
SATOR 
You know how? 
PROTAGONIST 
Aye, Captain. 
Sator gestures at Kat. 
SATOR 
She’s captain. 
EXT. OPEN OCEAN, AMALFI – LATER 
The boats FLY, SKIMMING THE WATER ON THEIR HYDROFOILS...  Sator and the Protagonist are next to each other, standing on  one pontoon, LEANING OUT IN THEIR HARNESSES... Kat is at the  wheel, concentrating... 
SATOR 
What do you know about opera? 
PROTAGONIST 
In 2008 a remote Russian missile  
station was overwhelmed and held  
for a week. When the station was  
retaken, the plutonium 241 on one 
warhead was three quarters of a  
kilo lighter. The missing 241  
surfaced at the opera-house siege  
in Kiev on the 14th. 
SATOR 
You’re well informed. But that  
doesn’t mean you have the  
plutonium. 
PROTAGONIST 
I didn’t say I had it. I’m saying I  
know how to get it – 
61.
KAT (O.S.) 
COMING ABOUT! 
Kat SWINGS the boat into the wind, SAIL FLAPPING FURIOUSLY as  the wind catches it on the other side, and Sator and the  Protagonist DUCK under the boom, RACING to the other side,  their harnesses SNAPPING TAUT as they lean out... 
SATOR 
What do you propose? 
PROTAGONIST 
Partnership. 
SATOR 
I wouldn’t partner with you. 
Kat works the wheel, tracking the other boat. Her look is one  of BOTTLED RAGE... 
PROTAGONIST 
What’s wrong with me? 
SATOR 
You know how to handle yourself,  
you have no record. 
PROTAGONIST 
Someone in the arms trade with  
training who covers his tracks? Not  
that shocking. 
SATOR 
For an intelligence agent. 
Sator holds the Protagonist’s gaze... 
KAT 
Secure your jib line. 
The Protagonist turns – Kat leans in to Sator – 
KAT (CONT'D) 
Burn in hell, Andrei – 
– and YANKS HIS QUICK-RELEASE – he FLIES off the boat,  SMASHING HEAD-FIRST into the waves – 
The Protagonist sees Sator FACE-DOWN, UNCONSCIOUS – he  UNCLIPS, JUMPS to the wheel, SPINNING the boat OFF THE WIND – 
KAT (CONT'D) 
YOU CAN’T JIBE A BOAT LIKE THIS – ! 
The Protagonist STEERS the boat across the wind, SNAPPING THE  BOOM ACROSS, ALMOST LOSING THE MAST – 
62.
PROTAGONIST 
You can if you have to – 
He RELEASES THE SHEETS, SPILLING WIND, LOSING SPEED – as they  pass Sator he DIVES into the water – GRABS the oligarch –  PULLS his face out of the water... Sator starts COUGHING... 
INT. STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – DAY 
The Protagonist dries himself – the door opens – Kat BURSTS  in – 
KAT 
WHY DIDN’T YOU LET HIM DROWN?! 
She is on him, smashing her fists into his chest – 
PROTAGONIST 
I need him. 
KAT 
To sell guns?! 
PROTAGONIST 
I’m not who you think I am. 
KAT 
That, I know – he showed me the  
drawing. 
I’m sorry. 
PROTAGONIST KAT 
Do you have any idea what you’ve  
done? 
PROTAGONIST 
I had to get close to him. I don’t  
know what you think your husband is  
– 
KAT 
We both know he’s an arms dealer. 
PROTAGONIST 
He’s so much more. 
KAT 
What, then? 
PROTAGONIST 
Andrei Sator holds all our lives in  
his hands. Not just yours. 
She looks bemused. A KNOCK at the door – she hides behind it  – 
63.
VOLKOV 
Mr Sator wants to see you. 
The Protagonist nods – pushes the door – Volkov stops it – 
Now. 
VOLKOV (CONT'D) PROTAGONIST 
He wants to see me without pants? 
Volkov lets the door shut. The Protagonist turns to Kat – 
Trust me. 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) KAT 
Save it. I’m not falling for it  
twice. 
The Protagonist looks at Kat. Sighs. 
PROTAGONIST 
You have a better option? 
She looks into the Protagonist’s eyes. Assessing. 
KAT 
Whatever it takes to get what you  
want. Just like him. Not a second’s 
thought about me. My son. What do  
you think he’s going to do to me 
now? 
He pulls a gun from his bag. Offers it to her. 
PROTAGONIST 
Try not to use this – 
She takes it – lets it point at him. 
On anyone. 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
INT. STUDY, SATOR’S YACHT – EVENING 
The Protagonist is shown in. Sator is sitting behind his  desk. A DOCTOR is taking his blood pressure. 
Enough – 
SATOR 
Sator RIPS the cuff off his arm, sending the doctor out –  checks a fitness tracker on his wrist. 
64.
SATOR (CONT'D) 
See? Pulse of a man half my age.  
Drink with me. 
Sator pours them both tumblers of vodka. 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
It seems I now owe you my life. 
PROTAGONIST 
It’s nothing. 
Sator fixes his black gaze on the Protagonist. 
SATOR 
My life is not nothing. And I don’t  
like to be in debt. 
PROTAGONIST 
Then pay me. No retribution against  
your wife. 
A dangerous beat. Then Sator GRINS – 
SATOR 
You think she released my harness? 
(laughs) 
It was my own mistake. 
PROTAGONIST 
Then help me steal the 241. I need  
resources. It’s weapons-grade 
plutonium – that means special  
handling, containment facilities – 
SATOR 
I know what it means. You lecture  
me about radiation. Andrei Sator, 
digging plutonium from the rubble  
of my city as a teenager? 
Where? 
PROTAGONIST SATOR 
Stalsk-12. My home. 
Sator sips his drink. Looks the Protagonist in the eye. 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
One pod of a warhead exploded at  
ground level, scattering the  
others. They needed people to find  
the plutonium... 
65.
INSERT CUT: IN A DESOLATE STREET, SNOW FALLS ON A HAZMAT SUITED SCAVENGER – A YOUNG SATOR WALKING IN FRONT OF A  MASSIVE MINING MACHINE, CARRYING A GIANT CROWBAR AND A GEIGER  COUNTER... 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
It became my first contract –  
nobody else even bid. They thought  
it was a death sentence. 
INSERT CUT: YOUNG SATOR SPOTS THE MACHINE UNEARTHING A LARGE  METAL CAPSULE. A FELLOW WORKER SEES THE SAME THING... 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
But one man’s probability of death  
is another man’s possibility for a  
life... 
INSERT CUT: YOUNG SATOR OPENS THE CAPSULE. HE LIFTS OUT SOME  PAPERS, WHICH HAVE HIS NAME ON THEM, REVEALING GOLD BARS  UNDERNEATH. THE FELLOW WORKER LEANS IN, STUDYING THE GOLD.  THEY MAKE EYE CONTACT... SATOR STRIKES THE FELLOW WORKER WITH  HIS CROWBAR, KILLING HIM... 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
I staked my claim in the new  
Russia. Even now, my company is the  
only one to operate in the ruins. 
PROTAGONIST 
The 241’s being transported through  
Northern Europe on its way to the 
long-term nuclear storage depot at  
Trieste. I’m told you have  
resources in Tallinn. 
Sator downs his vodka. 
SATOR 
Stay with us tonight. I insist. 
INT. KAT’S STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – NIGHT 
Kat slips the gun under her mattress, feels the lump – pulls  it out – moves to the desk, puts it in her jewellery case –  hearing a noise she jumps onto the bed, picks up a book. The  door opens. Sator. He locks the door. 
KAT 
What do you want, Andrei? 
SATOR 
We’re going to talk about today. 
KAT 
No, we’re not. 
66.
He removes a DIAMOND CUFFLINK... 
No? 
SATOR 
Kat starts to get off the bed – 
KAT 
Don’t think for a minute you can  
treat me the way you treat your  
other women. 
Sator shifts to lean on the desk, cutting her off from the  jewellery box. She sits back down. He removes his belt... 
SATOR 
And how do you imagine I treat  
these other women? 
Sator slips the cufflink through a belt hole... 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
You think I force them into  
conversation? 
Sator tests the diamond studded belt against his palm. 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
You want to be quiet? Fine... 
He tosses her a pillow. 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
Bite down on that... 
Sator moves towards her – she looks at the jewellery box on  the desk – no way around him – Sator looks down at her. She  looks up at his cold eyes... 
KAT 
Even a soul as blank and brittle as  
yours needs a response. Is fear and 
pain enough? Because that’s all I  
have to offer. 
SATOR 
Then it’ll have to do. 
KAT 
Why didn’t you just throw me out? 
SATOR 
If I can’t have you, no one can. 
KAT 
At what point do you give up and  
kill me? 
67.
Sator shrugs, wraps the belt a turn around his fist... 
Turn over. 
SATOR KAT 
Touch me, I scream so loud he  
hears. 
SATOR 
You think I’d let him interfere? 
KAT 
If he tried you’d have to kill him.  End of deal. So leave me the fuck 
alone. 
A KNOCK at the door. 
NOT NOW! 
SATOR 
But he hears a RUMBLING... Sator, without a word, exits – 
EXT. SATOR’S YACHT, AMALFI COAST – NIGHT 
Sator GRABS binoculars from one of his men, peering out – A helicopter EMERGES from the darkness, THUNDERING IN... 
INT. GUEST STATEROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist listens to the incoming chopper – pulls on a  black Windbreaker – quietly opens his door... 
INT. PASSAGE, BELOW DECKS, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS The Protagonist makes his way, looking for an exit... 
EXT. SATOR’S YACHT, AMALFI COAST – CONTINUOUS 
The chopper descends to the landing pad – rotors turning as  Sator signals his men to head in... 
EXT. SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist is on a roof overlooking the helipad... 
He watches Sator’s men remove a LARGE, GRUBBY CAPSULE and  take it below as the chopper LIFTS OFF... 
68.
INT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist makes his way through the storage area.  Peering through a window, he sees – 
INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS 
Crew gathered around the capsule. Sator enters, wipes dirt  from the latches and opens it. Sator puts his hand over the  open capsule, letting small, flat GOLD BARS leap from the  capsule into his hand... he looks up, expectantly...  
The Crew SHOVES a CREW MEMBER forwards, onto his knees...  eyes downcast, he reaches behind – pulls a gold bar from his  rear pocket. He offers it to Sator with TREMBLING hands.  
Sator takes it, eyes never leaving the Crew Member... who  finally, tentatively looks up –  
BAM! Sator JABS him in the mouth with the gold bar, then  SMASHES him over the head – 
INT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist is REPULSED by what he sees... 
INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS 
Sator steps back, breathless, from the Small Crew Member, who  lies motionless on the ground. 
As Sator raises his wrist to check his fitness tracker, BLOOD  drips from the gold bar in his hand. 
SATOR 
Ninety-eight. Not bad for such  
exertion. 
EXT. STORAGE AREA, SATOR’S YACHT – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist SENSES, TURNS – CRACK! Volkov smashes his jaw  – KICKS him in the ribs – pistol-whips him... 
INT. ENGINE ROOM, SATOR’S YACHT – MOMENTS LATER The Protagonist, bleeding, is SHOVED into the room – 
VOLKOV 
He was at the window. 
Sator looks at the Protagonist, who nods at the capsule – 
69.
PROTAGONIST 
I was curious. 
SATOR 
My property shouldn’t concern you.  
Who are you? How do you come by 
your information about the opera? 
PROTAGONIST 
Do I work for intelligence  
services? Several, just like you.  
You wouldn’t do business with  
someone who wasn’t savvy enough to  
be recruited. Hell, the CIA  
provides two-thirds of the market  
for fissile material. 
SATOR 
They’re usually buying, not  
selling. But we do live in a  
twilight world... 
PROTAGONIST 
Is that Whitman? It’s pretty. 
SATOR 
Next warning’s a bullet in your  
brain. 
PROTAGONIST 
No balls in my throat? 
SATOR 
There’ll be no time for such things  
in Tallinn. 
Sator gestures to his men – they lift the capsule. The  
Protagonist spots DRIED MUD from the latches on the table... 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
Make your way there. I want Volkov  
on the team. 
The Protagonist struggles to his feet. 
PROTAGONIST 
No. I spring the materials, you pay  
me off. Your wife does the  
exchange. 
SATOR 
I never involve her in my business. 
PROTAGONIST 
That’s why I trust her. 
70.
SATOR 
(to Volkov) 
Put him ashore. 
PROTAGONIST 
How do I contact you? 
You don’t. 
SATOR 
PROTAGONIST 
How do you advance me funds? 
Sator TOSSES the Protagonist the BLOODY GOLD BAR – the  Protagonist FUMBLES it onto the table. Volkov SNEERS – 
SATOR 
Handle the plutonium better than  
that. 
The Protagonist, looking Volkov in the eye, picks up the gold  bar, scooping DRIED MUD into his hand, unseen. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS, TALLINN – DAY 
The Protagonist walks the crowded streets with Neil. 
PROTAGONIST 
What did you find on the gold? 
NEIL 
Three hundred thousand at today’s  
price, no franks, mould marks. 
Nothing. Like it came from outer  
space. 
PROTAGONIST 
Or the future. 
How? 
NEIL 
PROTAGONIST 
Dead drops. He buries his time  capsule, transmits the location,  then digs it up to collect whatever  inverted material they’ve sent. 
NEIL 
Instantaneous. Where’s he bury it? 
PROTAGONIST 
Someplace that won’t be disturbed  for centuries. What did the soil sample show? 
71.
NEIL 
Northern Europe or Asia,  
radioactive. Dried blood was  
European. 
PROTAGONIST 
Pretty broad. 
NEIL 
This is the start of the run. 
The Protagonist looks back where they came. Then up ahead. 
PROTAGONIST 
When does the material arrive? 
NEIL 
Thursday. When does Sator arrive? 
PROTAGONIST 
I don’t know. But he’ll be here. 
NEIL 
Cargo’s in a reinforced truck.  
Nuclear police front and back –  
SUVs with serious armour – you  
can’t break in through the windows. 
PROTAGONIST 
And they can’t break out. 
NEIL 
I don’t follow. 
PROTAGONIST 
You will. So, light convoy through  
downtown, what’s the thinking? 
NEIL 
A crowded, unpredictable traffic  
pattern makes planning an ambush 
almost impossible. 
The Protagonist looks around at the congestion. 
PROTAGONIST 
They have a point. Is the convoy  
monitored from the air? 
NEIL 
No, tracked by GPS – a wrong turn  
or an unscheduled stop, in comes  
the cavalry. 
Neil and the Protagonist hop a tram. The Protagonist studies  the journey along the multi-lane road out of town. 
72.
PROTAGONIST 
We need big guns, guns that make  
the point without being fired. We 
need a fast car that doesn’t look  
fast and four heavy vehicles, all 
different – bus, coach, eighteen wheeler... 
Neil nods. 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
One of them has to be a fire truck. 
Neil looks up, interested. 
PROTAGONIST (CONT'D) 
Most of all, we need to set this up  
with nothing in the record –  
nothing electronic, nothing paper –  
I don’t want Sator ambushing us the  
second we spring the material. His  
ignorance is our only protection. 
INT./EXT. MERCEDES ON TALLINN STREETS – DAY 
Kat sits beside Sator in the back, staring out the window. 
SATOR 
Everything salvaged from Oslo’s  
been shipped here. 
KAT 
Why am I here? 
SATOR 
I don’t trust anyone else to assess  
the pieces. 
EXT. FREEPORT, DOCKSIDE AREA, EDGE OF TALLINN – DAY 
The MERCEDES pulls into the Tallinn Freeport. Several  BODYGUARDS emerge, Sator heads inside. Kat follows, looking  through a metal fence – an AUDI sits there, idling. Its  driver is wearing an OXYGEN MASK... 
INT. STORAGE FACILITY, TALLINN FREEPORT – MOMENTS LATER Kat enters. Sator is at a table covered in WEAPONS. 
SATOR 
See, Kat? Some of my favourites... 
He picks up a MACHINE GUN. 
73.
SATOR (CONT'D) 
Singed but salvageable, wouldn’t  
you say? 
She stares at the weaponry as if she’s never seen anything  like it before... 
KAT 
It’s not my area of expertise. 
SATOR 
That’s right. You’d never have  
anything to do with such things.  
But this is where our worlds  
collide. 
KAT 
Andrei, what is this? 
SATOR 
You know perfectly well what it is,  
Kat – the filthy business that put 
those clothes on your back and our  
boy in his school. That you thought  
you could negotiate your way  
around. 
VOLKOV 
(in Russian, subtitled) 
The convoy’s due downtown in ten. 
Sator checks his watch. Nods at Volkov. Turns to Kat. 
SATOR 
It’s time to go. 
KAT 
I’m not going anywhere with you. 
Sator SLAMS the machine gun back down on the table. Kat  FLINCHES. Sator TURNS, enraged... 
SATOR 
Look at me and understand – you  
don’t negotiate with a tiger – you 
admire a tiger, until it turns on  
you and you feel its TRUE. FUCKING. 
NATURE! 
Sator moves towards her – Kat pulls out a gun. 
Don’t... 
KAT 
74.
EXT. TALLINN STREET – DAY 
A LARGE UNMARKED TRUCK, with an ESCORT FRONT AND BACK, makes  its stop and-start way through the downtown traffic. 
INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist and Neil watch the convoy cross an  intersection, then pull forward, squeezing through traffic to  get ahead. Neil raises a walkie-talkie – 
YELLOW CO-PILOT 
(into radio) 
Green? Two minutes. 
INT./EXT. GREEN TRUCK, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS 
The GREEN DRIVER nods at the GREEN CO-PILOT who holds the  radio. 
Check. 
GREEN CO-PILOT 
He puts the radio down and pulls out a LARGE AUTOMATIC RIFLE. 
INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist checks his watch – Neil speaks into the radio  – 
NEIL 
Yellow? Sixty seconds. 
YELLOW CO-PILOT 
(over radio) 
Sixty. Check. 
NEIL 
Blue? Forty-five seconds. 
BLUE CO-PILOT 
(over radio) 
Forty-five. Check. 
NEIL 
Red? On our way to you. 
INT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE – CONTINUOUS 
RED DRIVER and RED CO-PILOT are dressed as FIREFIGHTERS. 
75.
INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS 
The BMW pulls out, running behind the nuclear convoy. As the  convoy passes the cross street where the green truck, a  FLATBED TRUCK, is sitting, it pulls out beside them, settling  in to the right of the convoy. 
INT. STORAGE FACILITY – DAY 
Sator steps towards Kat – 
KAT 
Stay right there! 
She lifts the gun, intent – 
SATOR 
You wouldn’t kill me. 
KAT 
I already tried. 
SATOR 
You pushed me off a boat. You’re  
not going to shoot me in cold blood  
– 
KAT 
My blood’s not cold, Andrei. 
SATOR 
No, but you’re not angry enough. 
Sator edges towards Kat... 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
Because anger scars over into  
despair. I look in your eyes... 
He casually GESTURES at her – 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
I see despair. 
He SMACKS the gun out of her hands – PUNCHES her – she DROPS  – 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
Vengeful bitch. Living off me,  
pretending to be better... 
With a primal, animal viciousness, Sator SPITS at Kat. 
ENOUGH! 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
Sator KICKS her once, in the side. 
76.
SATOR (CONT'D) 
You wanted to know when it’s better  
to kill you? You’ll have your 
answer. 
He motions to Volkov, who, with a guard, lifts Kat and  
carries her towards the door. Sator puts an earpiece in his  ear... 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
Tell me everything as it happens. 
Volkov nods, leaving – Sator walks through a large door. 
SATOR (CONT'D) 
Seal us this side! 
As the door shuts behind him, he walks towards a RED DOOR  WITH A SMALL PORTHOLE, finding a spot in the shadows  nearby... 
EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS 
The BMW watches the yellow truck, a BROADCAST TRUCK, which  pulls out just ahead of the nuclear convoy... the Protagonist  looks back through the BMW’s side mirror, which is CRACKED... 
The BMW sees the blue truck, a WRECKER, which pulls out onto  the larger street, just behind the convoy, which is now  SURROUNDED ON THREE SIDES by the coloured trucks. 
INT. MERCEDES – CONTINUOUS 
Volkov follows the convoy... 
VOLKOV 
(into radio) 
Three trucks in place... 
SATOR 
(over radio) 
Watch everything, give me all the  
details... 
INT. STORAGE FACILITY, TALLINN FREEPORT – CONTINUOUS Sator sits in the shadows, listening intently... 
EXT. TALLINN STREETS – CONTINUOUS 
The BMW ZIPS ahead, weaving through traffic, pulls alongside  the fire truck. 
77.
The Protagonist, DRESSED AS A FIREFIGHTER, jumps out of the  BMW and grabs onto the side of the fire truck, BANGING the  side to signal the driver. The fire truck pulls out onto the  three-lane highway... 
INT./EXT. FIRE TRUCK – CONTINUOUS 
The fire truck pulls alongside the nuclear convoy, slotting  in on the left, so that the convoy is now SURROUNDED... the  Protagonist CLIMBS onto the roof beside the ladder, puts on a  pair of heavy-duty gloves, pulls a diagonal backpack around  onto his front, checking his tools.  
Blue Co-pilot and Yellow Co-pilot COUNT DOWN in unison – 
BLUE CO-PILOT 
(over radio) 
Five, four, three, two, one, go... 
Blue truck, behind the convoy, GUNS THE ACCELERATOR, as  yellow truck, in front of the convoy, SLAMS ON THE BRAKES... 
The two SUVS are ACCORDIONED against the nuclear truck, then  CARRIED FORWARD WITH THE NUCLEAR TRUCK as the coloured trucks  CLOSE FORMATION and PULL FORWARD, maintaining pace – 
Go yellow! 
BLUE CO-PILOT (CONT'D) 
The YELLOW CO-PILOT in the broadcast truck sends out STATIC – 
INT./EXT. SECURITY SUV – CONTINUOUS 
The SECURITY DRIVER is trying the radio – STATIC... 
INT. CONTROL CENTRE, TALLINN POLICE – CONTINUOUS 
A POLICE OPERATOR is frowning, trying the radio. He calls to  his SUPERVISOR – 
POLICE OPERATOR 
(in Estonian, subtitled) 
– Radio’s down. – 
SUPERVISOR 
(in Estonian, subtitled) 
– Are they still moving? – 
The Police Operator checks his screen – NODS... 
78.
EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS 
TYRES HOWLING, the convoy GRINDS forward – Blue Co-pilot 
tosses a DYE PACK onto the windshield of the SUV – it BLASTS  across the glass, obscuring the view – Yellow Co-pilot does  the same in the front – the Guards are now BLIND, CANNOT OPEN  THEIR DOORS OR SHOOT OUT THROUGH THE BULLET-PROOF VEHICLES... 
The Protagonist CLIMBS ONTO THE LADDER, lying on top... Inside, the Red Co-pilot operates the ladder controls... 
The ladder SWINGS OUT AT NINETY DEGREES, hanging the  Protagonist DIRECTLY OVER THE NUCLEAR TRUCK... he PULLS a  frame from his pack, unfolds it – fixes it to the roof. The  ladder SWINGS him away – the frame EXPLODES – he SWINGS back  through the smoke to find an OPENING and climbs into – 
INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist lands, gets his bearings, finds the SAFE. He  reaches into his pack... 
EXT. TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS 
An Estonian POLICE CAR pulls up behind the fire truck – the  POLICEMEN spot SPARKS from the dragging bumper of the SUV –  the Policeman Passenger tries his radio... STATIC... 
INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist affixes a CHARGE to the safe – he runs a  wire, pushing back into the farthest corner – BLASTS the door  open – 
INT./EXT. FIRE ENGINE – CONTINUOUS 
Watching the Police through his mirror, Red Passenger rolls  down his window and props his ASSAULT RIFLE on the sill... 
INT. NUCLEAR TRANSPORTATION TRUCK – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist reaches into the safe... PULLS OUT an ORANGE  PLASTIC CASE... reaches up to climb through the roof... 
INT./EXT. FIRE TRUCK – CONTINUOUS 
The Protagonist, orange case in hand, CLIMBS onto the ladder  – Red Passenger SWINGS his rear-opening door out and SHOOTS  OUT the engine block of the police car which DROPS BACK as – 
79.
The fire-truck ladder SWINGS the Protagonist back onto the  fire truck – he climbs down onto the side – the BMW pulls  alongside – he JUMPS into the car, which SPEEDS away... 
INT./EXT. BMW, TALLINN STREET – CONTINUOUS 
Neil, driving, glances at the orange case – 
We got it! 
NEIL 
The Protagonist opens the latches, flips open the lid...  revealing the BLACK METAL SHAPE the size of a softball. 
PROTAGONIST 
I’ve seen samples of encapsulation  
in every weapons class – this is  
not one of them. 
Neil looks back at the Protagonist. Serious. 
NEIL 
It’s what he’s after. 
The Protagonist looks around at the surrounding traffic... 
PROTAGONIST 
Check the radio chatter. 
Neil clicks on the radio – EMPHATIC GIBBERISH... 
NEIL 
I can’t understand – 
PROTAGONIST 
You said you spoke Estonian – 
NEIL 
It’s not Estonian, it’s...  
backwards – 
Up ahead, an Audi is weaving through traffic, towards them,  BACKWARDS... Neil STARES... 
The hell? 
NEIL (CONT'D) 
The BACKWARDS-RUNNING AUDI flies at them, CLIPPING the wing  mirror, ‘HEALING’ its crack. Behind them it SPINS AROUND, to  CHASE them, still running BACKWARDS... 
The BMW DODGES around traffic, trying to lose the backwards  Audi, which pulls up to the back bumper – then ALONGSIDE – in  the back is Sator, black eyes peering over a RESPIRATOR, a  gun to Kat’s head. She is BOUND and GAGGED, eyes TERRIFIED –




It was in all the papers at the time.


Men searching in the arctic


And found the yellow metal


Gold


A mad fever's spread

And thousands more rushed to the north


To try their luck


These men needed dogs


Big dogs, with strong muscles,
to pull their sleds


Come on there buck


Buck was neither a house dog






Nor canal dog


Here good boy.


His master


Was santa clara county judge


Watch it, you!


In this realm


Buck was king

Good boy good boy


Take the cake! Take the cake!


Good boy good boy

Locked in that box


He couldn't eat, drink, or sleep.

Where he'd been


Where he was going

Tonight


He would begin to hear his own


Come on buck, we have to go on today, ale.


Thanks perrault

In all his years sending the mail


Perrault's never been on time


Not once


But he drives every day
like it might happen


He believes


But I've never saw
him believe in anything


As much as he believes in you


Now I do too


A pack can have only one leader


Spitz' had her enough


Spitz!


Spitz!


Spitz!


He's not like him


I looked all morning,
can't find him anywhere


It's like he's vanished


Spitz!


We have to go without him


Can't lose the day


So-Leks... buck?


Back in place, ale


Sol-Leks got more than
five years on you


Get in line!


Buck


Just because you pull good
don't make you ready to lead


Okay? Hey


I don't think he's gonna move


Oh he'll move


Buck... move!


Come on, ale


Come here


What got to this dog this morning?


I think they know something you don't know
- There is nothing I don't know


Hey


We can't make up this much time.
They'll close the office.


No no no no!


We are going to be on time, just once


Fine


Take it


It's not that bad


I lost my lead dog.


We'll be two days
behind if we're lucky


And we've never been lucky


You may want...

- Yeah yeah


Ok buck


And... mush!


Go


Hee ha!


Buck, turn!


Turn left!


Left!


Turn left! Go


Turn left!


No no no!


Are you crazy?


No no no no!


Perrault?


This is it! We're better now buck!


Get out of the way!


Go go!


Did you see that?


We made it!
We did it!


Here's one for kelly, yeah.


Your card is here


See buck


We don't carry mail


We carry lives


We carry hope, we carry love


We are leaving in the morning,
let's get some rest


Dear sarah


The soul seems to have
gone out of me now


Each day


Starts with a memory
of our dearest son


Team's approaching birthday


Reminds me of all
that's been lost


The warmth of our home


The adventures our son dreamed of


I wish I'd found the words


To express how I felt


Before the silence became


Unbearable


And I left


I search for a place


I might feel some


Peace


Though I'm sure I will never find it


As I know that as I am


There maybe


No home for me


In this world


You got time for one
more before you leave?


You're late
- It's my son's birthday


And I need to send this remembers to my wife.
- You should have come when we were taking


Took time to find the words


Oh

You're lucky, buck is a boss


Anyone else?


Hey buck

Ready, buck?


And mush!


Nice buck

Straight ahead

Perrault, one for you


It seems official


What's the news from down south?


Perrault?


It's okay


It's okay, it's okay


You did nothing wrong


You all done good


Okay?


Sorry buck


They don't need me and
my sled anymore


By summer the telegraph
will reach here


A new way to send the mail


It's your team now


You still have a mighty journey ahead


The ground had shifted under him again.


Buck had lost another master


Now he would have to be the leader himself


Until a new master came along


I promised you, didn't I?


And here we are
- You promised me gold


Where is it?


In the dogs?


Get the sled loaded


It's time to stake our claim


Let's go, and...


Mush


Mush

- No, they're just lazy


Buck


Charles, persuade the beast


Not the club


Charles, put that down, or...
I won't go a step


Charles!


Remember me?


Yeah I know


Your runners are frozen


You help your dogs and their mighty feet
if you take a gee pole and break them out


Gee-Pole?


What is he doing?


Dear watch the crawler


Where are you headed mister?


None of your concern


Didn't buy that map in skagway, did you?


No.
- An old fairy tale


Lost cabin


River of gold


It said not enough too far into the spring


Half that trail is on the river. - Well
that leaves half the trail worth the travel


All that means, the ice is gonna break up


With your companions
and that dogs on it


Why don't you wait
until spring comes


Save your dogs and your companions
from suffering


And let some old prospector
beat us to the gold?


I'm not a gold prospector I...
- No thank you


I paid a fortune for this team


They'll pull my sled
- They are good dogs, sir.


They'll pull your sled


They'll pull your sled till they die


Thank you


Let's go


Alright let's go, and...


Mush!


You lazy mutt!


I'm not so sure about those dogs


Maybe you should have
bought a different team


Maybe we should feed them


We should have stayed on the trail
- Mush!


Maybe they need a little encouragement


Mush!


For the first time buck
knew more than his masters.


But the whip


Offered him no choice


Son of a...


Oh no, we're going on a cross
move!


I say you go
- Hal, he can't!


Move


Don't you dare!


Hey!


The river ice's gonna break any minute


You fool


The dog is trying to
help you keep your life


Why are you so keen to stop us?


You know where the gold is, don't you?


You keep your filthy hands
off of my dogs


Hal he said we shouldn't cross


Hal, maybe we should leave-The dogs
- No, I can do it


Mush!


Mush!


Don't do this


Not to them


Mush!

They're gone


You were sleeping for two days


In my bed


I'll be back


Stay, go


Do what you want


Whiskey


Big bright shiny gold

They are all gone


Dogs ran off


My fortune is lost


You called it a fairy tale


You just don't want

This man and I had business,
and the dog went for my throat


Leave the dog alone! Buck!

This for mrs. Birthday


My son


After he dies, his mom and I.


We just grew apart


She didn't want to be around
me, I didn't...


I didn't wanna be around any body


So I came up here


And I met you


Good you're awake


Uh


Here it is


There is something I want to show you


Come here, come here,
this is a map of the yukon


My son was always reading


Adventure storys


He's crazy, about the news
coming from yukon


Wasn't the gold, he didn't even
care about that, he wants the mountains


He spent all day looking at
maps and pictures of the mountains


Dreaming about all
was on the other side


Places no one had been


Wild places


"Let's go," I said


He said "yeah pop"


We start there


But then he grabbed a pencil and he


He drew a bound line


Off the map


And he said, "let's go there"


"Off the map, where no one's been"


That's... that's what he loved


A real adventure


We could go


You and me


See what's out there


What do you think?


It's a canoe, buck,
we are gonna ride it


Settle, sit, sit, sit buck


Good boy


What are you doing?


Begging?


You are not my pet


Are you coming?


Get in here


Come on buck


Give us a song


Maybe not


I'm glad you're enjoying this


Oh you like that, huh?


I guess we walked from here


Your ancestors used to roam here


Back when they were wild


This is always here


I don't know,
which way? You tell me, go on


You lead!


Look what you found?


Look at this buck


I don't think we are off our maps


Prospector, I guess

And the fairy tale is true


That's more like it, buck


Smart boy


What?


What you're looking at?


Go take a look


Come on


Just be back before dark


Buck


Here, so far from home


I can see a change in buck


Something's pulling him into the forest.


Into the hunt


That's beautiful buck


It's still the same dog with me.


But I found it hard to imagine him


Back in civilization


Is there any house
big enough to hold him?


This journey seems to be leading
buck to his destination


Where is it leading me?


Long after dark


We've been staying out,


Later and later every day


Yeah, I know,
there's a lot to explore, but


World's a dangerous place


You never know what's coming


You never know


Two days


Hell


Ok buck


It's been a beautiful summer


You know what buck?


I have been thinking


I might buy myself a railroad


That's my hat, that's my hat, come on


Give me my hat


Give me my hat give me my hat


Give me my hat, buck!


Buck, come on


Hey hey


Uh


Timberwolf


Beautiful


This is their domain
they own this house


You wanna go? Go!


Just


Be careful


He had been both spoiled


And he'd suffered


At the hand of man


Now buck found himself


With his own kind


How far he has traveled
to find his home


How far I have traveled from mine


You look buck


Groceries


For life


No man needs more than that


It's time for me to go buck


Go home


What ever is left of it


Pick up the pieces harder


At least try


No


I'm not asking you
to come with me buck


You got something here


Something important


I know, I know it


I'm leaving in the morning


Come say bye


You're a good dog, buck


You're a good dog


You came all the way out here.
You knew something, didn't you?


You want it all for yourself


Where is it?


Where is the gold?


It's everywhere


Take it, take it all


It won't change anything


Won't bring back the dead


You know this, do you? Good


You see it boy? You see it?


Good


Buck


Now buck


Wanted adventure, huh?


It is ok boy


You're home


There is a place in these mountains


Where a new breed of
timberwolf roams


Wiser than man


Or wolf


Because of the dog


That runs at the head of the pack


Now


They live without fear


Raise their young and flourish


Some say


It's just a legend


Not so


You see, I knew him once


When he was just a dog
at a man side


And even though this land is his


Every summer


When he comes down to the valley


He remembers


Kind hands


And old masters


Before he went to his own


Became his own master


Before he heard


The call



That's why he is rising.


You've got to go.


Don't look behind you,


you see the light you need to follow that life.


Don't follow the line tomorrow.


The founder of the light.


Ah.


Traveler here,


it's been fourteen moons.


The mission began following the light,


but no Senator Maria traveler,






it's been twenty nine moon still know so tomorrow.


It didn't run this little fellow,

He's a good look.


I'm thinking of calling him roller and its been fifty four months,


and between one hundred and ten million,


two hundred miles travelogue.


It's been.


A lot of moons,


all the moon's stillness of tomorrow.


Something's come up the skyscraper.


The?


It's a person.


Yeah,

and in a sense I've been living in a cave for my whole life and I didn't really come across.


Other people very often,


let alone a boy.


The omens are actually interested in the world and we found each other.


if,


when fate brought us together,


my whole family loved him.


Whatever.


But actually the guy won him over.


Oh,


and I were travelling the world,


searching for a perfect place to call home of the cycles tomorrow.


Tomorrow is a kind of reason.


He gives me a funny feeling like I had butterflies in my stomach and not just the one they had for lunch.


Don't like other butterflies.


I don't know what this feeling is called,


but it looks like this and this,


I'm not drivers saying,


I don't know why it just feels right.


The black sky and girls don't get funny.


I can't stop fighting,


I will turn.


There have been plenty of obstacles along the way.


There is nothing,


as Christianity.


That's an angry kangaroo telephone,


her tail.


I don't think that love.

Adding sports that we have?


You see,

Yeah.


And you're only one click away.

Sometimes it feels like it's just the two of us.


Love.

A bitter roots just as soon as Tupac members who shall remain English do their jobs in spite of fire.


Come on just she will no doubt try.


And now I'm going to show you how.

so we have a deal.


Deal.


I just had a best time with Phil.


look at me,


standing up straight on lots of ideas,


you know,


it was a good listener.


He knows a smart idea when he hears one.


The veterans wanted to leave without guy thing so long as if we would ever do that.


Well,

a member of our pack come down.


if you knew it would absolutely destroyed her well,


initially making simple cave people that were so stupid we trade guide for a fruit basket and then try to make me think it was my idea that is a great idea,


as if we'd ever do that.


so we have better early must think we're pretty stupid.


You've done a good thinking man.


You're not stupid.


Maybe we should take it down a notch,


honey.


Rupert abroad,

we've gotta get garden and get out of here.


Okay,


but first,


there is something that I wanted to do for a really,


really long time.

That's the better.


This is my mom.

You know to keep everyone safe.


Guy relaxed.

It's just going to be saying,


Oh,

This is a very severe piece saying this is a virtual.


No,

I thought I'd find you don't eat.


That was not smart.


She could have been seriously hurt.


You gotta think about these things.


Why are you acting like this?


You like adventures,

I wouldn't have said that graduates take this moment to talk about your great idea.

How dare you?


How dare you a problem you're trying to fix me up what happened to your hand?


I got stung by a bee and send them off.


He went outside to watch.


It's not your fault,


though our faults can I say something now.


Okay,


I can't believe you actually made that deal.


OK.


It was really hot,


I was full shark milk.


I was no good.


Why?


Because privacy promotes individuality on official motto,

OK.


Really,

and now you want me to come with you.


You are trying to take my daughter away,

Any months ago,

All of those is going to be a long story.


It was a time of much joy.


The water flowed freely.


The nights grew in bunches,

And most of all,

We go back.

We are not going back.


as I was saying good times within,


for some strange reason the water went away after that,


the bananas went away too,


but the monster didn't go away.


No,


it came back and there were no payments.


In summary,


they really need those begets monsters.


bananas.


I'll tell you what the problem is.


Their water supply is dried up.


Tell them this word for word,

Yeah.


Ah.


Instead,

Everyone over who won in Florida.


Trust her or your weapons.


Can you look like you could give up?


This isn't a monster,


it's a mom who is just afraid for her baby and being protective and maybe a bit.


Rude,


and maybe she just didn't realize that the outsiders weren't a threat,


but actually friends.


and that maybe you don't.


Wolf spiders and outsiders to live in beautiful harmony together.


You got all that just from looking at it,


perhaps the window,


by which I view the world is flawed.


I'm going to go.


You came back.


You made you know I've got what I want to do tomorrow is forgotten.


Do you mind,


and I'm trying to think what I'm trying to get out of here for that monster shows up.

there are the closest thing he has to a family.


We'd have been hurt before.


Mark,


I can see this hurts so much,


and I can't even see it.


I can see it.


Doesn't matter,


there's two different.


I don't even care.


Eve,


if something hurts this much,


maybe it means you do care.


Maybe it's something worth fighting for.


So what are you going to do about it?


Are you sure you don't want to join us?


It's really warm in here.


I'm not really a sleep per person.


I have a shop that's okay.

because you smother them what you built a wall around your family.


You'll also build a wall around your you know you.


I'll tell you what you are.


You're a bad father.


Words as weapons,


you're just a cave.


It's called a shower.


I told her to take a shower.


Who does that?


Regulations?


Everywhere on Earth.


Likewise.


Grub and my hallucinated,

Not just as Joseph.


Yeah.


Ah.


What did I know?


Well,


I guess this is it.


Phil,


I'm sorry I ate their bananas.


I suppose perhaps I have made mistakes too.


Recognizing these monkeys,


wrote them or stealing the water and teaching them to tiny's.


Not so there are not for atrocious.


I just wish I had been able to see equal more time.


I spent my whole life searching for a place of my parents.


One of you find.


In the family.


Oh,

What's the first problem?


But that approach?


I think I see something.


Ah.


And we all here with this guy.


Yeah.


There's something I need to tell you now.


My whole life,


searching for a place called tomorrow isn't a file.


Go on,


but tomorrow is it a place?


It's a person,


if you eat you by tomorrow.


Ah.


I think I made a matter.


Yeah.


I got to talk this thing.


There are too many bikes.


Wow,


I can't believe that actually worked fine.


You know what?


that's not my real job.


Ever told me about that,


Do you know she had a better job?


Travelogue?


Vinyl entry after two of the longest,


most terrifying moons in my life,


the cruise had a better man made it back together.


Douglas.


Web veterans welcomed everyone to stay around,


so we made a few changes around the farm.


It really opens up the place and the punch bowl is going there next door if they hardy lot all day all night,


Phil actually learned to speak confidently.


OK,


come again.


Well,


he's still working on it.


He get to the good part.


Oh,

Are babies leaving those interviews?


OK.


Grant to do something new with your hair.


Witnesses took the day off,


so I'm trying a new dish.


No one knew at the table Who is Andrea,


It's a special dish.


We can't borrow none of that.


My father was afraid of the pack getting smaller,


but in the end he can't live a whole lot bigger.


That was right.


After all,


we were stronger together.


Wet.



Adrian?


Come on.


Zeus, I'm sorry.


I can't take you with me.


I'm sorry.


Shit. I'm not gonna leave you
with that thing on.


Okay.


Come here.


It's okay. Good boy.


There you go.


Come here.






Fuck.


Emily, where are you?


Shit.


Cecilia, what is going on?


Are you okay?


I'll explain later.


Just go, Emily.


Go.


Open the fucking door, Cecilia!


What is happening?


Open the door!


- No. -
- Open this door!


Open the door!


- Open the fucking door!
- I'm going, I'm going.






Cecilia, get back here!


Jesus!


Get back here now!


You can't do this!
Get back here!


Cee.


How long have you been up?


A few hours.


Can't sleep.


Now, you know,
if you close your eyes


and you lie down,
that usually helps.


Um, don't think being tired


gets you out of
our little deal, now.


I swore to your sister I'd get
you to step outside my house.


Hey, Cee.


He's not out there.


I promise.


I'm sorry. I'm just...


- I'm not ready yet.
- Hey, it's okay, Cee.


That's the furthest you've gone
since you've been here, okay?


So, as far as I'm concerned,
you just walked on the moon.


I can't work
with this goddamn thing.


It's all right.


I got it.


I got it.


Do I know you?


- Do I owe you money?
- A lot.


A lot? I told y'all about
running up on me in my house.


Hey. Cee.


Tell her she can't
take you back.


We're keeping you.


What are you doing here, Emily?


Well, it's nice
to see you, too, sis.


I'm gonna go see
what Sydney's up to.


- Just...
- Mm.


Yeah.


This is not fair.


I asked you not to come over.


He knows where you live.
He will follow you.


Yes, well, I have some news.


There is no news
that justifies this.


Okay, I have a plan,
and I just...


I-I need you
to-to go along with it


and just not be in control
for one second.


I'm not trying
to control you, boo.


I'm desperately trying
to tell you that


you don't need
to cut me off anymore.


Because he's dead.


What?


What?


Hey.


What did he do to you?


Can you talk to me?


It just doesn't make any sense.


He was...
he was in... he was...


in complete control of
everything, you know? Just...


Including me.


He controlled
how I looked and...


what I wore and what I ate.


And...


then it was controlling
when I left the house and...


...what I said.


And eventually...


what I thought.


And if...


if he didn't like what
he assumed I was thinking...


...h-he... he would...


He'd what? He'd...


He would... he would hit you?


Amongst other things.


He wanted to have a baby.


And I knew that if we did that,
that I...


I would never be able
to get away from him, so...


I took birth control
without him knowing it.


But, um, that can only go on
for so long, so...


I called you.


Hey.


You're here with us now.


And you're safe.


He's gone.


I'm not telling you to aim low.


I'm just saying, e-explore
more than one option, okay?


Don't limit
your choices to just


one school
in the whole country.


But that one school is my goal.


Parsons is my goal.


Yeah, I told you
to have goals... plural.


I think it's important
to have goals, James.


Uh, hey.


Look at you,
getting out into the world.


You know, by next year, you'll
make it across the street.


Uh, hey, Cee.


- Hmm?
- Something came for you.


No one knows I'm here.


So, who's it from?


Thank you both for coming in.


As the appointed attorney


representing my late brother's
discretionary trust,


I'm required to enact
his final wishes.


And he stipulated
that I do this in person.


He wanted me to read a...
a prepared statement.


"Cecilia,


"although our relationship
was far from perfect,


"I at least thought
we had built up enough trust


"that you would talk to me


"rather than running away
from what you


- perceived us to have."
- No, no. Sorry.


You're not allowed to do that.


- I'm required to read this.
- She's not required to listen.


E-mail me a copy,
and we will read it.


You bet.


I'm just trying to do my job.


Your job is
to explain the money


- you mentioned on the phone.
- I mentioned Cecilia


specifically is named
in Adrian's trust.


- That is why we're sitting here.
- Yes.


For the same reason
so many women in Adrian's life


got close to him: his money.


If there was a chance of
physically being close to him,


we would not be here
for any amount of money.


You are physically
close to him.


He's in that urn over there.


And as per his final wishes,
you're getting $5 million,


estate and income tax free.


Now, the money
will be staggered


in installments of $100,000


each month for the next
four years or so,


contingent, of course,
on the fine print.


You can't commit a crime,
et cetera.


Normally, I would have a
120-day contestability period,


but I'm gonna waive my rights
in that regard.


So...


as soon as I have
your signature


and your banking information,


I can start
releasing the funds.


Okay, you can come in now.


- Uh-oh.
- Oh, hey.


Wait, wait. Where you at?


- Okay.
- Okay.


- Can we look now?
- Careful.


Yes, you can look.


- Ta-da!
- Oh.


Wow. Thanks, Cee.


Wow, that's nice.
L-Look at that.


A ladder?


Excuse you?


I know I didn't hear you
just say that.


- I meant to say thank you.
- What do you say? Uh-huh.


You're welcome. Well, I-I knew
you needed a new one,


and that one just...
that has to go.


That's so nice of you, Cee.
Thank you so much.


That's very sweet of you.
Thank you.


I just...
I wanted to thank you for,


you know, letting me stay here


and for taking
such good care of me, so...


And Sydney can also
use ladders.


Don't think
I'm helping you paint.


I wouldn't even bother
to ask you.


No, not for, like,
painting, obviously,


but just for a lot of things.


You climb them to get things
like-like stuff like that.


That's so strange.
God, I wish you had, like...


Oh, wait, you could totally


- use the ladder.
- A ladder to climb up...


Yeah, the ladder's cool.


- Okay.
- This happened to just pop up there by itself?


- It happened to just be here, so...
- Mm-hmm.


- ...it's convenient.
- Wow.


What is it?


- It has my name on it.
- That's weird.


- And it looks like your handwriting.
- I don't know...


- You sure it's weird?
- I just got a ladder, so...


- If you think it's weird.
- I don't know what...


- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Let's see.


A cool ladder is all.


It's a new bank account,
um, with your name on it,


and I'm gonna put
$10,000 in it every month


for the rest of the year.


I called the account "Parsons."


You're going to
fashion school, kid.


Hey, whoa, Cee, Cee, that's...
that's too much, Cee.


Come on, are you sure
you can do that?


Let me put it this way.


She can probably
go to grad school, too.


I'm going to Parsons.


She can go to Parsons.


You're going to Parsons.


Oh, my God.


Oh, wait, no.


We got to cel...
we got to celebrate.


And I don't want TV dinners,
microwave nothing, we...


Oh, it's, like,
I guess too bad


we don't have anything at all
to celebrate with.


- Hey...!
- Whoo-whoo!


I don't know why you dancing.


You can't have none,
'cause you're not 21.


- Yes, I can.
- Oh, come on.


Just, like, a little bit.


He said the other day that
I was mature for my age.


- That's right.
- He did.


- A mature child.
- I heard you say that.


- I remember.
- Hey, hold up, hold up, hold up.


This ain't fair, okay?
Two against one.


I'm just an innocent man
trying to do right.


Are you scared? Are you scared?


This a... this is abuse.
I'm a cop.


- Are you-you scared?
- You realize I'm a cop.


- I got him, I got him.
- Hey, hey, hey.


- I got him, Sydney! I got him!
- No, he's got me!


Oh! I'll protect you!


Morning.


You want some breakfast?


Nah, nah, I got to go.


You know, I'm a little
hungover, believe it or not.


Ugh. Me, too.


Champagne does that to me
every time.


We're getting old, Cee.


We old.


These winter mornings
are killing me.


All right, look,
I'm out of here.


Um, I'll be back around 7:00.


- Okay.
- All right?


- Oh, uh, Cee.
- Hmm?


You mind getting Sydney up?


She's actually pretty excited,
thanks to you.


She, uh... she might need
a little help staying focused.


You got it.


Syd, come on, girl.


You're gonna be late.


Shit!


Shit, shit.


- Shit.
- No, no, no, no, no.


No, don't use water. No.


Excuse me. Sorry.


- Oh.
- Wow.


You did that.


Yeah.


You think we can salvage it?


- No.
- No?


No. Sorry.


James?


James!


James! James, James!


Yeah, yeah, what?


What-what happened?
What happened? What?


I saw something right there.
They were right there.


There were footprints.
I saw it.


You-you saw...
you saw footprints?


I saw... I... Yes, I saw...
On the sheets.


I saw it right there.


- I saw them.
- On the sheet?


I saw it.


There was someone in here.
There was someone in here.


Syd, put that
stupid thing away.


Y-You're the one
who bought it for me.


Who you gonna spray? Who?


James, I saw it.


I swear.


Hey, Cee.


Adrian will haunt you
if you let him.


Don't let him.


Now, you should try
and get some sleep.


You have an important
job interview tomorrow,


and I don't want the memory
of this motherfu...


...that...


this person to ruin it.


- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.


- Sorry.
- Yeah.


After Cal Poly,
I worked in Paris


for six months.


That was the best time
of my life, for sure.


Except for this next phase,
of course.


Take a seat.


So, any reason you worked
in Paris in particular?


Is that where all the
beautiful women in the world


have to go as a rule?


Well, I speak a little...
a little French,


and I've always wanted
to live there.


So, after I graduated,


I went out there
on a totally student budget.


I slept in a broom closet,
literally.


I started this firm
in a supply closet, literally.


There you go.


- So we both know the value of closet space.
- Yeah.


Let me see some of your work.


Yes, of course.


Uh, um...


I don't...
Uh, I know that I...


I know I put them in here,
so I... so I apologize.


I don't know what happened.


- Um...
- It's okay.


Uh, you can send it to us
whenever you get a chance.


Okay.


Uh, so, uh,
l-let me tell you about us.


Uh, at Ruler, we approach
architecture on a human level.


First and...


Are you okay?


Um, I'm sorry.


Uh, I'm just not feeling, um...


Uh, would you like
some water or...


Cecilia?


Are you feeling okay?


Cecilia.


Okay, so, uh,
you probably shouldn't drive


or operate any heavy machinery
for the next few days,


but other than that,
you seem fine.


Either myself or my admitting
will, uh, follow up with you


with the results
of the blood test.


Okay? Uh, can you just leave
a number with the nurse?


You guys can go home.


Okay.


You ready?


Yeah.


Hello?


Is Cecilia Kass there?


That's me.


Hi. Uh, this is Dr. Lee
at St. Vincent's.


So, we got the results
of your blood test back,


and it looks like the diazepam


was the most likely cause
of you fainting.


Um, sorry, what diazepam?


Well, your blood work showed
a very high amount of it.


That would definitely explain
what happened to you.


There's something else
I wanted to talk to you about,


but I'm not sure if we should
do it over the phone, so, um...


Tell him to stop.


Tell who to stop what?


Tell him to stop
what he's doing.


Do you know what
she's babbling about?


Nah, she hasn't explained to me
why we're here yet,


but being her very good friend,
I know it's a good reason,


so I'm gonna need you
to sit up and listen.


Show a little respect.


One night, I was sitting,


and I was thinking about
how to leave Adrian.


I was planning
the whole thing in my mind.


And he was staring at me,


studying me.


And without me saying
a single word,


he said that I could
never leave him.


That wherever I went,


he would find me.


That he would walk
right up to me


and I wouldn't be able
to see him,


but that he would
leave me a sign


so that I'd know he was there.


The night I left him,
I drugged him with that.


I lost the bottle that night.


And somehow,
it found its way back to me.


So, what exactly
are you saying?


You lost the bottle,
you found the bottle.


He's not dead, Tom.


I have a pile of ashes
in the box


that would disagree
with you, Cecilia.


I don't know how he's done it.


He's figured it out, though.


He has figured out a way
to be invisible.


He is a world leader
in the field of optics.


I-I... I know that he
could do this.


Something tells me you know
exactly what I'm talking about.


He's not dead.


I just can't see him.


Please tell him to stop.


Okay.


No, I agree with you.


Adrian was brilliant.


But it wasn't because of
anything he invented.


It was how he got
in people's heads.


That was his true genius...
knowing people's weaknesses.


You think about it.


He came up with the perfect way
to torture you even in death.


Only thing more brilliant


than inventing something
that makes you invisible


is not inventing it
but making you think he did.


My brother controlled me


long before he met you,
Cecilia.


I hated him.


You and I,
we got that in common.


I was relieved...


...when I heard
that he was dead.


He's gone, Cecilia.


I saw his body.


Listen to me.


Don't let him win
by bringing him back to life.


Hey.


Hey.


Emily, I need to talk to you.


Well, at least now
we have clarity.


Now I know what
you really think of me.


- What?
- Thanks so much


for carving out the time
to let me know how...


quote, unquote...
"suffocating" I am to you.


What? What are you...


Not that I should
have to say this,


but I never expected
any of that money.


Emily, I-I don't... I don't
know what you're talking about.


The e-mail... the e-mail
you sent me this morning.


- What e-mail?
- If that's how you feel about me,


don't ask me to bail you out
of your personal life anymore.


If you're too stupid to know
who the good guys are


and too weak to get away
from the bad ones,


don't sob to me for charity.


I'm out.


I didn't send you
the fucking e-mail.


I didn't.


Someone is-is-is
doing this to me.


He's-he's doing this to me.


Who's...


Adrian?


Adrian sent me the e-mail.
Okay.


You need some medication.
Adrian is dead.


Em, please, no.


Cee?


It's okay, Syd.


You-you know what
I think we need?


Um...


I think we could
kick Dad out and...


...have a little girls' night.


Eat some cake.


Yeah.


I do like cake.


Oh, my God.
Sydney, are you okay?


Why would you just...
Stop! Stop! Dad!


- What? No. No, Sydney, I didn't...
- Dad! Dad.


- What? What-what...
- No, I... - Dad, she...


- What happened? What happened?
- She-she hit me.


- What?
- No. No, no, no.


James, I did not do that.


Sydney, I would never hit you.
I love you.


I would never do that, James.


It was him.
He's here, I swear to you.


Enough. Enough.


Cee, enough.


Just stop it.
Are you okay, baby?


- I don't want to stay here.
- You-you all right?


Sydney, I'm sorry.
I would never...


Hey, hey. Cee.


Right now my priority is
getting my baby somewhere safe.


Do you understand?


Come on, baby. It's okay.


No. James, please.


This is what he wants.


This is what he used to do
when we were together.


He wants you to think
that I did it.


This is what he does.
He tries to isolate me,


- and he tries to get me alone.
- Hey!


You need to calm down.


You are scaring my daughter.


Now, if I were you, I would go
to your sister's place.


You don't need
to be here right now.


Come on, Sydney.


Sydney, Sydney, I'm sorry.
Sydney.


Where are you?


Come on!


Where are you? Come on out.


Don't hit a little girl.


Hit me!


So, why me, Adrian?


You could have any woman
you wanted.


That's the sad reality.


Right?


And that's what money
and power buy you.


People.


So...


why me?


I'm just a suburban girl who...


stumbled into your life
one night at a party.


Can't you just forget
I ever existed?


There's nothing left


for you to take.


You've already taken it all.


This is Adrian Griffin.


Please leave a message,


and I'll get back to you
when I can.


No!


- Cecilia?
- Yes. Go.


Please, hurry. Lock the doors.


- Lock the doors!
- You okay?


Yes.
Please, please just go.


Okay.


Just please hurry, please.


Stinson Beach...
that's a long way from here.


I-I just need to get something.


Do you mind waiting for me?


I might be two minutes,


I might be 20,
I don't know, but...


You could run me back
to the city after.


- Sure.
- Okay.


No problem.


Zeus.


Hi. Hi.


12-14... 17.


The day we met.


So romantic.


Please, meet me tonight,
if you can,


in a pu... in a public place.


8:00 at Yulan.


And if you can't, I understand,
but you have to tell me,


because I have to call
someone else,


because I don't think
I have much time left.


Thank you. Thank you.


Hi.


Hey.


Hey, guys. Welcome to Yulan.


My name is Taylor,
and I will be


taking care of you
this evening.


Do you know
how this place works?


I'm assuming you order food,
then you eat it.


Hmm, pretty much.


We just do things
a little bit differently.


It's all family style.


We've been here before.
It's all good.


Okay. Can I get you
started with some water?


- We have still or sparkling.
- Just the free kind.


- Okay, tap it is.
- Cool.


Thank you for being here.


I love you.


You're like a cop, Emily,


and y-you have
this brute-force strength


that is so, so comforting
when I'm in trouble,


and it is really intimidating
when I'm not.


I mean, James actually is
a six-foot cop,


and he's, I think,
really intimidated by you.


As he should be.


I'd kick his ass.


I would.


You would.


I need that strength
in my life right now.


And I need you to believe
what I'm about to tell you.


Okay. I...


Thank you, Taylor.


All right.
Uh, do you guys need more time


- with the drink menu?
- Yes.


Lots more time.


Okay, no problem at all.


Emily.


I went to his house today.


- You went to Adrian's house?
- Yes.


I just walked right in.


I found something that can
prove what I'm experiencing.


That can prove that Adrian
is stalking me.


What is it?


It's some kind of suit
that Adrian has built.


And it has cameras,
and it somehow...


What?


No, please. No!


You can't do this.
You can't do this.


He killed her. He killed her.


Please, I didn't do it!


I didn't do it.


No! No!


He killed her!


He did it!
You have to listen to me.


- Please, please, no.
- Try to relax.


Please, no!


No!


Listen to me! No!


You motherfucker!


You killed her!


I see you! I see you!


He's here!


He's here. He's right here.


He's right here. Please!


You can't see him.
He's in the room.


You have to listen to me.


He's right there.
He's gonna hurt me.


- Please. No...
- Okay.


He's right there.


- He's here.
- Okay.


He's right...


There.


- Everything's better now.
- He's right there.


Okay? You'll be all right.


Surprise.


Cecilia.


Can you confirm the person
in this video is you?


And can you confirm


you recently fainted
during a job interview


due to a high amount
of diazepam in your system?


- I was drugged.
- Uh-huh.


You also sent your sister
an e-mail a few days ago


saying you wished
she was dead, didn't you?


I have something.


I have something
that will prove he's alive.


I found it.


What do you have?


I can't tell you right now.


He's listening.


He's in the room, James.


You're saying that the person
who killed your sister


is in the room right now
but we can't see him?


Okay.


- Yeah.
- Thank you.


James.


Tell me you don't think
I did this.


Tell me you know that.


I may as well
have done it, though.


I brought Adrian into her life.


I did that.


I shouldn't have walked out
on you and left you alone.


I failed you.


Is this bed giving you
any problems, Cecilia?


No.


Is there anything in the room
that is distressing to you?


No.


Okay. Good.


I wanted to talk to you
about something.


We checked the blood test


that you had done
at the hospital last week.


Do you remember taking
those blood tests?


Yes.


Okay.


Well, did you know
that you were pregnant?


No.


Didn't the doctor
who took the test tell you?


No, that can't be right.


That's... that's not true.


The test shows us
that it was pretty recent.


We can't be sure
of exactly when,


but it must have been
sometime in the last month.


Sweetie, is there
anyone we can call?


Family?


Any friends?


Okay.


It's upsetting to see you
in this condition.


Even though things ended badly
for you and Adrian,


I still look at you as family.


Are you my lawyer now?


I'm the lawyer
for your source of income.


I represent my brother's trust.


The money from his trust
was payable to you


conditional upon you
being subject


to criminal charges of any kind


or being ruled to be
mentally incompetent.


Now, in light of
your current situation,


it's my duty to inform you


that any further payments
are to be halted.


I know that you set up
a bank account


for a friend of yours
to go to college,


so I take no pleasure
in relaying that.


I used to feel sorry for you.


The blood relative
of a narcissist sociopath.


Permanent punching bag.


Handcuffed to his wallet.


But now...


I can see you
for what you really are.


You're just the jellyfish
version of him.


Everything but the spine.


I mean, you can try
to litigate it,


but that's going to be
an expensive option.


I can't see it working.


However...


...if you sign this document
and forfeit


your share of the trust,


it'll be a lot cleaner.


Or there's one option


where this all goes away.


Agree to have the baby...


...and go back to him.


You really think
he didn't know


you were secretly using
birth control?


Of course he did.


You should have known
he'd find out.


You knew him as well as I did.


He replaced them
with something else.


You only thought you were
taking birth control pills.


He was always going to find you
no matter what he had to do.


He needs you
because you don't need him.


No one's ever left him before.


But he's punished you
enough now.


Now that he knows you're
the mother of his child.


It's time to stop
playing games.


A new life with him
can be given to you


with one phone call.


A life just like
your old one with Adrian.


Cecilia, you don't really have
the choice right now.


Right now you're a murderer.


But I can change that.


Adrian killed my sister,


and you helped him.


I don't expect you to make
a decision right now.


I can come back in three days.


Be good to yourself until then.


We'll be watching.


Grab your umbrella.


Grab your rain jacket.
Grab your rain boots.


You're gonna need it.


You'll need them
for a couple days.


This pattern we're in
stays put.


We've got this
atmospheric river


pointed right here
at central California.


And that means we're gonna
keep it cloudy and rainy


as we get through
the rest of the week.


This is a lot
of moisture coming in.


It's going to mean
heavy rainfall


and flash flooding concerns


right as we get to
the end of the week.


It's not until the weekend
that we get our next chance


of seeing some dry conditions.


In fact, the next glimpse
of sunshine even


doesn't come
until Sunday afternoon


when temperatures hit
the mid-60s.


But until then,
it's going to be cool,


it's going to be damp,
it's going to be...


Open your mouth.


Tongue up.


Tongue down.


Okay. Good night.


You won't get the baby.


And you won't get me.


There you are.


Fuck you!


Get back in bed. Now.


Hey!


No! No!


Please, no!


No!


Stop. Stop.


No, please. No.


No, stop! No, stop.


He's right there.


Lay down.


He's right there.


Lay down.


He's right behind you.


- Listen to me.
- Who is?


He's right behind you.


- Turn around.
- I understand, Cecilia.


- He's right there.
- Lay down.


Listen to me!


- He's right behind you.
- Stay down.


Bang.


- Get back!
- Hey! Hey, whoa. - Okay.


Get back!


She's over here!


She's over there!
Go right!


You think you're
learning how to beat me,


so I'm gonna truly
teach you something.


If you fight me,
I won't ever hurt you.


I'll find someone you love
and hurt them instead.


Now you've only got
yourself to blame


for that innocent
young girl's death.


No, please.


Not Sydney. Adrian, no.


Hold it!


Show me your hands!


Hey!


Cecilia, don't do
anything stupid.


I'm over here!


Hey, stop her!


Heading towards the main exit!


What the... What the fuck?


Hello? Hello?


Hey!


Harry, what's going on?


Harry.


Hey!


Hello?


Harry, are you okay?


- He's fine. He's fine.
- What?


- I promise.
- Who... who is this?


This is James Lanier.


James, it's me.


Cee? What... How...


- How are you calling?
- It doesn't matter about that.


- You have to listen to me.
- No, no, it-it does matter.


- Listen...
- Come on! -


You can't be calling me.


- James, listen to me!
- Look, I...


Sydney's life is in danger.


Where are you right now?


I'm at work.
She's at the house.


Okay, you need to go to her
right now, James.


Do you hear me?


'Cause I'm afraid Adrian
is gonna do something to her.


Sydney.


Sydney.


Syd, you okay?


Sydney, Syd...


Stop!


No!


Stop!


Stop.


Dad! Dad!


No!


Sydney, get down!


Don't cry.


Tom?


Is someone there?


Help. Help.


Please.


- Help!
- Stand clear!


Police! Show me your hands.


Our tactical team


found Adrian this morning


tied up in his basement.


Looks like he was
a victim of his brother


just like you were.


No.


No, James.


That's not right.


Adrian did this to me.


He is not the victim here.


He was tied up in his basement.


If he faked his own death,


he could fake
his own kidnapping.


We have Tom's body laying
in my living room,


wearing some sort of suit
that you shot to pieces.


If it did work, it doesn't now.


But-but we have a whole bunch
of corroborative witnesses


from the psychiatric hospital


when it comes to seeing
something strange.


Look, this is
your best-case scenario


for getting
your freedom back, okay?


No.


I mean...


I know Tom's body
is in your living room.


Yeah.


Adrian did everything
before that, though.


He set his own brother up.


I know how this works, Cee.


I know. You don't understand.


No, you don't understand.


This is what he does.


He makes me feel
like I'm the crazy one.


This is...


This is what he does.


And he's doing it again.


Okay, okay, but listen.


I need you to keep that
to yourself


and let me do my job.


Okay?


Just let me help you.


Yeah, but as long as Adrian's
around, you can't help me.


Cecilia?


I'm so glad you called.


Well...


You look amazing.


I mean, you-you've always...
you always look amazing.


I don't feel amazing.


It's all a lie.


Please, come on in.


It's cold. Come on.


So, I-I wanted to get us some
simple takeout, but, of course,


I-I started obsessing over what
you'd be in the mood for.


Hence, we have the OCD buffet
of sushi, steak and pasta.


Or you might not
be hungry at all.


Uh... which is so logical


that it suddenly makes
this feast look moronic.


I'll have steak.


That's a good choice.


My hand's shaking.


Uh...


You know, you're the only
person in the world


who gets to see my hand shake.


It's 'cause I need you,
Cecilia.


I know I didn't
treat you the way


you should have been treated
when we were together.


But I've learned my lesson.


I would burn everything I own
just to prove that to you.


Okay.


Okay.


If you want to be a part
of this child's life...


...it has to start
with honesty.


Of course.


Which means I need you to admit
everything that you did.


That it was you,


not your brother.


You.


Cecilia.


I loved my brother.


And I thought he loved me, too.


I know it didn't seem like it
to the outside world, but...


Tom controlled me.


Just tell me the truth.


I need to know
that I'm not crazy, okay?


And we can't start this
with a lie.


But I'm not
starting with a lie.


It wasn't me.


I swear it.


Why can't you just
tell me the truth?


I am.


Adrian, stop.


I need you to do this for me.


More than that,


do it for you, Adrian.


I'm giving you exactly


what you're asking for,
Cecilia.


I am telling you the truth.


Oh.


Oh, no, no, no.


I know that you feel like
you're going insane sometimes.


But I'm the only one
who can help you.


Remember?


Because I know you better
than anyone else in the world.


I mean...


that shouldn't come as a...


surprise.


I should go clean myself up.


Of course.


No! No, no.


No, no. What did you do?


9-1-1,
what is your emergency?


Please, please,
you have to help me, please.


I'm with somebody,
and I think he's...


he's tried to kill himself.


Hurry. You have to help.


You have to hurry. Please.


It's, uh, 3333 Celestial Drive.


Please.


Surprise.


Hey, hey.


- Hey. You okay?
- It's okay.


- You okay? What...
- I'm okay. I'm okay.


James, look at me. I'm okay.


He killed himself.


He cut his own throat.


There's security camera
video of it.


You never did want to get him


admitting anything
on tape, did you?


Of course I did.


I just didn't know
he was that unstable.


You heard it, right?


James?


What'd it sound like to you?


It sounded a lot like
he killed himself.

-(clicking teeth) 
(humming) 
You look like you need another. Page 2/87
What are you, psychic? 
Look deep into my eyes. 
(chuckles) 
Yeah. 
You're feeling very thirsty. 
Oh, you are very good. 
-And... -("Heal the Pain" 
by George Michael playing) 
Oh, yeah, 
this is your favorite song. 
That was so psychic. 
No, that was you playing it 
four times in a row. 
Well, love me, 
love George Michael. 
We're kindred spirits. 
-How so? 
-Well, we're both singers. 
Uh, we're both 
famously misunderstood 
and underappreciated 
in our time. 
But all that's gonna change, 
'cause tomorrow I've got a 
big audition for the West End. And you, uh, 
came into town for it? 
No, I, uh, moved out 
on my flatmate today. 
So, what, 
you're gonna move back home? 
-Oh, kill me now. 
-Uh-oh. Family issues. 
Yeah. Let me count the ways. 
Um, anger, shame, resentment, 
embarrassment-- 
and that's just my mum. 
Do you want to hear 
about my sister? 
-No. Okay. 
-(laughing) 
So, what's your plan? 
I'll figure it out, you know. 
It'll be fine. 
Page 3/87
Something will turn up. 
Or someone. 
Morning, gorgeous. 
This bed, it's like sleeping 
on a pile of kittens. 
If that thought's comfortable 
-and not completely horrifying. -(chuckles) 
I'm gonna dash down the street. I need some gingerroot, 
fresh beets 
for my famous 
breakfast power juice. 
-Cool. 
-And... 
-a cappuccino while you wait. 
-Wow. 
And lashings of hot water 
if you fancy a shower. 
-Bliss. 
-I'll be right back. 
(sighs, chuckles) 
-(door opens) 
-WOMAN: 
Guess who got back from 
the conference a day early. 
God, I've missed you. 
(both scream) 
God, who are you?! 
I'm the... plumber. 
-The plumber? 
-Look... (stammers) 
This isn't what it looks like. I just... 
I just... I needed a bed 
for the night, and he... 
-Ed. -Ed. Ed was just 
so understanding. 
And I-I just... I just... I've got lots of issues, all right? Accommodation, firstly, 'cause I've sort of run out of options 
because I've really messed up 
Page 4/87
for a number of reasons. 
-And he... 
-Ed. 
Ed just seemed to get that. 
Did you shag him?

(stammers, grunts) 
Ow! 
(scoffs) 
Why is my life so shit?! 
-(groans) 
(kazoo buzzing) 
It's not funny, Klaus. 
It's incredible 
how unfunny it is.

CHILDREN'S CHOIR: 
(groans) 
I'm sorry, George. 
(sighs) 
(whispers): 
Happy. Happy. 
Happy. Happy. 
Hey, you're early. 
You are never early. 
What are you up to? 
Accommodation issues. 
Hmm. So the usual. 
What did you do this time? 
-Fry someone's fish? 
-No, no, that was last week. 
-(electrical crackling) 
(music stops) 
You are going to run out 
of friends with sofas. 
You have been sick. 
You need to take care 
of yourself better. 
-Santa, I didn't know 
Page 6/87
you cared. -I don't care. 
I just don't want you to drop 
dead in front of the customers. I don't have enough tinsel 
to cover your corpse. 
Get to work, elf. 
(groans quietly) 
I don't know. 
You're gonna have to 
help me decide. 
-They're both so darling. 
-I tell you what. 
Let's pretend Mary had twins, 
and you can get both. 
(both laugh) 
You must just love your job. 
-Love it. 
-It's like being in a dream. 
All the joys and the love 
of Christmas 
-every single day of the year. -(chuckles) 
Now, which baby 
is it going to be? 
He's gorgeous, but this one... he looks like he's having 
a lot of fun. 
-Oh, yeah, and a lot more 
to come. -(both laugh) 
-But this one, look at him. 
-Come on. Hey. 
-He's more like my idea of... 
-Jesus Christ. 
-You think so, too? 
-Katarina. 
Um, excuse me 
for just one moment. Santa! 
I need a word. 
I'm at work. 
You could've called me. 
You're not answering 
your phone. 
Remember? 
Look, I've come from work. 
Page 7/87
I need to get back, 
so come get out here. 
That's my analyst. 
So sorry. 
Santa, can you get 
down here, please? 
Please? Thank you. 
Santa? 
Are you there? 
Mum needs you to ring her. 
All right, every time 
she contacts you 
and gets no response, 
she contacts me. 
Yesterday, 17 times. 
-Just do it. -Oh, don't just 
stand there issuing commands. 
I am an adult. 
You are the furthest thing 
from an adult that I know. 
I need time to myself. 
I'm asking you to do 
a single thing, Katarina. 
It's "Kate." 
Whatever. Just ring her. 
Contact her. 
Give me one good reason. 
You've missed five 
doctor's appointments. 
You've got one planned 
for tomorrow, which apparently you know about. 
You have to be there. 
She's also planning a dinner 
to celebrate my promotion. 
And you not ringing her 
is seriously affecting my life. Will you be inviting Alba 
to the dinner? 
Just ring your mother. 
Christ. 
(sighs) 
Yeah, Jenna, it's me. 
Listen, darling, 
Page 8/87
I'm sorry 
to leave this message. 
I just really need 
a bed for the night. 
Even possibly a few nights. 
-You're my bestie. Please. 
I know. -(grunts) 
-Just... 
-Hey, elf! 
This is my elf. 
Santa has elves, you know. 
Little helpers. 
I have nicknamed her 
"Lazy the Elf" 
because she appears 
never to work. 
-That's me. Mm. 
-She could also be called 
-"Crushing Disappointment 
the Elf." -(laughter) 
-I-I'm just... (clears throat) -"Waste of Payroll the Elf," 
"Bleeding Me Dry the Elf,"

-(gasps) Jesus. 
-Where'd you come from? 
-Well, what are you looking at? Look, look. 
There. You see it? 
-KATE: 
the lip of the roof there. 
It's quite unusual to see 
a bird like that in town. 
-Blimey. 
-(bird screeches) 
(groans) Damn it. 
Here. Uh, I think 
it just pooed in your eye. 
Page 9/87
Yeah, I think so. 
-SANTA: 
-KATE: 
-(Santa speaks Mandarin) 
-Ow. 
-Where have you been? 
-(groans) 
A shitting bird 
just shat in my eye. 
-Oh. Is there a bird in here? 
-No. 
Some bloke was outside the shop playing silly buggers. 
Well, maybe you can focus 
your attention 
-on the silly buggers inside 
the shop. -(phone ringing) 
I know. Oh! My phone. 
Sorry. Sorry. 
I'm sorry, Santa. 
Yeah, Jenna! 
Yes! Thank you so much. 
Thank you so much. 
Thank you so... 
I'll be with you around 8:00. 
-Okay. You are number one. 
-Get off the phone now! 
Okay, I got to go. Bye. 
Yeah, I'm just gonna get 
the shit out my eye. 
-I'll be right... 
-Time to sparkle! 
There you are, sir. Enjoy your festive hybrid Hanukkah bush. 
Merry Christmas to you. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. Take care.

SANTA: 
Your mother again? 
-I curse the day I was born. 
-Me, too. 
Ha! Funny, no. I installed 
everything on her phone 
from Snapchat to Instagram. 
All it means is that 
I can disappoint her 
in more ways than ever. 
Mothers are hell. 
Oh, yeah. 
KATE: 
Mm. 
Hello. 
-Leave him to me. 
-Oh! 
You'll just flirt with him, and he'll forget to buy anything. 
-Hi. 
-How can I help you? 
Wouldn't mind finding him 
in my stocking. 
-Hi. 
-(yells) Hi. Hi. 
I came in to check on your eye. It's fine. 
-It's good luck, you know. 
-What is? 
Getting pooed on by a bird. 
-Bollocks is it. 
-No, seriously. 
So I thought I'd see 
if you fancied 
-a little stroll with me. 
-Oh, that's my luck? 
-Going for a stroll with you? 
-Might be. 
Look, did you find me 
on Swiper? 
-Swiper? 
-Yeah.

The modern dating application 
you might have heard of. 
Oh. So not. 
Look, to be honest, 
you're not really my type. 
To be honest, 
you're not really mine. 
(opens drawer) 
Well, maybe we should 
just leave it, then. 
I do like a challenge, though. -You considered BASE jumping? 
-(closes drawer) 
-Japanese blowfish? 
-No, I have, 
but right now I'm considering 
a little stroll with you. 
Well, consider away, 
because it's a no. 
Is there anything 
that I could improve upon 
to, say, persuade you? 
-No. 
-Any reason in particular? 
Because you're weird, this is 
weird, and I don't know you. 
So, please, could you 
just leave, okay? Just get... 
-Shoo. Just go. Just go. 
-Hold on. This is weird? 
Let's just... 
Yeah, you're weird. 
-You're strange. I don't 
really... -Weirder than Grabber -or Swiper or whatever 
it's called? -Yeah. 
(sighs) Oh, just... 
Weirder than total strangers 
deciding on 
one Photoshopped image 
whether or not to engage 
in immediate foreplay? 
I'm busy. 
You're weird. Goodbye.

(register beeping) 
Can... 
Um... do you need any... 
-(drawer closes) 
-(register beeps) 
Good evening. 
Good eve... (gasps) 
Can I help you? 
I think so. 
Go on, then. 
What is it 
you were looking for? 
Um... 
This. 
That is very nice. 
It's Mr. Claus, I believe. 
Yes. 
Upon his vehicle. 
-Yes. 
-Do you have something... 
dissimilar? 
Yes. 
We have many... 
dissimilar items. 
Uh, for instance, 
this Christmas gibbon. 
(high-pitched voice): 
-(gibbon screeches) 
-(button clicks) 
-(screeches) 
It is amusing. 
I think so, too. 
(music stops) 
I'll come back for it. 
Yes. 
-Yes. 
-(sets figure on counter) 
Page 13/87
SANTA (hushed): 
Yes. 
Wow. 
That was like watching 
a short Scandinavian film. 
Are you all right? 
-Yes, I'm fine. 
-(sets gibbon on counter) 
Wait. Hang on. 
Did you... like him? 
You're so mysterious, 
I can't tell. 
Of course not. 
Oh, my God, you did like him. 
(gasps) 
I don't know anything 
about him. 
And you're fantasizing, elf, 
because all you seem to 
think about these days is sex. Ooh. 
-Oh, my God, he's coming back. -Where?! 
Got you. 
I knew you liked him. 
Well, now I know. 
You like your men tall, 
shy and translucent, 
like a squid but with bones 
and less legs. 
Shut up, lock up, 
and good night. 
-Mm-hmm. 
-(cell phone chimes)

in Serbo-Croatian)

-Sorry! 
Bugger. 
No, no, no, no, no, no! 
Please wait, please wait, 
please wait!

Not for me. 
-Charming. 
-Jarring.

CASTING DIRECTOR: 
"Maybe plus." 
Hi. 
-Hi. Sorry. 
-Hi. Oh. 
-So sorry. I'm late. 
-CASTING DIRECTOR: Sorry. 
-The auditions are closed now. -Right, yes. 
I was on the list. 
No, my name's Kate Andrich. 
Yeah, there was just a terrible accident on the way here. 
Was, uh, Santa involved? 
Well, yeah. 
She was, actually, yeah. 
"She"? Oh, is this like a 
"God being a woman now" thing? Oh, no, no, no. 
These are just my work clothes. -Don't worry about it. 
-Where do you work? 
Elf and safety? 
Uh... (laughs) 
Not exactly. 
Page 15/87
-Uh, I'm so sorry. 
-CASTING DIRECTOR: Sorry. 
-You're gonna have to come back next time. -It's too late. 
DIRECTOR: 
Let her go. 
I... Who knows? She might be 
the next Streisand. 
-We don't know. 
-(producer sighs) 
Plus, I've never seen an elf 
audition before. 
(laughs) 
Um, yeah. Take it away, 
you weird little 
North Pole-ian. 
It's Kate. Uh, wh-where 
can I plug in my music? 
The sound engineer's gone home. -Great. 
-A cappella. 
The penalty for lateness. 
Yeah, I can do that. Okay. 
Sure. 
Okay. 
(clears throat) 
-Stop! Stop. 
(chuckles softly) 
-You've got the part. 
-(stammers) 
Oh, uh, sorry. 
No, no, no, it was, uh... 
-it was shit.

-("Jingle Bell Rock" playing) 
(sighing): 
Oh, for God's sake. 
Whoa! (gasps) 
-You again? 
-What do you mean, "again"? 
Did you follow me here? 
No, I made a delivery here. 
-Yeah? 
-Are elves always so cynical? 
Yes, relentlessly. 
These are dark times. 
-So, having not 
followed you here... -Mm-hmm. 
...and having made my delivery, and you having bumped into me 
by chance, here we are. 
"Here we are"? 
Well, for instance, we could go for a walk together. 
Why do you keep trying 
to take me for a walk? 
-I'm not a dog. -Well, 
you are wearing a collar. 
Oh, LOL. You know what? 
I'm just not in the mood 
for a walk. 
Why? 
Well, fine. Okay. 
I was just incredibly bad 
at what I do 
in front of people 
who could've given me a job. 
I thought you had a job. 
Yes, but it's not 
what I "do" do. 
I'm not a career elf. 
Oh. What do you do? 
(grunts rhythmically) 
Sing. 
Wow. That's pretty amazing. 
I just can't seem to... 
Page 17/87
at the moment. 
Anyway, boring, boring, boring, la, la, la, la. 
I'm not bored. 
Actually, who are you? 
I'm Tom. 
Kate. 
Why are you so flexible? 
Why are you dressed 
like an elf? 
You know why. 
And you know what? 
I have had my fill 
of utterly hilarious elf jokes for one night. 
Cover me. 
-Here? 
-Here. 
You are now my cupboard door. 
-(grunting) 
-(Tom sighs) 
-So, you do this often? 
-Only when I have to. 
-TOM: 
-KATE: 
-(man whistles) 
-(man hooting) 
KATE: 
Oh, piss off. 
Nice covering. 
I'm-I'm trying my best here. 
(Kate whistles) 
Ooh. Thanks. 
TOM (sighs): 
Okay. 
Okay. Oh, no. Hang on. 
(bells jingling) 
-Where are we going? 
-This way. Come on. 
(grunts) 
Page 18/87
Oh... 
(Tom sighs) 
-Look at that. 
-Oh. 
You never seen 
this alleyway before? 
-Nope. -This is 
the narrowest alley in London. My mate Hendo, he calls it 
"Fat Man's Squeeze." 
-It's pretty cool, though, 
isn't it? -Sure. Why not? 
I like hidden places. 
Has anyone ever told you 
there's something 
slightly serial killer-y 
about you? 
No. Come to think of it, 
no one's ever 
-said that to me before. 
-Ah. 
TOM: 
Never more than once, anyway. 
Why are you always 
dancing about? 
Look up. 
Oh, wow. 
-Are they mice? 
-Yeah, I think so. 
There must be a story 
attached to them. 
I'll have to find out one day. -Yeah. I mean, it's very... 
-Come on. 
(laughing): 
You are so strange. 
-You're so weird. 
-Keep looking up. 
-Oh! Ow. 
-(thud, objects clatter) 
-You okay? 
-(groans) No! 
Page 19/87
Just my luck, I face-plant 
into a pile of rubbish 
because I wasn't looking 
where I was going 
like a bloody normal person. 
Well, you're not 
used to looking up. 
Or smelling like a bin. 
-Seen this? 
-Seen what? 
-KATE (laughing): Oh, my God. 
-TOM: 
I've walked down this street 
so many times. 
I've never seen that before. 
Like I say. Follow me. 
(quietly): 
Ooh. 
(bell tolling) 
(Kate chuckles quietly) 
KATE: 
This is cool. 
Welcome to my secret 
little garden. 
KATE: 
I had no idea this existed. 
TOM: 
Not many people do. 
(Kate sighs) 
Oh. Have a look over there. 
-It's Gideon. 
-KATE: 
TOM: 
He's recently divorced. 
-Oh. 
-He owes £748 in child support. How do you know? 
Page 20/87
I heard him have a very loud 
phone conversation 
right behind that shrub. 
KATE: 
no one could hear him. 
-Oh, and that's Geoff, 
a Mafia don. -Really? 
-No. He works at Burger King. 
-(laughs) 
He's also a vegan, 
so very conflicted. 
Who's she? 
TOM: 
That's Ursula. 
She lives in the flats 
around the back. 
She runs a brothel 
down in Bethnal Green. 
Now, some of the girls, 
they used to come, take a seat, just have a chat, 
and then go back to work. 
KATE: 
she was giving them tips? 
TOM: 
No. 
More like a bit of support. 
I want to talk to her. 
No, you can't do that. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
Everyone keeps 
everyone's secrets around here. It's like an unspoken rule. 
Well, you just told me 
Gideon's. 
Fair point. 
You're one of us now. 
(both sigh) 
So, when's your next audition? Saturday. 
Page 21/87
-It's for Frozen. 
-What's that? 
You... (laughs) 
You really don't know? 
-No, really. 
-Okay. It's a film... 
about two sisters 
who used to get on really well, and then don't 
because one of them 
has a problem with ice. 
And the production is... 
on ice! 
Huh. So, you can skate 
as well as sing? 
-No. 
-You can't skate? 
Never tried it. 
I'm gonna wing it. 
It'll be cool. 
I really enjoyed 
our walk today. 
Ditto. 
Would you like to... 
repeat the experience? 
Would you like 
to give me your number? 
I don't have a phone. 
What? (stammers) 
(laughing): 
I was just beginning to think 
you're not as weird 
as you look. Uh... 
Before you throw me in the bin with the rest 
of your battered conquests, 
it's... 
not completely true. 
I do have a phone. 
-It's just locked 
in a cupboard. -Why? 
Well, I got so tired 
of staring at my hand all day. Page 22/87
I mean, you should try it. 
That's like saying 
you should try death. 
-(ringtone playing) 
-I think somebody really 
-wants to get hold of you. 
-Yeah, no, I know. 
Someone really isn't 
gonna get the chance. 
-(clears throat) No. 
Ditch that. 
All of your stresses 
will just melt away. 
Oh, but I just like stress. 
-(horn honks) 
-DRIVER: 
You getting on? 
-Yeah. 
-Your chariot awaits. 
Indeed. 
-(grunts) 
-I'll see you at the store. 
-Okay. 
-And don't forget-- look up. 
Oh, for God's sake, 
shut up, will you? 
(chuckles quietly) 
(sighs softly) 
-(sighing, chuckling): Hi. Hey. -Hi. Thank you so much. 
-Thank you so much. Thank you 
so much. -It's okay. It's okay. And your suite, madame. 
-(Kate chuckling) 
-Ta-da! 
JENNA: 
just before we got the crib up, -so there was still room. Yeah. -Yeah. 
This is gonna be so good 
for my sex life. (chuckles)

(music playing quietly) 
KATE: 
Mm... 
Hey, Ruf. 
-Hey, Kate. 
-Thanks for this. 
-Holding up? 
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
-Fine. Totally fine. 
-How's it all been? 
-(groans) 
JENNA: 
How's Santa? 
Oh, you know, fine. 
Her usual, curt, Asian self. 
I thought you might have 
decided to move on. 
No, no. (grunts) 
What, with something 
that started as a Saturday job? Yeah. Comfy where I am. 
(Serbian accent): And, um, 
uh, what about your folks 
and mad Marta? 
-With her law firm 
and her briefcase. -Ah. 
(Serbian accent): I stay out 
of contact with the crazies. 
(normal accent): 
Um, you know, 
just to give myself 
a bit of space. 
Are the doctors 
keeping in touch? 
-How about being pregnant? Huh? -(sighs) 
For crying out loud, 
how's that? 
Page 24/87
JENNA: 
conspiracy, is what it is. 
-Yeah? -Yeah, they lie 
to you about pregnancy. 
You know the whole glowing, 
mother-to-be image 
you see in the ads? 
-Yeah. 
-It's just bollocks. 
You know, genuine bollocks. 
It's just 
a nine-month-long trauma 
-spent piddling into cups... 
-(sighs) Of course it is. 
...being poked up the vag 
by strangers with cold hands, 
and, you know, if men 
had to do this shit, 
we would have 
contraceptive beer. 
You know, actually, 
if men had to do it, 
the human race 
would just die out. 
-Sh... 
-No, Ruf. 
I know you know all this, 
and I know you're fed up 
with feminism 
in general, but... 
I'm not fed up with feminism. 
No, I mean, 
she's not listening. 
(snoring softly) 
That's not right. 
This is a fish knife. 
I'm trying to cut a passion 
fruit with a fish knife. 
If anyone can do it, you can. 
It's your fault. 
You did this. 
Wake Me Up Bef 
Page 25/87
-(gasping) 
Wha... 
Hey, Sleeping Beauty. 
-Hi. 
-Come and grab some food. 
Oh, yeah. 
(Kate groans) 
(softly): 
Good sleeping. 
Anyone up for a, 
you know, pizza? 
Bottle of Rioja? 
Mm. Celiac. 
Oh, yeah. I forgot. 
And preggers, so we ain't 
drinking, either, party girl. 
-(Jenna chuckles) 
-Okay. Well, I'm off out. 
Okay. I'll see you later. 
I won't be too late. 
I promise. 
Yeah, all right. Peace out. 
-(door closes) 
-Don't. 
She's my oldest friend. 
I know it seems like she's... 
The most selfish woman 
in the world? 
Oof. Harsh. 
She's been ill. 
I'm over the galleon, 
but one more thing, 
and my legendary patience 
will crumble. 
Don't bring that up. 
She burned her eyebrows off. 
Her eyebrows will grow back. 
You know what won't grow back? (Jenna laughing) 
-(grunts) 
-(screams) Oh, my... 
Page 26/87
My matchstick galleon. 
No, I agree. 
One, and she's out. 
MALE RADIO ANNOUNCER: 
Wakey, wakey, London. 
Here's something 
to start your day. 
(door creaking quietly) 
(Fabien exhales, inhales) 
-Mm, ma chérie. 
-No! 
-(door slams) 
-Not again! Stop. Shh. 
(muttering, grunting) 
Okay. Thank you. 
You take me for 
the full English now? 
No, mate. You had 
the full English last night. 
-Sortez. (groans) 
-(Fabien speaking French) 
-(door closes) 
-(Kate clears throat) 
Hi. 
Morning. Hello. 
Happy? A good morning. 
It's brilliant. 
It's lovely, isn't it? 
Well, someone looks not rested. What? Me? No, fine. 
Totally fine. 
Able to leap sofas 
in a single bound... 
-No, no! -Oh, my God! 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. (footsteps crunching) 
(door closes, bell jingles) 
CHURCHILL: 
write this out for you. 
CROWLEY: 
right go in here, haven't they? Page 27/87
-KATE: 
-Probably just kids. 
-Yeah, I reckon it's just kids. -Just kids. 
-Yeah. 
-Like, yeah, I just said. 
This is your crime number. 
You'll need it for insurance. 
-Thank you. 
-What happened? 
Break-in, I'm afraid. 
Very common this time of year. -Place like this is 
a prime target. -Mm. 
Lovely, it is. 
Is that a crocodile 
with pompoms? 
Yes. 
And, uh, who... who's this? 
This is my employee. 
She locked up last night, 
so please ask her 
if she saw anything. 
Nothing out of the ordinary. 
Are you writing that down? 
I am. 
How do you spell "ordinary"? 
Well, we're done here. 
We'll be in touch 
if we hear anything. 
Mm, pity. 
It's a lovely place. 
-It is. I love Christmas. 
-No, you don't. 
You make 
"have a merry Christmas" 
sound like a death threat. 
What are you talking about? 
Merry Christmas. 
Have yourself 
a merry Christmas, yeah? 
-You see? You just did it. 
-What do you mean, 
-I just did it? 
Page 28/87
-You just did it. 
Let me get my phone out. 
I'll record you, 
and you'll realize 
you sound like Jason Statham. 
CROWLEY: 
Well, that's a good thing, 
'cause I love Jason Statham, 
-so that's not even an insult. -Santa, I... 
-Don't talk to me. 
-But, listen, I... 
I said, "Don't talk to me." 
You forgot to lock up. 
Don't deny it. 
Well, I can pay you back. 
Now, you listen to me 
and you listen good. 
You were great at your job 
when you started. 
That's why I took you on 
full-time. 
You've got a way with people, 
and I felt so lucky 
to have you. 
Thanks. 
But I don't feel lucky anymore. Since you came back, 
you started losing your shit. 
It's like you don't care 
about anything. 
So, now, you care about this. 
I had to smash my own window 
to make it look 
like a break-in. 
Otherwise, 
I wouldn't get the insurance. 
(grunts softly) 
You turned me into someone 
who broke the law. 
(stammers quietly) 
I can't believe I'm even 
giving you another chance, 
Page 29/87
but I am because... 
-I am a good person. 
-Yeah. 
But one more thing, 
and you're out. 
So clean up your mess, 
you stupid, stupid girl. 
-Hey. 
-Hey. 
Were you coming to see me? 
-No. 
-Oh. 
Great. 
You okay? 
Yeah. No, we had a break-in, 
-and Santa's taken it 
really badly. -Right. 
And I got chucked out 
of my digs this morning, 
-so I've got nowhere to stay. 
-Mm. 
Anyway, I'm homeless again. 
-That bad, huh? 
-Yep. 
Okay. 
You should come with me, then. You were so coming to see me. 
-Mm-mm. 
-Yep. 
-Nope. 
-Yep. 
Not in your wildest dreams. 
-Uh, yeah. 
-This way. 
Page 30/87
-Yeah, you were so coming 
to see me. -Uh-uh. 
Here we are. 
-KATE: 
-TOM: 
The homeless. 
Oh, Christ. 
Well, thanks, 
Bono or Mother Teresa 
or whoever wins 
the moral superiority prize. 
You're the one who used 
the word "homeless." 
I meant I haven't got a place 
to stay that I've chosen. 
I choose not to go back 
to my parents' house. 
And they live here in London? 
Yeah, kinda, sorta. 
Christ, if I'm going home, 
I'm gonna need a drink. 
How about you leave it and 
you go home alarmingly sober? 
Oh, bugger off, person who has never met my parents. 
Okay. 
Where are you going? 
I'm going in there. 
Well, you're not homeless. 
No, I volunteer in here. 
(laughs) 
Christ, why don't you just get "saint" tattooed 
on your forehead? 
-Oh, boy. 
-(laughing): 
Just can't help it, can you? 
What? 
Never mind. 
Good luck. 
(groans) 
Page 31/87
-Good night. 
-Ugh. 
("Everything She Wants" 
by Wham! playing) 
(“ Everything She Wants” by Wham!) (bicycle bell dings) 
Hi. Yeah, I need a cab. 
I honestly think she 
preferred it when I was ill. 
You know? Like it made her 
more important. 
More center stage. 
-IVAN: 
-And all she's done, really, 
since the operation 
is try to interfere 
and control my life. 
You know, how do you even know if you have a life? 
Does anything official arrive 
that tells you? 
Like an envelope and something that's like, "Dear so-and-so, 
you now have a life. 
We wish you'd get on with it." -Hmm. -Oh, everything's 
just such a mess. 
Page 32/87
How did I even get here? 
IVAN: 
Through the tunnel. 
Yeah. 
Here we are. 
Mm. Thanks, Dad. 
Mwah. 
-You coming in? 
-No, no, no. 
Your mother is still up. 
I like to wait 
until she's asleep. 
She talks less. 
(both chuckle) 
Why don't you just 
get a divorce? Huh? 
-Mm. -Been avoiding 
each other for years. 
No. 
No, divorce is for the rich. 
Ah. 
Get some rest, Katarina. 
You look done in. 
-It's "Kate." 
-Ah. 
Don't pick up anyone dodgy. 
Yeah. 
-(grunts) 
-Love you. 
(dog barking in distance) 
(grunts) 
Mum? 
Mum, would you let me in? 
Mum? Would... Mum! 
Nailed it shut. Mental. 
KGB! Open up! 
-KGB! -PETRA: 
-(lock clicking) 
Ne, ne, ne, ne. Stop. 
Stop. You are very bad girl. 
Would you prefer the KGB? 
KGB. (clicks tongue) 
Page 33/87
You don't make joke about 
what you don't understand. 
(clicks tongue) 
Yeah, well, can I just come in? Can I... 
-What you done? You look like 
dead person. -Oh, yeah. 
Thanks. 
Great parenting. Great. 
-Why don't you do it inside? 
-Why don't you ring me? 
-(Kate groans) 
-You have phone. 
Uh, it-it's broken. 
(Petra exclaims 
in Serbo-Croatian) 
Why you not ring me 
when I worry about you?! 
Not to hear nothing. 
No call, no Twitter, 
no Snap... chat shot. 
I think she's dead, 
she's had lapse, 
she's never coming home, 
like her father 
who is never here. 
My life is hell, Katarina. 
It's "Kate." It's "Kate." 
"Kate" is not a name. 
"Katarina" is name. 
Katarina. 
Cat is animal. 
Cat, dog. 
What I call Marta? Dog. 
I call you cat. 
-Meow. 
-(clears throat) 
Yeah, no, great, 
but can I get some sleep? 
One of us should sleep. 
I don't sleep. 
-Yeah. 
-This is very... 
-This is naughty. 
Page 34/87
-Yeah. 
Mum! 
Can I please just go to sleep? Yes, you sleep. 
We talk morning. 
-You are clean, hmm? 
-This... Yeah, yeah, um... 
-Pillow. Pillow. 
-Okay. Um, yeah, it's a pillow. -Head. Sleep. 
-Yeah, I am gonna... 
I'm good. (mutters) 
-Hmm. 
-KATE: 
(sighs) Okay. 
-Good night. 
-Naughty. 
(yawns) 
Oh, God. 
Mm. 
-(high-pitched groan) 
DR. ADDIS: 
So, uh, tell me about the diet. -Keeping up with the fruit 
and veg? -Yeah, fine. 
She's eating rubbish 
when she is outside. 
When she's at home, she's 
eating my food, and it's good. I'm sure it is. 
Uh, what about sleep? 
-Yeah, it's all right. 
-She never sleeps. 
-Exercise? 
-Religiously. -Not at all. 
-Alcohol? 
Page 35/87
-Every once in a while. 
Oh, she's drinking 
like the pirate. 
-You say you're okay. 
-KATE: 
And your mother says 
the opposite. Who do I believe? -Me, obviously. 
-Me, the mother, of course. 
-All right, all right, listen. -(Petra scoffs) 
There's nothing 
conclusive here, 
but you, Kate, you've got to 
take care of your heart. 
You need to rest more, 
-eat better, drink less... 
-Da. Da. Da. 
-and stop being so angry. 
-Da. -(Kate groans) 
And you, Mrs. Andrich... 
you need to worry less. 
I not sleeping. 
Can you please give me 
something for sleeping? 
Mrs. Andrich, you've been given everything there is 
for sleep, anxiety, 
panic attacks, the lot. 
You have the best that 
modern medicine has to offer. 
-Then what can I do? 
-Join a club. 
Hmm? Talk to other people. 
Enjoy time with your friends. 
-All my friends were murdered. -Okay, fine. 
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you 
so much for your time. 
-But it's-it's true. 
-Let's go, Mum. Come on. 
-They took them. 
-Mum, come on. Come on. I know. Page 36/87
-Thank you. Um... -Come on, 
Mama, out we get. Sorry. 
-Sorry. Let's go. -Kate, we'll see you in a... in a month. 
-(speaking Serbo-Croatian) 
-See you next year. 
-There you go. All right. 
-I am coming. I come. 
-Get-get out the-- Right. 
-I'm coming. 
-Thank you. -(door closes) 
-(sighs) Bloody hell. 
(bell jingles) 
Can I help? 
No. 
I'm having a self-pity party. 
Ooh. 
Am I invited? 
Well, only if you promise 
to judge me. 
Oh, you definitely don't need 
any help doing that. 
Or maybe you do. 
I'm very good at tidying up. 
(clears throat) 
Yes. 
-These expensive? 
-(rattling) 
(Kate stammers) 
Idiot. Follow me. 
Ah. 
(singsongy): 
Tra-la. 
Tra-la. 
All right, Mr. Muscle, you can get to refreshing that tree. 
-This one? 
-Yeah. 
Going home 
always makes me crazy. 
How was it? 
Hell. Mum sung me to sleep. 
You're the only person 
Page 37/87
who can make being sung to 
sleep sound like waterboarding. Well, it's not that dissimilar. 
(laughing): 
These, um, folk songs 
make you want 
to string yourself up. 
Is that where you get 
your singing from? 
Yeah, she was a singer 
back in, um, the homeland. 
Where was that? 
Former Yugoslavia. 
We had to escape. 
-'Cause of the war? 
-Exactly. 
Mm. Must have been hard. 
Yeah. Dad was a lawyer. 
Um, and now he stays away 
from home as much as he can 
because he'd rather be dead. 
(chuckles) 
Except he's a minicab driver, 
which is sort of 
the same thing. 
Can he not practice here? 
No, he couldn't afford 
to retrain, 
so he's out all the time. 
Also to avoid my mother, 
who's given to depression 
in much the same way as, um... What? 
You're looking at me like 
some sort of science experiment that's gone wrong. 
Sorry. 
-No, I'm interested. 
-Huh. 
I mean, your mother-- 
when was the last time 
you saw her 
not being depressed? 
Page 38/87
(chuckles) 
Ooh, I think 
when I got really ill. 
And she was happy about that? 
No, but she was happy 
about the attention. 
I mean, 
I got a lot of attention, 
but I was unconscious. 
She got more. 
Just the doctors, 
the nurses, the hospital staff. Drama. God, she loved it. 
She sort of flowered 
under it like a... 
like a late blossoming 
or something. 
Anyway, when I got better, 
it all went away, 
and she's just never 
been the same since. 
Well, maybe she enjoyed 
being needed again. 
Oh, trust you to come up 
with something understanding. 
-That is truly horrific. 
-(Kate chuckles) 
I mean, who buys this stuff? 
Santa. She's Chinese, 
so she's, you know, 
got access to some 
really freaky outlets. 
She just loves Christmas 
more than anything else. 
-More than taste or sanity. 
-Yes, exactly. 
And that isn't even 
the nastiest thing we sell. 
Inconceivable. 
Hang on. 
-Oh! 
-Check it out. 
-What is it? 
Page 39/87
-Is that donkey actually 
smiling at me? -Yeah. Yeah. 
And that baby 
has a full set of teeth. 
-Oof. -I sold four of these 
last week. I'm that good. 
(techno version 
of "Last Christmas" playing) 
Oh, it's a... 
oh, it's a techno manger. 
-Yeah. 
-Oh, yeah, yeah. Cool. 
-It's a disco nativity scene. 
-(laughing) 
Is that really 
a good nutritional choice? 
Oh, God, don't you start. 
Where are you? 
Look up. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, after you... 
what you've been through, 
I mean, shouldn't you be eating quinoa or kale or something? 
Yeah, but this 
admittedly rank burger 
is all part of my grand plan 
to become a famous singer 
and die like Kurt Cobain, 
Amy Winehouse and all the rest at the age of 27. 
-How old are you? 
Oh. Good to have dreams. 
Not really. I'm 26. 
Oh, thank God. 
You still have time. 
(chuckles) 
-Come on. Get rid of that. 
-Where...? Wait. 
Let's go. 
I've got a surprise for you. 
-Ugh, really? (laughs) 
-Mm, yummy! 
There's something wrong 
Page 40/87
with me, you know. 
-I'm too trusting. 
-(Tom scoffs) 
Down a dark alley again 
with a complete stranger. 
I don't even... 
I mean, seriously, 
-where are you... (chuckles) 
-Pop yourself over here. 
-All right, then. 
-Need a hand? 
No. 
-(grunting): 
-Oh. 
-(groans) Oh, my God. 
-Oh! That looked painful. 
-Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine! 
-Ah, you... you're fine. 
That was like poetry in motion. -Piss off. 
-Come on. 
Sure. Never wanted kids anyway. (grunts) 
(Kate groaning) 
Okay. 
Now I am intrigued. 
-How are you gonna dispose 
of my body? -Shh... 
-Shh! 
-I... am shh-ing. 
(imitating Sean Connery): 
Stay back. 
Are you seriously doing 
a James Bond impression? 
Now is not the time 
for unpleasantness. 
Now is the time... for romance! ("Praying for Time" 
by George Michael playing) 
You like? 
I like, yeah. 
Let's go. 
Page 41/87
-Oi! 
-Oh, sorry! -Oh, crap. 
-You can't be in here! 
-Yeah, no. -Sorry, no. 
-We're-we're leaving. 
-Absolutely, we're leaving. 
-Sorry... (screams) 
-Whoa! 
-(Kate squeals) 
-TOM: 
(both laugh, whooping) 
-(groans) Ow! 
-(Tom chuckling) 
KATE: 
I'm coming. I'm com... 
Page 42/87
(both chuckle and sigh) 
I would, uh... I'd call that 
a successful date. 
Fun, free, illegal, romantic. 
-And practical, too. 
Don't forget. -(laughs) 
Why practical? 
Your audition. 
-Remember? 
-Yes. 
I'd like to think that I played a part in your rise to stardom. -(laughs) -Remember me 
when you're at the top. 
No chance. Tom who? 
Actually, Tom who? 
Webster. 
Huh. 
You look like a Webster. 
Now what? 
Now I've got to go to work. 
Um... 
You knew. 
-I work nights. 
-Yes. 
I knew. 
It's night. Cool. Okay. 
How you gonna get home? 
-Oh, the bus. 
-(Tom grunts) 
You gonna be okay? 
As okay as I'll ever be 
on the bus. 
Okay, then. 
I'll come find you at the shop. 
(chuckling): 
if I've still got a job. 
Santa kind of hates me. 
Maybe you should do 
something nice for Santa. 
Good luck. 
Look up. 
-(chuckles softly) 
Page 43/87
-(horn honks) 
-(brakes squealing) 
-(horn honking) 
Christ. 
So, this is our selection 
-of nutcrackers. 
-Working hard over here. 
-Mm-hmm. 
-Mm. 
You know, from the ballet? 
-Tchaikovsky? 
-WOMAN: 
MAN: 
Which kind of music is this? 
-I want something to be... 
-WOMAN: 
SANTA: 
This is Christmas music. 
You must enjoy it. 
SANTA: 
This is a big nutcracker. 
MAN: 
Can my nuts fit inside there? 
SANTA: 
how big are your nuts. 
WOMAN: 
We can't take that with us. 
Santa, um, I think 
I can take over from there. 
Because, um, there's also 
someone here, a gentleman, 
who requires 
your specific assistance. 
SANTA: 
Yes, you can have a look. 
Page 44/87
Think about it. 
KATE: 
I'm gonna show you to 
the even bigger nutcrackers 
around the corner. 
MAN: 
There's bigger nuts? 
-KATE: 
Here we are. -MAN: Oh. 
Have you come back 
for the gibbon? 
Of all the things in my life, 
this is my best thing. 
What is? 
Christmas. 
Really? 
This is why I love 
to come in here. 
I also love it. 
That is why I have this shop. 
Oh, wow. 
(chuckles softly) 
(applause) 
Kate, that was lovely. 
Thank you. 
Wonderful. 
I can smell the commitment. 
Do you know we have people 
turn up here, 
never been 
on an ice rink before? 
(laughing): 
I just couldn't imagine. 
Do you know we had a woman 
Page 45/87
turn up in a crop top? 
-In a crop top to audition. 
-Yeah, I remember. 
Do you remember her flip-flops? -Remember those? -Of course 
I remember. -I remember. 
CASTING DIRECTOR: 
Thank you. We'll be in touch. 
-DIRECTOR: 
-Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
I think she'd be good 
for the horse. Don't you think? -DIRECTOR: 
-KATE: 
-DIRECTOR: 
-I, uh... I did that 
just in case you thought 
I was too perfect. 
KATE: 
Okay. 
Okay. 
DIRECTOR: 
for a heavy woolen tight. 
KATE: 
Idiot. 
Skaters fall. It's fine. 
MAN: 
...at the same time. 
Also, nobody's clapping. 
(continues indistinctly) 
-(scattered applause) 
-(indistinct chatter) 
-(applause) 
-(crowd murmuring) 
So, it went well, 
Page 46/87
and I am happy. 
Good. 
All set for your date? 
Good Lord. 
(clears throat) 
Okay. 
-Right, um... 
-What? 
We're just gonna need 
to dial this down. 
I'm making an effort. 
He's gonna think he's wandered into the llama enclosure. 
Close. 
(sighs) 
Ow. 
KATE: 
Mm-hmm. 
-Ow. 
-Oh, yeah. 
Serves you right. 
So I defer to the Swiper queen. -Blot. 
-Mm, mm. 
There we are. 
So, where is See-Through 
taking you? 
-I have no idea. 
-What's his name? 
I can't pronounce it. 
Lots of glottal stops. 
"Yogh..." (hawking) 
Oh, when I try to say it, 
I sound like a cat 
with a fur ball. 
So I've decided 
to call him "Boy." 
Mm. Well, at least your name's easier to pronounce. 
What? Huang Qing Shin? 
You're not really called Santa? Of course not, idiot. 
-I chose it for the shop. 
Page 47/87
-Really? 
Yeah, when I worked 
at the pet shop, 
I called myself Kitty. 
-No. 
-Mm-hmm. 
And at the health food shop, 
I was Miso. 
-No, no. 
-Mm-hmm. Yes, yes. 
Guess what it was in the bakery on the Edgware Road. 
Uh, Crumpet? 
-Sausage Roll? 
-Muffin. 
-(laughs): 
-"Muff" for short. 
Excellent. 
More important is: 
how do I look? 
Really hot. 
(giggles) 
Did you just giggle 
like a girl? 
I am a girl. 
-Not really. 
-Oh, shut up. 
And where's this man of yours? The one you keep 
looking out the window for 
instead of working. 
Oh, he's just... I don't know. He hasn't got a phone. 
-Oh. He's wise. 
-Mm. 
-What is he doing with you? 
-Nothing. 
Mm. 
Don't worry, elf. 
He'll turn up. 
(sighs) 
(man grunts) 
(indistinct conversation) 
Page 48/87
We woke him up. 
(conversation continues 
indistinctly) 
(bicycle bell dings) 
(quiet chatter) 
Hi. Excuse me. 
I'm just looking for someone. 
-Who's that, then? 
-Uh, Tom. 
Ta-ta-ta. Would you like 
a biscuit, Arthur? 
Have you got a bourbon, 
Danny boy? 
No, but can I press you 
to a custard cream? 
Ooh. 
I wish somebody would. 
-Tom, did you say? 
-KATE: 
Tom. Um, h-he's tall... 
-Tom! 
-(people murmuring) 
Take your pick, young lady. 
Right. Yeah, see, the thing is, he's not homeless. 
Well, what's he 
doing here, then? 
Um, well, he works here. 
-Nights, I think. 
-Ah. 
Well, I don't see 
the night lot, me. 
-He must be a volunteer. 
-Yes. That's... 
MAN: 
Oi, Danny! Give us a hand? 
Speaking of which, 
be a pet and serve the teas 
while I get the soup sorted. 
And only 
two biscuits each, mind. 
I'm not made 
Page 49/87
of bloody biscuits. 
And watch this one, 
'cause last week, 
he filled his pockets. 
Come on, then! Tea's up! 
Okay. 
I'm Tom. 
-Ex-grenadier. Will I do? 
-Lovely. Um... 
KATE: 
Do you know, actually, it's... a whole different Tom. 
But would you like a biscuit? 
I could... make some tea. 
ARTHUR: 
Just the two, then? 
Just... 
(weakly): 
Anyone like a cup of tea? 
Try and keep it down to... 
Oi, oi. 
Nice of you to volunteer. 
Well, I-I didn't. 
I was press-ganged. 
You want to help us 
with the soup? 
KATE: 
No. Thank you, but no. 
If Tom Webster does come in, 
could you just tell him 
that Kate needs to talk to him? -Not "needs." 
-"Would like"? 
Yeah. Yeah. 
-Got it. -Yeah, 'cause 
he doesn't have a phone. 
Would you like a bowl of soup? You've earned it. 
No, I'm good. Thanks. 
Dan, what do you reckon?

Bit up herself, I thought. 
(train passing in distance) 
-IVAN: 
And-and she's very happy. 
-She was. -You show... 
I show you picture. 
-MARTA: 
-A little beautiful picture. 
-You showed me last time. 
-Easy, easy, easy. 
-And she's a... 
-Hey. 
-Ah! Oh, at last. 
-Hey. Uh, there she is. 
-PETRA: 
-(chuckles) 
-I was so worry. 
-(Ivan speaks Serbo-Croatian) 
Where you are, huh? 
-Huh? -Um, I was volunteering 
at a homeless shelter. 
-Uh, what it mean? 
-It means helping, Mum. 
-You? Helping? 
-Yes. 
-Ha, yeah. Sure you were. 
-IVAN: 
And I just rescued an orphan 
from a burning car. 
(clears throat) 
Did I miss something? 
Oh, wow. 
Oh, jebote, Marta. 
I'm sorry. 
The dinner to celebrate 
your promotion. 
Second promotion. 
-KATE (whispers): Second. 
-Great achievement. 
Page 51/87
Thank you, Dad. 
Now you are here, 
we have krem torta. 
-KATE: 
-(Ivan mutters) 
Seriously, Marta, I am sorry. 
It doesn't matter. 
-Oh, thanks a lot, Mum. 
-Your favorite. 
-I'm all right, actually. 
-MARTA: 
something wrong 
with your favorite cake now? 
No. I'm just not hungry. 
Well, I'm... 
There's always something, 
isn't there? 
Like, you're hungry, 
you're not hungry. 
You're tired, 
you're overexcited. 
-You've got a tummy ache. 
-Give... 
(groans) 
Gosh, you're so tiresome, 
Katarina. 
(groans) 
Nabijem te na kurac, Marta. 
It's "Kate." 
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
-(laughing) 
You taught her 
this terrible word? 
-Of course not. 
-Do you actually even 
know what 
"nabijem te na kurac" means? 
Uh, yeah, I actually do. 
It means, 
"I will nail you to my dick." 
-Yeah, I knew that. 
-Not "dick." "Penis." 
Page 52/87
Well, "dick" means "penis." 
-"Dick" means "penis"? 
-"Dick" means "penis." Yeah. 
-No, Dick is our neighbor. 
-It also means "penis." 
Dick, our-our neighbor, 
is called "penis"? 
Dick is penis. Penis is dick. 
That's the same word. 
-Would you stop saying "dick" 
and "penis"? -It's just... 
-I'm trying to explain. 
-Uh, uh, whatever, you know. 
-I'm just so bored of your 
shit. -Marta, stop. She's ill. -She's not ill anymore, Mum. 
-She is not ill anymore, Petra. And what you know? 
What you know anything 
about this family? 
You're never here. 
I'm not ill anymore, all right? No, she is still ill-- 
why is she still 
working in silly Christmas shop when she was always 
the b-bright one? 
Nabijem te na kurac. 
(hisses) 
You are very hard worker. 
Wha... Oh, right, yeah, 
well, well, apparently, 
with my pathetic, 
inferior little brain. 
Now she's wasting her life, 
which only a miracle save her. Wasting my life. Thanks, Mum. 
And you have job you dream of. Yeah, except that I didn't 
dream of it, did I? You did. 
You know, Dad can't be 
a lawyer here, so I had to be. No matter what I might have 
actually wanted to do. 
Page 53/87
Yeah, would you rather 
drive minicab? 
Look what it done to him. 
He look thousand years old. 
Oh, thanks. 
-Nabijem i tebe na kurac. 
-MARTA: 
y-you sit there, and you think it's absolutely acceptable 
to say that she's cleverer 
than me. 
And I'm expected to swallow it just because she's been ill. 
-Marta, calm down. 
-No, don't you dare 
-tell me to calm down, 
all right? -(groans) 
-Marta. -All right, 
you don't care about anything, Katarina, or Kate, 
or whatever your name is now, 
because you're ashamed 
of who you are. 
Oh, I'm ashamed of who I am? 
-(scoffs) 
-What about you? 
Where's Alba? 
(quietly): 
Shut up. 
On your big celebration dinner, where is your girlfriend? 
PETRA: 
Alba? 
Alba is... 
Alba is Marta's flatmate. 
KATE: 
it's always gonna be. 
I bet she's really happy 
about that. 
What she say? 
Page 54/87
Oh, God, 
you're a piece of work.

-Marta. 
-Marta. 
Eh.

("Waiting for That Day"

-(raucous laughter) 
-Hey. 
-(bicycle bell dings) 
What are you doing out so late? Well, where have you been? 
-What's up? 
-"What's up?" 
Me not being able 
to find you is what's up. 
You just... you've been 
Page 55/87
disappearing for days on end. 
-Two days. -And I've been 
trying to find you. 
So take your stupid phone 
out of your stupid cupboard 
and contact me, all right? 
'Cause... 
because I've just been 
really stupid. 
I've been 
really, really stupid. 
I mean, it's a bit 
of a stretch, but... 
have you had a couple drinks? 
Oh, bugger off 
with your cleanly manliness. 
All right? 
Just... just go back to work. 
Leave me alone. 
No, I've just come back 
from helping the needy. 
Great. 
You know, just a bit 
of psych work. 
I work with 
the severely distressed. 
You know, 
when they get off on one. 
-Ah. 
-In fact, 
you're severely distressed 
and have just gone off on one, so I'm glad that we bumped 
into each other. 
Shall we go get my phone 
from that cupboard? 
Okay. 
Let's go. 
Where are you taking me? 
Home. 
-It's down here. 
-Yeah. 
Come on in. 
Page 56/87
KATE: 
Uh, wow. 
You weren't kidding. 
Place is so tidy. 
-Come take a seat. 
-No. Uh, no. 
I can't. I'll crease something or just spontaneously wee. 
I'm gonna... sit on the floor. There's plenty of seats. 
Nice landing. 
You're not yourself. 
No? 
Maybe I'm wrong. 
Wrong about what? 
Maybe this is more you 
than anything. 
I'm a mess. 
Kind of. 
In here. 
When I was ill, 
it was a heart thing. 
Right. 
I had a heart transplant. 
I don't tell people, 
'cause they get weird, 
but I don't think 
you'll get weird. 
No. 
Is this okay? 
They took out my heart. 
They took it and threw it away. And I... and I don't know 
what they put back, 
but it felt weird and different and strange and... 
and like I'd lost 
my most special part. 
And they kept telling me 
I was lucky to be alive. 
But I didn't feel alive. 
I just felt half dead. 
Come here. 
(Kate grunts softly) 
Page 57/87
I was supposed to be special. 
I didn't ask to be, but... 
they made me feel special 
when I was ill. 
And then I was special 
when I nearly died 
and had a transplant, but... 
then they just expected me to 
be normal and get on with life. There's no such thing 
as normal. 
It's a stupid word. 
Does a lot of damage. 
Nothing feels right. 
You're the only person 
that makes me feel, like, 
I don't know... 
...solid. 
Like I exist. 
I'm a part-time cycle courier 
who doesn't even have a phone. -I know. 
-(Tom chuckles) 
It's pretty sad. 
And I could sing before. 
Turns out... 
I can't do anything. 
I think the whole special... 
being-special thing 
is overrated. 
I think just to be 
a human being is hard. 
You know, really hard. 
You seem to manage all right. 
One thing someone said to me 
helped me. 
"Every little action 
of the common day 
makes or unmakes character." 
It just means that you're built of everything you do. 
And that's okay. 
Who am I? 
-I don't know. 
Page 58/87
-(laughing) 
What's all this 
"me" business anyway? 
Hmm? What's wrong with... 
not knowing, you know, 
being inconsistent? 
Just uncertain. 
Why do you have to be anything? Tom. 
Yeah? 
(whispers): 
Can we lie down? 
Absolutely. 
-Come on. 
-Okay. 
Ooh. Gently does it. 
(groaning): 
Oh, my God.

Jump in there. 
-Oh, the bed. 
-In the bed there. 
(Kate chuckles)

Bed. 
What...?

Tom, I said... "we." 
This is close enough for now. 
-We hardly know each other. 
-Wha...? 
(stammers) 
What do you mean? 
We ju... we ju... 
I just told you everything 
there is to know about me. 
There is nothing more to know. You've just poured out 
some very heavy-duty stuff. 
I think you should just 
sleep for a bit. 
Page 59/87
Sing me to sleep? 
-Like your mum? 
-No, no. 
Oh, dear God, not like my mum. I'm a terrible singer, really. -Everyone can sing. 
-Mm-mm. Not me. 
You sing. 
You're the singer. 
If I sing a lullaby... 
will you kiss me good night?

-They hate us.

They send us all back.

-Hmm, you're early. 
Don't tell me even your mother kicked you out. 
No, I'm just... 
doing something for someone. 
-How was your date? 
-Really nice. 
Are you really gonna 
call him Boy? 
-He likes it. 
-What does he do? 
He's an expert on sauerkraut. 
Mm, you're kidding. 
-I wish I were.

Now I must learn 
to love sauerkraut. 
Which will be hard because 
I am not a sour person.

So, did you find 
your Tom, then? 
Yeah. 
-Nice. 
-Yeah. 
Yeah, good for you. 
Thank you. 
I'm just gonna leave that... 
right there.

-See you. 
-See you later.

where that's been. 
Dan, she doesn't have to help, you know.

hot dinners, mate. 
Dan, I can't take 
your attitude. 
You're so negative. 
-Eat your mint. 
-(laughs) 
So I didn't get 
that Frozen job. 
-You're fired. 
-(Kate chuckles) 
No, it's funny. I'm all right 
about it, actually. 
I'm not sure how I feel about 
the whole auditioning thing 
in general. 
I'm not sure 
it's that good for me. 
Page 64/87
I might just give it a break. 
-What's wrong with you? 
-What? 
That sounds like 
quite a healthy choice. 
I haven't heard you make one 
of those in a very long time. 
Well, don't panic. 
I will go out 
and get shit-faced later.

I haven't heard from him 
in days. 
He's disappeared again. 
It's a bit annoying, 
if I'm honest. 
He seems to be 
disappearing a lot. 
Is he a magician? 
Well, you never know.

Probably just scared 
of what he feels about you.

Yeah.

Mm.

we're having a relationship. 
Kate, there's something 
I've got to tell you.

Oh, God.

Okay, let's go 
through the list. 
Um... 
You're gay? 
-No, it's... 
-Married? 
-No, there's... 
-Uh, y-you need space? 
You can't depend on me. 
I don't depend on you. 
-Kate. 
-(stammers) Who said anything 
about depending on anyone? 
Listen, you said it yourself. 
I mean, you've been 
having a tough time 
after all the trauma and... 
Look, I'm just worried... 
Oh, so now it's my issue? 
-No, you... -Look, if this 
is about commitment, 
then you just need to say it, 
because I... 
I can't do this anymore. 
I look for you. 
I look for you everywhere, 
and you're never there. 
And it makes me feel 
really bad about myself. 
And I'm finally getting better and not feeling bad 
about myself. 
I'm not gonna heal my heart 
and then give it to someone 
who is going to break it.

I won't.

never stop being sorry.

-from getting on with our jobs. That's the prob... -"Probate"? Yeah, you know, 
when someone dies. 
It's a pain in the fundament. 
Who's died? 
Oh, previous owner. 
Who...? 
Uh, someone Webster, I think. 
Uh, youngish bloke. 
Sad, really. 
It was last Christmas, 
by all accounts.

(Kate gasps) 
Why can I feel you? 
Because I'm a part of you.

-Take care of my heart. 
-(Kate sniffles) 
I promise. 
It was always going to be yours one way or another.

DORA: 
Come in here! 
Roll up! 
Roll up, 
you shower of gobblers. 
You, you load of tossers, in. 
-And you're a tosser, too. 
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
-Dora, Dora, Dora. 
Loving the work. -In. 
I'm loving the work. 
Wrong vibe, though, yeah? 
You can't call 
the audience names. 
-And you're a wanker. 
-Maybe... (laughs) 
Don't I know it, Dora. 
(indistinct chatter) 
Yeah. I mean, you... 
Oh, you want crumble?

Whoa.

(laughing): 
That's my girl. 
Yes, yes, yes. Thank you. 
All right, 
we've got lots to get through. I just want to say 
a massive thank-you 
to everyone who's put 
so much hard work in. 
Mum, for making 
the most ginormous krempita. 
-I think you're all enjoying. 
-(cheering) 
My mother, 
ladies and gentlemen. 
-Thank you. Thank you. 
-(Ivan laughing) 
You are famous 
with your krempita. 
Now, I'd like to thank 
everyone individually, 
but Dan said no speeches 
were allowed. 
-Yeah, now, get off, elf. 
-(laughter) 
KATE: 
Yes. Thank you, Daniel. 
Seconds away. I just, um... 
I-I just want to say 
this one thing. 
We... are so lucky to be alive. Hear, hear. 
(crowd chuckles) 
We are so lucky to be able 
to help each other 
in little ways and in big ways. -(baby coos) 
-(Jenna gasps) 
The reason we are lucky 
is because helping each other 
is, in fact, 
what makes us happy. 
(applause)

-That's all. 
-(cheering) 
Give us a song, Kate! 
A... a song? (chuckles) 
Well, I think I've got one 
up my sleeve.

-Do you recognize me? 
-No.
