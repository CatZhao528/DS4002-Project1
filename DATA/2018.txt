Gone forever. 
Telling you that she 
wasn't coming home, 
was the hardest thing 
that I ever had to do. 
But then, Scott showed up... 
Or should I say, broke 
into our house. 
And when he went to 
the Quantum Realm.... 
And came back, 
everything changed. 
I started to wonder... 
Could your Mother 
still be alive? 
So I dusted off some old plans. Dad, what are you saying? 
I think it's possible, 
to bring her back. 
Okay. We're in. 
Aw, this place is a maze. 
Where's that map? 
We're definitely close. 
- Are you ready? 
- I'm ready, Daddy. 
Are you sure? Once we're inside, you show any hesitation or fear, - we're done. 
- I eat fear for breakfast. 
Wow. That is super cool. 
Come on. 
Look! It's Anton. He'll 
show us the way. 
Anton, which way do we go? 
Anton, which way do we go? 
Thanks, Anton. 
Look! The ants have burrowed 
into the tech facility. 
Oh, no! Lasers! 
Oh! I got lased! 
The secret vault. 
- Tell me you brought the contact lens. - Yup! 
Page 2/53
Perfect! Right there. 
There! It's the microtreasure. 
My trophy? 
- It looks like treasure. 
- Oh, it is to me. 
- I wanna take it to show and tell. - Oh, you can't do that. Can't. 
It never leaves the house. 
It's too important. 
This is the best birthday 
present you ever got me. 
I'm so touched you think I'm 
the World's Greatest Grandma. 
- It was the only one they have. 
- It makes me wanna get you a sweater. - Oh, no, the fuzz! 
- Hey, Scotty. 
I was looking at the schematics 
for the Karapetyan buildings, 
and I think we have way too 
many security cams, don't we? 
- No, not at all. 
- 'Cause, it's a lot of security cameras. I know what he needs. Who's the 
security expert in our business? 
You are. But I'm running 
the company, right? 
And if we overcoat him, he's gonna go somewhere else, so we got to land this bird. He can go on anywhere. And the 
expression is "landing the fish." 
No, it's "land the bird." 
Just like landing a plane. You gotta land the plane to be in business. 
I know it's silly to get hung up on these kinds of things. But I do... How am I gonna land a fish? 
It can't walk. 
And if it swam up on shore, and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win? 
You've really turned me 
around on this thing. 
It's okay. We're gonna 
land Karapetyan. 
Page 3/53
Now if you'd just excuse me, I'm in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter. I'm gonna go recheck it. 
Don't just stand there! 
Let's bounce before 
the po-po come back! 
Po-po? How do you 
even know that? 
Let's fly, Antoinette! 
Let's fly! 
Crash landing! 
- I wish we could shrink for real. 
- It is pretty cool. 
Hey, I'm headed to 
the office, Scotty. 
Hey, sorry about freaking 
out earlier, you know? 
But I feel like... I'm way better. Like, my heart is definitely like, beating way too hard and stuff? And, like, my hands are shaking. But 
I think it's unrelated, you know? 
It's gonna be great, Luis. You 
got nothing to worry about. 
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss. 
I'm the boss. 
I'm the boss. Yeah, 
yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Daddy! 
Come on, Woo. I've 
got three days left. 
- Why would I try to escape? 
- Sorry, Scott. Rules are rules. 
You trip a perimeter alarm 
and we search the place. 
Keel, stern, suits and nuts. 
Thank you. It was an accident. 
My foot went through the fence. 
Our flying ant crashed. 
Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year 
old when you can't leave the house. 
You know the lengths 
that I've gone to? 
Close-up magic. 
I learned that. 
Page 4/53
Why can't you just 
leave my Daddy alone? 
Oh, Cassie. 
This must all seem like a bunch of confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh? Well, think of it this way: 
Your school has rules, right? 
Like... 
You can't draw on the walls. 
Well, your Daddy went to Germany and drew on the walls with Captain America. And that was a violation of Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the Sokovia Accords. Now as a part of his joint plea deal with Homeland Security and the German government, he's allowed to return to the U.S., provided he serve two years under house arrest, followed by three 
years of probation. 
And avoid any unauthorized 
activities, technology, 
or contact with any former associates, who were or currently are, 
in violation of said Accords. 
Or any related statutes. 
Okay, sweetie? 
Wow. You're really 
great with kids! 
Thanks. I'm also a youth pastor. 
Anyway, not to be a 
Johnny Ass-calade, 
but you haven't had any contact with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you? - No. 
- You sure? 
Because it's only a matter 
of time before we get them. 
It was their tech, so they 
violated the Accords, too. 
Associating with them breaks your deal. And, uhh... 
I don't need to 
remind you, that... 
Any violation of your agreement 
Page 5/53
means 20 years in prison. Minimum. I haven't talked to Hank 
or Hope in forever. 
- They hate his guts. 
- Thanks, Peanut. 
- How'd you do it, Scott? 
- Do what? 
The card trick? 
Seriously? 
Oh, my God! 
You people can't just show up here, whenever you want and search the place. Actually, they can. 
- You need a warrant. 
- Actually, they don't. 
Really? Wow. 
- Did you pack your soccer shoes? - Yeah. 
Next time I see you, 
will be on the outside! 
I'll get on the inside of this. 
- Three days! 
- Seriously? 
- I'm proud of you, buddy. 
- Thank you. 
- You know what? Give me another one. - Me, too! 
Freedom, business, I'm 
sensing greatness. 
- I had a fun weekend, Daddy. 
- Me too, Peanut. 
Just wait till next weekend. Once I'm outta here, we're gonna go paint this town red. We'll have so much ice cream, 
we'll never stop puking. 
- You're getting good at that. 
- How'd you do that? 
- Bye, Daddy! 
- Bye! 
- Bye! 
- Bye! 
Three days... 
Easy-peasy. 
Snap your fingers. That 
Page 6/53
gets them to look over there. 
Now that is misdirection. 
Easy-peasy. 
Lost... in the 
Quantum Realm. 
What? 
I'm gonna find 
you, Jellybean. 
I found you! 
You always find 
me, Mommy. 
What the hell? 
Hey, Hank. 
It's been a while. 
Umm... I don't even know 
if this is your number... 
Anymore... and, 
I'm probably the last person 
you wanna hear from. But... 
I just had a really 
weird dream. 
And I know that doesn't sound like an emergency or anything, but it just felt... Very real. 
I was back in the 
Quantum Realm, and... 
I think I saw your wife. 
And then I 
was your wife. 
I mean, not in 
a weird way, or... 
You know... 
Hearing this out loud, I'm 
thinking, it's not an emergency. 
I'm sorry I 
bothered you. 
I'm sorry for 
a lot of things. 
Hope? 
Is this another dream? 
Do you think it's a dream? Or is it possible that you really saw my Mom down there? I'm not sure. 
I can't be here! I can't be, 
Page 7/53
I'm under house arrest. 
They won't open while the 
system's engaged, Scott. 
You have to 
take me home. 
- They can show up any second. 
- Relax... 
As far as your nanny cops 
know, you're still at home. 
Woah! 
Scotty? 
He's programmed to 
replicate your daily routine. 
Nine hours in bed, five 
hours in front of the TV, 
two hours in the bathroom, 
whatever that's about. 
That's totally inaccurate. 
How do you know about my daily 
routine? Are you spying on me? 
We keep tabs on all 
security threats, all right? 
And so far, the biggest 
one we've had is you. 
I'm sorry about Germany. 
They just showed up. They said it 
was a matter of national security, - That Cap needed help. 
- Who's Cap? 
...tain America. 
Captain... Cap. 
It's what we call him. 
If you're a friend. I think I'm a friend, a little. I know him. He's not, we're not... I'm sorry! All right? I didn't 
think I'd get caught. 
You didn't think 
about a lot of things. 
How's Hank? 
We're still running, the house is gone. So is our freedom. How do you think he is? I'm sorry. I know 
you're mad. 
I'm not looking 
Page 8/53
for apologies, Scott. 
The only reason why we're even talking is because we need what's in your head. Is this where 
you're living? 
If you need help, money 
or something, maybe I can... 
We're fine. 
Hey, Hank. Look... 
- I just want to... 
- Save it. 
- Can we start? 
- Yeah. 
So, while you were relaxing 
at home, we were building this. 
It's a tunnel. To 
the Quantum Realm. 
To my Mom. 
We think she might still be down 
there, we just don't know where. 
What? 
If we can pinpoint my Mom's location, then the pod can take me down to get her. You built all this and you 
don't even know if she's alive? 
It's called a hypothesis. 
Last night we powered up the tunnel for the first time. It overloaded, and it shut down. But for a split second, 
the doorway to the 
Quantum Realm was opened. 
And? 
And five minutes later, you 
called. Talking about Mom. 
We think when you went down there, you may have entangled with her. 
Hank, I would never do that. 
I respect you too much. 
Quantum entanglement, Scott. 
We think she might have put some kind of message in your head. Hopefully, a location. And opening the 
tunnel triggered it. 
Your Mom put a message in my 
Page 9/53
head? Come on. That's insane. 
No, Scott. Insane... 
is going to Germany without 
telling us and fighting the Avengers. Just tell me you weren't 
lying about the suit you took. 
Tell me you 
really destroyed it. 
I did. I destroyed it. I swear. I can't believe you 
destroyed my suit. 
That was my life's work. 
- What was I supposed to do? 
- You were supposed to not take my suit! I'm sorry, Hank. I'm 
sorry I took the suit. 
I'm sorry that 
I called last night. 
I don't remember seeing Janet 
down there. I wish that I did. 
I just had a dream about her playing hide and seek with a little girl. What? 
I had a dream. She was playing 
hide and seek with a little... 
girl. Cassie and I do it all the time. It doesn't mean anything. But, was it Cassie 
in the dream? 
No. 
- Where was she hiding? 
- What? 
The little girl, where was she 
hiding. Was it in a wardrobe? 
No, it's in a tall dresser. 
- You mean a wardrobe. 
- Is that what that's called? 
- What color was it? 
- Red. 
- Were there horses on it? 
- Oh, boy. 
It's where I hid every 
time we played. 
Doesn't sound like you really 
Page 10/53
got the gist of the game. 
She's alive! 
I knew it. 
I knew it! 
- We need to get that part. 
- Okay. 
The sooner we get the tunnel working, the sooner we can get this message out his head. - Does Burch have it? 
- Yeah. Let's go. 
What part? Who's Burch? 
Wait, what's happening? 
We need a component to stop 
the tunnel from overloading again. 
I brought your clothes. 
You might wanna change. 
Look. I'd really like 
to help you out. 
But if I'm not home when they come to take off my ankle monitor then I'm going away forever. Once we get the component and power up the tunnel, we'll get the message and have you home by lunch. We have to hurry. The 
entanglement won't last. 
You owe us. 
All right, fine. But can I just wait inside? Because I'm not supposed to be out here. Let's go. 
- We good? 
- Yeah. 
I'll be right back. 
- Can I have one of those? 
- No. 
Susan! 
- Welcome to Oui! 
- Sonny. 
Oui is French for yes. As 
in, yes, we found a table, 
yes, you saw 
us, and yes, 
to planning before property. 
Well, let's hope it 
also means yes to 
do you have the 
Page 11/53
component I ordered? 
You know, I've always loved 
your sense of humor, Susan. 
- Have a seat. 
- No, I'm good. Thank you. 
- Who is this guy? 
- Sonny Burch. 
He traffics in black 
market technology. 
He's been getting us what 
we need to build the tunnel. 
- Can I just have one? 
- No. 
You know, I have a special friend, down at the FBI. And I say special, because... Well, he tells me things that 
I didn't previously know. 
For example... 
Your name isn't Susan. 
It's Hope Van Dyne. 
And your unseen associate, 
that's your father, Hank Pym. 
- That's not good, Hank. 
- No shit. 
What do you want? 
Relationships are 
built on trust, Hope. 
And I want our relationship 
to have a strong foundation. 
- Our relationship? 
- Well, business landscape's been shifting, Hope. Hell, screw it. I don't even exist 
anymore. But now, Hank Pym? 
- Hank Pym, is a real opportunity. 
- Do you have a point? 
You think that I don't know what 
you've been building? With all of this? Quantum technology. 
And you can forget nano-tech. 
Forget AI. Forget cryptocurrency. 
Quantum energy is the future. 
It's the next gold rush. 
I want in, Hope. 
So, as a gesture of goodwill, 
Page 12/53
I've taken the liberty 
of arranging some 
buyers for your lab. 
Starting bid? 
One billion dollars. 
Thank you, 
Sonny. Really. 
But my father and I have something slightly more pressing than starting a business. So, I'll just take the component. 
As arranged. 
My buyers don't take 
no for an answer. 
So, we're either in business together, or we aren't in business together. 
- Then, I guess we aren't. 
- You can go. 
But, I'm afraid your money's 
gonna have to remain. 
Let's call it compensation 
for my injured feelings. 
Listen, Sonny. 
This is gonna be so much easier on 
everybody if you just give me that component. No, the only thing you're 
taking from here, is my heart. 
But it will mend in time. 
Okay. 
- So now, what? 
- You'll see. 
She said her and daddy 
had something pressing. 
I wanna know what it is, 'cause if they're not working with us, they're working with somebody. So find out. Name... 
Hold on. You 
gave her wings? 
Not my 36-feet chandelier! 
Stop firing! Stop! 
Alright, take this. Go. 
Go, go, go, go! 
Wings and blasters. 
I take it you didn't have 
that tech available for me? 
Page 13/53
No, I did. 
It's a pleasure doing 
business with you, Sonny. 
Oh, our business isn't 
finished yet, Hope. 
I can assure 
you of that. 
What the hell is that? 
Dad, are you 
seeing this? 
Hope, get out of there! 
- I gotta do something. 
- Wait! 
It's still a work in progress. 
You taught me that 
kick. Remember? 
- Yeah, great form. 
- Those were the days. 
- Whatever happened to us? 
- Not the time, Scott. 
Dammit, where did he go? 
I lost it. 
I'm not seeing anything 
on the ant cams. 
Dad? 
Give me that. Now. 
- Are you okay? 
- No. He got the lab. 
- No. 
- Come on. 
- What was that? 
- I don't know. 
But we need to find somewhere to 
regroup and figure out where the lab is. So where to now? 
How about my house? Mmm? 
I'm supposed to be there anyway. 
- Woo could walk in any second. 
- Exactly why we're not going to your house. What about your house? 
Sorry. 
There is one place 
I can think of. 
No. 
Page 14/53
No, no! No! No! 
No! 
Wow, Dr. Pym. 
Like, who would've thought 
that, once again, 
in your hour of need, that you 
would turn to us? You know? 
Not me. 
Help yourself. 
That was overexpensive pastry. 
We gotta keep the food budget down. 
Well, what are we supposed 
to have for breakfast? 
- The oatmeal packets. 
- Oatmeal packets. 
- It's insult. 
- Why's it insult? 
- Because it takes like sand. 
- You know why? Cause it's organic. 
- That is not organic. It's sand. 
- The most important meal of the day. 
You know what, you can get creative 
with it. Put a little brown sugar on it. Sprinkle some cinnamon... 
Guys, guys, guys, guys! 
Come on, man! 
We got bigger fish to fry. 
- Is that my desk? 
- Yeah. 
What? Why do I have 
such a small desk? 
- Cause you weren't there when we're choosing desks. - You snooze, you lose. 
- I was under house arrest. 
- Yeah! 
You know what, this isn't 
even a desk. This is garbage. 
You found this outside 
amongst garbage. 
I got it out of 
rummage sale. 
- So, you saved money on my desk? 
- Guys. 
Hope, please! We need 
Page 15/53
to focus. All right? 
We gotta find that 
lab already. Geez. 
Oh, you know what? I heard stories, like what happened to you. 
Like this crazy, creepy cat who like, walks through walls and stuff. 
Like a... Like a Ghost! 
Like Baba Yaga. 
Baba Yaga. A witch. 
They tell stories to 
children to frighten them. 
You know Baba Yaga? 
Whoever stole it... 
We need to find it. 
Well, you don't find 
someone like that. 
- They find you. 
- Like Baba Yaga. 
Dr. Pym, you're like the 
smartest genius I know. 
Did you put some kind 
of lojack on your lab? 
Because if you didn't, we have a variety of affordable options. 
Of course, I did, Luis. 
It was disabled. 
Whoever stole the lab knew 
exactly what they were doing. 
- They also looked like they were phasing. - Phasing? 
Quantum phasing. When an object 
moves through different states of matter. Oh, yeah. That's what 
I was thinking. 
The lab emits radiation. Could we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it? That could work, yes. But all 
of my equipment is in the lab. 
Well, where else can 
we find that equipment? 
Well, there is one person. 
- Bill Foster. 
- Great! 
Page 16/53
Who's Bill Foster? 
He's an old colleague 
of my Dad's. From SHIELD. 
- They had a falling out years ago. 
- You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people. It's probably just 
a waste of time. 
Hey, I'm risking everything by being 
here. Don't you think we should check? 
We need to find out 
who took the lab. 
Guys, it's not a good idea 
to be out in the open like this. 
Relax. No one's gonna 
recognize us. 
What, because of hats 
and sunglasses? 
It's not a disguise, Hank. 
We look like ourselves 
in a baseball game. 
In an isolated system... 
Particles co-exist in a 
stable phase relationship. If 
the system is interfered with, 
that stability becomes chaos. 
Unpredictable. 
Dangerous. 
Beautiful. 
Isolated completely, a quantum system would revert back to separate states of matter. Each entangled with a distinct 
state of its environment. 
In other words... 
The object in question would 
be both in and out of phase 
with multiple parallel realities. 
Speaking of being out 
of phase with reality... 
I am noticing an unusally high number 
of glazed eyes out there among you. 
So, why don't we call 
it a few minutes early. 
That will be enough for today, thank 
you, ladies and gentlemen. You may go. 
Page 17/53
It's incredible. 
Your link to Janet. 
It's Quantum entanglement, 
between the quantum states composed of her molecules and your brains. Yeah. It's what I 
was thinking. 
Do you guys just put the word 
'quantum' in front of everything? Doctor, we need to find our lab. Hope, I'd love to help you but I don't have the equipment you're describing. I told you this was a waste of time. Come on. Let's go. 
Don't condescend, Hank. 
You're the one who's on 
the run from the FBI. 
All because you had 
to grow to a size 
that finally fit your ego. 
That wasn't me in Germany. 
It was this idiot. 
Really? 
Going that big must've 
been exhausting. 
I slept for three days straight. You have no idea. 
Actually, I do. 
Back in the day, I was Hank's partner in a project called Goliath. 
Excuse me, you were my partner? The only thing more tiring 
than going that big, 
is putting up with 
Hank's bullshit. 
How big did you get? 
My record? 
Twenty-one feet. 
- Not bad. 
- You? 
- I don't... 
- No, really. I'm curious. 
- Sixty-five feet. Yeah. 
- Whoa. 
Page 18/53
- Huge. 
- Sixty-five. 
If you two are finished 
comparing sizes... 
We need to figure out a way 
to track down the lab. 
And the great Hank Pym hasn't 
figured that one out yet? Strange. He had all the answers back in the day. That's why I left the project. Left? I fired you. 
Best decision I ever made. 
Hank was a terrible partner. 
Temperamental. Stubborn. 
Impatient. 
Sooner or later he just 
pushed everyone away. 
Just the mediocrities. 
Janet was the only one who could endure him and chose to stick it out. Watch it, Bill. 
She paid the price 
though, didn't she? 
You son of a... 
We didn't come here to 
listen to you two squabble. 
I'm trying to save my Mother. 
It's Woo. 
Someone must have seen me. 
Relax. If this is about you 
they'd be in your house by now. - What are you, fifteen? 
- Come on. We gotta go, right now. Wait! You might be able to 
improvise that tracker. 
If you modify the defraction 
units on one of your regulators. - That could work. 
- I don't know what that means. Thank you. 
But Doctor, campus police says they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne. I don't know what 
to tell you, agent. 
Page 19/53
I haven't talked to 
Hank in thirty years. 
I can assure you I'm the last 
person he would wanna visit. 
- Oh, come on. You expect us to... - Hey, hey. 
- Why is that? 
- Simple. 
We hate each other's guts. 
So I'm a terrible partner? 
Foster, he hasn't had one good idea in his unremarkable career. But his idea about the 
defractors could work. 
Fine, one decent idea. 
Except I eliminated the defractors when I upgraded the suits. 
So if we had an old suit, 
we might be able to 
track down the lab? 
Yes. But we don't. 
- What if we did? 
- What do you mean? 
I mean... 
- Life's funny... 
- Oh, my God. 
- You didn't destroy the suit. - What?! 
Well, it was your life's work, Hank. I couldn't destroy that. 
Before I turned myself in, I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis. You sent my suit 
through the mail? 
Hey, the postal service is 
very reliable, you know? 
They do tracking numbers now. 
Like UPS. 
Where is it? 
It's in a very safe place, alright? Don't worry. 
What, the trophy? 
No, it's not here. 
What do you mean it's not there? Page 20/53
Where could it be? 
I've looked everywhere. 
It's not here. 
Hey. Get away from the table. 
I put it back out 
to Cassie, and I... 
Show and tell. 
Scotty? 
Well, the good news is, 
I know where it is. 
Whenever you go back to school, isn't everything supposed to look so much smaller? This place seems huge. Ah! 
- What is it? 
- It's the new regulator. 
Hank, what's going 
on with this suit? 
How much of a work 
in progress is this? 
Uh-oh. Oh, no. 
No, no, no. 
What, are you laughing? 
Please, can you just... 
Okay. Okay. 
What do you see? 
The sizing coils are 
malfunctioning. 
Just let me... 
Oww! 
- Sorry. 
- It's all right. 
Okay. 
All right. 
Try it now. 
So... 
Awesome. 
If only Cap could see you now. 
Hilarious. What are we gonna do? 
Hey! 
Where's your hall pass? 
Hey, I'm talking to you. 
Hey! 
Hey... 
You can do it. You 
Page 21/53
almost got it! 
Oh, Peanut. 
Okay. Let's go. 
Hiya, Champ! How 
was school today? 
Hahaha. Alright, get 
your jokes out now. 
- Can you fix the suit? 
- He's so cranky. 
You want a juice box 
and some string cheese? 
Do you really have that? 
Let's see if Foster was right. 
This has got to be the lab. 
- Let's go get it. 
- Yeah. 
This seems right. 
Look at us. Teaming 
up twice in one day. 
Makes you think, huh? 
- About what? 
- Germany? 
- What do you mean? 
- We were working together. 
Training together. And, 
other stuff-ing together. 
If I'd have asked you, 
would you have come? 
I guess we'll never know. 
But I do know one thing. 
What? 
If I had, you'd have 
never been caught. 
Hey, Scott. 
You think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter long enough to get my lab? - Yes, sir. 
- Thank you. 
Okay. You're transmitting. 
What took you so long? 
Sorry, I had to come up 
with a name for my ant. 
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant. - Like it? 
Page 22/53
- Hilarious. 
I'm not getting anything on the monitors. There's some kind of electronic disturbance. - Be careful. 
- You know me, Hank. 
I'm always care--- Whoa! 
- It's okay. It's just a suit. 
- How do you know? 
Look. 
That's Ghost? 
What is she doing? 
You think that suit is how she 
goes through walls and stuff? 
Let's just get out of 
here before she wakes up. 
Hope, look. There's the lab. 
We're sure this is our shrunken building and not somebody else's, right? 
Just take it, Scott. 
We gotta be fast. 
I'll get it. 
Oh, sh... 
Hope. 
Hank. 
Guys? 
I don't think they can hear you. 
Hi. 
I'm Ava. 
Scott. 
So... 
You don't need a suit to, uhh... 
You know. 
Go through things. 
No. 
It just helps me control it. 
And the pain. Supposedly. 
You're not gonna reach into my 
chest and crush my heart, are you? You're funny. 
I'm not gonna hurt you 
Scott, unless I have to. 
I need... 
What's in your head. 
Let's wake up the rest of the gang Page 23/53
and get this over with, shall we? Get up! Come on! 
Dad? 
Don't ever touch him again. 
Now, now, Hope... 
I think I'm being rather gentle with your Father, all things considered. What the hell are 
you talking about? 
Another casualty 
of Hank Pym's ego. 
Bill. 
What have you done? 
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym. 
You with her? 
Aw, man. I thought 
you were cool. 
What the hell is going on here? 
I doubt Hank have ever mentioned my Father. Why would he? 
Elihas Starr. 
They were colleagues at SHIELD. 
Quantum research. 
Until my Father dared to disagree with the great Hank Pym. 
You had him fired. Oh, and 
discredited for good measure. 
My father tried to continue 
his research on his own. 
Desperate to restore his 
name, so he took risks. 
No! 
Too many. 
Until something went wrong. 
He told us to run. 
- Elihas, what's happening? 
- Just go. Go! 
Daddy! 
I can tell he was scared. 
- Daddy! 
- Ava, no! 
I didn't want him to be alone. 
No! No! 
When I woke up, my 
Page 24/53
parents were dead. 
I wasn't so lucky. 
They call it "Molecular 
Disequilibrium." 
A rather dull name, I think. 
Doesn't quite do justice 
to what it means. 
Every cell, in my body, is torn apart and stitched back together. Over, and over, everyday. 
I was still at SHIELD 
when I got the call about a 
"quantum anomaly" in Argentina. Hello, Ava. 
My name is Bill. 
I was a friend of your Father's. I brought you something. 
It's all right. Try again. 
That's it. 
Dr. Foster did his 
best to keep me safe. 
But others at SHIELD saw an 
opportunity in my affliction. 
They built me a containment suit so I can control my phasing. 
And trained me to be 
a stealth operative. 
They weaponized me. 
I stole for them, 
spied for them... 
I killed for them. 
And in exchange for my soul, 
they were going to cure me. 
They lied. 
When SHIELD collapsed, 
I took Ava in. 
I built the chamber to slow 
her decay, but her condition 
was progressive. I didn't 
know how to cure her. 
She wanted to kill you, Hank. 
But I told her, no. 
And that she should watch you instead. And sure enough, 
Page 25/53
she discovered that you 
were building a tunnel. 
Then she told me about Lang. 
And the message from 
Janet inside his head... 
- For Christ's sake! 
- That's me. I'm sorry. 
Look, can you tell 
me who's texting me? 
Cassie. 911. 
That's my daughter. I 
need to text her back. 
No. That's not happening. 
It's 911. That means 
it's an emergency! 
You're not making 
demands here, Lang. 
You're not appreciating 
the gravity of the... 
Okay, well, she's trying to videochat me now. Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please! 
Cassie, are you okay? 
What's the emergency? 
- I can't find my soccer shoes. - What? 
I have a game tomorrow. 
Hey, Scott, I know 
that they're there. 
Can you just walk the 
phone around the house? 
- No, I can't do that right now. - Why not? 
Because I'm sick. 
Hey, can you just maybe look around later then call me back? Please? Thank you. - Bye, Daddy! 
- Bye, Peanut! 
- Feel better! 
- Feel better, buddy! 
I'm sorry. It's 
that emergency. 
Ava, I wanna help you. 
She doesn't need your help. 
Page 26/53
I know how to save her. 
- Oh, really? How? 
- Janet. 
For the last 30 years, she's been down there absorbing quantum energy. We can extract that energy. We can use it to repair Ava's molecular structure... - Extract it? 
- Yes! 
Are you insane? That 
would rip Janet apart! 
You don't know that. I'm 
gonna fire up your tunnel. 
When Janet's location pops into Lang's head, he's gonna give it to me, 
- or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI. - What? 
You're gonna stay here just 
in case I need your help. 
- Like hell, I would help you! 
- You'll do whatever I say. 
- You're gonna kill Janet. 
- I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank. Goddammit, Bill! 
- Dad? 
- Calm down, Hank. 
So help me, God... 
It's his heart! He needs 
his pills, please. 
Dr. Foster, they're 
in the tin, please. 
He could die! For... come on! 
Help him! 
Dad, just hang on, alright? 
Just keep breathing. Stay calm. 
- Help him, man! Come on! 
- The Altoid tin! 
Wait! 
Thanks, guys! 
Hank! 
Bill is filling that 
girl's head with lies. 
Elihas Starr was a traitor. 
He stole my plans. 
Page 27/53
Now, bring her down. 
Right, lock it in. 
No, no, no. The bolt 
is on the other side. 
Tighten that one down, then 
bring her down with one knock. 
- Good job. 
- It'll work. 
Foster, he could've fried 
the entire system. 
Look, we'll adjust the relays while you go reprogram the settings. All right? It's gonna be fine. 
- So, this is it. 
- Yeah. 
You'd think with all this time 
to prepare, I'd be more ready. 
Well, going subatomic isn't 
something you can prepare for. 
It kind of, melts your mind. 
- I mean, seeing my Mom again. 
- Oh. 
What if she's a completely 
different person? 
Yeah, like George Washington? 
- I'm serious, Scott. 
- Or, George Jefferson? 
What if she's 
forgotten about me? 
When I was in prison... 
The only thing that got 
me through was Cassie. 
I could've been locked up for 100 years. I never would've forgotten her. I know your Mom is counting the minutes until she can see you again. Thank you. 
- Hey. 
- We've got a big problem. 
You forgot the motion sensor lights on the back of the building. 
No. 
They're on the proposal, and Karapetyan asked for them specifically. 
Page 28/53
Uh, yeah. Look, it's 
been a little crazy... 
Look, maybe I can stop by 
tomorrow and take a look at it. 
No, no, no, no! 
The meeting is first thing in the morning. You gotta come right now and fix it. I can't. I wish I could, 
but I can't leave. 
You know what, I'm coming to you. I'll just explain the plans, and get it on the laptop, and 
you can fix them in. 
- Just tell me where you are, okay? - It's complicated. 
What do you mean, 
it's complicated? 
As you can see, sir... 
This system is state-of-the-art. Security of tomorrow... today! 
Oh, that's so good! I love the 
lead-in, Bro. Keep practicing. 
Hey, I just gotta drive on to 
Scotty's, so he can fix the plans. But don't worry. I'll be 
back in plenty of time. 
As you can see, sir... 
Oh! Oh! Oh! 
Tell me you got the van 
washed for tomorrow morning. 
Down to the undercarriage, baby. - You sprung for the undercarriage wash? - Well, you said get the works. 
That's a scam, Bro. We live in 
California, not Minnesota! 
He's right. 
The undercarriage wash. 
That's for cleaning 
off road salt. 
Laid out in all those 
snow-laden sister states. 
Who are you and why do you know 
so much about car wash protocol? Well, my name is Sonny Burch. 
Page 29/53
And I do my research, Luis. 
To wit, I have learned, 
from a friend of mine, 
at the FBI, that you're a 
known associate of Scott Lang. A known associate of Hank Pym. Who I've also learned, 
has a portable frickin' laboratory. Filled with all kinds of juicy tech. And you're gonna 
tell me where it is. 
Well, I hate to break it to you, but I don't know what you're talking about. Well, I sense a 
resistance in you, Luis. 
And I have promised results 
to some dangerous people. 
So, I'm gonna introduce you, 
to my good friend Uzman. 
Now, Uzman, is a master 
at extracting information from the unwillin' through psychoactive means. Oh, is that truth serum? 
There's no such thing 
as truth serum. 
That's just nonsense from TV. 
- What is it, then? 
- It's a little concoction, 
that he's been perfecting 
since his days with the SIS. 
It makes you suggestible. 
And highly responsive. 
- Dude, that's truth serum! 
- No, it's not. 
No fencing, but, 
- this sound like truth serum to me. - Right?! 
- It's not a truth serum. 
- Oh, okay. Hey, I believe you. It's not a truth serum. 
If it walk like duck, 
and talk like ducks... 
It's truth serum. 
Well, I have a lot of allergies. Page 30/53
So... 
You might wanna 
think about that. 
Time to get that lab back. 
What? 
The chamber and the suit are 
barely helping anymore. 
How long have I got? 
A couple of weeks, maybe. 
Well then, we'll make 
them bring the lab back. 
How? 
Lang. He has a daughter, right? You can't mean that. Ava? 
I tolerate a lot of the 
things you do out there, 
but I won't be a part 
of anything like that. 
You're not the one who's about to fade away into nothing, Bill. I am! 
You said you could fix me. 
You promised! 
I know. I will. 
But not like that. 
You let one finger on 
that little girl... 
I won't help you. 
And we're done. 
Fine. 
There are other options. 
You know what? You're right. 
This isn't truth serum. 
'Cause I don't feel anything. 
That was a lie. I 
did feel something. 
- This is truth serum! 
- There's no such thing. 
Okay! 
Okay, okay. 
Now I'm gonna make this 
real easy for you, Luis. 
Okay. 
Where... 
Page 31/53
is Scott Lang? 
Well, see, that's complicated. 'Cause when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place. And I'm not talking about cell block D. 
His wife had just filed for divorce. 
And I was like, "Damn, homie, she 
dumped you while you were in lock-up?" 
And he's like, "Yeah, I know. I thought 
I was gonna be with her forever, 
but now, I'm all alone!" 
And I was like, "Damn, homie, you gotta 
chin up. 'Cause you'll find a new partner. But you know what? I'm Luis." 
And he says, "You know what? I'm Scotty. And we're gonna be best friends." 
Wait, hold on, hold on. 
Now I like a good story as much as the next person, but what's this have to do with where Scott Lang is? I'm getting there, 
I'm getting there. 
You put a dime in him, you got 
to let the whole song play out. 
He hit like human jukebox. 
Oh! My abuelita had a 
jukebox in a restaurant. 
Yeah. Only played Morrissey. 
And if anybody ever complained, 
she'd be like, "Oh, porque? Gusta mas?" 
And El Chicanos, we call 
them mas, "then, adios!" 
What can I say? We relate to these 
melancholy bandits, you know? 
- Lang. 
- Right, right, right, right. 
So anyway, this guy gets out of 
jail and starts working for Hank. 
And that's when he met Hope. 
And Hope's all like, 
"I want nothing to do with you. Look 
at my hairdo. I'm all business." 
And then Scotty's like, 
"You know what, girl? My heart's all broken, and I'll probably never find love again. But damn, if I 
Page 32/53
want to kiss you!" 
But then you fast-forward and they're 
all like into each other, right? 
And then Scotty's like, "You know 
what, I can't tell you this, 
but I'm gonna go trashing the 
airport with Captain America!" 
Then she said, "I can't believe you split 
like that! Smell you later, dummy!" 
So Scotty goes on house arrest, and he 
won't admit it, but his heart's all like, 
"Damn! I thought Hope could've been 
my new true partner. But I blew it!" 
But fate brought them back together, 
and then Hope's heart is all, 
"I'm worried that I can't trust him. And he's 
gonna screw up again and ruin everything." 
And in my heart, it's all like, 
"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's rent. And we're days away from going out of business! Oooh!" - Out of business? 
- Days away?! 
Damn truth serum! I was 
trying to protect you guys. 
I swear to God. I was trying to 
be a good boss. But we're broke. 
And the Karapetyans are our last hope, 
and if we don't show up, we're done! 
- That's terrible bossing. 
- Damn, Bro! 
- That's on me. That's on me! 
- Hey! 
Enough. 
I'm gonna ask you 
one more time... 
Where is Scott Lang? 
I've been trying to tell you. He's in 
a tricky spot, emotionally speaking. 
Emotionally speaking. 
But where is Scott Lang, 
literally speaking?! 
Oh! The woods. 
The woods? 
Baba Yaga! 
Page 33/53
What do you mean, the woods? 
The Muir woods! 
For God's sake! 
Baba Yaga, coming late, little 
children, sleep at eight. 
Damn it! 
If that freak gets Pym's tech, 
I'm never gonna see it. 
So what do we do now? 
It's easier to steal it from the 
feds than from a boogeyman. 
Hey. It's me. 
How'd you like to 
get a promotion? 
I've got the location on 
Pym, Van Dyne, and Lang. 
But you're gonna have to take them down now, 'cause they ain't gonna be there for long. And when you do, you're 
gonna get me that lab. 
Understood. 
Good news, gentlemen. 
Feds are gonna do the 
hard work for us. 
What are you looking at? 
Change my tire! 
Sir... 
Can you knock? 
Sorry, sir. But I 
just got a lead. 
Ooh. I love leads. 
- Systems in the green. 
- Priming the coils. 
Full charge. 
Soon as the tunnel's open, let us know if you get anything that could be part of her message. Yeah, yeah. I will. 
Okay, then. 
Here it goes. 
We did it! 
You got anything? 
Nothing. 
Just give it a minute. 
Because it could... 
Page 34/53
No. No, no, no! 
- What's happening? 
- It's shutting down. Maybe vectors are off. We've gone over them a million times. I know they're right. 
- Well then, what else could it be? - I don't know. 
- Scott, what are you doing? 
- Scott, get away from that! 
Scott, we had... 
I'm sorry. I don't know how much time I have. I need to fix the algorithm. Trust me, after 30 
years down here... 
I've thought about it a lot. 
Janet? 
Hi, Hon. 
Hello, Jellybean. 
Mom? 
It's not the reunion I had 
imagined. It's all so rushed. 
You two have done 
such great work. 
You just need 
a little... 
nudge. 
Janet, how is 
this possible? 
It wasn't a message you put in 
Scott's head. It was an antenna. 
Clever girl. 
I'm so proud of you. 
Honey, tell us where you are. 
Tell us how to find you. 
No, the probability fields are too complex. That's why I needed to talk to you. You have to 
follow my voice. 
- Of course. 
- Like tracing a call back to its source. I'm tracking your signal using 
subatomic frequencies, 
between point 
2 and point 9. 
Page 35/53
- I've narrowed it to 4 and 6. 
- It's too tight. We could miss you. Look at us squabbling again. 
Fine. Between 3 and 7. 
Our first fight in decades 
and it's over just like that. 
Bull's eye. 
- Source lock. 
- It's you! 
Ha! We got it! 
You have to meet me in 
these exact coordinates. 
In the wasteland, beyond 
the quantum void. 
It's very dangerous, especially on 
the human mind. So be careful. 
Time and space work 
very differently down here. 
You have two hours. After that, 
the probability fields will shift, 
and it'll be another century 
before they'll align like this again. We'll find you. 
I know you 
will, Jellybean. 
Nope. 
Nothing. I got nothing. 
No sign of Janet. 
How did we get up here? 
At first, you'll see all kinds of lights, and it's gonna get really trippy 
but then it's gonna turn black 
and silent. Like, really silent. 
Scott, I'll be fine. 
- I'm just saying. Cause I've been down there. - Yeah, so you've mentioned. 
Um, sorry. I have 
to take this. 
Hey, man. You coming? 
No, I'm not. But you 
know what? Ghost is. 
And you know what? The 
feds, they know where you are. 
- What? 
Page 36/53
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 
They gave me some truth serum, then all of a sudden I started talking all honestly, like, I hate the way that you 
use the dishwasher. I hate it. 
But you need to go home because 
the feds are probably going there now! And by the way, who puts the 
plates on the top rack, okay? 
They don't go there! 
I feel like 
such a jerk. 
You're gonna be really 
mad. We gotta go. 
- What? 
- Ghost knows where we are. 
- So does the FBI. 
- How? 
- I told Luis where we are. 
- You what? 
I told him to come here, so I can help him with the Karapetyan proposal. Oh, my God! 
But... Look, we need to land that account. Otherwise, we'll lose the business! Do you know how hard it is for ex cons to find work these days? 
Jesus, Scott! 
90 seconds to 
close the aperture. 
- You have to depolarize the coils first. - I know. 
I'm really sorry, but the... 
FBI is coming 
to my place, so... 
I have to go. 
Can I borrow the suit? 
Look, uhh... I'm just 
gonna borrow the suit. 
I'll come back. Just 
tell me where you'll be. 
- Don't bother. 
- What? 
We'll come and get the suit from 
Page 37/53
you as soon as we find my Mom. 
- Hope... 
- Scott, just go! 
- Scott? 
- Daddy? 
- It's us, buddy! 
- We're here for Cassie's shoes. 
He must be resting. 
Honey, why don't you go up the 
stairs and go look under your bed. Daddy? You upstairs? 
Daddy... 
What the? 
Really lives like 
a pig these days. 
Daddy? 
Spread out! 
- Again? 
- You people have no shame! 
- The monitor says that he's in the bathroom. - Yeah. I'm not buying it. 
Cassie, let 
the man get by. 
- But Daddy's super sick! 
- I'll see about that. 
He says he doesn't want 
anyone else to get sick. 
Well, I'll take my 
chances, sweetie. 
He barfed. Like, a lot. 
Young lady, I'm a federal agent. 
I've seen worse things than vomit. - Like, a lot, a lot? 
- Yes! 
- Forget it. Move aside. 
- No! 
Woo! 
- What are you doing here? 
- Scott. 
I'm sorry. I'm just really sick. 
I told you. 
Excuse me. Sometimes you 
just gotta get it out, you know? 
Sorry. 
Page 38/53
I'll start the van. 
You get the lab. 
Freeze! You're surrounded! 
Hank Pym. Hope Van Dyne. 
You're under arrest. 
- This is harassment. 
- Actually, it's not. 
What does the FBI even stand for? 
Forever Bothering Individuals? 
- His monitor check out? 
- Of course, it does. 
Damn it. It's like I just got 
fed a bowl of malarkey. 
We got them, sir. Pym and 
Van Dyne are in custody. 
Seriously? Yes! 
Oh. Sorry, Scott. They were 
your friends. That's insensitive. 
I just really needed a 
win, you know? Anyway... 
I'll be back later for the official end of your sentence. Sorry for misjudging you, pal. You should feel 
great about yourself. 
What is it? 
We have a man down, 
and Pym's lab is gone. 
Hey. 
- Thanks for covering for me. 
- Sure. 
So.. 
How long have you 
been Ant-Man again? 
Not long. 
Things just sort 
of happened. 
I'm sorry, for lying to you. I'm 
sorry for risking everything. 
- Dad, it's okay. 
- That's not... 
I do some dumb things, and the people that I love the most pay the price. 
Mainly, you. 
Trying to help 
Page 39/53
people isn't dumb. 
Well... 
I screw it up just 
about every time. 
So maybe, you just need 
someone watching your back. 
Like a partner. 
Well, she's made it clear that's about the last thing she wants. - Who? 
- Hope. 
- What, who did you think? 
- Me. 
You? 
Don't laugh. 
- I'd be a great partner. 
- Oh, Peanut! 
You would be awesome. 
And if I let you, I would 
be a terrible Dad. 
Fine. 
Have Hope be your 
partner. She's smart. 
She reminds me of you. 
You gonna go help her? 
I think you should help her. 
I wish I could, but... 
I don't know how I can help 
her without hurting you. 
You can do it. You 
can do anything. 
You're the World's 
Greatest Grandma. 
Agent Woo will 
see you in an hour. 
An hour? We don't 
have an hour. 
Aww. You got somewhere 
else to be? 
Now, that's my girl. 
Alright, what's our plan? 
To shrink that wall. 
It looks load bearing. 
Ceiling could collapse... 
Page 40/53
- Then we run like hell. 
- It's made up of 15-20 agents on the floor. Roughly five times that 
in the building at large. 
- They're all heavily armed. 
- Not great odds. 
- You got any better ideas? 
- Nope. 
But I'm not giving 
up on Mom. 
She'd be so proud of you. 
Okay. 
One... 
Two... 
Scott? 
What are you two just 
standing around for? 
We gotta go 
find that lab. 
What about me? 
Perfect. 
Hurry up and get dressed. 
We don't have much time. 
Sir. 
Okay. Now what? 
You're asking me? 
Get in! 
Hi. 
Hi. 
Uhh, excuse me. Are we 
planning on leaving soon, 
or are you two gonna keep staring at each other until they start shooting at us. - Hey, Burch. 
- Yeah? 
- Yeah. They're out. 
- I'm on my way. 
- As soon as we see him, so was the van. - How could this happen? 
What the dickens? 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
So, uhh... How do 
we find the lab? 
Page 41/53
After I lost it the first time, 
I put on a new tracker... 
...of sorts. 
That'll work. 
Is it ready or not? 
We can begin the 
extraction process now. 
Listen, Ava, this whole thing 
could be very dangerous. 
- Maybe, maybe we should... 
- Maybe we should what? Wait? 
I've got days until I'm dead. 
We're doing this, Bill. Now. 
Energy readings show they 
have not used the tunnel yet. 
We don't have much time before Mom's 
location shifts and we lose her. 
Yeah, and we have 
a lot to do before that. 
You know, my Pap-pap always said if you 
wanna do something right, you make a list. So, we should do that. 
One, we have to 
break into that lab. 
Two, we have to kick 
out Foster and Ghost. 
Three, we have to fight Ghost. That 
seems like it should be part of 2. 
2-A. Right? Let's call it 2-A. 
Fight Ghost, 2-A. Oh! 
Also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully grown for you to come back. Otherwise we're screwed... Scott... 
You want me to start 
again? I'll start again. 
I'm going to dive. 
The only chance we've got is if 
the 2 of you are out here 
together, protecting the tunnel. 
Let me do this, 
Hope. Please. 
Let me get her. 
I think he's right. 
Whassup? 
Page 42/53
You remember that 
beloved commercial? 
Whassup? 
I had him follow us here. 
I thought we could 
use some help. 
All right. I'm in position. 
The ants are headed in. 
- Copy that. 
- Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty. - You want a pez? 
- No. 
Guess who gave me 
this for my birthday. 
By the way, 
I love that suit! 
Thanks, man. 
I wish I had a suit. 
I would even like a suit with 
like minimal powers, you know? Or maybe, even just 
a suit. With no powers. 
What is it? 
I don't know. 
It's them. 
They can't be far. 
Hank? Hank? 
Stop it! 
Dad, what's your status? 
Foster's taken care 
of. Suiting up, now. 
I just wanted to save Ava. 
She's facing death or something far more terrible. She's afraid. I'll help you find a cure when I get back. I promise. 
Together, we'll figure 
something out. 
Good luck, Hank. 
Thanks, Bill. 
Now, I'm gonna need 
you to step back. 
Time remaining: 
Page 43/53
fifteen minutes. 
Hank's in, Scott. 
Any sign of her? 
No. Nothing yet. 
Ava! 
Call off the ants, Scott. 
Oh, boy. 
Can I get a status report, cause I got some serious Ghost problems here! Ready to dive. 
- In case I don't make it... 
- Don't. Don't say that. 
I can't lose you, too. 
I love you, Hope. 
Guys, everything's bad 
over here. Please... 
Now. 
Misdirection. 
One of the first things they teach you at Online Close-up Magic University. No! 
All right. We 
got it, Scotty. 
- Meet us at the rendezvous point. - Okay. On my way. 
Oh, no. 
Really? 
- This guy? Again? 
- Who? 
I told you our business 
wasn't over. 
Change of plans. 
Hang on. 
I want that lab, boys. 
Whatever it takes. 
Hold on. 
Oh! 
That undercarriage is filthy! 
Now they have 
bigger problems. 
Hope, what are you doing? You're heading away from the rendezvous point. Don't worry. I'm taking these 
guys on the scenic route. 
Page 44/53
Wait, what 
are you... Oh. 
No! 
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, we're 
gonna die! We're gonna die! 
Signal lost. 
What the hell are 
they doing up there? 
Recalibrating. 
Recalibrating. 
You never said it was 
so beautiful, Scott. 
Recalibrating. 
Okay. Anytime now. 
Recalibrating. 
- Recalibrating. 
- Come on. 
Signal restored. 
Bikes, it's all on you. 
- Take the wheel. 
- What? Wait, Hope! 
Well, the 60's were fun. 
But now, I'm paying for it! 
Be careful up there! 
Give me a break. I haven't 
driven in two years. 
You got pez'd! 
Up here! 
Oh, that's not good. 
Hope! 
No! 
There it is right there, the lab. Get it, get, get, get the lab! I've got her. 
Westbound on Primo. 
Hope! Wait! 
Hey! What about me? 
We got you now, Ava! 
Not again! 
Piece of junk! 
Yes! 
Go. Go! Go, 
go, go, go! 
Burch got the lab. 
Page 45/53
I'm going after him. 
No, no, no, 
no, no! 
Work in progress, my ass. 
Scott, where are you? I've got Burch in my sights. Hurry! 
- I'm coming, I'm coming! 
- We're running out of time! 
Warning. Approaching 
quantum void. 
I'm coming to you, Honey. 
Guys... 
Don't you need the 
remote to the lab? 
I just found it. 
We can't grow the lab without it. Get it to us, fast. 
- Yeah, but the van is busted. - Use the Hot Wheels Rally case. Wha? 
I love you, Dr. Pym. 
The remote! We're missing the remote. We gotta check the van. 
Huh? 
Awesome! 
Hey, I'm going left. But 
Burch's boys are all over me. 
- I'm on my way. 
- Right. I'll get the lab. 
Hi! 
Oh, that's badass! 
Nice! 
Toink! 
Come here, you little weasel! 
Oh, no, you don't! 
I guess... Well, 
maybe, you do. 
Come on! 
Anyone see a southern gentleman carrying a building? 
How did he even have 
time to buy a ticket? 
Just one time, please. Work! 
Yes! All right, I need help. 
Page 46/53
That's it. 
Oh... sorry! 
Hey! Come on, man! 
Not cool! 
Murderers! 
Yes! Yes! 
I'm gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas. 'Cause you're a badass! Yes! 
No. No. No! Ant-onio! 
Our friends the humpbacks dip in here to the San Francisco bay for a little leisure, - and a little breeding. 
- Listen, Uzman... 
Just meet me at the 
waterfront in three hours. 
Oh, folks, we barely left the dock, but it looks like we have some company! 
You see it, folks? There it is. There's a breach. What the... 
Hi. Sorry. Hi. It's 
okay, it's okay. 
Sorry. No, I'm not a whale. 
This will just take a second. 
Hey! That doesn't belong to you. 
- No! No! No! No! 
- You're embarassing yourself now. 
- Come on. Let go! 
- No! 
Thank you. 
I'll take this now. 
No... 
... melts your mind... 
... a message in your head... 
... I had a dream... 
Daddy? 
Dad? 
What's going on? Why 
haven't you found Mom? 
You look lost, Hank. 
Are you all right? 
Still think you have 
all the answers, Hank? 
It's me. 
I'm so sorry! 
Page 47/53
- It took so long. 
- No. 
I do know... 
You're here now. 
Let's go home. 
I thought I was gone. 
But that energy from your hands... How did you do that? 
I'm not the same woman I 
was 30 years ago, Henry. 
This place... 
It changes you. 
And adaptation is part of 
it, but some of it is... 
Evolution. 
Lab coordinates not found. 
Do not ascend. 
I should probably tell you what we're dealing with up there. 
I got the lab. I got the lab. 
Move. Move... 
Move! 
Get out of the... 
Let's go. 
No one here appears to 
be sure what this is. 
It seems he's 
90, 80, 85 feet tall. 
Get out of the way! 
I got the lab. The lab! Okay... The earth feels junky. 
Oh, no. He's too big. 
- Scotty! 
- Scott! 
I'm gonna go to sleep. 
I'm just gonna go to sleep 
now for five minutes. 
I just need five minutes. 
Five minutes... 
You get the lab somewhere safe. Scott's air won't last! 
Okay! 
Move. Move. Move! 
No, wait! 
Page 48/53
Lab at full scale. 
- They did it! 
- Ready to ascend. 
Let's go see our daughter. 
Scott. 
Scott! 
Scott, come on. Wake up. 
Come on. Come on. 
Where are you, Scott? 
Gotcha. 
Scott? 
Hey! 
Hey, Scotty. Hope, come in. 
Do you take any questions 
'bout the building? 
- Sco... 
- Where's the remote, Luis? 
It's probably in there. 
I don't have it. 
I don't have it. 
I guess this is where 
we say, Adios, amigo. 
No, no, no! 
Thanks, guys. 
Ava? Ava! 
Ava. 
- Almost ready for extraction. 
- Please, stop. People are getting hurt. Everything hurts. Don't 
talk to me about pain. 
What if Hank was right? What 
if this process kills Janet? 
You're worried about her? 
All I'm saying is she's a brilliant scientist. She may be able to help. Oh, she will help. Right now. 
And if she dies, she dies! 
I'm sorry, we can't do this. 
We have to find another way. 
This is the way. 
Janet! 
She's starting the extraction. 
She's gonna tear Mom apart. 
No! 
Page 49/53
Hope! 
Are you okay? 
Mom? 
Oh, my God. 
We found you. 
I missed you so much. 
I missed you too, Jellybean. 
It's okay. I'm, I'm here now. 
We have time. 
No more last minute 
business trips, okay? 
I promise. 
It's okay, it's fine. 
Don't worry about me. 
- I'll be fine. 
- Dad! 
Scott. 
Miss Van Dyne. 
It's nice to... 
I guess we've already met. 
I guess we have. 
Wait. 
Your pain... 
I can feel it. 
It hurts. 
It always hurts. 
I'm sorry. 
I think I can help you. 
Do you know she could do that? It's okay. 
Guys, the cops are coming. Whoa! The, uhh, the... 
The cops are coming. 
Like all of them. 
- I gotta go. 
- We gotta go. 
What about them? 
Hands in the air! 
No. No, no, 
we do our jobs. 
You see, we see these guys, 
they trying to shoot people. 
So we apprehended them. For you. You're welcome. 
Page 50/53
- We traffic in stolen technology. - And they have killed many, many people. - He's in charge. 
- That's true. I am. 
I've also committed numerous healthcode violations in my restaurant. 
Some of them would shock you. 
It is truth serum. 
We gotta get out 
of here. Fast. 
I have an idea. 
Giant figure now spotted at the intersection of Broadway and Wycona. - All units move in. 
- Go. Go. 
There he is. 
It's over, Scotty. 
I'm sorry but we got you, man. 
Come on, it's the end of the line, pal. There's nowhere to hide. 
Just pull off that band-aid. 
You lost. it's okay. 
Dammit, Scotty! Reduce yourself! Magic? 
Dammit. Get to Lang's. Now. 
Well done, Honey. 
Let's go! 
- Leave me here. 
- We can make it. 
You said it yourself. 
I've hurt people. 
But you haven't. 
- Go, please. 
- We can make it, Ava. 
Bill... 
I'm not leaving you. 
Oh, hey guys. 
Are my two years up already? 
What's it like out there? 
I mean... 
Do people still dance? Are 
food trucks still a thing? 
You got away with it 
this time, Scott, but... 
Page 51/53
I'll be seeing you again. 
Where? 
Huh? 
Where will you be 
seeing me again? 
Like... 
in general, I'll see you. Like, the next time you do something bad. - I'll be there. To catch you. - Ohh. 
You'll be watching me. I thought you were inviting me somewhere. Why would I do that? 
That's what I was wondering. 
Why would you do that either? 
Like a party, or 
dinner or something? 
I don't know. I thought you 
were planning the evening. 
No. I meant to, like, arrest you. Like, I'll arrest you later again. - Take it easy. 
- Okay. 
Did you wanna go out 
tonight or something? 
I mean, 'cause I'm free. 
Yeah. Come on. 
- You ready? 
- Yes! 
- Daddy! 
- Hi! 
Yes, that was a... 
- 8: 
- Sounds great. 
Mr. Karapetyan? 
Yeah, you saw that? 
Well, it would be an honor to be in business with you as well. 
I'll see you Thursday, 9 A.M. 
Okay. 
This is awesome. 
So, Cassie... 
What do you wanna be 
Page 52/53
when you grow up? 
I wanna help people. 
Like my Dad. 
Really? 
I wanted to be his partner. 
But he said he wants you. 
Is that so? 
Daddy! 
Hold on. 
- Move! Get outta here! 
- No. Don't. Don't! 
Oh! Gross. 
Ugh. I hate that moth dust. 
Go. Shoo! Shoo!

Jules Verne once wrote, "Put two ships in the open sea


"without wind or tide, they will come together."


That's how my parents met. Like two ships destined for each other.


We are something else. Try Arthur Treacher...


It's okay.


Easy. You weren't breathing.


They were from different worlds.


But life, like the sea, has a way of bringing people together.


Uh...


I was gonna make you some eggs.


Just don't eat my dog, okay?


It's okay.


I made tea.


Go on, try it.


It'll make you better.


So, uh, who are you?


Atlanna.


Queen of Atlantis.


Wow.


I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.


She had fled an arranged marriage.


Left her whole world behind.


But in my father's lighthouse, she found something unexpected.


And my father found the love of his life.


Category 4 Hurricane Arthur is due to make landfall sometime after 2:00 p.m.


How about Arthur?


After the hurricane?


After a legend. He's a king, isn't he?


He's more than that.


He's living proof our people can coexist.


He could unite our worlds one day.


And the trident could only be wielded by the strongest Atlantean.


And it gave King Atlan mastery over the seven seas.


It made him so powerful that the ocean itself became jealous and sent a terrible earthquake to destroy Atlantis.


Down it fell, to the bottom of the ocean.


But, legend has it that one day a new king will come who will use the power of the trident to put Atlantis back together again.


Take him!


Queen Atlanna, by the authority of King Orvax, you are ordered to return to Atlantis.


Atlanna!


But Atlantis' memory is long...


And its king refused to let her go.


Atlanna! Tom!


My w*apon! Here!


Their two worlds were never meant to meet, and I was a product of a love that never should've been.


You don't have to do this, Atlanna. Please.


No. They will always find me.


Next time, they'll send an army.


I have to go back. It is the only way to save him.


Save you.


Where I come from...


The sea carries our tears away.


Not here.


Here you feel them.


I will return to you. When it's safe.


One day.


Right here, at sunrise.


We'll be together again.


You stay strong, my little prince.


I'll always be with you.


Don't let him forget me. Hmm?


All life came from the sea, so if we want to understand ourselves, we must journey to where we began.


Now, today, we have better maps of Mars than we do of our own sea floor.


Come on, closer. Come on, fishy.


Come on. Come over here. Boys!


Stop that. Come on.


Come along.


Bye, fishy. Bye.


My name's Arthur. What's yours?


You guys hungry? Me, too. Check it out.


Arthur is talking to the fish.


Such a freak, Arthur.


Stop! What are you gonna do about it, freak?


Stop it! Don't!


Let me go!


Who are you?


Come on, let's go. Move it.


Come on. Hurry up.


Sir, we've secured the captain.


Distress signal's disabled.


We're running dark again.


But they heard it. You can count on it.


I'll make you a deal. I won't tell you how to captain...


And you don't tell me how to pirate.


Where's the rest of the crew?


Decided discretion was the better part of valor and sealed themselves up in the torpedo bay.


Our reputation precedes us.


Your reputation.


This is your win.


Here.


Can't take that piece of junk.


It's the love of your life.


I never told you the story behind it.


This was your grandfather's.


He was one of the Navy's first frogmen during World w*r II.


He was so stealthy in the water, his unit nicknamed him Manta.


But after the w*r, his country forgot about him.


So, he went back to the sea, scavenging and surviving with his wit...


And this Kn*fe.


He gave it to me when I was your age.


And now it's yours, son.


Did we just h*t something?


No. Something h*t us.


Sir, there's something out there.


Another submarine?


Uh... No. I think it's a man.


That's not a man.


Alpha, to the right. Bravo team, sweep the passageway.


Permission to come aboard?


Aquaman!


I've waited a long time for this.


Am I supposed to know who you are?


I scavenge the high seas.


You're the Aquaman.


We were bound to meet at some point.


Let's not make it a habit.


Up.


Ow.


Dad!


Dad? Ow.


That's your kid?


Shame on you.


Boys got yourselves into this mess.


Get yourselves out of it.


Bastard!


Dad!


Dad!


Wait!


Help me! He's trapped!


You can't leave him like this!


Please!


You k*lled innocent people. You ask the sea for mercy.


Get outta here! I got this!


Shut up, I'm not leaving you!


You need to live, so you can k*ll that son of a b*tch!


Now, go! No!


Go! Shut up!


No!


No!


Damn you!


Go.


I always know where to find you.


Old habits.


Come on, I'll buy you breakfast. All right!


You want me to have them put that in a sippy cup for you?


How is it that I can breathe underwater, but you can still drink me under the table?


That's my superpower.


A Russian submarine h*jacked late last night by high-tech pirates.


The same pirates who are suspected in connection with the disappearance of the Navy's highly classified prototype stealth submarine.


And a further development, we now have unconfirmed reports that the metahuman dubbed by social media as "The Aquaman" was responsible for this daring rescue.


That's not me.


Bullshit. You're doing it, aren't you? Huh?


What Vulko trained you to do.


I knew you couldn't stand on the sidelines forever.


Your mother always knew you were special.


Don't even start.


She believed you'd be the one to unite our two worlds.


Just stop.


Whatever Atlantis' problems are, you're bigger than them.


Atlantis m*rder my mother.


You don't know that for sure.


Yes, I do.


They k*lled her. For loving you and having me.


And you know it.


Son, one day you're gonna have to stop blaming yourself.


Hey, buddy.


You that fish boy from the TV?


Oh, great.


It's "fish man." What do you want?


I'll tell you what I want.


Could we get a picture with you?


You're like our local hero, man.


It would mean a lot. Just a quick...


Whatever.


All right. Let's do this. Don't touch me.


Right, that's exactly right. I'm gonna go down here.


There we go. Everybody smile.


He understands the significance of this meeting.


He'll hear you out.


King Orm. King Nereus.


You picked a meeting place too close to the surface for my liking.


You don't recognize the Council of the Kings?


In Atlan's time, when the Seven Kingdoms were one, our ancestors gathered here.


Atlantis sat here at the head of the table.


Xebel, as always, by his side.


Brine. Fishermen.


The Deserters and the Trench had not yet fallen.


The Lost Nation had not yet vanished.


Together, they were the greatest empire the world had ever seen.


But now, I sit on Atlan's throne, shackled by archaic laws and politics.


While the thr*at above us grows undeniably...


v*olence has always plagued the surface.


They will destroy themselves.


Not before destroying us first.


We have been hiding long enough.


The time has come for Atlantis to rise again.


We honor you, King Nereus, by inviting Xebel to be the first kingdom to join King Orm's alliance.


As if you had a choice, Vulko.


By law, you need four of the Seven Kingdoms to ascend and att*ck.


The Lost Nation and the Deserters have long perished.


The Trench are nothing but animals.


The Brine will never join you, and the Fishermen are cowards.


Without me and my army to convince them, your plans are stillborn.


But I know what you really want.


Once you've obtained the pledge of the four kingdoms, you will be ordained Ocean Master.


That is merely a title.


I'm no fool, King Orm.


As Ocean Master, you'll be commander of the greatest m*llitary might on this planet.


I am the natural choice to lead it.


Are you?


What about the rumors that there's another?


An Atlantean, living among the surface.


One of royal blood.


You may sit on the throne of Atlantis, but your claim to it is weak.


How can you possibly hope to unite the empire?


My mother's bastard has never even been to Atlantis.


His loyalty is to the surface.


Surface-dwellers! To arms!


Your king is injured!


I'm not trying to start a w*r.


The w*r has already g*n.


Then it's time we send them a message they'll hear.


I'm good. Stop.


Here're the keys. Thank you.


Let's go home and work on your ta moko. Huh?


If your grandpops was still alive, he'd be banging our heads for not finishing it.


Yes, he would, but there is plenty of time for that.


We gotta get you to bed.


Got it?


I've been looking for you.


Oh, no, no, no...


I need you to come with me to Atlantis.


Listen, I'm gonna tell you the same thing that I told that rusty starfish Vulko.


Except nicer, because you're a lady.


No, thank you. I'm not interested.


You defeated Steppenwolf and saved Atlantis.


That had nothing to do with Atlantis.


Your half-brother King Orm is about to declare w*r upon the surface world.


Billions will die.


Your people and mine.


We must stop him.


And how do you propose we do that?


You are the firstborn son of Queen Atlanna.


The throne is yours by birthright.


The only way to stop this w*r and save both worlds is for you to take your rightful place as king.


You think if I just show up, Orm's gonna give up the throne?


I'm the bastard son of the queen your people ex*cuted.


Trust me. I am no king.


I agree.


That's awesome. Cool.


But, Vulko seems to believe in you for some reason, and that's why I'm here.


Vulko has learned of the location of the Lost Trident of Atlan.


Ooh, fairy tales. It's a myth.


It's not a myth.


With the Sacred Trident, the people will listen to you.


You can then claim your birthright and dethrone Orm.


My birthright? It d*ed with my mother.


But I promise you this. If Orm att*cks, I will treat him exactly the same way your people treated her.


With no mercy.


That submarine was barely operational, but it served its purpose.


One of your kind intervened.


He is not one of us.


He k*lled my father.


Our transaction has ended.


Keep the money. I want Aquaman.


Dad!


Dad!


Dad!


Pops!


Pops!


Come on, Pops.


Come on! He's not breathing.


Move! Let me help.


Come on, Pops.


Come on.


I don't even know your name.


It's Princess Y'Mera Xebella Challa.


You may call me Mera.


Thank you, Mera.


Dear God.


This was Orm's doing.


The worst is yet to come.


There's a flash flood warning here that was just extended for a couple hours.


Unprecedented sights from all over the world today.




We are seeing warships and trash washed up by massive waves.


These extraordinary scenes of coastlines deluged with waste and garbage are taking place all over the world.


Decades of pollution has been thrown back onto land.


Many are asking the question, "Was this a natural disaster or something else?"


No. This was no natural disaster.


They threw out our garbage and our warships.


This was our first contact with the people of Atlantis.


There you go again with your insane Atlantean theory.


You have absolutely no proof, Dr. Shin.


Open your eyes.


We already have an Atlantean living among us, and his name is Aquaman.


What is it?


This is the exact spot that Vulko gave me my first swimming lesson.


You have to forget all the teaching of the surface world and go deeper to uncover your Atlantean instincts.


But I already know how to swim.


Not even close.


Just so we're clear, I'll help you stop this w*r.


But then, I'm done.


Maybe that's for the best.


The ocean is more than our life source, Arthur.


It is who we are.


Wait, you can talk underwater?


I can talk underwater, too!


This is awesome!


Oh, we can do more than just talk.


Being Atlantean means more than just being able to breathe water.


Your body is equipped to survive the extreme cold and pressure, and your eyes adjust to see in the dark.


This is awesome!


So, Vulko, when can I meet my mother?


Soon, my young prince.


When you're ready, I'll take you to Atlantis to meet the queen.


I hid my ship in here.


Listen, I'm not getting in that thing.


Well, to get where we're going, you're gonna have to.


Your fish ship has been marinating in chum butter.


I'm gonna come out smelling like swamp butt.


That'd be an improvement.


Yup. Okay.


What's the point in having a bridge underwater?


The Gateway Bridge is a remnant of the Old World.


It's also the only way in or out of the Capital.


Why can't they just go over the walls?


Security is impenetrable.


Even if they did manage to evade the guards, they'd never get past the hydro-cannons.


People try to sneak in all the time.


Yeah, right.


What is this?


Customs and border control.


Don't worry. I have diplomatic clearance.


Welcome home.


There's a safe house down in the Old City.


The Highborns never venture to the sea floor.


We're here.


What is this?


We use this air pocket as an extra layer of precaution.


Only the Highborns can breathe water as well as air.


Plus, it keeps the animals out.


They get kind of messy.


Vulko. Here I am, old man.


After all these years, you finally get what you wanted.


Arthur, I wish it was under better circumstances.


I can't believe Orm att*cked.


It wasn't an att*ck.


Legally, he's not allowed to yet.


What he did to your surface warships was merely a warning.


What provoked it?


King Orm and your father were ambushed by the surface.


By the surface? I don't think so.


They still think Atlantis is a fairy tale.


I was there.


A surface warship fired at us.


Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis, giving Orm a fleet big enough to force the other two kingdoms to join him.


If we're going to prevent this w*r, you must dethrone him now.






How many times do I have to tell you? I don't wanna be king.


You don't understand.


Once he is named Ocean Master, it'll be too late.


The power at his disposal will be unlike anything you have ever seen.


I'm from the surface. No one is gonna take me seriously.


Okay? I don't even know where to begin.


By winning the hearts and minds of the people by proving to them that you're worthy, and retrieving this.


Hmm.


I already got one of those.


Not like this one, you don't.


This is the Lost Trident of Atlan.


Oh, I know the story.


It's more than a story. It's real.


It was forged by the greatest w*apon masters in history.


Crafted from Poseidon's steel for King Atlan, the first ruler of Atlantis.


Legend says the trident was imbued with the power to command the sea.


So what happened to it?


To know that is to go back to the time before the Great Fall, when King Atlan ruled over all that was, when the kingdoms of Atlantis were one.


It was a time of great prosperity and technological advancement.


We had unlocked the secret of unlimited energy at a time when the rest of the world still thought the earth was flat.


But we became too ambitious, too hungry for power.


The ocean swallowed us, and Atlantis sank.


But the very power that collapsed our civilization also paved the way to our future.


It gave us the ability to breathe underwater.


And so, we evolved.


Others regressed, became savage.


And the king lived out the remainder of his days in self-imposed exile.


Neither he nor the trident were ever seen again.


One of our archeological teams uncovered this a few months ago.


It's an ancient recording dating back to the First Dynasty.






I believe it contains Atlan's final message to his people and the whereabouts of the Sacred Trident.


So, what does it say?


We don't know. The technology's too old.


The cylinder bears the markings of the Deserter Kingdom.


You must take it there and retrieve the message.


The clue to Atlan's final resting place is inside of this.


Border Defense. You are under arrest for illegal entry.


No!


You mustn't be seen here!


I don't suppose you want to talk about this, do you?


Neither do I.


In the name of His Highness, King Orm, I place you under arrest.


Welcome to Atlantis...


Brother.


I can't believe you're finally here.


I've heard so many stories about you.


All these years, I've been ashamed of my mother for defiling herself with a surface-dweller.


Ashamed of the fact that I have a half-breed brother whose heart I wanted to run my trident through.


But now that you're finally here before me, I must admit…




I am conflicted.


You want conflict, why don't you take these chains off, little brother?


And we'll see who gets run through.


Yes, I see you've brought our mother's w*apon.


Is that why you've come here after all this time?


To k*ll me?


I came here to stop a maniac from destroying the world.


I see.


And how do you plan to stop the atrocities that the surface continues to commit?


Because for a century, they have polluted our waters and poisoned our children.


And now, their skies burn and our oceans boil.


And you've come all this way to take sides against your own people?


There are no sides in a w*r like this.


You have clearly chosen a side and come here to challenge the throne.


If that's what it takes to stop your w*r.


Are you invoking the Combat of the Kings?


Call it whatever you want. I call it an ass-whooping.


Well then, perhaps that's how we'll proceed.


Your Majesty! Orm, please.


Don't you see?


If I defeat the firstborn son of Atlanna in a formal challenge in front of everyone, then all Seven Kingdoms will have to concede that I am the one true king.


Your Majesty, there is no victory in defeating the ignorant.


Your brother is clearly an imbecile.


Your Highness, he doesn't know our ways.


Then he's about to get an education.


Are you officially challenging me?


Hell yes, I challenge you. And when I win...


If you win, I will cease all immediate action. The w*r is over.


But if I win...


You're over.


Let's do it.


So be it.


Challenge has been made, and I accept.


Prepare him for the Ring of f*re.


Wait. The ring of what?


How could you be so foolish to let Orm bait you into a fight?


It seems to me like I just solved all of our problems.


I b*at him in a battle, w*r's over, I get to go home.


You're a formidable fighter on land, but here you're out of your element, literally.


Orm has spent his entire life underwater, training to be a warrior, training to be the best.


You taught me how to fight, Cobra Kai.


Let's see if you remember anything.


So, what's with the big fork?


It's a trident. Now, defend yourself.


What the hell is this?


I'll teach you this move when you've mastered the trident.


It's not fair.


This thing is so big and awkward. Why can't I use a sword?


That's your mother's trident. A traditional w*apon of royalty.


You'll never be a king until you've mastered it.


Why has she never come to see me, huh?


I told you, when you're ready...


Stop lying to me! I've done everything you ever asked.


And every time I pass a test, you make up another one.


When am I gonna be good enough?


Does she not love me?


Your mother loved you more than anything in the world.


But she had to return to Atlantis to keep you safe.


Her marriage to King Orvax was arranged a long time ago, so she had to marry him...


And bear him a son, Prince Orm.


When Orvax eventually found out about you, he became overwhelmed with jealousy and sacrificed her to the creatures of the Trench.


Are you saying they ex*cuted her?


Because she had me?


I remember...


Everything.


I have something for you.


It belonged to my mother.


Tell me...


Do you think she would have enjoyed watching her sons m*rder each other?


I understand your fear and your reluctance, Mera.


I truly do. I don't want w*r...


Don't patronize me!


I know you.


What you're doing flies in the face of everything that your mother taught us when we were children.


If she were here...


But she's not here, is she?


What my mother taught us was treason.


Don't follow in her wake.


All right! So, this is the big, old ring of f*re, huh?


How's it work? I just kick your ass right here?


Vulko.


Will you escort my betrothed to the royal box?


Let's go, Lady Mera.


Down here, we have a legend about the Karathen, an ancient sea monster so powerful that even King Atlan himself feared it.


So, he imprisoned it in the depths of the ocean.


And in that abyss, the creature bides its time waiting to rise again.


Atlantis has been lying in wait...


And now, the beast has awakened.


There was a time when I wanted to meet you more than anything.


Get to know my little brother.


Let him know that he wasn't alone, that we were in it together.


If only I had known what a d*ck you would turn out to be.


You were the reason our mother was ex*cuted.




And I've hated you for it ever since.


But I do not want to k*ll you, Arthur.


I'm going to give you one chance.


Go home.


Do not ever come back to Atlantis.


You are not going to win this.


A w*r is coming to the surface whether you like it or not.


And I am bringing the wrath of the seven seas with me.


You know I can't let that happen.


I know.


What the hell is that?


The Ring of f*re.


Yeah!


Yeah!


sh*t.


People of Atlantis, hear me!


My brother has come from the surface to challenge me for the throne.


Let us settle his claim in the ancient way.


By bloodshed do the gods make known their will!


Traitor!


Traitor!


You'll never be king!


Never thought I'd see the day when my own father would bow before the king of Atlantis.


The surface-dwellers drew first blood. What would you have us do?


Beg them for mercy?


I detest the surface as much as you do.


But don't you find the timing of all of this a bit convenient?


But you wouldn't be that gullible, would you?


You want this w*r too, don't you?


It is past time the surface-dwellers learned their place in the world.


If this is how it must be done, then so be it.


You have our mother's trident.


Powerful, but flawed like her.


I wield my father's.


And it has never known defeat!


I promised Atlanna I'd protect him.


This isn't a competition. It's an execution.


I am the one true king!
You waiting for an invitation? Get in!


Mera!


Oh, yeah. So, what's the plan?


The plan was to recover Atlan's trident, then challenge Orm.


Okay, so we're doing things a little out of order.


sh*t happens.


Heads up! We got a bogey on our six!


What does that even mean? Bad guys behind us.


Then just say that! Bad guys behind us!


Whoa, whoa, wait, you said we couldn't go over these walls.


I did! You said there were hydro-cannons!


I did, now shut up!


Oh, sh*t!


sh*t!


sh*t.


We're not d*ad yet! But I'm hoping he'll think we are.


Oh!


Here, hold this.


What are you doing?
Listen, it worked for Pinocchio. Who?


Never mind. Come here, get in. Come on.


Great. So we're getting eaten.


How are you even doing this, anyway?


I don't know.


I can hear them sometimes, and they can hear me.


Right. Because you're both big, dumb animals.


Hey, I just saved your life. I saved yours first!


She said, "Coast is clear."


So, where to now?


To the ocean of sand your people call the Sahara.


All right.


I don't usually take charters, but I don't usually get paid in pirate treasure.


Thanks for the ride, buddy.


Oh, man.


Are you okay?


I've never been so high up before.


Or so far from home.


But at least you have a home.


Not anymore.


I can never go back.


I betrayed everything when I saved you from the coliseum.


Yeah, but you're engaged to the king. They have to take you back.


Atlantis is many wonderful things.


But forgiving, it is not.


Yeah, but you're royalty.


So was your mother.


If I went back now, I'd be sacrificed to the Trench.


Even my own father wouldn't take me back.


Look on the bright side, now you don't have to marry some tool bag that you're not in love with.


My obligation isn't to love.


It is to my family and my nation, and I've turned my back on both.


Sometimes, you have to do what's right, even if your heart aches against it.


Your Highness.


The tracker places Princess Mera here, in the Deserter Kingdom.


You said she was d*ad.


Apparently not.


Then your brother still lives as well?


Not for long.


Captain Murk, assemble a strike force immediately.


No! Mera is to be arrested and safely returned to me.


She betrayed the throne.


She is a daughter of Xebel.


If any harm befalls her, our coalition is over.


Your Highness, we are now entering the waters of the Fishermen Kingdom.


Securing the alliance of the other two kingdoms should be our immediate concern.


My vizier is correct. As usual.


Arrest them and bring back King Nereus' daughter unharmed.


We're here!


Hey!


Is there anything nearby?


Nothing but desert for hundreds of K's, mate!


Nothing but desert. He's wrong.


Hey! What are you doing? Wait! No! Oh...


She just jumped! She didn't have a parachute!


Redheads! You gotta love 'em.


sh*t!


Oh, you're crazier than I thought!


A-ha!


This way.


You were defeated the last time because your surface w*apon failed you.


Ours will not.


It's prototype armor for the next generation Atlantean soldier.


Revenge is something we Atlanteans understand.


You will lead my finest commandos as your personal army to hunt down the half-breed abomination.


I cannot touch them, but you can. He's fled to your world.


k*ll him and the woman he's with, and you will be rewarded.


k*lling him is my reward.


The crown jewel. Still experimental.


Converts water into beams of energized plasma.


Hmm.


I think I'm gonna need a bigger helmet.


One of the tribes of Atlantis broke off and settled here when this region was still an inland sea.


When the water dried up, they perished along with it.


Perished? Yeah, that's terrific.


We're getting close now.


Oh, yeah? Close to what? Dying of thirst?


Close to getting punched in the face!


Look, Fight Club, I know you're new to how things work up here.


Why don't you look around? We are lost.


You see that over there? Hey, what is that?


Nada. This place is a wasteland.


You're the one who calls this wasteland a home.


This isn't my home!


It's not like the whole surface looks like this!


Oh, no, of course not.


You've also got disgusting cities whose sewers empty out into our ocean and whole mountains made out of trash.


And, oh, you've got great factories that do nothing but belch out filth and melt ice caps.


Okay. Point taken. Listen.


Yeah, we got some idiots running the show, but we've got some good things too, all right?


We got green forests and big mountains and beautiful lakes.


You'd love 'em. They're like little baby oceans.


Are you trying to provoke me?


I'm just saying you cannot judge a place before you've even seen it.


You've judged Atlantis on far less.


No. Would you just stop it with that? No.


Your stupid Atlantean GPS just told you to jump out of an airplane over the middle of the desert, and now we are stranded.


If you're the next true king, we're doomed.


That was awesome.


Oh. Look what I found.


What you found?
Yeah.


Check this place out.


This is badass!


This is the Hall of Armory.


Where the legends say Atlan's trident was forged.


I don't think they're legends anymore.


Vulko was right.


It's real.


Huh.


Nothing.




Of course it's not working.


It's been sitting here collecting dust since before the Sahara was a desert.


Man!


"Since before the Sahara was a desert."


Thank you for repeating what I just said.


It's completely dried out.


Let's just say you do your best thinking when you're not thinking at all.


All right, now hold still.


Hey. What are you doing?


We need water, and you're the closest source.
Now, hold still.


Hmm.


Show-off.


I could have just peed on it.


King Atlan.


In this trident resides the power of Atlantis.


In the wrong hands, it would bring destruction.


But in the hands of the true heir, it would unite all our kingdoms above and below.


If you seek my power, you must prove your worth.


Journey beyond the edge of the world to the Hidden Sea.


Look inside the bottle for the charted path.


Only in the hands of the true king can he truly see.


Hmm.


We can't let Orm find this.


Hey! Wait!


What?


Shouldn't we have written it down first?


I memorized it. Didn't you?


Oh, yeah. Totally.


What'd he just say?


"Something something trident."


"Look inside the bottle for the charted path."


It's our next stop.


I'm starting to think you actually like these surface-dwellers.


It would be wrong to judge a place I've never seen before.


I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.


Well, apparently, it's just right up on the hill. A big old castle.


And I just learned something very interesting.


You risked our lives based on something you read in a children's book?


Wait, it's a book? How about that?


Oh!


I got it from the movie.


King Nereus, I had hoped our people had evolved beyond that ancient notion that w*r with the surface is inevitable.


It is the position of the Fishermen that when the time comes to make ourselves known to the landsmen, it should be to educate them, not to destroy them.


I admire your lofty aspirations, King Ricou.


But I suspect they are but clouds of ink hiding the heart of a coward.


How dare you!


Please. I implore you.


You're a kingdom of bloated philosophers and flaccid poets whose waters have grown stagnant, and it sickens me.


My King!


The king is d*ad! Long live his heir.


Princess.


Prepare your armies, Your Highness.


We move against the Brine Kingdom at once.


What did the recording say, again?


"Journey beyond the edge of the world to the Hidden Sea.


"Look in the bottle for the charted path.


"Only in the hands of the true king can he truly see."


"Look in the bottle for the charted path."


Hmm.


Oh, man.


What?


Wow. That's awesome.


Let me see.


Wow. But how do you know where to point it?


Here, let me see.


What was the last line?


"Only in the hands of the true king can he truly see."


"Only in the hands of the true..."


Marcus Agrippa.


He was a great general, but he wasn't a king.


Neither was Scipio.
How do you know all this stuff?


Because of my pops. He made sure I knew my history.


None of these guys are kings, except this guy. Romulus.


First king of Rome.


"Only in the hands of the true king can he truly see."


There it is. That's our heading.


What? Let me see.


We did it!


Oh!


That's not bad for an imbecile, huh?


Not bad at all.


Mera.


"Loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep, "and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men."


Get back!


Arthur!


I order you to stand down!


Princess Mera, you've been charged with high treason.


Who the hell are you?
Maybe this will jog your memory.


You're the guy from the sub.


That's right.


But now I have Atlantean steel.


Call me "Black Manta."


You thought you could walk away?


I thought I told you not to make this a habit.


You can't run.


You owe me blood!


How'd you find me?


Your lady friend has people who like to keep tabs on her.


No!


Come on.


Everybody, inside. Get inside.


I'll show you the same mercy you showed my father.


And gut you like the fish you are!


Arthur!


Mera, they're tracking you.


What?


They're tracking you.


Arthur, stay with me.
Arthur, wake up! Arthur.


Um...


Did you steal a boat?


Are the boats at the marina not for public use?


No, those belong to people.


Huh.


Those were Orm's elite commandos.


But the one who led them, he wasn't Atlantean.


I've never seen him before.


Yeah, I have.


He and his father were pirates.


And he blames me for his father's death.


They picked a dangerous line of trade. It's not your fault.


That's not how it feels.


It was up to me, and I let him die.


I could've saved him, but I didn't.


And now, I made an enemy, and he could have hurt you.


And that would have been my fault.


Well, he's behind us now.
It's what lies ahead that should concern us.


The charted path leads to the Kingdom of the Trench.


Are those the same creatures that k*lled my mother?


Yes.


She was taken there and sacrificed to them.


It's become a place of death.


We know next to nothing about what's down there.


We should turn back.


We can still warn the surface. Try and prepare them for what's coming.


Turn back?


Look, I learned from a young age not to show weakness.


Okay? I solve my problems with my anger and my fists.


I'm a blunt instrument, and I'm damn good at it.


But I've done nothing but get my ass kicked this whole trip.


I'm no leader. I'm not a king.


I do not work or play well with others.


And I can't let you die trying to turn me into something that I'm not.


You think you're unworthy to lead because you're of two different worlds.


But that is exactly why you are worthy.


You are the bridge between land and sea.


The only question is...


Can you?


The tracking on Lady Mera is still dark, Your Highness.


Vulko.


My trusted vizier who has stood by the throne since my father sat upon it.


Have you any advice for me as this w*r begins?


I have already given it, My King.


But I will stand by your decision, as always.


My decision.


To protect it.


While you betray it.


You think I do not know of your treachery?


That you have remained loyal to my mother's bastard son.


That you have spent years training him to take the throne from me.


Do not deny it.


I do not.


Why?


I am the pureblood.


I have devoted my life to Atlantis.


He wanted nothing to do with it. You swore to serve the throne!


I do serve it.


Arthur may only be half-Atlantean, but he's already twice the king you'll ever be.


Take him.


But make sure he has a view.


What the hell are these things?


The Trench! We're here!


There are too many of them! Come on, inside!


They're from the depths.


They're scared of the light. Here!


Come on!


You ready to jump?


Over there!


That thing will tear us apart.


We don't have a choice!


Arthur!


Mera!


Mera!


Mera!


Mera!


Mera!


Arthur.


Mom?
King Orvax sacrificed me to the Trench, but I survived.


I fought my way through as you did, and I ended up here.


You've been here alone for 20 years?


Yes.


Come. Sit here.


You must forgive me.


Forgive me for everything.


This happened because you had me.


Not for having you. None of this is your fault.


I made a choice. I had to leave...


To save you, to save your father.


Tell me. Tell me about him.


Is he...


He still walks to the end of that dock.


Every morning.


Every day.


Waiting for you.


Why didn't you ever come back?


Because the portal that brought you here won't let us return.


The trident is the only way back.
But it is guarded by the Karathen.


The creature from our legends, it's real.


It lies beyond the waterfall.


We'll go with you. We can fight it together.


No.


It's too powerful.


I've tried many times over the years.


The creature will only allow the true king to pass.


You're afraid.


Yes.


Good.


You're ready.


Atlantis has always had a king.


Now, it needs something more.


But what could be greater than a king?


A hero.


A king fights only for his nation.


You fight for everyone.


You do not belong here.


I have guarded the trident against false kings since the beginning.


And for a thousand years I have seen the greatest champions try and fail.


But never have I sensed one as unworthy as you.


You dare come here with your tainted mongrel blood to claim Atlantis' greatest treasure?


So be it...


Half-breed.


You thought yourself worthy?


You thought yourself a king?


You dishonor this place with your presence.


Stop!


You're right. I am a half-breed mongrel.


But I did not come here because I thought I was worthy.


I know I'm not.


You understand me?


I do.


No mortal has conversed with me since King Atlan.


Who are you?


I'm nobody.


I came because I had no choice.


I came to save my home and the people that I love.


I came because the trident is their only hope.


And if that's not good enough...


Then screw you.


No man has ever freed the trident from Atlan's grip.


Should he deem you unworthy...


Well, I haven't feasted in eons, and I am famished.


The one true king.


Remember, the Brine are powerful, savage brutes, but a swift as*ault aimed directly at their leadership will turn the tide.


Defeat the Brine King, and you will command the greatest m*llitary might on this planet.


Today, we unite our kingdoms.


Tomorrow, we scorch the surface!


Rise, Atlantis!


Death to the Atlantean hagfish!


We will not bow to Atlantis.


We're gonna give them a fight that they will never forget!


No! We need him!


Join me or die.


You expect me to address you as Your Highness?


Not Your Highness.


Call me...


Ocean Master.


You can take my army, you soft-bellied slug.


But you will never have my allegiance!


So be it!


What the...


The king has risen.


att*ck!


There are too many casualties. We have to stop the fighting now.


I'll find my father. But you must defeat Orm.


And what if I can't?


Last time, he was in his element.


This time, make him fight in yours.


Um...


What was the plan, again? The plan is to not get k*lled.


Yeah, good plan. Don't get k*lled.


The Trench! He commands the Trench!


Impossible!


Stand down! Let her pass.


Please, Father, he has the trident.


I know you think this w*r is necessary, but Arthur is king by our most sacred law.


And if you turn your back on that now, then the Atlantis you're fighting for is already d*ad.


It's true! The half-breed wields King Atlan's trident.


He commands the sea!


Then that half-breed is your king.


Vulko! Come on, he needs our help!


We can't! Look.


The people must bear witness.


That trident doesn't change what you are.


A half-breed bastard.


Atlantis will never accept you as its king.


Well, then by bloodshed...


Do the gods make known their will.


Yield the throne. Yield it!


Finish it.


Yield the throne.


Mercy is not our way.


Maybe you haven't noticed, brother...


But I'm not one of you.


Do it!


k*ll me! No!


That is enough k*lling.


Mother?


Oh, my son.


It's a long story.


I'll tell ya later.


Come on!


I don't understand. We thought...


I know.


Arthur saved me.


You're with him? I am.


You're both my children, and I love you so much.


But you have been misguided.


Your father taught you that there were two worlds.


He was wrong.


The land and the sea are one.


My queen.


Vulko.


Take him.


But make sure he has a view.


When you're ready,


let's talk.


People of Atlantis, today began in bloodshed, but let it end in joy.


I give you King Arthur of Atlantis.


Hail to the king!


Hail to the king! Hail to the king!


So, what do I do now?


Be their king.


Ooh.


This is gonna be fun.


You came back. You're back.


Yes. Yes.


My father was a lighthouse keeper.


My mother was a queen.


They were never meant to meet...


But their love saved the world.


They made me what I am.


A son of the land, and a king of the seas.


I am the protector of the deep.


I am...


Aquaman.


Hey!


I spent 15 years at the United States Institute of Marine Science...


Weren't you fired? ...studying oceanic phenomenon, and this is the most conclusive evidence we have to date.


Deep-sea seismographs have recorded explosions on the ocean floor.


We have satellite imagery of debris from Atlantean warships floating on the surface...


Dr. Shin! Will you please let me finish?


Here we go again. Atlantean?


Yes. The government does not want us to know about the thr*at that exists right here...


Yeah, I wouldn't do that if I were you.


This is Atlantean technology, isn't it?


Can you tell me how you got this?


Sure. But first, you gotta tell me how to find him.

Ebony Maw:

(We now recognize a bearded Captain America as he steps into the light. While they are distracted, Falcon {Sam Wilson} swoops in and kicks PROXIMA MIDNIGHT to the next room.

Unfortunately, his arm slips from it and he keeps going. Spider-Man shoots a web strand at Strange with one hand and holds onto a piece of the ship with the other. It breaks, sending them both towards space when his Iron-Spider suit’s metal arms brace him to keep him from being sucked out.)

So I’m not so sure if it’s a better plan to fight him on out turf or his but you saw what they did, what he can do. At least on his turf, he’s not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur? 
Strange: 
understand….if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone… I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can’t, because the fate of the universe depends on it.

he puts his outstretched arm briefly on either shoulder) Alright, kid. You’re an Avenger now.

ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and
for the first
time in our history
we will be sharing
our knowledge

with the outside

from the shadows . We cannot , we
must not. We will work to be an

sisters
on this Earth should treat
each other . Now more than ever ,
illusions
of division
threaten
our
very e x istence.
We all know the
truth : more connects
us than
separates
us . In times of crisis ,
the wise build bridges , while the
foolish
build barriers

Freddie!  
JIM HUTTON (O.S.) 
The DOOR then springs open - it’s JIM HUTTON (FREDDIE’s  long-term partner and carer) running, heart-broken, through  the upstairs rooms of Freddie’s mansion, finally stopping  at the top of the stairs, as -  
 - the front door opens. It’s MARY AUSTIN (40) entering,  breathless, with her own key. She looks up the stairs, at  JIM, who is standing there, tearful, grief-stricken.  
MARY catches her breath. Her face starts to crumple as  JIM’s expression delivers the tragic news. MARY puts down  her bags and climbs the stairs, stopping to steady herself,  until she and JIM hug, hold hands, then move together  toward the distant bedroom and a big round bed lit from  above by a column of daylight. On the bed, distantly, we  can just make out a still FIGURE over which JIM and MARY  bend...

...ROGER TAYLOR (42) holding a TELEPHONE in one hand, reads  from the DAILY MIRROR... 
ROGER 
“a man--bent--on abnormal pleasures,  
corrupt, corrupting--his life a  
revolting tale of depravity, lust  
and wickedness...” 
No. 
BRIAN ROGER 
“...for his kind his death--was a  
suicide.” Bastards.  
Silence -  
BRIAN 
What do you want to do?  
INT. BREAKFAST TV SHOW - DAY 
The grieving BRIAN and ROGER on a couch, face an arrogant  MALE TV INTERVIEWER. We are live -  
INTERVIEWER 
Last week saw the death of one of the  
most flamboyant and popular figures in  
rock-music--Freddie Mercury, lead  
singer with Queen. Joining us in the  
studio to pay tribute and maybe  
reflect on Freddie’s memory for the  
first time: two of the band members:  
guitarist Brian May & drummer Roger  
Taylor--thanks for coming. So-- 
the commentators have all had their  
say about Freddie, haven’t they?  
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 
For ROGER and BRIAN, so full of emotion, the words don’t  come easily... 
ROGER 
What we feel is--our friend is barely  
in his grave--all he ever did was try  
to entertain people--and some people  
are saying “good”, “good riddance”,  
“he deserved it.” It’s disgusting.  
Because he was actually -  
MALE INTERVIEWER 
(cutting him off) 
(Yes, I mean) it would be wrong not to  
say that he has been depicted in  
certain quarters as a sort of  
decadent, wild, bisexual,  
irresponsible lover.  
ROGER 
We’re here to stick up for him, coz 
he can’t stick up for himself. 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
But what was the truth of that? 
Of what?  
BRIAN 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
Was he decadent, irresponsible? When  you hear the stories -  
BRIAN 
(reacting) 
Did he deserve to die, you mean? Is  that the question?  
MALE INTERVIEWER 
But it’s interesting isn’t it, that -  
ROGER 
He was a victim of an epidemic. A  
plague. We lost a great artist. 
BRIAN 
And a magnificent human being. 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
And why do you think, then, some  
people are -  
(CONTINUED) 
5.
CONTINUED: (2) 
ROGER 
- Newspapers - let’s be clear -  
MALE INTERVIEWER 
- newspapers--the media--have reacted  
in this way? Is it perhaps because -  
ROGER 
Because they have no shame. They want  
to sell papers. They don’t know who  
he was. 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
- because Freddie became a symbol for  
a certain sort of life-style, didn’t  
he? A manifesto of hedonistic freedom. 
BRIAN and ROGER now start to become furious with this guy -  
BRIAN 
Did he? I don’t know that. 
ROGER 
You asked us on this program so we  
could talk about our friend. We  
agreed that -  
MALE INTERVIEWER 
Well let’s talk about you then, the  
band. What will you do now? Will you  
go on, or disband?  
ROGER 
It’s too soon--it’s been three days 
--we were together 22 years. We’re  
in shock, I think.  
Yes. 
BRIAN 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
Because also, well, Freddie wrote  
most of your hits--didn’t he? 
This comments stuns BRIAN and ROGER -  
ROGER 
(to BRIAN) 
Did he? Oh.  
BRIAN 
Oh so Freddie wrote: “We Will Rock  
You”--did he?  
(CONTINUED)

ROGER 
“A Kind of Magic”? Coz I thought -  
BRIAN 
“Radio Gaga”? (Oh I see.) 
MALE INTERVIEWER 
(Well let’s just)--just say--a lot  
of your biggest most popular hits... 
Silence, and then -  
ROGER 
No. No, let’s say--”let’s just say” 
this interview is over. Let’s just  
say that.  
(to BRIAN) 
(Shall we, dear?)  
BRIAN and ROGER get up and pull off their microphones -  
MALE INTERVIEWER 
(No, no, please), guys, hey, come on -  
You’re a dick. 
BRIAN and ROGER walk out. 
FADE TO BLACK.

INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
The year is now 2016...and in a dimly lit PRIVATE  STUDIO...full of homely touches (furnishings, books,  candles, and a telescope, etc) the CAMERA finds... BRIAN  MAY (69), his back turned to camera, his curly tresses now  GREY, wearing HEAD-PHONES (CANS), whilst playing his RED  (”RED SPECIAL”) GUITAR. Only he can hear what he is  playing...  
ANGLE ON: ROGER TAYLOR (67), appearing in the doorway  behind him... 
Brian? BRI! 
OLDER ROGER 
But BRIAN can’t hear this...so ROGER throws a CUSHION.  BRIAN turns, takes off his CANS... 
Mmmmm?  
OLDER BRIAN 
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 
OLDER ROGER 
I’m out of here. See you tomorrow  
morning. Got some good stuff.  
When ROGER departs, BRIAN pulls his HEAD-PHONES back on,  then walks to an AMPLIFIER, tinkering with the  knobs...until something catches his eye... 
In the doorway now stands a YOUNG MAN (early 20’s), with  ROGER behind him. BRIAN pulls off the cans... 
OLDER ROGER 
Says he’s here for an interview.  
BLOGGER 
“BuzzMix Online”? You both agreed  
to an interview? David Ashcroft. 
Buzzmix? 
OLDER BRIAN BLOGGER 
Twelve million followers.  
The BLOGGER holds out his CELL-PHONE to BRIAN - BRIAN looks  at the PHONE, reading the EMAIL... 
BLOGGER 
Email confirmation...7 pm. You  
were both “looking forward to it.” 
BRIAN passes the cell-phone to ROGER to read... 
OLDER BRIAN  
...fucking Jim Beach... 
BLOGGER 
And I fly back to the US tomorrow  
morning, so--this is really the  
only chance. Kinda--now or never.

You give him 12 minutes!  
Silence.  
OLDER BRIAN 
I’m working. Sorry. No.  
Can you show yourself out?  
BLOGGER 
Wow. Okay. Okay--alright. Jesus.  
I’ll um--okay... 
The BLOGGER starts to go and then stops at the TELESCOPE,  examining it. BRIAN notices and watches -  
BLOGGER 
This is an “Orion”, right?  
OLDER BRIAN 
(unimpressed) 
It’s written on the side.  
Indeed, the make “ORION” is clearly visible...

That’s the one. Anyway... 
The BLOGGER smiles, until BRIAN capitulates - 
OLDER BRIAN 
How long will it take - ?  
BLOGGER 
- Not long, not at all! See, as it’s  
the 25th anniversary Of Freddie’s  
passing there’s renewed interest,  
especially with Queen playing again... 
The BLOGGER begins to set up his TAPE RECORDER... 
BLOGGER 
...to huge crowds still--and the  
songs, they’ve endured! 
(sings badly) 
“Bismillah, we will not let you go,  
let him go...Bismillah...we will  
not let you go...” 
OLDER BRIAN 
And the press said that song should be  “sunk to the bottom of the ocean.”  
“The Sun”, newspaper--never forget a  
bad review--nor did Freddie. Oh how  
he hated the critics. 
BLOGGER “Bismillah.” What is that, by the way?  There’s all these theories out there.  Did Freddie ever explain it?  
Bismillah? 
OLDER BRIAN 
When BRIAN NODS...the BLOGGER smiles - 
BLOGGER 
Tell me. You gotta tell me.  
(CONTINUED)

But BRIAN smiles wistfully, shakes his head, and waves a  finger -  
OLDER BRIAN 
Freddie wanted mystery. He needed it,  
you see. Ask me something else.  
BLOGGER 
It’s just I did some research for this  
interview and I googled the TV  
interview you did at the time--wow, I  
mean, horrible! And you clearly wanted  
to tell people who Freddie Mercury  
really was... 
OLDER BRIAN 
And your question?  
BLOGGER 
Just that, really. Who was Freddie  
Mercury? Who was he? If we could  
start there... 
Coz, I read a bunch of stuff about  
him but none of it really made  
me any the wiser... 
The BLOGGER angles the TAPE-RECORDER MIC toward BRIAN...and BRIAN reluctantly sits... 
OLDER BRIAN 
Freddie?...(Frowns) Hated to talk  
about himself--well, truthfully 
about himself.  
BLOGGER 
Right! But you knew him.  
So--how did you first meet?  
Freddie Mercury? The Legend?  
OLDER BRIAN 
Bulsara. Freddie--Bulsara. I heard him--before I saw him...

The YOUNG BRIAN (23) and ROGER (21) walk down the halls,  which are filled with ARTISTS plying their craft,  sculpture, fashion, design. ROGER has two DRUM STICKS and  drums them on whatever he passes, including the odd CUTE  GIRL!  
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
Our band was good. But we were having  
problems connecting with audiences -  
INT. “SMILE” GIG - NIGHT 
SMILE perform - onstage, “Doin’ All Right”.  
BRIAN, ROGER, and BASSIST/SINGER TIM STAFFELS, in T-shirts  and jeans, are entirely focused on playing their  instruments - no stage presence whatsoever.  
The small AUDIENCE - of about 20 people - is appreciative.  
INT. HALLS/ EALING ART SCHOOL - DAY 
BRIAN and ROGER continue their walk through the art school. 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.)

INT. HALLS/ EALING ART SCHOOL - DAY 
ROGER and BRIAN continue their walk through ART  SCHOOL...ROGER suddenly veering off down another corridor,  toward the BATHROOM - BRIAN only belatedly works out where  ROGER has gone by following the sound of DRUMMING.  
INT. BATHROOM/ EALING ART SCHOOL - DAY 
ROGER and BRIAN are now singing “TUTTI FRUTTI” (a jazzy,  slowed-down version, harmonizing beautifully with each  other) as ROGER, then BRIAN, go up to the urinal in the  TILED BATHROOM with its real nice echo.  
ROGER, one handed, (one drum stick clenched in his teeth)  still drums on the TILES as he sings (he has a very high  sweet voice) 
ROGER/BRIAN  
“I got a girl...named Sue... 
she knows just what to doooo...  
 I got a girl...named Sue...

VOICE 
“She rocked to the east... 
 She rocked to the west...  
 But she's the girrllll.... 
 ...that I love the best... 
The singing - which is very good - is coming from one of  the TOILET CUBICLES. They move toward it.  
(CONTINUED) 
13.
CONTINUED: 
The VOICE in the TOILET CUBICLE continues to sing “TUTTI  FRUTTI” very well...as ROGER and BRIAN get down on their  knees and peek under the door and see FEET, pointing toward  them. Before they can get up off the floor the DOOR opens  and the STRANGER walks past them, right over them, moving  to the WASH-BASINS.  
ROGER and BRIAN stand and look at the STRANGER from behind,  who is now bent over the BASIN, washing his hands as he  continues to sing. The long-haired STRANGER is wearing SILK  trousers, a scarf around his waist and a sheepskin  waistcoat. Finally, the STRANGER straightens and his face  is at last revealed in the MIRROR...

- FREDDIE raises his right arm, feet astride, already  striking the iconic pose, eyes closed, chin raised high  until he breaks out of it.  
REACTION, ROGER and BRIAN: Astonished... 
FREDDIE 
“Smile”! Yes?  
FREDDIE SMILES, but covers his buck teeth with his hand,  self-consciously - the bullied little boy showing itself in  this lingering mark of childhood insecurity.

FREDDIE undoes his fly, and pulls out his PENIS, as...

CLOSE ON: A RECORD - JIMI HENDRIX’S “ELECTRIC LADY LAND” -  playing on a turn-table.  
WIDE: As BRIAN reads the sleeve notes on the ALBUM COVER -  FREDDIE excitedly puts his EAR to the LEFT SPEAKER then  moves to the RIGHT SPEAKER of his old STEREO RECORD  PLAYER... 
FREDDIE 
Listen to this! Hear how the guitar  
starts here (left speaker)--here-here here!--and now comes over here! (right 
speaker) How does he make it do that?  
BRIAN 
Studio. They split stereo sound, two  
channels, left and right, pan back and  
forth...  
BRIAN then moves to FREDDIE’s desk, which is full of LITTLE  PAPER BALLS, as -

BRIAN 
What’s with all the paper balls? 
(CONTINUED) 
16.
CONTINUED: 
BRIAN un-folds one of the balls - the title is “VAGABOND  OUTCAST”. BRIAN looks at FREDDIE, seeing him then as FRED  sees himself... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
“Outcast”--Yes, that’s how he’d  
always seen himself. A sad, lonely  
boy, bullied--tugged from Africa  
to India to this place--this 
little room in Feltham, Middlesex!  
FREDDIE at the full-length MIRROR, struggles to do up the  TROUSERS...he starts to LAUGH (FREDDIE’s high GIRLISH  LAUGH) and turns to share the joke with BRIAN - those big  BUCK TEETH flashing for a second before FREDDIE covers them  with his hand. BRIAN, thoughtful, smiles back... 
FREDDIE 
One has to suffer for fashion.  
BRIAN 
You write songs?  
FREDDIE 
No. That’s why they’re paper balls.  
Can’t finish them.  
BRIAN picks up a heavily marked scrap of un-balled paper,  as FREDDIE dons a LONG BLACK COAT and covers his wardrobe  before he EXITS. BRIAN remains - studying the scrap. 
FREDDIE! 
FREDDIE’S MUM (O.S.) FREDDIE (O.S.) 
I move into my first flat next week  
thank God. Smaller than this room,  
but we can hang out, play music...

Mind if I make a suggestion about  
our playlist on Friday?

It’s only a trial gig, just to see if  you gel with the band - okay? 
FREDDIE nods, exits.  
Coming!

Here was his music. I’d never seen  
notation like it. It was--different. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT OLDER BRIAN crosses to the BLOGGER, with a WOODEN BOX -  
OLDER BRIAN 
Not at all proper. But a language  
that was Freddie’s own--a 
kaleidoscope of influences--a nod to  
one style, a genuflection to another-- 
melodies battling with counter melodies... 
We hear, as SOUNDTRACK, these layers of sound, these  elements, building up...up...as - BRIAN opens the BOX.  Inside it, LITTLE PAPER BALLS. 
OLDER BRIAN 
...rock competing with “Uncle Mack’s  
Children’s Favourites”, competing with  
Mantovani--the Laughing Policeman with  
Verdi and the Billy Goats Gruff. And  
what I saw, in these little bits of  
paper, this confetti - was a man's  
confusion--in musical form--about who  
he was! A many of strange parts. And  
such--cacophany! 
BRIAN playfully covers his ears as the noise he hears gets  too much. And then the CACOPHONY on the SOUNDTRACK suddenly  stops - SILENCE.  
OLDER BRIAN 
And what could I do for him? Connect  
them all, help him to tie them  
together, to produce...harmony.  
BRIAN picks up his “RED SPECIAL GUITAR”  
OLDER BRIAN 
Let me show you! In those days--he 
was writing things--like this... 
BRIAN sits -

BRIAN alone hears...(as we do, as SOUNDTRACK)...the opening  PIANO RIFF of “SEVEN SEAS OF RHYE”... 
INT. BULSARA HOME - DAY 
FREDDIE, playing the PIANO RIFF on the FAMILY PIANO -

OLDER BRIAN 
MASSIVE...three guitars in harmony!  
Guitars transformed into an  
orchestra! I could give him what  
he was hearing but couldn’t play. 
Another BANGGG! of HUGE GUITARS and then FREDDIE’s voice  comes in with the first lyric...  
OLDER BRIAN 
And then we’re in.  
BRIAN silences, with a snap of his fingers, the music.  But the BLOGGER is more interested in the guitar itself.

CLOSE ON: The RED SPECIAL, being strapped on by BRIAN, as  
- the band prepare to perform their first song - to a small  audience. 
ANGLE ON: FREDDIE, struggling to adjust the FAULTY MIC STAND which is set too low -  
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
We had no idea what to expect from  
Freddie on that first night. 
ANGLE ON: JOHN DEACON (20) - on BASS GUITAR.  
OLDER BRIAN 
And John Deacon, electrical  
engineering student, had just taken  
over on bass--so anything could  
happen.  
FREDDIE still can’t adjust the FAULTY MIC-STAND -  
ROGER 
Ready? Freddie?  
FREDDIE 
Ready Steady Go.  
(struggling) 
Wait, wait--This--give me---Bloody- 
- but then the top half of the MIC stand breaks off, and  won’t go back into the bottom half -  
- ROGER and BRIAN share concerned looks. Not a good  beginning.  
Come on.  Freddie -  
ROGER 
BRIAN 
FREDDIE 
Fuck it. Let’s go.

CONTINUED: 
FREDDIE will just use the top half of the MIC stand, the  MIC affixed. FREDDIE comes to the centre of the stage.  
For a second FREDDIE stares at the audience, the shy  nervous Farouk Bulsara. But then he takes a deep breath and  nods at BRIAN, who counts in the BAND -  
“SMILE” strike up the intro to “Doin’ All Right” - and  FREDDIE jumps into a dramatic pose, which he holds like a  statue -  
BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN all share surprised looks as  FREDDIE then begins to TRANSFORM THE SONG - his hugely  dramatic and showy performance a million miles from what we  saw Tim Staffel do with it.  
ANGLE ON: The Audience reaction: Startled. 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
Same old song, but it sure felt  
different with Freddie doing it.

Details! She’s your girlfriend?  
Not your girlfriend? What? C’mon. 
Sort of.

FREDDIE 
Sort of Yes, or sort of No?  
BRIAN 
Sort of--both. We’ve been out a few  times. It was -  
Kissed her?  
FREDDIE BRIAN 
Cheek only. Look, if you like her-- 
then just--she’s had a rough time with  
guys. Needs someone to appreciate her. 
FREDDIE 
There’s something really sweet and  
calming about her.  
BRIAN

LATER. MARY shows out the last shopper and turns to see  FREDDIE, the last one in the store - BRIAN and ROGER are  gone, and FREDDIE is still pretending to go through the  clothes.  
ANGLE ON: FREDDIE, his eye momentarily taken by a HANDSOME  YOUNG MAN, who glances at FREDDIE, before leaving the  store. FREDDIE watches him go, with as yet unadmitted sexual interest, as -  
Closing.

FREDDIE 
Fashion & Design, Ealing Arts.  
(holds wide his arms) 
Can’t you tell?  
MARY 
I can now. Yes.  
A spark passes between, as FREDDIE tries to pluck up the  courage -  
- and as MARY notices that FREDDIE’s FINGERNAILS are  varnished BLACK.  
FREDDIE 
So--right. See you. Some other time.  
He leaves, but then returns -  
FREDDIE 
It’s some other time.  
She smiles at him - he’s CHARMING.  
EXT. KENSINGTON MARKET - DAY 
FREDDIE and ROGER work their little STALL, trying to sell  FREDDIE’s ART-WORK (drawings of JIMI HENDRIX, ROCK HUDSON) 
(CONTINUED) 
23.
CONTINUED: 
Right now, no buyers...And then, through the crowd, comes  MARY - 
FREDDIE picks up a VENETIAN MASK and holds it over his  face.  
“Smile”. 
MARY ROGER 
If we could find a customer. 
MARY 
I just had people in the store talking  
about this wild new band. It’s going  
well.(to Freddie) 
And who might this be? 
FREDDIE 
Countessa! Might I perchance interest  
you in my bric a brac? A portrait  
perhaps of our Saviour, James Hendrix 
rendered by own hand?  
MARY 
Actually, I was looking for Fred. 
FREDDIE  
(to ROGER) 
Fred?  
ROGER 
Could you describe him?  
MARY 
With some difficulty. 
FRED slides the MASK down...and then starts to sing...  
FREDDIE 
“He’s so nervous...but he’s at your  
service...” 
(smiling) 
Hello 
Hello. 
MARY 
FREDDIE 
(CONTINUED) 
24.

ROGER sees that these two are smitten with each other. 
CUT TO: 
With MARY, FREDDIE buys an old damaged PIANO, paying CASH,  but is a little short and so whispers to MARY, who has to  open her PURSE and contribute...FREDDIE smiles at the PIANO  SELLER over this... 
CUT TO: 
MARY and he watch the PIANO being loaded into a truck.  
FREDDIE 
Rightio. We need to stop by a  
chemist and buy some  
nail-polish immediately.  
Why?  
MARY 
FREDDIE 
Why do you think? 
INT. FREDDIE’S FIRST FLAT/ 2 VICTORIA RD/ LONDON - DAY 
CLOSE ON: The BRUSH of the BLACK-FINGERNAIL painting  BLACK NAIL-POLISH onto - the White Piano Keys.  
WIDE: We are in the tiny new flat Freddie has just rented  – empty but for the piano. While he paints the White Keys  BLACK...MARY paints the black keys WHITE... 
FREDDIE 
Let's make the poor little thing  
stand out...transform it, from  
being just another sad, completely  
forgettable, run of the mill... 
two-a-penny...humdrum... 
MARY 
...garden variety... 
FREDDIE 
...bog-standard... 
MARY 
...middle of the road... 
FREDDIE 
...a So-So piano--and make it  
one-of-a-kind. Famous among pianos.  
(CONTINUED) 
25.
CONTINUED: 
MARY 
Famous among pianos? 
He steals a kiss on her CHEEK -  
There. Oh.  
FREDDIE MARY 
She then leans forward and kisses him on the LIPS. When she  stops -  
Oh. 
FREDDIE 
Keeping his eyes locked on her, he blindly plays a few  cheerful notes on the PIANO, which makes her smile. 
CUT TO: 
They have just finished making love, on the floor. He  kisses her body with little love-pecks -  
FREDDIE 
So what are your parents like? (kiss)  
(giggles) 
That tickles! 
MARY 
FREDDIE 
Completely normal I suppose? (kiss) 
MARY 
Garden Variety. Freddie! (stop) 
FREDDIE 
Run Of The Mill? (kiss) 
MARY 
(suddenly serious) 
Two. A-penny. 
INT. AUSTIN FAMILY HOME - DAY 
LUNCH. While they eat, MARY communicates with her parents -  both are MUTE and DEAF and communicate in sign language  with MARY.  
(CONTINUED) 
26.
CONTINUED: 
Tense silence. FREDDIE seems nervous, shy. His FINGERS, on  the table, TAP OUT PIANO NOTES on an imaginary keyboard... 
MARY’s PARENTS both notice that FREDDIE’s tapping finger nails are painted BLACK.  
FREDDIE 
(whispers) 
They’re deaf and mute? 
MARY 
(to FREDDIE) 
I just told them your life story.  
Well, the little I know of it! 
FREDDIE smiles at her parents, who smile back.  
FREDDIE 
Tell them it’s nice to meet them.  
I have.  
MARY 
FREDDIE 
Okay. Then, uh--thank them for  the delicious food. 
I have.  
MARY 
FREDDIE 
Then--I dunno, then tell them their  daughter is a tremendous fuck.  
MARY 
They can lip read.  
BOOM. FREDDIE’s heart stops - mortified! REACTION MARY’s PARENTS: outrage. 
FREDDIE 
You’re joking?  
Uh-uh. 
Oh God.  
MARY 
FREDDIE 
FREDDIE lowers his head, trying to eat. 
(CONTINUED) 
27.

FREDDIE 
(to her parents) 
Great food.  
EXT. LONDON STREETS/ FREDDIE’S FIRST FLAT - DAY 
FREDDIE, HAPPY, hurries up the street and climbs the steps  to a front door, humming a TUNE, lighting a CIGARETTE. 
INT. STAIRS/ FREDDIE FIRST FLAT - DAY 
FREDDIE runs up the stairs - humming the TUNE -  
INT. FREDDIE’S FIRST FLAT/ LONDON - DAY 
FREDDIE opens the door to his FLAT, and is surprised to see  -  
- MARY, in their new bed, drowsily waking. (The PIANO  serves as the bed’s HEADBOARD) 
FREDDIE 
Dearie! Still in bed? Perfect. Stay  
right - 
FREDDIE peels off his shirt, kicks off his shoes, and then  takes another HIT on his CIGARETTE... 
FREDDIE 
- where - you are.  
MARY 
I loathe that you’ve started smoking.  
FREDDIE 
I need more gravel in my voice. The  
top guys now all sound asthmatic. 
FREDDIE stops at the full-length mirror -  
FREDDIE 
(touches his hair) 
Why is my hair always greasy?  
MARY 
It’s not. I need to get up. 
(CONTINUED) 
28.
CONTINUED: 
FREDDIE 
No. The new rule for our new life  
together: we have to make love at  
least four times a day whether we want  
to or not. And this number  
can be changed, but only increased. 
He bounds into bed.  
FREDDIE 
And you will want to, won’t you?  
You’ll always want to? 
MARY 
Always? (Playfully uncertain) Prob ably.  
FREDDIE 
Probably?! You little Nun! You  
little convent Nun! 
She giggles as he tickles and kisses her -  
MARY 
Are all men as -  
- as what?  
FREDDIE MARY 
Your libido is - 
FREDDIE 
- We’re lucky, aren’t we? It’s just  
a gift we both have to be grateful  
for. It astonishes me too.  
He kisses her bust and she playfully pushes him away until  their eyes lock and they start to kiss passionately, and  make love - MARY moving on top of him, happily. Until -  
Wait! 
FREDDIE 
MARY 
(concerned) 
What? What is it? 
FREDDIE stares at her, his eyes wide (is he in pain?) and then - without raising his head from the pillow - reaches -  with his right hand, up and behind him - for the PIANO  keys... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Wait. Wait... 
29.
FREDDIE 
Lying there, he BLINDLY plays a few notes on the PIANO... 
(We start to recognise the TUNE as the opening bars of what  will eventually be BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY) He likes what he  hears, as his face breaks into a smile. 
FREDDIE 
What do you think?  
Freddie! 
MARY 
FREDDIE 
It’s good, don’t you think?! I’m  
writing a song. If Brian and Roger can  
do it I should be able to. And this  
tune keeps going round and round and  
round in my head- Bom Bom...  
Bom,Bom,Bom,Bom...but I can’t finish  
it. Do you think it has potential? 
MARY 
(insulted) 
Freddie -  
FREDDIE 
How beautiful you are.  
They start to kiss and MAKE LOVE again but, as he caresses  her with his LEFT HAND, his RIGHT HAND sneaks back up to  the keys and plays the opening phrase of the TUNE.  
MARY 
Freddie! You’re awful! 
FREDDIE 
Wait, wait, wait--what do you think  
of it? It’s charming, don’t you  
think? It’s like a cowboy song. 
I give up!  
She jumps out of bed.  
MARY 
FREDDIE 
Mary! Come back here this instant! 
MARY slams the bathroom door.  
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) Mary?! 
30.
FREDDIE 
He then lies back and reaches up with BOTH HANDS and plays  blindly - even more recognizably - the opening bars of  BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY. He tries now to hum a melody over it -  
FREDDIE 
Hmmm-Hmmm....Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm 
(breaking) 
Mary? (sings) 
“Mama”...Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm-Hmmm. 
FREDDIE gives up, looks down, notices he has an erection,  as MARY exits the BATHROOM, heading for the KITCHEN.  
FREDDIE 
Mary?! Uh Oh! It’s happening again! 
MARY (O.S.) 
Use the bathroom! 
He gets out of bed, adjusting himself -  
FREDDIE 
The bathroom?!! The bathroom?!! 
FREDDIE exits the BEDROOM, hunting MARY, and we promptly  hear (O.S.) HAPPY SQUEALS from MARY... 
MARY 
Stay away! Freddie! Arrhh! Stay away!  
Help! Help! 
INT. BULSARA HOME - DAY 
LUNCH. It’s FREDDIE’s BIRTHDAY. A far noisier affair than  the Austin’s. Everyone is wearing paper party hats.  
FREDDIE is dressed VERY CONSERVATIVELY - playing the role  of the good son.  
MARY meets FREDDIE’s boisterous family, and sees the love  they all have for him.  
FREDDIE’S MUM 
No, Farrokh was born in Zanzibar.  
FREDDIE 
(cringing) 
Ma! None of that old stuff!  
(CONTINUED) 
31.
CONTINUED: 
Even here, FREDDIE is nervous, TAPPING his FINGERS, playing  that PHANTOM PIANO.  
What?  
FREDDIE’S MUM 
MARY notes that - FREDDIE’s tapping FINGERNAILS are no  longer PAINTED BLACK - He’s hiding his true nature from  those who love him most.  
MARY 
(at FREDDIE) 
Farrokh?  
FREDDIE shrugs at the revelation of this family secret, as -  his MUM comes to the table with a STACK of FAMILY PHOTOS  and starts passing them to MARY... 
FREDDIE’S MUM 
His father and I are Indian Parsees.  
FREDDIE 
Can we please talk about something  
else? I’m serious!  
MARY 
(to FREDDIE’s DAD) 
Fred said you were Persian. 
FREDDIE’S DAD 
(defensively) 
A thousand years ago the  Parsees came out of Persia  to escape Muslim  
persecution...  
FREDDIE 
(singing) 
La da da da da da da da da  da dada dadadada... 
FREDDIE’s sister passes bread to MARY - 
KASHMIRA BULSARA 
...and what’s a thousand years  
between friends, right Fred?  
FREDDIE scowls at KASHMIRA, as -  
- MARY shows FREDDIE a PHOTO of a 10 YEAR OLD FARROKH, in  a village in ZANZIBAR, grinning with BUCK TEETH... 
Sweet. 
MARY 
FREDDIE winces as he snatches the PHOTO away from MARY.  (CONTINUED)

KASHMIRA BULSARA

FREDDIE 
What?! What are you so  embarrassed about?! 
Both of you!!! 
Kash! WHY DON’T YOU JUST -  FREDDIE’S DAD 
KASHMIRA BULSARA 
Freddie was born in England at the  
age of 18. 
FRED’s DAD shows MARY then FRED a PHOTO of YOUNG FREDDIE in  BOXING GLOVES... 
FREDDIE’S DAD 
Was a good boxer actually. 
He had to be! 
KASHMIRA BULSARA 
FREDDIE can take no more of this and bounces over to the  FAMILY PIANO, and starts to bash on the keys -  
FREDDIE’S DAD 
(aside, to MARY) 
But his opponents went for his teeth. 
FREDDIE 
“Happy Birthday to Me...Happy 
Birthday to Me...” 
(switching to the  
style of Marilyn  
Monroe) 
“Happy Birthday Mr Fred-isent,  
Happyyyy... 
(and then a segue) 
“Get Back, Get back, Get back to  
where you once belonged!...’  
(segue) 
“For once in my life I have someone  
who needs me, someone I’ve waited  
so long...” 
FREDDIE winks at MARY, but MARY - serious-faced - perceives  FREDDIE’s game, that he’s hiding his biography from her.  She then notes that the FAMILY are delighted by FREDDIE’s  pantomime... 
Elvis! Elvis! 
KASHMIRA BULSARA

“...Was a cold and grey Zanzibarian morn, and another little chil’...” 
Acker Bilk! 
FREDDIE’S DAD FREDDIE 
Oh shit...umm...uhhh... 
(and then remembers) 
FREDDIE slips into “Stranger On The Shore” and, as he  plays, BLOWS - with pursed lips - the CLARINET part, which  gets the whole family La-la-laing the lilting melody...  
MARY finally smiles at this balmy family.  
FREDDIE then slams shut the lid of the PIANO.  
FREDDIE 
There! Concert over. 
FREDDIE’s DAD picks up where they left off, handing another  PHOTO to MARY -  
FREDDIE’S DAD 
And this is Farrokh at boarding  
school in Bombay... 
(to MARY) 
KASHMIRA BULSARA 
All on his own. Poor Farrokh -  
FREDDIE explodes - 
FREDDIE 
FREDDIE! My name is Freddie! My  
name--is FREDDIE...MERCURY.  
KASHMIRA BULSARA 
Freddie what?  
FREDDIE 
My stage name. My new stage name. 
FREDDIE’S MUM  
Well you’re not on stage now Farrokh.  
FREDDIE 
Freddie Mercury! I am a professional  
singer and that is now my name from  
now on, anywhere, anytime, even here!  
(CONTINUED) 
34.
CONTINUED: (4) 
Stunned silence, then -  
FREDDIE’S DAD 
You want your own family--to call  
you Freddie Mercury? 
From now on.  
FREDDIE 
FREDDIE’S MUM 
Freddie Mercury? What is this?  
(to MARY) 
What is wrong with Farrokh? With  
Bulsara? 
FREDDIE 
What’s wrong with it is...  
he doesn’t exist anymore! 
He resumes eating. The FAMILY and MARY stare at him. The  FAMILY finally resuming eating as well - accepting this.  
INT. ZANDRA RHODES’ CLOTHING STORE - DAY 
ROGER comes out of the DRESSING ROOM - in a full GLAM OUTFIT.  
Designer, Zandra Rhodes, nods with approval as - a second  later, another curtain parts, and BRIAN comes out in  another GLAM OUTFIT, complete with a WING-SHIRT. A second  later, and JOHN comes out in a THIRD COSTUME - and finally  FREDDIE - only FREDDIE looks happy. 
FREDDIE 
I feel like a butterfly!  
ROGER 
I feel like a tosser.  
We’re musicians. We’re not actors. 
FREDDIE 
It’s outrageous--that’s the only way  
the public will realise you’re on the  
scene! Rock has to be a show!  
Look at Hendrix. You saw him perform?  
BRIAN performs a LICK of AIR-GUITAR - we actually HEAR the  LICK (intro to “VOODOO CHILD”) as SOUNDTRACK...  
FREDDIE 
It’s a show! Jimi lets the audience  
in!  
(CONTINUED)

BRIAN 
Muddy Waters just sits in a chair.  
FREDDIE shoots BRIAN an “Et tu Brute” look.  
JOHN’s costume is too tight for him -  
JOHN 
Is breathing allowed? 
FREDDIE 
And the band needs to change its  
name. “SMILE” is limp. We deserve  
something--regal...  
INT. ROLLER SKATING RINK/ UK CONCERT 2 - NIGHT TIGHT ON: The BASS DRUM, sporting it’s new LOGO -   QUEEN 
QUEEN play...”STEP ON ME”...but now for disinterested  ROLLER-SKATERS, going round and round. The BAND looks  ridiculous in their new ZANDRA RHODES COSTUMES. When the  song ends they are approached by the RINK MANAGER... 
RINK 
You guys finished?  
ROGER 
No. We’ve just started. 
RINK 
Coz they (the skaters) want some  
disco, you know how ‘tis. Do you  
play disco then? No?  
FREDDIE 
I fucking hate disco. 
RINK 
Then if you don’t mind, I’m just  
going to put on some disco records,  
keep ‘em happy, rightio?  
The BAND stand there, stunned, as cheap DISCO comes over  the TANNOY. The SKATERS go round and round.

INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
BRIAN finishes lighting a CANDELABRA, touching a match to  the last THREE wicks... 
OLDER BRIAN 
Those first three albums? We had  
small hits. “My Fairy King”.  
Freddie’s. It starts--it starts  
(blows out the match) 
...in descending lines...  
As he mimes (AIR-GUITAR) playing the first notes, we hear  these notes as SOUNDTRACK...  
OLDER BRIAN 
But then? I took the reels on  
the tape deck, turned them over,  
played the tape backwards... 
He mimes again, and we hear the same notes in reverse, as a  RISING SCALE now... 
OLDER BRIAN 
You see? “Backwards guitars”...so  
rising now...in three-part harmony... 
...eight bars...then the drums!  
(the drums kick in) 
Little Richard suddenly! Jerry Lee!  
Vocal harmonies...  
(the vocals kick in) 
...Soaring, impossibly high!  
(the vocals go even  
higher) 
Bending harmonies--another 
trademark--and then -  
He mimes the little LEAD GUITAR FILL that bridges the next  section - as we hear the SONG switch -  
OLDER BRIAN 
- a nursery rhyme! What next?  
(CONTINUED)

FREDDIE’S VOCAL (O.S.) “In the land where horses

“In the land where horses  born with eagle wings And honey bees have lost  their stings

We were reaching for something, and we  
didn’t even know what it was.  
The song abruptly stops being heard as BRIAN disappears his  air-guitar...

worth...34, 42...  
FREDDIE 
Is this the most intellectual rock band the world has ever seen?  
JOHN 
Certainly the best spellers.

The band performs (mimes) “Killer Queen” on the BBC’s Top  Of The Pops. 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
...our breakthrough song. Got us on  
UK TV. ”Top Of The Pops”. The biggest  
most popular music show there was.  
What a transformation in the band! We see the young Queen  in full glam-rock glory – outlandish costumes, lights, make up! And Freddie, in full flamboyant flow.

deep in debt, owed people for

INT. RAY FOSTER’S OFFICE/ EMI RECORDS - DAY 
CLOSE: on JOE BASTIN, a handsome record executive of  FREDDIE’s age.  
RAY FOSTER (O.S.) 
So. A new album?  
ANGLE ON: FREDDIE, taking a clear interest in JOE BASTIN -  
JOHN REID (O.S.) 
Their biggest and best yet -  
RAY FOSTER (O.S.) 
And most expensive I presume.  
FREDDIE finally concentrates on what EMI BOSS, RAY FOSTER,  has to say... 
AT FOSTER’s side stand JOE BASTIN and his FINANCIAL  OFFICER. They face - 
- JOHN REID, PAUL PRENTER and QUEEN.  
RAY FOSTER 
Well I need not tell you--that it’s  
make or break time. I think you have  
to agree we have been patient with  
you, hoping for a breakthrough that  
I’m afraid just hasn’t come.  
Yet. 
JOHN REID FREDDIE 
I want you to hear something.  
It’s the new concept.  
FREDDIE goes to the record player and slips on an ALBUM.  Meanwhile BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN exchange nervous looks.  RAY FOSTER looks to his advisors, who shrug. The MUSIC  comes on - They all listen. It’s OPERA.

Seems to be an echo in here. 
Wait! 
FREDDIE 
FREDDIE, as if conducting the orchestra, thrills to a  particular passage (a coloratura) in the music - singing  along with it -  
You see?! 
FREDDIE 
REACTIONS ROGER, BRIAN, JOHN - nervous about how this is  going down. 
RAY FOSTER looks simply confused, as FREDDIE turns off the  music.  
(quietly) 
FREDDIE 
That’s our concept--mix genres, no  
boundaries, dare to go anywhere. I  
can’t think of anyone whose ever done  that before. 
RAY FOSTER 
Precisely what worries me. 
FREDDIE 
I don’t want us to repeat ourselves.  The same formula, over and over--How boring! We want to capture a  
hurricane! Paint pictures on an  
enormous scale, heavy rock foundation,  ethereal vocals, different voices,  
rhythms, keys. Deafen ‘em, blind ‘em,  and leave ‘em wanting more.  
We want to make the greatest fucking  album ever made.  
(CONTINUED) 
43.
CONTINUED: (2) 
RAY FOSTER 
Really? Trouble is, Freddie, that’s  
exactly what every band who comes in  
here says - minus the “fucking”. 
(beat) 
Because it’s our feeling, here at EMI,  that your biggest success was “Killer  Queen”, and it’s that we’d like to see  you get back to.  
FREDDIE 
Go backwards? It’s not in our nature.  You want us to go back?  
RAY FOSTER 
Not necessarily back, no. You stay  
here, we want you right here--just-- 
bring sound...forward.  
The BAND stare at FOSTER - not buying it.  
FINANCIAL OFFICER 1 
We really need a firm undertaking to  
that effect. John? If we are to take  
the risk one more time. 
JOHN REID looks at the band, and then nods -  
JOHN REID 
I understand what you’re saying.  
FREDDIE glares at JOHN REID for this.  
FEATHERSTONE 
So--we are agreed? An album--in the  
vein of “Killer Queen”? Radio friendly? Top of The Pops?...Good?  
Silence from the BAND, until -  
Absolutely.  
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
JOHN REID 
JOHN REID and PAUL PRENTER stand and toast their deal, but  QUEEN, very GLUM, refuse to stand, or join the toast.  
JOHN REID 
To your fourth album! Come on guys!  
You got your fourth album!  
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Fourth album! 
44.
PAUL PRENTER 
JOHN REID 
We just need 12 great new “Killer  
Queens.” Get writing. All of you.  
ROGER, BRIAN, FREDDIE and JOHN just stare at him.  
FREDDIE 
Boredom--is a disease--the biggest  
disease in the world, darling--and 
we’ve just agreed to spread it!  
Cheers! To Boredom! 
FREDDIE raises his glass - and turns to the EMI EXECUTIVES  across the room -  
JOHN REID 
Freddie--I’m giving Paul to you.  
Personal assistant. Take some pressure  
off. And keep you out of trouble.  
A good influence.  
FREDDIE 
Oh I have a good influence. I have  
Mary. 
JOHN REID 
You will still have Mary. Now you  
have Paul as well. It’s a gift.  
JOHN, ROGER and BRIAN all observe this -  
Oh well.  
FREDDIE 
FREDDIE and PAUL shake hands. 
ANGLE ON: BRIAN watching - suspicious -  
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
In hindsight, if there was a moment  
I should have intervened...  
FREDDIE and PAUL smile at each other.  
FREDDIE 
I suppose the more the merrier.  
(CONTINUED) 
45.
CONTINUED: (2) 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
...I was worried but I didn’t have  
the audacity to tell him what to do.  
I said--nothing. 
CUT TO: 
Later - REID and QUEEN confer -  
JOHN REID 
Royalties, profits. How do you want  
to cut up the pie? How have you  
traditionally done that? 
What pie?  
ROGER 
JOHN has the best business head -  
JOHN 
The songwriter--whoever brings a  
song in - even if we all contribute - 
- gets the song-writing credit for  
that song. And if the song gets on  
the album, then that person gets  
the publishing royalties. The rest of  
the band gets -  
ROGER 
- what’s left over.  
JOHN 
Brian, now Freddie, are writing  
most of the songs, so... 
JOHN REID 
And you don’t want to pool the  
money, divide it evenly?  
A KEY moment for the band - they look at each other for the  longest time... 
BRIAN 
I think--we’re good with the  
current arrangement. 
FREDDIE 
It’s working.  
REID looks at ROGER and JOHN, who swallow their nascent  dissatisfaction with this.  
(CONTINUED) 
46.
CONTINUED: (3) 
JOHN REID 
Yes? We’re all good? Speak now...?  
Then I’ll draw something up.  
CUT TO: 
FREDDIE (sitting with JOHN REID)... 
JOHN REID 
You’re happy? Being in a band?  
Sure.  
FREDDIE JOHN REID 
Ever think of going solo?  
No.  
FREDDIE 
FREDDIE glances over at JOE BASTIN, who smiles at FREDDIE  while raising his GLASS. FREDDIE, nervously, smiles back,  raises his glass, ever careful not to bare his TEETH.  
JOHN REID notices this exchange between the two men - and  it appears to trouble him... 
JOHN REID 
I hope you don’t mind but I need  
you to know something.  
(beat) 
I’m gay. 
FREDDIE just stares at John, and says nothing. 
Really?  
FREDDIE 
FREDDIE looks at his friends, anxiously: Do they know about  him also?  
FREDDIE 
Have you told the others?  
JOHN REID 
I think they know.  
(pointedly) 
People generally do.  
REACTION FREDDIE: Concern - has JOHN REID detected his true  nature?  
47.
INT. FREDDIE’S FIRST FLAT/ LONDON - NIGHT 
Fred gives MARY a PRESENT.  
What is it?  
MARY 
FREDDIE 
Go on, open it up!  
MARY opens the box and inside is another box. She opens  this second box only to discover, inside, a third...and so  on...  
Oh no.  
MARY 
FREDDIE 
Getting smaller and smaller, I’m  afraid. Shrinking and shrinking,  sorry sweetie. 
What is it? 
MARY 
FREDDIE 
Well it can’t be very big!  
(watching her) 
Be more fun if the boxes got bigger  
and bigger, wouldn’t it and you end  
up with a car or something. 
Finally MARY takes out a RING-BOX, and opens it. Inside is  a RING. She stares at him - stunned.  
Well? 
Which hand?  
FREDDIE MARY 
FREDDIE 
Left hand, fourth finger.  
Her heart stops.  
FREDDIE 
Your turn to say something.  
(moved) 
MARY 
Yes. Of course.  
(CONTINUED) 
48.
CONTINUED: 
They kiss.  
FREDDIE 
That’s alright then. Isn’t it? 
She nods, moved, looking at her RING. FREDDIE watches her,  warmly - but conflicted.  
EXT. ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY 
CHICKENS and COWS cross the FARMYARD. A working DAIRY FARM.  
ANGLE ON: QUEEN, standing with their gear, at the gates, in  the mud, uncertain if this was a good idea.  
ROGER 
Nice recording studio. 
JOHN 
Evidently the cheapest EMI could find. 
BRIAN 
The idea was to get away from all  
distractions.  
FREDDIE 
You forgot cow shit and roosters  
at dawn. 
The FARMER comes out to greet them.  
FARMER 
“Queen” I presume?! Welcome! Shall  
we get you settled in then?  
The BAND cross the YARD. FREDDIE, playfully, chases a  CHICKEN that SQUARKS and FLAPS away.  
FARMER 
Only two of the rooms have windows! 
This makes BRIAN and JOHN dash indoors to grab them -  leaving FREDDIE and ROGER the last to enter the FARMHOUSE.  
ROGER 
Engaged? Congratulations’n all that.  
Ra Ra, very cool. 
FREDDIE 
Surreal you mean. You and Dominique?  
(CONTINUED) 
49.

ROGER 
(cautionary) 
Ah ah ah ah! Every man, in their own  
time, in their own way. 
WIDE SHOT of the YARD. 
MATCH DISSOLVE TO: 
THE YARD - LATER. ROGER now CHATS-UP a FARM-GIRL (who  holds an URN of MILK) as the sound of BRIAN’s GUITAR  (playing ROCK CHORDS - not yet a memorable riff) emanates  from the open windows.  
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
BLOGGER 
Was there creative conflict? During  
those sessions? 
OLDER BRIAN 
Conflict? No, I don’t think so. No. 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO /ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY 
FREDDIE, ROGER, BRIAN and JOHN are shouting at the same  time - ROGER’s VOICE breaks through.  
ROGER 
I put my heart and soul into this  
song and you don’t like it because  
you want your songs on the album  
and your royalties as writers--  
that’s why you don’t like it!!! 
FREDDIE 
For God’s sake. It’s not that, Roger  
dear -  
ROGER 
OH REALLY?! THEN WHAT IS IT?!  
Only BRIAN is brave enough to say it -  
BRIAN 
(picking up the lyric  
sheet) 
“I’m In Love With My Car”? It’s not  
strong enough.  
(CONTINUED) 
50.
CONTINUED: 
ROGER 
Not strong enough?  
BRIAN 
No. John? Fred? Is it strong enough?  
If I’m on my own here... 
JOHN and FRED prefer not to say... 
ROGER 
How fucking dare you! Oh! How does  
your song go? “You call me  
sweet...like I'm some kind of cheese”  
Fucken Yeats! But did you hear me  
(criticizing) -  
BRIAN 
(No, but you -) No, but you made it  
very clear! Playing your drums out  
of time! 
ROGER 
I never play out of time!  
I can’t play out of time! 
BRIAN 
Way out of time, smashing your high hat -  
ROGER 
Sometimes I could fucking murder you  
May! 
FREDDIE 
Let’s be honest--we could all  
fucking murder each other! (So let’s  
just -)  
BRIAN 
You know why you’re angry? Because  
you know your song isn’t strong  
enough!  
JOHN knows BRIAN has gone too far. FREDDIE too, winces,  anticipating what is to come... 
ROGER looks at BRIAN - then GOES to a SHELF holding  CASSETTE TAPES. He pulls it over - CRASH! 
ROGER 
Is that strong enough?!  
ROGER then PUSHES over his DRUM-SET - CRASH! 
(CONTINUED) 
51.
CONTINUED: (2) 
ROGER 
That strong enough?! 
ROGER then picks up the COFFEE MACHINE...the BAND react as  one: 
BRIAN/JOHN/FREDDIE/ROY 
NOT THE COFFEE MACHINE! 
ROGER stares at them, the COFFEE MACHINE held aloft.  
Fuck this.  
FREDDIE walks out... 
FREDDIE 
INT. TACK-ROOM/ ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY 
FREDDIE wanders in to the RIDING-GEAR STORAGE ROOM and  sees, to his surprise, behind HAY BALES, an OLD PIANO. He  moves the top BALE aside and uses the remaining one as a  PIANO STOOL. He tests the keys - a little out of tune in  the uppermost keys... 
Oh dear.  
FREDDIE 
IN FRUSTRATION, he bangs out a few dumb cords and then  stops - thinks a moment - what shall he play? He sighs,  alone in this little shed, letting all the TENSION out of  himself, trying to rid himself off all the shit that is  weighing him down... 
FREDDIE 
(to himself) 
Come on Freddie... 
He flexes his FINGERS, looks at the keys and then sets his  FINGERS on the keys...trying to recall an old half-written  piece...the opening “MAMA” part from BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY... 
FREDDIE 
How does it go?  
(plays a few notes) 
...it goes it goes it goes... 
He remembers, and plays the opening bars beautifully on the  BROKEN PIANO. Pausing again - he recalls the lyrics...then plays again, but singing now, clear, high, clean,  emotional... 
(CONTINUED) 
52.
CONTINUED: 
FREDDIE 
“Mama...I just killed a man - “ 
He pauses, reflecting, with strong emotion, on the meaning  of this line... 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
(singing) 
OLDER BRIAN 
- “Put a gun against his head,  pulled my trigger now he’s dead.” (beat) 
Just like that. He’d started it years  before. You see-  
(leaning forward) 
- he wasn’t ready to finish it then.  He hadn’t been ready to own up to  what the song needed to say. 
BLOGGER 
And did it say? What did the song say? 
(smirks) 
Listen to it! 
OLDER BRIAN 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY 
FREDDIE plays the song for the BAND on a WHITE GRAND  PIANO...

FREDDIE 
“Mama, life has just begun and now  
I’ve gone and thrown it all away.  
JOHN comes in softly with his BASS part... 
FREDDIE 
“Mama, oooooooh, Didn't mean to make  
you cry, 
If I'm not back again this time  
tomorrow, 
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing  
really matters. 
ROGER now comes in, softly, beautifully, on the drums...  (CONTINUED)

What truth? It’s obvious... 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO /ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY 
FREDDIE 
“Mama, oooooooh, I don't wanna die, 
I sometimes wish I'd never been  
born at all. 
FREDDIE plays a few more notes and then stops -  
BRIAN 
What happens then?  
FREDDIE stops, turns, looks at BRIAN. 
FREDDIE 
I think that’s where the Opera bit  
comes in.  
BRIAN looks at ROGER and JOHN.  
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
The Opera bit! Yes, the Opera Bit!  
BRIAN goes to the PIANO, throws open the lid and starts to  play the chords of the OPERA BIT...  
OLDER BRIAN 
No rock song had so thoroughly changed  
its very nature midway through, as if-- 
as if the passion of the sentiment  
couldn’t be contained by the existing  
form and everything had to be  
exploded. It shouldn’t have worked,  
and yet--it was sublime. 
54.
INT. RECORDING STUDIO /ROCKFIELD FARM - DAY 
With a CLUNK the 24-TRACK RECORDING TAPING MACHINE starts  to RECORD. At the MIXING DESK -

Sorry!  
FREDDIE ROGER

Bit too fast, Fred. It’s okay,  
it’s just a wee bit too fast.

JOHN 
So, tomorrow--we start on the vocals? 
FREDDIE 
Don’t worry my dears, it’s all in

ROGER 
It’s not exactly “Killer Queen”. EMI’s  
gonna have a fucking heart-attack-- 
half the album’s gonna be one song.  
FREDDIE 
Serves ‘em right--for telling  
artistes to repeat themselves!

Freddie wants to do a few more  
overdubs. Gotta tell ya, the tape is  
wearing out, can’t take much more. 
The ENGINEER holds up the TAPE - almost TRANSPARENT! 
FREDDIE 
But it’s sounding colossal. A few  
more. Let’s do it!

JOHN REID 
It’s a great album, Roy.

FINANCIAL OFFICER 
- is the most expensive album ever  
made. That’s official.  
RAY FOSTER 
And as for Bohemian -  
Rhapsody -  
JOE BASTIN RAY FOSTER 
What is that? It goes on forever - six  minutes! Six minutes?  
FREDDIE 
I pity your wife if you think six  minutes is forever. It’s a rhapsody.  
FINANCIAL OFFICER  
It’s a travesty.  
FREDDIE 
We want to release it as our single. 
RAY FOSTER 
Well, that’s not possible. Anything  over 3 minutes the radio stations  won’t program it. And what on earth is  it about anyway? Scaramouche, Gallileo 
- Figaro -  
FINANCIAL OFFICER 1 RAY FOSTER 
And all that “ISSMILLER” business-- ”ISHMILLER” -  
Bismillah. 
FREDDIE

ROGER, BRIAN and JOHN look at FREDDIE - SILENCE. FREDDIE  shrugs -  
FREDDIE 
(obfuscating) 
It’s nonsense. Doesn’t mean anything.  
This does little to appease FOSTER - and then -  
JOHN REID 
Actually, I agree. We do need the  
BBC and their format is 3 minutes  
tops. I have to agree with Roy.  
FREDDIE looks at JOHN REID, furious - gives his ‘Et Tu  Brute’ look. ROGER and BRIAN and JOHN also stare at JOHN  REID, outraged. 
JOHN REID 
I think the single is--”Love Of My  
Life.” It’s slow, but it’s strong. 
JOHN REID looks back at FREDDIE and holds up his hands -  
JOHN REID 
My job is to turn things around for  
you. “Love of my Life”.  
RAY FOSTER 
Play that one again. Let’s hear that  
one again...

No. Bohemian Rhapsody.  
Bo-Rap.

Then let’s promote Bo-Rap ourselves.  
Go on TV, play it live.  
JOHN 
Without the multi-tracking it’ll sound  
crap. Gotta sound huge, or not at all.  
ROGER 
Okay. Alright, then let’s film it  
ourselves, mime it to the recorded  
track, and give the film to TV to  
play.  
BRIAN and JOHN and FREDDIE stare at ROGER, who nods and  raises his pint -  
BRIAN 
Can we do that?  
JOHN 
Be expensive to film something.  
How much?

call it that?  
KENNY 
Queen--you’re a very shy bunch,  
really, aren’t you?

The BBC won’t play it, so EMI  
won’t release it. 
KENNY 
Rotten dogs. Why not? 
FREDDIE 
It’s 6 minutes long. 
KENNY looks out the STUDIO WINDOW to his PRODUCERS in next  room, then scrunches up his face like a naughty school-boy,  and HIDES the ‘45’ under his JACKET.  
KENNY 
Ooooooooooohhhh! 
CUT TO: 
KENNY EVERETT’s PRODUCERS, furious now, BEAT on the WINDOW,  before trying to rattle open the door which is locked.  
KENNY 
And that was “Bohemian Rhapsody”  
for the--what was it?--the 13th time 
to-day? Gee wizz, we just lurve that  
little song here at Captial Radio. In  
fact, we love it so much, how ‘bout  
we pppplay it again! 
The PRODUCER, outside, shakes his head, issuing a FINAL  WARNING, but KENNY raises his INDEX FINGER HIGH and then  theatrically drops it on the PLAY BUTTON. “BO-RAP” starts  again...  
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE the BOOTH... 
FREDDIE 
Tried to stop him from playing it.  
So many times! Tse! 
The PRODUCERS turn and see FREDDIE standing right behind  them, talking to PAUL PRENTER, both looking in at KENNY. 
FREDDIE 
(to PRENTER) 
Just wouldn’t listen. Must be a  
nightmare to work with. 
(CONTINUED) 
66.
CONTINUED: (2) 
FREDDIE grins, covering buck-teeth with hand, then walks  off down the long RADIO STATION HALLWAY with PRENTER (who  share a low-key HI-FIVE), as the PRODUCERS watch... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
With this one album, we became one  
of the biggest bands in the world.  
And that one song? It was the most  
expensive song ever made, at the  
time--and it didn’t win a Grammy -  
that went to... 
CUT TO: 
VIDEO EXCERPT: “CHICAGO” (1976) playing “IF YOU LEAVE ME  NOW”...a low-wattage song and performance... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
...something more deserving. Hell,  
Hendrix, Bob Marley, The Who, and Led  
Zeppelin never won a Grammy either!  
But Bohemian Rhapsody did become the  
third biggest-selling song of all  
time--and is routinely voted the  
greatest song of all time...so... 
in your face Chicago!  
EXT. HYDE PARK CONCERT (1976) - SUNSET 
A VAST CROWD awaits QUEEN’s arrival on-stage, CLAPPING, in  HIGH EXCITEMENT -  
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
Overnight, we were loved. We wanted  
to repay the fans--with a free  
concert...We played Hyde Park to  
150,000 people.  
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
BLOGGER 
What was that like? To walk out on  
stage in front of so many people?  
OLDER BRIAN 
What was it like? It was...  
67.
I/E. HYDE PARK STAGE - SUNSET 
The BAND make their way to the STAGE, and as they do so,  the CLAMOR of the VAST AUDIENCE actually FADES to SILENCE,  to total SILENCE... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
...like nothing else. Energy like you  
couldn’t believe-- 
SOUNDLESSLY the band makes their way onto the stage, the  CAMERA trailing them, until the CAMERA reveals what the  band see as they step on-stage -  
- MASSED HUMANITY! But silent -  
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
A tidal wave of sound, but more than  
that. Of approval. Approbation.  
Validation. A rush of joy. Love!  
Filling your soul and washing away  
your worries, fears, pain, making you  
into something you never dreamed you  
could be.  
EXT. STAGE/ HYDE PARK - DAY 
REACTION FREDDIE, ROGER, JOHN, and lastly BRIAN - Awe struck by a sound we can’t hear - CUT-AWAYS of members of  the wildly gesturing (but SOUNDTRACK-MUTED) CROWD... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
When we went over our allotted time?  
The police shut us down but no-one  
would go home. 150,000 people stayed. 
We were suddenly the biggest band in  
the world. Well, we sold tickets  
faster than anyone. We toured like  
people possessed... 
EXT. SANTA MONICA CIVIC AUDITORIUM/ 1976 US TOUR - NIGHT BAND plays “TIE YOUR MOTHER DOWN” 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
America. 32 dates coast to coast.  
68.
EXT. JAPAN TOUR/ 1976 - NIGHT 
FREDDIE engages the crowd with his “DAY-O” ROUTINE.... 
FREDDIE 
Dayyyy---OOOOO! 
JAPANESE CROWD 
Dayyyy---OOOOO! 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
Japan. Australia. UK.  
EXT. ARGENTINA TOUR/ BUENOS AIRES/ 1981 - DAY 
Police motorcycles lead a TANK down the CROWD-LINED street  of BUENOS AIRES, with the motorcycles crisscrossing to keep  civilians and cars away from the tank.  
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
Then came South America. No one  
had ever played that part of the  
globe-- but Freddie... 
Appearing out the TOP of the TANK, FREDDIE MERCURY, waving  a ARGENTINIAN FLAG... 
FREDDIE 
(to his band-mates  
below) 
Isn’t this fun, darlings?!  
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
...Freddie realised that after the  
World Cup there might be some nice  
little stadiums not being used by  
anyone.  
EXT. STAGE/ SAO PAOLO/ 1981 - NIGHT 
FREDDIE walks out on-stage to a FOOTBALL STADIUM AUDIENCE  of 58,000 (nearly all of whom waving LIT LIGHTERS!) He  waves to this TWINKLING GALAXY of PEOPLE...  
There were.  
CUT TO: 
(CONTINUED) 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
69.
CONTINUED: 
Onstage, FREDDIE has his eyes closed, as if PRAYING, as -  58,000 Brazilians sing “LOVE OF MY LIFE”! A tremendously  moving - almost holy - experience for him.  
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
58,000 people. Most couldn’t  
speak English but they could 
sing Freddie’s song. 
When FREDDIE opens his eyes - he has TEARS in them.  CUT TO: 
BRIAN, on-stage alone, starts an extended GUITAR SOLO, as  FREDDIE jogs from the stage... 
CUT TO: 
...Backstage - FREDDIE quickly changes into a new costume,  with the help of PAUL PRENTER, as BRIAN’s SOLO continues.  ROGER drains a cup of water... 
FREDDIE 
How long has Brian been going? 
ROGER 
Ahh--’bout five minutes so far. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN, eyes closed, remembering, smiling, plays the  RED SPECIAL GUITAR (unplugged) - as we hear him reproduce  the virtuosic lead-break (mutely) on the un-amplified strings...  
EXT. STAGE/ SAO PAOLO/ 1981 - DAY 
...BRIAN, on-stage, alone, at full volume again, still  cutting loose on the RED SPECIAL -  
CUT TO: 
FREDDIE, now slouched in a chair, in his new costume and  waiting to go back on, but awaiting the end of BRIAN’s  SOLO. PAUL PRENTER checks his watch -  
FREDDIE 
(to PRENTER) 
Fuck it, let’s go shopping.  
(CONTINUED) 
70.
CONTINUED: 
PAUL PRENTER 
This is ridiculous. 
Just then the STAGE MANAGER enters -  
STAGE-MANAGER 
Freddie, Roger - it’s ending.  
FREDDIE and ROGER stalk back on-stage, to a roar from the  CROWD.  
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLDER BRIAN 
And the parties?! 
(pause) 
Well--I was a married man...  
INT. FANCY DRESS PARTY/ BALLROOM (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT 
A BACCHANALIAN REVEL straight from the imagination of  FELLINI - we see the FUN of being one of the biggest bands  in the world... 
OLDER BRIAN (V.O.) 
But there were temptations... 
MONTAGE A (NEW ORLEANS PARTY): of - 
A) BRIAN on the BALCONY, surveys, from above the hotel  ballroom, made up to resemble labyrinthine jungle swamps,  swarming with -  
B) Naked dancers, cavorting in bamboo cages suspended from  ballroom ceilings.  
C) Magicians 
D) Zulu tribesmen 
E) Contortionists 
F) Fire-eaters 
G) FREDDIE, dressed in an outrageous costume, greets  (loving) GUESTS and hands out GIFTS as they arrive. Helping  him to hand out gifts is PAUL PRENTER...  
PAUL PRENTER 
From Freddie, just a little something.  
(CONTINUED) 
71.
CONTINUED: 
The GUESTS OOOHHH and AHHHH as they open their GIFTS -  WRIST-WATCHES for the MEN, JEWELRY for the WOMEN.  
H) JOHN and his WIFE are served champagne by naked waiters  and waitresses who carry their tips in their bodily  crevices. 
I) Nude models of both sexes wrestle in huge baths of  shimmering, uncooked liver.  
J) QUEEN’s “BICYCLE RACE” VIDEO (with nude girls on bikes)  is projected on to a screen. 
K) FREDDIE signs his AUTOGRAPH on the BUTT of a GLAM FEMALE  FAN, who has hoisted up her BALL-GOWN and pulled low her  KNICKERS. PAUL PRENTER roars with laughter.  
L) HERMAPHRODITE DWARVES deliver COKE on TRAYS strapped to  their heads...PAUL PRENTER directs one of the DWARVES in  the direction of - FREDDIE.  
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
BLOGGER 
I heard the “Dwarves with trays of  
coke on their heads” didn’t actually  
happen? So it’s true! 
OLDER BRIAN 
It’s hard to know what to believe  
sometimes, even when you were there. 
The BLOGGER is confused - so did it happen, or not? MONTAGE B (NEW ORLEANS PARTY): of - 
M) A dwarf lies on a table beneath cold cuts of meat - he  jiggles when a slice is removed. This causes a FEMALE DINER  to scream with SURPRISE.  
N) ROGER entertains 3 ATTRACTIVE WOMEN. 
O) BRIAN watches the entire scene from the BALCONY, while  being interviewed by a JAPANESE BLOGGER... 
BRIAN 
It’s so nice to have a quiet  
night for a change. 
He then looks down upon the world the band created.  (CONTINUED) 
72.
CONTINUED: 
P) FREDDIE, climbs onto a BALCONY and prepares to DIVE on  to a CHANDELIER.  
The CROWD shouts to FREDDIE, trying to stop him, but  FREDDIE isn’t listening. He dives toward a CHANDELIER. He  makes it! But the CHANDELIER collapses under his weight,  and the whole thing - and FREDDIE - drops onto a CAKE TABLE, softening his fall. CRASH! 
The CAMERA descends on the supine FREDDIE, over -  
OLD BRIAN (V.O.) 
Everything changed--so why wouldn’t  
we? How could we not? It was a dream  
come true. The world seemed to be  
unanimously saying to each of us -  
“Genius!” How could we resist such a  
verdict? We were kids!  
FREDDIE, lying there, winces in pain - as JOHN DEACON comes  to his rescue, helping him up...  
FREDDIE 
Couldn’t resist--always wanted to  
swing on a chandelier. 
INT. BRIAN MAY’S RECORDING STUDIO (2016) - NIGHT 
OLD BRIAN 
But--the pressure! The expectation, 
night after night, that comes with  
such fame? That, we were not prepared  
for.  
EXT. STAGE/ HYDE PARK CONCERT - NIGHT 
The BAND at full tilt, playing the climactic CHORD/NOTE of  a big song - FREDDIE dancing, SWEAT POURING OFF HIM, the  BAND playing at double speed, sustaining the tension of the  last chord, bathed in SWEAT also, faster, faster, faster -  the vast audience climactic too...  
(INTERCUT with - ) 
MONTAGE (GLOBAL AUDIENCES) 
A) US AUDIENCE ecstatic (QUEEN in a different costume) 
B) JAPANESE AUDIENCE ecstatic (QUEEN in a different  costume) 
(CONTINUED) 
73.

C) BRAZILIAN AUDIENCE ecstatic (QUEEN in a different  costume) 
D) LONDON (HYDE PARK) AUDIENCE ecstatic (QUEEN back in the  original Hyde Park costume)  
INT. DRESSING ROOM/ BACKSTAGE/ HYDE PARK CONCERT - NIGHT 
Silence. FREDDIE and BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN collapse side by side on TWO COUCHES after the concert. ALL are bathed in  sweat, utterly drained of energy. JOHN REID nods at JIM  BEACH, the band’s lawyer, who -  
- herds everyone else, including himself, out of the room -  except for one - PAUL PRENTER.  
JOHN REID 
Very important gig for us. 
ROGER 
Almost as important as tomorrow  
night’s, and the night after that -  
JOHN 
- and the night after week after month  
after that.  
JOHN REID 
Excuse me--where does it say it would  
be easy?  
(beat) 
Your four cars are waiting outside for  
you. 
BRIAN 
Why four cars?  
JOHN REID 
From now on, you each have separate  
cars and drivers.  
FREDDIE 
My voice is cracking up. I’m a  
baritone pretending to be a soprano.  
I need to rest my voice.  
JOHN REID 
What you need is to stop burning the  
candles at both ends.  
(CONTINUED) 
74.
CONTINUED: 
FREDDIE 
But the glow from both ends is so  
divine.  
JOHN REID 
Get showered everyone. Get something  
to eat. Back to the hotel. Sleep. See  
you on plane at 6 am. Don’t get high,  
don’t get drunk, you have a photo shoot at 9 in Berlin, interviews all  
day, arena sound-check at 5, show at  
8. Your next day off?  
(looks at his watch) 
November.  
JOHN REID exits, as PAUL PRENTER clocks the tension.  
ROGER 
I’m beginning to hate him. 
FREDDIE covers his face with his hands - he’s really bone  tired, exhausted...then emerges, melancholic... 
PAUL PRENTER 
(to FREDDIE) 
I’ll run your bath.  
PRENTER exits.  
FREDDIE’s POV of: his friends...  
FREDDIE 
If I ever get lost, come and find me,  
would you? 
ROGER 
What are you on about? 
Really lost.  Course.  
FREDDIE BRIAN 
FREDDIE 
(intensely) 
Promise me. 
BRIAN 
Sure Fred. You got it.  
Yeah.  
ROGER 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
No problem.  
75.
JOHN 
FREDDIE pulls off his top and grabs a towel, going to take  a shower... 
FREDDIE 
My throat, it’s like a vulture’s  
crotch. 
ROGER and JOHN and BRIAN share a concerned look. 
INT. LIMO - NIGHT 
FREDDIE and JOHN REID ride in the backseat -  
JOHN REID 
Listen to me now. You’ve seen what  
I’ve done for Elton. 4% of all records  
purchased last year? In the world?  
Elton John. Who is his band? Do we  
care? I’m just saying, if you went-- 
solo--Freddie Mercury--I guarantee you  
could do even better. Guarantee it. 
FREDDIE 
You’re seriously asking me--to break  
up the band? 
JOHN REID 
I’m telling you what awaits you if  
you go solo.  
FREDDIE 
You’ve seen what happens when we work  
together?  
JOHN REID 
I’ve seen what you do for them. 
FREDDIE stares at JOHN REID, until -  
FREDDIE 
OK. I’ll go solo. 
Yeah? Yeah. 
JOHN REID FREDDIE 
(CONTINUED) 
76.
CONTINUED: 
JOHN REID 
Yes! Alright! I am so relieved.  
JOHN offers his hand and FREDDIE shakes it - emotional,  knowing what is coming next... 
JOHN REID 
Coz I have been having such huge  
problems with that band...I don’t know  
how you’ve put up with it.  
FREDDIE 
(to the driver) 
Pull over. Pull over.  
The LIMO stops. FREDDIE leans over and opens REID’s door -  
FREDDIE 
Get out. Out. Get out, it’s over.  
You’re fired John. You’re gone.  
JOHN REID 
What are you talking about “fired”? 
FREDDIE 
Get out of the car. Get out of the  
car! GET OUT! 
Freddie!  
JOHN REID 
FREDDIE pushes JOHN REID out and then uses his FEET -  
OUT! OUT! 
EXT. LIMO - NIGHT 
FREDDIE 
REID is kicked out of the LIMO by FREDDIE, who then slams  the door, before the LIMO pulls away.  
FREDDIE!  
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
JOHN REID 
FREDDIE and MARY and BRIAN and ROGER and JOHN and PAUL  PRENTER and JOE BASTIN and JIM BEACH are having DINNER in a  fine-dining restaurant. WAITERS hover around their star  guest, as FREDDIE speaks -  
(CONTINUED) 
77.
CONTINUED: 
FREDDIE 
We’ll manage ourselves from now on.  
Mr Beach here, you’ll take care of  
the rest, won’t you dear?  
Me?  
JIM BEACH FREDDIE 
“Miami” New name for you. You ever  looked after a band before, Miami?  Points deducted for hesitation. 
No.  
JIM BEACH FREDDIE 
All in favour of Miami here looking  
after us from now on?  
JOHN and ROGER and BRIAN all nod.  
FREDDIE 
This is fun. Who else can we hire or  fire?  
FREDDIE looks at JOE BASTIN -  
What?  
JOE BASTIN FREDDIE 
Bohemian Rhapsody was “too long”, it  
would “never work as a single”. 
JOE BASTIN 
My sincerest apologies. 
FREDDIE 
Funny--apologies take so long,  
but criticism arrives just like that! 
JOE BASTIN 
But! I still think “Love Of My Life”  
would have been the better choice! 
Over laughter, FREDDIE picks up a bottle, as if to strike  JOE -  
JOE BASTIN 
Just kidding! Just kidding!  
(CONTINUED) 
78.
CONTINUED: (2) 
Under the table JOE pats FREDDIE’s LEG as he grins at the  others -  
JOE BASTIN 
We’re all here for you, Freddie. 
FREDDIE reacts to the tap on the knee and the look in JOE  BASTIN’s eyes like an ELECTRIC SHOCK. Did BASTIN just make  a pass at him?  
MARY observes this - and feels left out.  
PAUL PRENTER 
Tell us about your childhood? 
FREDDIE 
(shakes his head) 
Uh uh uh uh. The future? (pointing) 
It’s that way! Fuck today, it’s  
tomorrow already. 
JIM BEACH 
Such an enigma. 
FREDDIE 
Oh I hope so. True stardom is the  
absence of detail. 
But the clues are all in my songs.  
They’re all...  
FREDDIE eyes go back to JOE BASTIN, who is talking now with  PAUL PRENTER... 
...in my... 
FREDDIE 
As FREDDIE watches BASTIN - MARY notices. When FREDDIE,  embarrassed, turns back to looks at her, he kisses her on  the cheek and TAPS her on the leg in the exact same way  BASTIN just did to him.  
Noticing all this, is ROGER, who looks between FREDDIE,  MARY and JOE BASTIN, even while chatting up a BRUNETTE  BEAUTY.  
INT. PARTY - NIGHT 
FREDDIE and JOE BASTIN are talking. FREDDIE seems nervous,  shy. JOE BASTIN then kisses FREDDIE on the CHEEK. JOE  BASTIN then walks off, into the crowd, as - FREDDIE is  joined by MARY and PAUL PRENTER, who carries drinks.  
(CONTINUED) 
79.
CONTINUED: 
PAUL PRENTER 
Here we go. And - Freddie?--just want  
to thank you.  
But FREDDIE’s mind is only on JOE BASTIN -  
PAUL PRENTER 
For keeping me on, you know?--I will  
live and die for you, man. Want you to  
know that. Freddie? 
FREDDIE 
Be back in a second. Paul, look  
after Mary, would you?  
FREDDIE pushes through the crowd, going after BASTIN, and  is gone.  
MARY and PRENTER, who don’t like each other, are stranded  there, with their preposterous drinks.  
REACTION, MARY: Anxious. Knows something is going on. She  sips her drink and then looks at PAUL...He smiles weakly at  her, INSINCERELY... 
Pretty dress. (beat) 
PAUL PRENTER 
Make it yourself? 
MARY, insulted, stares at PAUL, her dislike confirmed. 
INT. FREDDIE & MARY’S FLAT/ LONDON - DAY 
MARY comes in with SHOPPING BAGS and a stack of BRIDAL  CATALOGUES. FREDDIE is sleeping off his hang-over. MARY is  still carrying anxiety, but trying to hide it.  
MARY 
Oh, not still in bed?! Come on. If  
you come in so late that’s your fault.  
Get up! 
She tugs at his COVERS. 
MARY 
Come on! I want your opinion on  
wedding dresses and venues--we have a  
choice of three. Freddie?! Freddie!  
We need to talk about the wedding!

Fuck Wolverine. 
First, he rides my coattails 
with the R rating. 
Then the hairy motherfucker 
ups the ante by dying. 
What a dick. 
Well, guess what, Wolvie? 
I'm dying in this one, too. 
To understand 
why I took a cat-nap 
on 1,200 gallons 
of high-test fuel... 
I need to take you back 
to the dewy slopes 
of six weeks ago. 
I'd gone international, 
taking out mass murderers, 
gangsters, 
unspeakable monsters. 
People nobody would touch. 
Except me. 
I'm gonna touch them all over. Hey, it's Gail calling. 
Love the shiny suit. 
Really brings out 
the sex trafficker in your eyes. I don't 
speak Cantonese, Mister... 
Well, I'm not even gonna 
attempt that. 
But I did take 
8th grade Spanish, so... 
Which literally translates to... I don't bargain, pumpkin fucker. Uno, dos, tres, cuatro... 
I'll take 
a cranberry-grapefruit vodka. 
I know it's called a Sea Breeze. Don't make me say it. 
Hit it, Dolly. 
Taking the hands out 
of the guns of the criminals! 
Whoo! Do not go in there! 
Page 2/61
Oh, God! Oh, God, time out! 
Time out! 
Cut. Got bad guy blood, 
right in my open eye. 
Oh, that's so gross. 
Fuck. 
Scoutmaster Kevin? 
Too exotic? 
My world tour brought me home 
to this guy, Sergei Valishnikov. But we'll get to him 
in a moment. 
'Cause I know 
what you're thinking. 
"I'm so glad 
I left the kiddos at home." 
But that's where you'd be wrong. That babysitter of yours 
is high as fuck right now... 
and, believe it or not, 
Deadpool 2 is a family film. 
True story. 
And every good family film 
starts with a vicious murder. 
Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7. 
Holy shit pickles! 
That guy's on fire. 
That's not CGI, folks. 
He's actually on fire. 
Yeah. You know I get paid 
to take out bad guys, right? 
But this guy? 
He was one of the worst of 'em. Hurry up and open 
this fucking door, 
and let's kill 
this motherfucker! 
Ugh. So gross. 
A panic room? Really? 
Can you come out? 
I really have to go. 
It's my anniversary. 
Over and over, 
I hear people say, 
Page 3/61
"I just don't have 
enough confidence." 
Listen, confidence is not 
something you have. 
It's something you create. 
And you can create it 
at any moment in time. 
A sense of confidence is nothing but a sense of power 
within yourself... 
a sense of certainty that 
you can pull something off. 
Start the car! 
Start the fucking car! 
Dopinder! 
Start the fucking car! 
- Whoo! 
- Oh, I shit my pants. 
Actually, that may have been me. Oh, mission accomplished? 
Well, in a George W. 
Sort of way. 
Fucker can't stay 
in a panic room forever. 
Oh, you're living 
the dreams, DP. 
It has been 
quite the run, Dopinder, 
and who'da thought? 
Now I'm talked about in the 
same sentence as Jesus. 
Passion of the Christ, then me. At least domestically. 
We beat them overseas, 
where there's no such thing 
as religion. 
I do want to live the dreams, 
Pool Boy. 
Taxiing is not as sexy 
as it looks. 
- I want to fill my... 
- Pockets? 
What's your poison? 
A little, uh, cokey cokey? 
Page 4/61
Can't maintain an erection 
without buying shoes online? 
I've never experienced 
that last one. 
Talk to me, Goose. 
I was going to say "soul". 
I want to fill my soul. 
I want to belong to something, like you, Pool, sir. 
- Dopinder... 
- Hmm? 
You never cease to surprise me. You know, the depth of 
your heart is extraordinary. 
We all need 
a sense of belonging. 
We all need 
a genuine sense of home. 
A place in this world. 
I want to become 
a contract killer. 
I'm sorry. What did you say? 
Remember when I kidnapped Bandhu and threatened him 
with great violence? 
You kind of killed him. 
And then remember the movie 
Interview with the Vampire? 
Don't want to. 
When Tom Cruise fed 
10-year-old Kirsten Dunst blood for the first time... 
and she looked up at his smooth, handsome face and said... 
"I want some more." 
Oh, Pool, picture me, 
a 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst. 
I'll never not picture that. 
But I can't wait 
to never speak of this, 
as soon as possible. 
We're here. 
You're my Tom Cruise! 
And you're my Kristen Dunst! 
Page 5/61
Kristen? Kirsten? 
Sorry I'm late. 
There was a bunch of 
handicapable children 
stuck in a tree... 
- and I had to, uh... 
- Uh-uh. 
You're right. 
I was fighting a caped badass. But then we discovered 
his mom is named Martha, too. 
No. 
Traffic? 
Hmm? 
Kiss me like you miss me, Red. Well, come here. 
I'm gonna shower 
and get out of this suit. 
Don't you want your surprise? 
Do I look like 
a patient burn victim? 
I got one for you, too. 
Happy anniversary, baby. 
Open, open, open. 
Skee-Ball token. 
Our first date. 
Yup. 
That's genuine, high-grade lead. I'll keep it forever. 
Thank you, baby. 
- Open yours. 
- All right, all right. 
Oh... 
That's just the most 
beautiful thing that I've... 
I don't know what this is. 
My IUD. 
A bomb? 
No, dick for brains. 
My birth control device. 
What, you mean that your... 
Baby factory's open 
for business. 
Oh, my God! 
Page 6/61
Oh, my God! I want a boy! 
Or a little girl! 
Definitely one or the other! 
Oh! And I want our kid 
to have only one name. 
Like Cher or Todd. 
You gotta pump a baby 
in me first, cowboy. 
Yes, I do. 
Let's watch some porn 
and show that bed who's boss. 
Let's do that. 
Papa... 
Can you hear me? 
Papa, can you see me? 
Does this song 
sound familiar to you? 
May. 
Connor, if it's a boy. 
May, if it's a girl. 
So weird. 
Family was always 
an F-word to me. 
My pile of shit father 
took off and bailed. 
I mean, it's not like I have 
a lot of strong role models 
to draw off of for Todd. 
Hey. Look at me. 
You are not your father. 
Besides... 
I will never, ever 
let our child be named Todd. 
But here's the thing, 
isn't that how it always works? Like in Star Wars, 
men are destined 
to become their father... 
and then have consensual sex 
with their sister? 
I think you missed 
big, big chunks of that movie. No, I'm pretty sure 
Luke nailed her. 
Page 7/61
Baby, that's Empire. 
The point is, kids... 
they give us a chance 
to be better than we are. 
Better than we used to be. 
You're a lot smarter 
than I look. 
I'm gonna go make dessert. 
You get the strap-on. 
Let's make a super baby. 
Pretty sure it doesn't work 
that way, but we can try. 
What about Krystal? 
But with a "K"? 
It's too stripper-y. 
Kevin with a "K"! 
No, too stripper-y, too. 
Uh, Earl! 
He's gonna go straight to jail if we name him Earl. 
What about Bruce? 
No. 
Get down. 
What? 
Baby? Baby? 
I'm okay. 
Thank God I didn't have to use the cream cheese spreader. 
Please. 
Please. Please. 
Baby, I'm so sorry. 
No! 
Papa, can you hear me? 
Is it just me, or does 
Do You Want to Build 
a Snowman? from Frozen... 
sound suspiciously like 
Papa, Can You Hear Me? 
From Yentl? 
Papa, can you hear me? 
And nobody fucking realizes it. Go home. You've been here 
for three days, okay? 
You smell like somebody shit 
Page 8/61
in a Civil War wound... 
after it had become gangrenous. They should've just 
amputated it. Why shit in it? 
Doesn't make any sense. 
I love Frozen. 
I loved her. I loved her 
like an ocean loves water. 
An ocean is water. 
More importantly, I liked her. I really liked her, you know? 
George Michael was right. 
I'm never 
gonna dance again. Fuck! 
He's dead, too. 
At least we still have Bowie. 
Yeah. We still have Bowie. 
I'm sorry. 
Shot after shot, 
it's not gonna change the fact that I think you're... 
Are you pissing? Are you 
urinating right now? 
You're making the face that 
you make when you urinate. 
- Is he pissing? 
- I'm on it! 
There you go, Dopinder. 
If you want to be 
a contract killer... 
you gotta handle a mop 
before you handle a gun. 
Although I don't 
quite understand 
how they are at all similar. 
Well, they both have handles. 
Now, leave me. 
Go home, Wade. 
I don't have a home, 
Weas, you know. I got a... 
Fuck! Okay, I'm fine. 
I'm fine. 
You know what "fine" 
stands for, Wade? 
Page 9/61
Fucked up, insecure, 
needy, and emotional. 
According to the... 
- Kubler-Ross. 
- Yeah. 
According to 
the Kubler-Ross model... 
denial is just one of 
the five stages of grief. 
Jesus Christ, Buck! 
No more speaking lines for you. "I'm thinking it over!" 
Motherfuck! 
Fuck! 
The hell you doin' here? 
Don't you know how to knock? 
I thought you saw me... 
with your ears. 
You're lucky I didn't 
shoot you in the... 
The wall? 
The refrigerator? 
I'm in so much pain. 
I heard the news, sweetie. 
I'm very sorry. I am. 
What am I gonna do, Al? 
Probably something terrible. 
Knowing you. 
It was my fault. 
I fucking did this. 
And all I wanna do 
is grab her and see her 
and tell her that I'm sorry, 
and I can't. 
She's gone. 
Sweetheart, can you speak up? 
It's a little hard to hear you with that pity dick 
in your mouth. 
Now, look, sugar. 
You need to just keep living. 
Thank you... 
Matthew McConaughey, 
your words are a treasure. 
Page 10/61
Listen to the pain. 
It's both history teacher 
and fortune teller. 
Pain teaches us 
who we are, Wade. 
Sometimes, it's so bad, 
we feel like we're dying. 
But we can't really live till 
we've died a little, can we? 
Wade? 
- Wade? 
- I'm right here, Althea. 
And that is 
the most beautiful thing 
I've ever heard. 
You're absolutely right. 
I'm about to do 
something terrible. 
There. All caught up. 
You can't really live 
until you've died a little. 
Let's test that theory, 
shall we? 
Baby factory's open 
for business. 
Your crazy matches my crazy. 
I will never, ever 
let our child be named Todd. 
Skee-Ball token. 
Happy International Women's Day. Listen, 
I've been thinking a lot. 
Really? 
About why 
we're so good together. 
I love you, Wade Wilson. 
Ness? 
Ness? 
Ness. 
Ness, there's something here. 
I can't get to you. 
Your heart's not 
in the right place. 
Wait, hold on. What? 
Page 11/61
Your heart's not 
in the right place. 
Wait. What do you mean 
my heart's not in the right 
place? What does it... 
I'm terribly sorry 
for your loss, Wade. 
You're broken. 
Oh, God. I know that voice. 
"Heart's in the right place." 
"Heart's in the right..." 
What does that mean? 
You've been sleep 
for three days. 
I took the liberty 
of dressing you. 
No shit. 
Why can't I fucking die? 
Take your mask off, Wade. 
We must talk. 
You need fresh start. 
With training, you can be X-Man. You're wasting your time, 
Shiny Jesus. 
I'm not X-Man material. 
Understatement of the year. 
Wade, Yukio. 
Yukio, Wade. 
What in the fuck knuckles 
is this? 
She's my girlfriend, 
you intolerant shit. 
Whoa! Pump the hate brakes, 
Fox & Friends. 
I'm just surprised 
anyone would date you. 
Especially Pinkie Pie 
from My Little Pony. 
I like this guy. 
Give him a chance. 
It's great seeing you like this. Yeah. 
Bye, Wade! 
Now, some ground rules 
Page 12/61
while under our roof. 
"Rule number one. No killing... "anyone ever, no matter how bad. "Rule two. Label everything 
in refrigerator." 
Wade? 
Wade? 
Wade! 
Don't try to chase me. 
I'm not ready 
to be touched again. 
All these elderly white men 
on the walls... 
Should have brought 
my rape whistle. 
Hi. 
Those were already damaged 
after they fell there! 
What am I supposed 
to do around here, anyway? 
Sit in a share circle, 
talk about my feelings? 
And how would I do that exactly? 'Cause where the fuck 
is everyone? 
It's always just you 
and Negasonic Teenage 
Longest Name Ever... 
Enough! 
I said no touching! 
What the fuck? 
You'd think the studio 
would throw us a bone. 
They can't just dust off 
one of the famous X-Men? 
How 'bout that putz 
with the giant pigeon wings? 
What do those do anyway, huh? 
Carry him 
three feet off the ground 
to snatch up 
the nearest muffin crumb? 
No, no, no! 
I am not X-Man material at all. Page 13/61
First off... 
I'm not even a virgin. 
Second and more... 
I should have left you 
in the self-pitying mess 
I found you in. 
But this is what friends do. 
They show up! 
Not when convenient or easy. 
When hard, 
and you always make it hard. 
You are unwell. 
I'm sticking my neck out 
bringing you here. 
Wait. One of the assholes 
who killed Vanessa got away. 
Oh, Jesus Christ! 
Wade, whoever they are... 
we track them down 
and bring them to justice. 
It was me. 
I'm the asshole who got away. 
I killed every last one 
of them, except me. 
Couldn't kill me. 
We were gonna start a family. 
We were, uh... 
We were gonna be a family. 
Wade... 
Vanessa is gone. 
She's not coming back. 
This may not be 
family you want... 
but it's family you need. 
You have a good heart. 
It belongs here 
where it can grow. 
What did you say? 
About my heart? 
I think I'm in the right place. Wade. 
Wade! 
Hey, I was just taking Cerebro for a spin here... 
Page 14/61
looking deep into the future. 
Phew. This thing... 
- That's not how Cerebro works. - That's not how Cerebro works. Yes. Yes, it is. 
- We have mission. 
- We have mission. 
We do. You do. 
You guys be safe out there. 
- No, I want you to join. 
- No, you want me to join. 
I'm sorry, what? 
You are ready. 
That's a terrible idea, 
and it's gonna end badly. 
You wanna know how I know? 
I'll give you a hint. 
It's on my head 
and smells like Patrick Stewart. Be at the X-Jet in five. 
Irene Merryweather, WHIT News. Live here 
at a breaking news situation 
at the Essex House 
for Mutant Rehabilitation. 
A mutant boy 
is appearing to have 
some sort of an incident... 
- with police here behind me. 
- Get away from me! 
There are two police vehicles 
that are overturned. 
- There are open fires. 
- Fuck off! Stay back! 
A scene of absolute chaos here. Calm down. 
I'll burn you! You stay back! 
Get away from me! 
You wanna fucking die? 
And it appears as if the X-Men are arriving... 
Scatter! 
With what appears 
to be a trainee. 
Page 15/61
Everyone, calm down! 
The pros are here. I... 
We're the X-Men! 
A dated metaphor for racism 
in the '60s. 
So, respect. 
At ease, Officer. 
What are you doing? 
My job! 
You're the one who said 
I was ready, 
and I frankly disagreed 
with you. 
But here we are, trying to 
overcome our differences. 
Like Beyonce says, "Please... 
"Please, stop cheating on me." Hey! 
This is the fifth incident. 
This kid needs to be 
in the Ice Box, not here. 
Russell belongs in our care. 
Not in prison. I assure you... we have everything 
under control. 
Stay back! I'll burn you! 
Not getting a real 
"under control" 
vibe here, Marty. 
- It is Glen, isn't it? 
- Daniel. 
I'll ask the questions. 
Let me talk to the kid. 
You stay here with your weird, secret sex lips. 
You wanna die? 
This kid's adorable. 
I don't know why I packed 
the hollow points. 
I'll burn your balls off! 
First day. I'm so nervous! 
Did you just say 
"hollow points"? 
Yeah, probably should've 
Page 16/61
brought a Super Soaker. 
Hi, there! 
Stay back or Justin Bieber dies! Justin Bieber. 
He called you Justin Bieber. 
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait! 
Okay, let's not do 
whatever that is. 
Okay? Let's just talk! 
It's Russell, right? 
- Firefist. 
- Firefist. 
Ooh, that's a great name. 
Where does it burn? 
Just the fist, or all the 
way up to the elbow? 
Definitely 
all the way up to the elbow. 
Come quietly, 
or there will be trouble. 
- You stole that from Robocop! - That's from Robocop! 
Just stand down! 
You're embarrassing me. 
Look, Fire... 
Oh, my God! I can't say it! 
I'm so sorry! 
Oh, shit! That fucking does it! Put your hands behind your knees and get down on your head! Now! Wade! What was first rule? 
Label everything 
in the refrigerator! 
- Do not escalate! 
- Rules are meant to be broken! That's the exact opposite 
of what they're meant for! 
Fuck! Fine! 
I'll start from the beginning. My name is Deadpool, 
and I'm an X-Man. 
- Trainee! 
- Shut it! 
Look, I get it. 
Page 17/61
All right, you're scared. 
Alone. 
You got no family. 
I didn't have a family, either. You live in this dump. 
Guess what? 
I used to live 
in a shithole just like it. 
But you know something? 
To make matters worse... 
it's a confusing time 
in your life right now. 
Your body is going through 
some fiery changes. 
Too far? 
I went too far, didn't I? 
That was effervescent. 
Stay in school, kid. 
Or don't. I didn't. 
And I'm an X-Man. 
Trainee. 
Fuck it! 
Superhero landing coming up! 
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck! 
That is so not practical. 
I could get used 
to this X-Man shit. 
Trainee! 
Trainee! 
Get a power restraint 
on him. Now! 
Calm down, squirt. 
It's over. We got ya. 
What's that do? 
Power-dampening collar. 
Shuts down all mutant abilities. You can't get it off. 
Unless you've got a grenade. 
Huh. Could've used 
one of those in the first act. Thank you! 
That was absolutely thrilling. True heroism in action. 
We are in your debt. 
Page 18/61
We can take it from here. 
Take me to the Ice Box, please! Anywhere's better than here. 
Believe me, son, 
you do not wanna go 
to the Ice Box. 
Let's get you inside, young man. No, wait, wait. Wait. 
You guys stay there. 
Those guys hurt you? 
Who? 
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner? 
Both of 'em? 
Oh, fuck it. 
Four or five moments! 
I'm sorry? 
Four or five moments! 
That's all it takes 
to be a hero. 
People think 
you wake up a hero... 
brush your teeth a hero... 
ejaculate into 
a soap dispenser a hero. 
But, no, being a hero 
takes only a few moments! 
A few moments... 
doing the ugly stuff 
no one else will do. 
No! 
Stand down! Hold your fire! 
- Wade, what did you do? 
- Colossus, no! 
That kid was abused! 
You can tell. 
- You can always tell! 
- We have rules! 
You are not judge, 
jury or executioner! 
Fuck your rules! 
I fight for what's right! 
And sometimes 
you gotta fight dirty! 
You let me down 
Page 19/61
for the last time, Wade. 
Okay, get these guys in the pod. Take them to the Ice Box. 
Hey, baby! 
I wonder what gang I'll be in. Yeah! 
- Is there, like, a Sorting Hat? - Hi. 
Go! 
Hard left, douchebag. 
Please, after you. 
Another disgusting mutant 
off the streets. 
God bless America. 
Let's get a taco. 
Nighty-night, 
you annoying prick! 
I'mma tell you 
what the big lie is. 
Toilet paper. 
Toilet paper 
is a plenty fine appetizer. 
But, then... 
Huggies Natural Care wet wipes. That's your main course. 
They're soft, they're moist. 
They're for babies. 
Finally, one more pass 
with the toilet paper, 
maybe clear out 
that excess moisture. 
Maybe treat yourself 
to a blow and go, 
if you can get you a hair dryer. Just about 30 seconds 
will do you good. 
The fuck? 
Year? 
What? 
What year is it? 
What kind of dumb-ass 
question is that to ask? 
You're a long way 
from your superpowers. 
Page 20/61
Yeah. 
Fuck! 
I wanted to be a superhero. 
Always wanted a real super suit. What happened? 
When was the last time you saw a plus-sized superhero? 
Never. 
The industry discriminates. 
Fuck superheroes. 
Fuck everyone. 
The first thing I wanna do 
when I get out of here... 
burn the headmaster alive... 
and then take a selfie 
with his smoldering corpse. 
Who says 
prison isn't reformative? 
Fucker hates mutants. 
Blessed are the wicked 
who are healed by my hand. 
Your abilities. 
I know how seductive they are. Now, please don't cry. 
Tomorrow, we'll find 
the biggest guy in here... 
and we'll make him our... 
What was that? 
That is the biggest guy in here. Fun fact about the Ice Box... 
though no one's ever seen it, 
they keep a monster 
in the basement. 
Right next to a huge, 
steaming bowl of foreshadowing. Look. 
I can't protect you. 
With this collar on, 
my superpower 
is just unbridled cancer. 
Give me a bow and arrow, 
I'm basically Hawkeye. 
Now, if you'll excuse me... 
I've got tumors to grow. 
Page 21/61
Vanessa awaits. 
I'll start by making us a shank. - Good listening. 
- I stole that guard's pen... 
and stashed it 
in the old prison wallet, 
if you know what I'm saying. 
Prison wallet? 
I really hope I don't know 
what you're saying. 
I can hear you 
rummaging around in there. 
And to update you 
on the story reported earlier, after a lengthy standoff 
outside the Essex House 
for Mutant Rehabilitation... 
two mutants were arrested 
and transported 
to the Ice Box... 
Entering repair mode. 
Several 
police cars were destroyed 
and the X-Men were called in 
to restore order. 
Cells seven and nine 
now off-limits 
for medical personnel. 
Cells seven and nine 
now off-limits 
for medical personnel. 
Psst! 
Don't do that. 
What? Why are you winking at me? I got your back. 
Oh, my God. 
You're sick, 
I gotta protect you. 
Just leave me alone, kid. 
Oh, great. 
Well, hello there, new fish. 
It's nice to see some 
fresh faces around here. 
I've done some 
Page 22/61
light catalog work... 
but, really, modeling is just 
a stepping stone to acting. 
- I was talking to him. 
- Oh. 
Have we met? 
I can't place your mustache. 
- Black Tom Cassidy. 
- White Wade Wilson. 
What's your superpower? 
Cultural appropriation? 
You're supposed to be 
the toughest cunt in here. 
You don't look like much to me. First rule of the yard, 
fuckface... 
find the biggest guy 
and make him your... 
Second biggest guy. 
The last thing I need 
is more hepatitis. 
Oh, it's slippery, too. 
This table needs a wipe down! 
Can we get a wipe down 
on the table? 
Kid, I think you picked 
the wrong side. 
No, I didn't! He's my friend! 
Zip it. We're not friends. 
You're about to get 
dick-slapped. 
I had so much fun! 
You were like... 
And I was like, 
"Take a seat, shit dick." 
Just let me die in peace. 
We make a great team! 
Oh, God! We're not a team. 
Why'd you say that back there? We're friends, partners. 
We're not partners or friends. This doesn't end with us 
riding into the sunset. 
It ends with me 
Page 23/61
dying of cancer... 
and you winning the Ice Box 
award for softest mouth. 
There's only one person 
in this world 
that I care about, 
and she's gone. 
You wanna survive? 
Stop trying to shank 
the biggest guys in here... 
and make friends with them. 
Make friends with someone. 
Anyone but me. 
Maybe even Black Tim. 
Black Evan, I don't know. 
All I remember is 
he was African-American. 
System malfunctioning. 
Cells 7, 12, 14, 27. 
Back in your cells, you filthy mutants! Get in there! 
Cells 1, 3, 7, 8. 
Searching. 
Cell 04 located. 
Door won't open! 
On your fucking knees! 
That was our cell. 
What did I do to piss off 
a grumpy old fucker 
with a Winter Soldier arm? 
Get away from me, kid! 
Listen to me! Go! 
Hello, Russell. 
Hello, superpowers. 
Who are you? 
I'm Batman. 
Ooh! 
Oh. That's got some zip. 
Don't feel bad. 
Even I can't kill me. 
Talk! 
What kind of 
spineless shit stick 
tries to kill a 14-year-old boy? Page 24/61
You might wanna start talking! 'Cause I got a long history of 
firing at times like this! 
The name's Cable. 
I'm from the future. 
Just walk away. 
Oh! 
So, you're from the future. 
I have three questions then. 
One, is dubstep still a thing? Two, which Sharknado are we on? And three, at what point 
do audiences say... 
"Enough with the robotic arms"? Dubstep's for pussies. 
You're so dark! 
Are you sure you're not 
from the DC universe? 
I love dubstep! 
Is that a fanny pack? 
I used to have one of those 
in 1990-never. 
Something to remember you by. 
Give me that back! 
That goes with me everywhere. 
Like the memory 
of your fucking fanny pack! 
Why are you protecting the kid? I don't give a fuck about him... and his Are You My Mother? 
Complex! 
What's this one do? 
In every film, there's a moment when the hero hits rock bottom. In Cool Runnings, 
it was when John Candy's 
prized bobsled broke. 
In Human Centipede, 
it was when those people... 
signed on to be in that movie. But in this film, well... 
you're looking at it. 
On your fucking knees, mutant. Rock... 
Page 25/61
meet bottom. 
I love you, Wade Wilson. 
Ness? 
Hey, Ness! 
Ness, can you let me in? 
Please! Please. 
Jesus. 
You're not giving me 
a lot of direction here. 
I'm at the end of my rope. 
Then I joined the X-Men. 
I went to prison. I, uh... 
Is it the kid? 
Kids give us a chance to be 
better than we used to be. 
The kid! 
That's exactly what she meant. Your heart needs to be 
in the right place. 
I'm not gonna abandon this kid. He's never had anyone, ever. 
I need to be selfless. 
Yeah, but what does that mean? It means I'm gonna save Russell. Maybe I couldn't save Vanessa... but maybe I can save a robust 
teenager from New Zealand. 
Yeah, but what I mean is, 
like, the world "selfless." 
I literally don't know 
what that means. 
Jesus Christ. 
Okay, look. 
According to my guy, okay... 
those muties 
are being transferred 
to a supermax, 80 miles away. 
Great, I'll pick 'em off 
along the way. 
Hold your testicles there, 
buddy, okay? 
We're talking about 
an armored convoy... 
and a vicious super soldier 
Page 26/61
from the future... 
that is looking to turn your 
skull into a fuckable ashtray. You know what we need to do? 
We need to build a fucking team. We need 'em tough, 
morally flexible... 
and young enough 
so they can carry 
this franchise 10 to 12 years. My body is an 
instrument of death. 
Not now, Dopinder. 
I could be of great use. 
What's your superpower? 
- Courage. 
- That's adorable. 
Do you have the courage 
to check and see... 
if there are enough sanitary 
napkins in the dispenser? 
Yes, sir. 
I'm sorry you had to see that, although I'm glad you heard it. All right, I'll put out 
a call for resumes. 
But we're not paying 
medical or dental. 
It's time to get back 
on Linkedln. 
Transport 
will begin at 0800 hours... 
Oi. 
What the fuck do you want? 
That's my fucking pudding. 
- Fuck your pudding! 
- You like pudding? 
Hello? 
I know you're in there. 
Must be hard being the 
biggest guy in here. 
Lonely at the top, eh? 
They're moving us tomorrow. 
Maybe I can get you out of here. Page 27/61
And we can make 
the whole world our bitch. 
We need a secret code. 
No, 
that's stupid, Russell. Idiot. We're a team. 
We're like thugs, 
we're like gangsters. 
I'm like Tupac, 
and you're like Ice Cube. 
Supposedly, she can rap, too. 
I like that. 
Terrific, 
these are all terrific. 
Meet Bedlam. 
Cool name! Superpowers? 
I can distort 
electrical fields. 
Including the one 
inside your brain... 
causing anxiety, confusion... 
pain. 
So, basically, 
you're Dave Matthews. 
We can use him. 
I'm Zeitgeist. 
Cool. I like it. 
So you have the power 
to put your finger 
on the pulse of society? 
No. 
No, I spit acidic vomit. 
- Oh. 
- Do you want me 
- to demonstrate? 
- No! 
We'll take your word for it. 
Thank you. Yeah. Listen, we've all eaten at Arby's, okay? 
And this is the Vanisher. 
But... 
Vanisher! 
Nice! Right? 
He's not here, is he? 
Page 28/61
He may be running late. 
My name's Rusty, 
but I go by Shatterstar. 
That's good, yeah. 
- "Rusty" is terrible. 
- Toughie. 
- So, uh, where are you from? 
- The planet Mojo World. 
- So you're an alien, I guess. - Bad name. 
How does that, uh, help us? 
I'm basically better 
than you at everything. 
Just once, I'm gonna find 
a planet of people 
that are worse than me 
at everything. 
A whole bunch 
of functional idiots. 
I'm gonna go there, and I'm 
gonna be their Superman. 
Isn't that Canada? 
You shut your 
goddamn trash mouth! 
- Meet... 
- Domino. 
- What's your shtick? 
- I'm lucky. 
If you're so lucky, then what 
are you doing here with us? 
I don't know yet. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
It means that I don't know yet. But there's a reason 
why I'm here, 
and I'll know when I know. 
Everything usually 
works out for me. 
Luck isn't a superpower. 
- Yes, it is. 
- No, it isn't. 
- Yes, it is. 
- No, ma'am. 
- Mmm-hmm. 
Page 29/61
- Mario No-pez. 
- Yeah. 
- Nacho cheese. 
No, it definitely is. 
I really... 
There's no way that it... 
Sorry, I was interrupting you. - Sorry. No, I interrupted you. - No, no, no. You can go first. Oh, I was just gonna say, 
"No, it isn't." 
I was gonna just bring it back to that yes, it is. 
Let's meet in the middle 
and say, "No, it isn't." 
- But it is. 
- Okay. 
- You're hired! 
- You're hired. 
Oh, lucky me. 
She's great. 
And last, but not least... 
Peter. 
Am I getting 
catfished here or...? 
Any powers you wanna 
tell us about? 
No. 
I don't have one. 
Um, I just saw the ad 
and thought it looked fun. 
You're in. 
- Yeah. 
- Fuck! 
It's fulfilling work. 
Let's go! 
This is Convoy 17 
departing the Ice Box. 
We are en route. 
Peacetime makes people soft. 
I was born into war. 
Bred into it. 
Okay. 
People think 
Page 30/61
they understand pain. 
What's the most pain 
you've ever felt? 
These restraints are pretty... I've got a list. 
We're gonna work down it. 
Together. 
Number one, 
I'm gonna bend something. 
Something that was not 
meant to bend. 
I'm gonna stop you right there because I'm not gonna 
make it to two. 
I won't even make it to one. 
I don't do well with pain, 
you know. 
If I stub my toe, 
I'm done for the day. 
I cried when 
they canceled Felicity. 
When I get really scared, 
I get nervous erections. 
I have one right now. 
Don't look. 
It'll only make it worse. 
I don't want you to hurt me, 
and I'll tell you 
anything you wanna know. 
Except for where they are. 
Russell's in a convoy 
heading southbound 
on Gerry Duggan Parkway. 
The monster's with them. 
I wouldn't fuck with him. 
You all know the plan. 
Intercept the convoy, 
grab the boy. 
But not inappropriately! 
You know what, 
I wouldn't fuck with 
Deadpool either. 
Because he's built a team. 
He's unstoppable. 
Page 31/61
He has an ass pen. 
He'll stab you with it. 
Watch out for this guy, Cable! He's very short, 5'11". 
Not like in the comics. 
And if we succeed, 
we all go home early. 
So if you go after 
them, Cable, I warn you... 
there's a wind advisory 
in effect. 
A little turbulent up here. 
I don't know much 
about this Cable fella... 
but I guarantee he hasn't killed as many people as melanoma has. We're getting close! 
As a former X-Man... 
- Trainee. 
- Thank you, Bedlam. 
I was always appalled 
by the blatant sexism 
in the group's name. 
X-Men! Men! 
The point is, our group 
will be forward thinking. 
Gender neutral. 
From now on, 
we'll be known as... 
X-Force. 
Isn't that a little derivative? I don't recall asking 
your opinion, Peter! 
That wasn't me. 
Hang the laundry out 
at 1,300 feet... 
intercept the convoy, 
and grab the boy. 
Let's bring on 
the carnage, baby! 
Get me on the ground, 
watch me go! 
Yeah! 
I can't wait to kill! 
Page 32/61
Hey! Hey! Hey! 
I just wanna say 
how proud I am of this team. 
You know, you guys look amazing! Vanisher, I have no doubt 
you look amazing too. 
This is the family 
that I've always dreamed 
of having and I... 
Ah, shit. 
I just get a little 
choked up sometimes. 
I hate to interrupt, 
but is anybody nervous 
about the high winds? 
- Gary. 
- My name's Peter. 
I realize that you're new 
to this, but relax. 
You've been chosen 
by a higher power. 
- Did he just call himself God? - I think he did. 
- I'd like to go home. 
- And I'd like... 
the McRib to be available 
year round, 
but sometimes 
dreams don't come true. 
I spent 10 years 
in Special Forces. 
You think we didn't 
jump out of the plane 
because of a light breeze? 
You're in this shit now, 
Mustache! 
I'm only yelling 
to impress the other guys. 
I'd never let anything 
happen to you, Sugarbear. 
Leonard, hit it! 
Go! Go! Go! 
Let's get some! 
Whoo! 
Page 33/61
Oh, yeah! 
Convoy, 12 o'clock! 
On my command! 
Deploy! Oh, hey now! 
Whoa! 
Little off course here. 
Holy mommy fucking shit! 
Ah, there they are. 
Look at these gorgeous 
sons of bitches. 
Oh, yeah! That's right, Bedlam! No! Tripping 
motherfucking billies! 
Shatterstar. Okay, you got this. Left! 
Left! 
No, stage left, you idiot! 
Well, I guess we found something you're not better at. 
Vanisher. 
Maybe the wind can't blow 
what it can't see. 
Oh! Really? 
All right, 
we could do this with four. 
Sugarbear. You got this, buddy! That's the stuff! 
That's the X-Force spirit! 
Never underestimate 
a man with a mustache! 
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn. 
We did it! 
You're a goddamn superhero, you! X-Force! 
X-Force. 
Oh! 
Peter. 
I got you, buddy! 
- You're gonna be fine! 
- This is not good, man! 
You got this, big guy! 
Here we go, Peter! 
Look at me. 
We're X-Force, right? 
Page 34/61
- Yeah, we're X-Force. 
- We're X-Force. 
Oh, my God! What the fuck? 
Fucking acidic vomit! 
Oh, God! I'm gonna throw up 
in my mask. 
Okay, I'm over the convoy. 
Where did the rest 
of the team land? 
Good news and bad news. 
Bad news is 
the whole team is dead. 
The good news is, 
I don't think anyone's 
gonna miss Shatterstar. 
He was a bit of a prick. 
Oh, but Paul! 
Peter! 
Peter, I'm gonna miss him most. But there is a slight chance 
Vanisher could make it. 
- -Nope, no chance. He's dead. The whole team? 
Only the main ones. 
We're still good. 
Fuck, you are dumb. 
Even after all this time, 
I still can't talk about it. 
Who knew these winds 
would be so strong? 
Everyone! 
Everyone on the helicopter! 
And everyone 
not on the helicopter! 
They're headed into the tunnel. I'm that kid's only hope, 
so sit tight 
and wait for my word. 
Whatever. 
We're gonna lose 'em. 
I'm dropping in. 
Uh, that's 
a negative, sole survivor. 
Luck is not a superpower! 
Page 35/61
We are so fucked! 
No, we most certainly 
are not fucked. 
Seriously, I don't get it! 
What, you shoot luck lasers 
out of your eyes? 
It's just it's hard to picture. And certainly 
not very cinematic. 
I mean, luck? 
What coked out, 
glass pipe-sucking 
freakshow comic book artist... came up 
with that little chestnut? 
Probably a guy 
who can't draw feet! 
Once again, it all falls 
on my shoulders. 
It's why I'm cursed to be 
a solo act. 
- Wander the Earth... 
- I'm in. 
I'm sorry, what did you say? 
I'm in. 
How in the fuck 
are you in already? 
Oh, shit. 
It's Cable. 12 o'clock. 
Okay. 
New plan. Use all of your 
imaginary powers 
to stop Cable 
from killing that kid. 
I'm coming up on your six. 
That gun is amazing! 
Hey! Asshole! 
Where is he? I can't see him. 
He's on top of you. 
He's going in through the back! Oh, God, he's inside! 
You hear yourself, right? 
Accidental double entendres! 
Russell! Russell Collins! 
Page 36/61
Hands off that kid, John Connor! No, no, no! 
Shit! 
Two can play that game! 
Got it! No, I don't. 
Showtime, mama! 
Lady Luck, take the wheel. 
I'd ask who you are, but 
you'll be dead in a second. 
I'm Domino, and doubtful. 
Hang in there, Doms! 
Oh, this is really hard. 
And give me back 
my Skee-Ball token. 
- You're doing great. 
- X-Force. 
I guess dubstep never dies. 
Whoo! 
You killed Black Tom, 
you racist son of a bitch! 
That's unfortunate. 
We got no brakes! 
Figure it out! 
There's nothing I can't kill. 
Ooh. 
Somebody knows karate. 
Give me your best shot, 
One-Eyed Willy. 
Ow. 
Here we go. 
Domino, mind slowing us down? 
Here goes nothing. 
Knock, knock. 
That's my boy. 
Holy... 
I'll be first to admit... 
this did not go 
according to plan. 
I'll also be the first 
to admit that 
that plan was written in crayon. Looks like Russell found 
a new friend. Jelly. 
Turns out Domino's 
Page 37/61
a bit of a badass, 
and maybe, 
possibly mildly lucky. 
But Cable? Ugh. 
That guy's in a mood. 
A mood that is 
about to get 
significantly worse. 
Something is so terribly, 
terribly wrong. 
Oh. 
Oh, God, that hurt. 
Russell. 
Russell! 
Russ, where are ya? 
Russell. Russell, you're okay! Oh, thank God. Oh, my God! 
Juggernaut! 
I thought that was you! 
I should've worn my white pants. You probably get this a lot, 
but I am a huge fan. 
Uncanny X-Men 183. Thor 411. 
X-Men Unlimited 12. 
You know, it has always been 
a dream of mine... 
to see my face 
reflected in your helmet... 
as you charge at me 
with murderous intent. 
I don't mean right now. 
I'm gonna rip you in half now. That is such 
a Juggernaut thing to say. 
Oh, my God! 
I can't feel my legs. 
I can't feel... 
Oh, no, they're right here. 
Got 'em. God, Russell. 
I have a mission. 
To get my revenge. 
I'm going to burn 
that headmaster alive. 
You're not the revenge type. 
Page 38/61
Take it from a friend. 
Friend? You were sick, 
and I protected you. 
You said it yourself. 
"I'm not your friend. 
Find someone stronger." 
So I did. 
Russell, I couldn't 
protect you back then. 
But I can now. What do you 
want me to say, huh? 
"I care about you"? 
'Cause goddamn it, 
I care about you, Russell. 
What's Juggernaut got 
that I don't have? 
Don't you say legs! I know 
you're gonna say legs! 
- Legs! 
- Still hurts to hear out loud! What is that? 
That's not a real rope! 
You get back here, young man! 
Doms! 
Doms, get me 
out of here, please. 
Use my arms as backpack straps. I think we may have found 
your cosmic reason 
for being here. 
I'm pretty sure this isn't it. X-Force. 
No child is hopeless. 
Don't give up on the boy. 
How could he just walk away? 
It was the coldness in his eyes. You should've heard it. 
I guess family 
really is an F-word. 
Rub my legs, Mama. 
Why would I rub your legs? 
Please, they hurt. 
I have growing pains. 
What in the... 
Page 39/61
Why is your hand so tiny again? That's not my hand. 
Oh! Mary, mother of Joseph! 
That was nice for me. 
Wade! I heard what happened 
with the convoy and... 
Why wouldn't you cover that up? A warrior has nothing 
to be ashamed of. 
Yeah, but you do. Look at you. You're just 
straight shirt-cocking it, 
toddler-style. 
Oh, yeah. Full Winnie the Pooh. The hell's happening? 
Describe it. 
I wouldn't ask him to 
do that, if I were you. 
- It's like, um... 
- Here we go. 
It's like he was 
giving birth anally, 
but they quit halfway through. They got the legs out, 
and they said, 
"You know what, I'm done." 
Happy? 
It's like he's a Muppet 
from the waist down. 
But this time, you can see 
the Muppet's dick. 
Grover's got a cock 
the size of a twig. 
Mr. Weasel, I can 
no longer be double-parked. 
I've had three tickets already. No, no, no, DP, not again! 
This has happened before? 
- -Jesus! Either vomit or don't. The indecision is killing me. 
Why couldn't God 
take my hearing? 
Oh. Wow! 
Cool your pits. 
Page 40/61
They're growing back. 
I'm talking about your face. 
I've never seen you 
without your mask before. 
- Jesus Christ! 
- Looks like an avocado. 
Your legs, though, they're cute. You wanna borrow 
a pair of pants? 
I'm glad everybody dropped by. You must be wondering 
why I didn't call you here. 
I'll tell you why I'm here. 
"The Time Traveler's Wife's" 
husband... 
beat me within 
an inch of my life. 
He was torturing me! 
But all I told him was 
everything he wanted to know. 
So, I'm here to help us gear up. So we can go after him 
without me. 
No! 
I'm doing this alone. 
The Juggernaut 
- will kill you all. 
- Fair enough. 
I just need a couple of 
hours to get some legs 
- under me. 
- What will you do? 
I don't care 
what the kid did to me. 
I ain't letting Cable 
get to him, 
even if I have to 
teabag him to death. 
It's really just a sip 
of tea at this point. 
Zip it, black Black Widow! 
I'm flowing. 
The first order of business is to get me in front of Cable... 
Page 41/61
so I can pull all the fucking 
blood out of his body... 
and fashion his bones 
into holiday jewelry. 
Then, I'm gonna take his skin... and stretch it out 
over a homemade mating drum. 
He's standing 
right behind you, isn't he? 
What in the ass? 
Is this apartment listed 
on Tinder? Grindr? 
You picked the wrong shithole 
to fuck, future boy. 
Ugh. Is that really necessary? No. It's his "Basic Instinct." What can we help you with? 
I'm here to proposition you. 
Oh, boy! 
He's really teeing it up, 
isn't he? 
Who gets to make the first joke? I think we should all 
do it at the same time. 
Good call. 
For $45, you get sucky-suck. 
I only do over 
the pants, mouth stuff. 
Fuck! 
The Proposition has a wonderful Guy Pearce performance. 
Wait, wait, wait! 
I wanna do mine over. 
- Give us the line again. 
- I need your help! 
Trust me, I'm even less happy 
about this than you are... 
but you unleashed the 
Juggernaut, you dumb cunt! 
I can't bring him down alone. 
So here we are. 
We're no longer 
accepting applications 
for X-Force, unfortunately. 
Page 42/61
Even if we were... 
there's a wind advisory 
in effect until at least... 
We don't have a lot of time. 
Your friend's about 
to make his first kill. 
No offense, 
but if you know so much... 
why not travel back to when 
he was a baby, kill him then? 
Or better yet, head back 
a little further, 
kill baby Hitler. 
I use a device 
to slide through time. 
The longer I travel, 
the harder it is to control. 
I got two charges: 
one to get me here, 
one to get me home. 
Well. 
That's just lazy writing. 
Your boy's 
gonna kill the headmaster 
of the orphanage tonight. 
After that, 
he gets a real taste for it. 
Like 10-year-old 
Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker! 
So he keeps killing... 
and killing, and killing, 
and killing. 
Until one day, he kills 
the wrong fucking people. 
My people. 
Relax. 
I'm retrieving something 
from my utility bag. 
It's a goddamn fanny pack... 
and you know it, 
you sick son of a bitch! 
The difference is night and day. You remind me of my wife. 
I'm sorry. 
Page 43/61
I said, "You remind me 
of my wife." 
No, I'm sorry 
that you said that... 
while making heavy eye contact and applying lip balm. 
She always struggled. 
But she was funny... 
and filtered her pain 
through the prism of humor. 
Something I could never master. It was my fault she died. 
It was my job 
to stop people like him. 
I came close a few times. 
He wasn't too happy about that. He was trying to hurt me... 
and he knew exactly 
how to do it. 
Blessed are the wicked 
who are healed by my hand. 
He came into my home... 
and took the only thing 
that made it a home. 
Sound familiar? 
- I'm sorry. 
- Uh-huh. 
No, I'm really sorry. 
But that isn't Russell. 
- It doesn't have to be him. 
- If you knew what I knew... 
Yeah, he's got anger issues... maybe a small 
learning disability... 
splash of diabetes... 
but nothing that can't be fixed. If you could go back... 
and stop the people that took 
your girl, would you? 
Of course I fucking would! 
But I wouldn't kill a kid. 
I'm not asking you 
to kill a kid! 
I'll kill the kid. 
Page 44/61
I'm asking you to save 
hundreds of other kids. 
Russell's gonna burn down 
that orphanage. 
And I can imagine 
your dead girlfriend... 
would want you to do the 
right thing, wouldn't she? 
So, what's it gonna be, 
handsome? 
Give me a chance to save him. 
- What? 
- You said... 
once he kills someone, 
he gets a taste for it. 
If we can get to him 
before that happens... 
promise you'll give me a chance to put him on a different path. Define "chance." 
I don't know. 
How long does it take 
to save someone's soul? 
That's not... 
I'll give you 30 seconds. 
- What? No! 
- Best I can do. 
Take it or leave it. 
He's doing it! 
Look at the little fella. 
He's doing it. 
There he goes. 
Jesus Christ! 
Just shirt-cocking it. 
Ugh. 
There you go, little fella. 
Go on, you're doing it! 
My beautiful, hairless, 
Twizzler-legged baby boy. 
Christ! 
That's disturbing. 
30 seconds. 
- Deal. 
- Deal. 
Page 45/61
I have no idea what's happening. Probably for the best. 
And that is why 
you never eat a raw starfish. 
It's just common sense. 
Where the hell are we going? 
You said it yourself. 
Nothing can stop the Juggernaut. We need backup. 
I will bathe in the blood 
of your enemies. 
Can you turn off the music? 
You'll do no such thing. 
Why don't you just say it 
in an Indian accent? 
What the hell are you...? 
Once again, intolerance rears 
its ugly head. 
I am so sorry. It gets better. I'm not a fucking racist, moron! Tell that to Black Tom. 
He was like a brother to me. 
I'm with the old white guy 
on this one. 
And that's a twist. 
So what exactly do you 
do in the future, anyway, huh? Some kind of soldier? 
Yeah, something like that. 
I was a soldier. Special Forces. I bet 50 years from now, 
we're bestest buddies. 
50 years from now, 
you're very dead. 
Your entire generation fucked 
this planet into a coma. 
Boom! 
Spoiler alert. 
Planets. 
Next time, Uber. 
Here's a spoiler alert. 
You're not a fucking hero. 
You're just an annoying clown 
dressed up as a sex toy. 
Page 46/61
Well, I got news for you. 
My heart is in the right place. Russell's not gonna kill anyone. Because of me, he's gonna know what real love looks like. 
Because of you, I'll always know what a grown man 
with baby balls looks like. 
I'm a grower, not a shower. 
I should've finished college. 
Right here! 
I made mistakes! 
I wanna take them back! 
You trusted me. 
I took that trust... 
and turned it into a glory hole in an airport bathroom. 
The one in Minneapolis. 
You know the one. 
Colossus! 
I wouldn't ask for your help 
unless it was life or death! 
That kid needs our help! 
I know you're listening! 
He's teamed up 
with the Juggernaut! 
The Juggernaut! 
That's like my favorite 
Marvel character ever, 
but you should never 
meet your heroes... 
because, honestly, 
he's a bit of a dick! 
And like a lot of dicks, 
he's as hard as a rock... 
and causes nothing but problems! - Hi, Wade! 
- Hi, Yukio! 
Please don't. 
You guys make 
a super cute couple. 
Yeah. Where was I? Oh, yeah! 
Colossus! Look, I don't deserve your friendship or your help. 
Page 47/61
But this kid does. 
And I'm not gonna bail on him 
like everyone else. 
Oh, come on! 
Any chance Pigeon Wings 
is available? 
That's just fine! That's fine! No! You know what? 
Doing the right thing 
is sometimes messy... 
and fucked up, and not 
particularly convenient! 
So stay here 
in Chateau de Virgin... 
while we go get our fuck on! 
You're doing great. 
So you wear that helmet because your brother 
tries to read your mind? 
Yeah, but he's in 
a wheelchair, so even-steven. 
Someone's coming. 
It's Russell, sir. 
He's not alone. 
Secure the children. 
What do you say 
we go fuck some shit up? 
"Let's fuck some shit up" 
is my legal middle name. 
Watch my back. 
I've got the old man. 
Amen, brother. 
Time to make the chimichangas. 30 seconds. 
I finally know why I'm here. 
I was raised in this place. 
Well, not raised. 
I was tortured. 
Wow! It's your cosmic reason 
for being here. 
- Shall we? 
- This is gonna be fun. 
Yeah! 
Hey! Been meaning to ask you... Page 48/61
what's with the creepy, 
dirty hobo bear? 
It's not dirt. It's the blood 
of my dead daughter. 
I have a gluten sensitivity. 
So one glass of wine, I just... Yeah. 
Wish we could head back in time, and I could take all that back. We should just cue the music. 
Welcome home, Russell. 
We missed you. 
Russell! 
You don't need to do this! 
Let's talk! 
Why are you dressed 
like the Unabomber? 
That's why! 
Told you this little fucker's 
too far gone. 
Zip it, Thanos! We have 
a deal and you fuck... 
Hey! 
I'm gonna shove that 
cab driver right up your ass. 
My body and my hands 
are so soft. 
You should probably 
head back to the car. 
I think I'll head 
back to the car. 
It works best 
when you pull the trigger. 
That gun is amazing! 
Say it! 
You are an abomination! 
Now, I'm gonna shove 
the red guy up the old guy. 
I believe him! 
Every man for themselves! 
Gotcha! 
Beat it, midget! 
Hey, big guy, 
the sun's getting real low! 
Page 49/61
Oh, shit fuck! 
Come here, beautiful. 
Say it! 
You came for me. 
I'm not giving up on you, 
and you are not 
giving up on that boy. 
Who says that rules 
aren't meant to be broken? 
It's time to fight dirty. 
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny. Hey! Pick on someone 
your own size! 
That's such a you thing to say! Go get him, tiger! 
Big CGI fight coming up! 
He's doing great. 
Say it! 
- Russell. 
- Bingo! 
That's right! 
I'm fighting dirty! 
Oh, great! 
There they are! Those freaks! 
A bunch of armed 
pedophiles in nursing shoes. 
Can I have one of those guns? 
- No. 
- That's fine. 
Get off this property, 
mutant scum! 
I'm just gonna use this brick. Maximum effort. 
Who says you can't 
go home again? 
Oh! 
Yeah! 
Say it. 
Say what you said 
every time you tortured me! 
Say it! 
Blessed are the wicked 
who are healed by my hand! 
Blessed are the wicked... 
Page 50/61
who are healed... 
by my hand. 
You commie motherfucker! 
Oh, my God. 
Did you feel that, too? 
Only best buddies 
execute pedophiles together. 
You got 30 seconds, 
you jabbering butt plug! 
Now we're getting it. 
I need a bus 
to get you all out of here. 
Orphans. 
Oh, geez. 
It's time to burn 
for what you've done! 
A child should not be burdened with such power! 
Russell! Wait! 
Oh! 
Wait! He hasn't killed 
anyone yet! 
- What more do you need to see? - Don't you fucking dare! 
He's just a kid! 
Tick, tock. Meter's running! 
I'm gonna melt you down 
and make a cock ring. 
- I told you! Leave me alone! 
- Come on! 
Listen to me! 
That's how we do it 
in Mother Russia. 
They say millennials are 
the hardest to reach. 
Oh, no. You're doing amazing. 
Damn, it feels good 
to be a gangsta! 
Go home, Wade! 
You're ruining everything! 
I'm getting good at this shit. Go, go, go! 
He dies tonight, Wade. 
You can't stop me! 
Page 51/61
He even runs 
like a fucking pervert. 
Like an online predator 
who lost his laptop. 
There's one bullet left 
in that gun. 
Wait, wait, wait! Please, 
just give me a second! 
I got this. 
- Russell! 
- Stay back! Go home, Wade! 
Let's talk. It doesn't 
have to go this way! 
That piece of shit... 
he deserves to die 
for what he did to you. 
He hurt you badly. 
Makes you wanna hurt others. 
But if you kill him, he wins. 
You become everything 
he says you are, but worse. 
You're just a kid. 
You don't wanna hurt anyone. 
How do you know what I want? 
Because I've been inside you. 
That came out wrong. 
I've been inside your shoes. 
Which is also off-putting. 
It's not a great analogy. 
The point is... 
there are people... 
There are people 
in this fucking world... 
besides him, 
who will treat you right. 
It isn't too late. Don't do it. I never should've left 
you there. 
I never should've left you 
in that prison. 
I can't trust you. 
I can't trust anybody! 
Wonderful kid. 
You can't stop me, Wade! 
Page 52/61
I got one more idea. 
It's just a really bad one, 
even for me. 
Wade, what are you doing? 
All right. This is for 
all the marbles, kid! 
You're gonna kill 
someone today... 
Blessed are the wicked... 
then it's gotta be me. 
Who are healed by my hand! 
Fuck this! 
The sun will 
come out tomorrow 
Bet your bottom dollar 
that tomorrow 
There'll be sun 
When I'm stuck with a day 
that's gray and lonely 
I just stick out my chin 
and grin and say 
The sun 
will come out tomorrow 
So you gotta hang on 
till tomorrow 
Come what may 
Tomorrow, tomorrow 
I love ya, tomorrow 
You're always a day away 
Tell me they got that 
in slow motion. 
Oh, that's not good. 
No, sir. 
You sacrificed yourself for me. Yeah. 
And it was the best thing 
I ever did. 
I told you I care about you. 
You're a good kid, Russell. 
Hey. 
The bear. 
It worked. 
Because of you. 
No, Wade, because of you. 
Page 53/61
Stop, stop, stop! 
Stop! 
Just let it happen, okay? 
I guess my heart was finally 
in the right place. 
That riddle is so fucked up. 
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
Don't be. Don't be. 
I've been trying to make 
this happen for a while. 
Please, just don't leave me. 
I don't wanna die 
without an audience. 
We are not going anywhere. 
Oh, God, I hope 
the Academy is watching. 
Just rest, okay? 
Papa. 
Papa, can you hear me? 
Papa, can you find me 
in the night? 
Before I go... 
Sorry, I got a bit more in me. Domino. 
I want you to have 
my Adventure Time watch. 
Turns out 
that I'm the lucky one. 
Thank you. 
Hey, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. It has been a pleasure. 
- Hi, Yukio. 
- Hi, Wade! 
And you... 
Chrome Bone. 
I haven't always been 
the best friend to you. 
But you've always been 
that to me. 
So thank you. 
Say "fuck" for me. 
Just once. Come on, 
we'll do it together. 
It's no big deal. 
Page 54/61
Here we go. One, two, three. 
F... F... F... 
Fuck. 
Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth. 
And you, Cable. 
You get back to your family. 
You tell 'em Wade says hi. 
And promise me. 
Promise me one thing. 
That you'll start 
judging people... 
not by the color of their skin, but by the content 
of their character. 
- Jesus. 
- R-Dog? 
There you are. Hey! 
You're a superhero now, bubba. Look. 
Family is not an F-word. 
All right? 
There's one out there for you. Just keep looking, okay? 
Guys, for a second there... 
we made a pretty good team. 
Oh, it's so hard to go. 
I just love being around 
you guys so much. 
So, so much. 
Mmm. 
No, I can feel it now. 
Here it comes, yeah. 
I feel the soul 
exiting the husk. 
Yeah. 
Can you see it? 
Do you see 
that beautiful bright light? 
There it is. 
Oh, that's the sun. 
Don't stare directly into that. I just have a few final words. Woodpecker. 
Gingivitis. 
Page 55/61
Codswallop. 
Do You Want to Build a Snowman? We're talking away 
I don't know what I'm to say 
I'll say it anyway 
Today's another day 
to find you 
Shying away 
I'll be coming 
for your love, okay? 
Take on me 
Take me on 
Sorry I'm late. 
There was a bunch 
of handicapable children 
who were stuck in a tree. 
- No. 
- No. 
- But I did have to help a kid. - Yeah. 
- He's got a terrible name. 
- It's just awful. 
- Ugh. 
- I tried to tell him. 
Is this heaven? 
It is now. 
I am so sorry. 
It's okay. 
Slowly learning 
that life is okay 
Say after me 
It's no better to be safe 
than sorry 
Take on me 
I missed you so much. 
What is it? What's wrong? 
It's not time. 
What do you mean it's not time? I'm here, I made it. 
- You can't stay. 
- No, no, no. 
I'm staying. I'm not going 
anywhere without you. 
It's okay. 
Page 56/61
There's a time for us. 
It's just not now. 
- They need you. 
- Who? 
Your F-word. 
Why? 
You'll find out. 
It's all right. I'll be here. 
I love you. 
I know. I love you, too. 
Now, go. 
Go on. Go, get out of here. 
Go. 
Hey! 
Kiss me like you miss me, Red. Well, come here. 
Take me on 
I'll be gone 
In a day or two 
Don't fuck Elvis. 
- Don't fuck Colossus. 
- What? 
Time to make the chimichangas. 30 seconds. 
Hey. Been meaning to ask you... what's with the creepy, 
dirty hobo bear? 
It's my daughter's teddy bear. Her name's Hope. 
Well... 
What are you doing? 
Somebody swiped right. 
Tell me they got that 
in slow motion. 
You sacrificed yourself for me. It would seem I... 
Huh? 
Genuine, high-grade lead. 
You time-sliding son of a bitch! You did this for me? 
Wait. You can't go back. 
You used the last of your fuel. What about your girl, your wife? Now, my family's safe. 
Page 57/61
And I didn't do it for you. 
No, I'm gonna stick around 
for a while... 
and make sure the world 
doesn't shit itself 
into oblivion. 
No. You did it for me. 
No, I didn't. 
- You did. 
- I really didn't. 
- Pretty sure you did. 
- No, I'm positive I didn't. 
Fine. All right, 
let's flip a coin. Okay? 
Heads, you did it for me. 
Tails, you did it for me. 
I'm not even gonna look, 
because you did it for me. 
Say it again. 
- He did it for me. 
- Jesus. 
- We must get the collar off. 
- Forget it. It's no use. 
These collars 
don't just come off. 
Wade. 
I have an idea. 
No, no, no! 
Let's not do that. Please! 
I'd rather die of cancer. 
Let's just... 
Oh, God! They do say the pen 
is grosser than the sword. 
We need the code. 
Try, uh, seven? 
Settle down, Captain Lucky. 
It's not gonna be one number. 
Oh, God, that's lazy writing. 
I still got it. 
Put that back 
in your prison wallet. 
I don't know how to thank you. But I do know how to hug you. 
- No. 
Page 58/61
- Yes. 
Here we go. Bring it in. 
Come on. 
Pelvis to pelvis. 
Let's go tip to tip. 
There we go. 
The kids call this docking. 
Is there a knife in my dick? 
- There's a knife in your dick. - I'm just gonna back up now. 
- Yeah, yeah. 
- No need to go full Yentl. 
Gonna pretend 
like that never happened. 
Let's go home, Russell. 
All you dirty mutants 
are gonna rot in hell 
with the boy! 
Your souls 
are beyond redemption! 
Let's see your soul, perv! 
No, no! No! No more! 
We're better than that! 
We're better than him! 
No more senseless violence! 
No more bloodshed! 
We'll let karma 
take care of him. 
The day of reckoning is here! 
I'm gonna miss him. 
He seemed great. 
Whoo! 
Courage, motherfuckers! 
And karma, motherfucker. 
I could hear you 
coming the last 30 seconds. 
I could barely keep 
a straight face. 
I want some more. 
I bet you do, Brown Panther. 
We should leave 
before Fuckernaut wakes up. 
Good call. You guys 
coming with us? 
Page 59/61
No, we'll get the kids 
back to the mansion. 
Besides, we're X-Men. 
No, you're X-People. 
You're exhausting. 
I see what you did there. Puns. - Bye, Wade! 
- Bye, Yukio! 
What do you get 
when you take 
eight feet of chrome... 
one pinch of courage... 
a cup of good luck... 
a dab of racism... 
a splash of diabetes... 
and a wheelbarrow 
full of stage four cancer? 
Answer: 
See? I didn't lie 
what kind of film this was. 
If there's anything 
you take away today... 
other than the need to Google, "What the fuck is dubstep?"... 
it's that we all need 
to belong to someone. 
How something so small generates enough energy 
to reverse time is... 
Oh, just fix it, Eleven, 
or I'll take it 
to the Genius Bar. 
Cable's gonna kill you 
when he finds out. 
Never heard of him. 
Why do you think 
I'm helping him? 
The Lord works 
in mysterious ways, 
don't I? A good day. 
Bye, Wade! 
Bye, Yukio! 
That was probably a bad idea. 
Page 60/61
What have we done? 
I hope we sharpened 
the cream cheese spreader. 
I'll be right back! 
We're definitely naming 
our kid Cher! 
Whoo! 
Peter! 
Whoo! X-Force! 
Walk away! Just walk away! 
But we're X-Force! 
Nope! We're not, 
there's no X-Force! 
All right, well, 
this has been pretty scary! 
Go home, Sugarbear. Go home. 
Okay. Will you give 
Domino my email? 
Wade, is that you? 
I guess Stryker finally 
figured out how to shut you up. Hey! It's me! Don't scratch! 
Just cleaning up the timelines! Love you! 
Welcome to the big leagues, kid. You're welcome, Canada.

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom 
By Derek Connolly 
Page 1/37
Isla Nublar 
193 miles west of Costa Rica 
Relax. 
Anything in here would 
be dead by now. 
There she is. 
The Indominus Rex. 
- Specimen collected, sent to the surface. - Roger that. 
- Air One, clear for takeoff. Begin tracking. - Copy that. 
- Go, go. 
- Tracking on. 
Land One, the asset is secure. 
We got what we came for. 
Coming back for you. 
Close the doors. 
Marine One, I gotta close the gate. Get outta there. 
Understood. We're heading out. 
Marine One, I need to close the gate. Confirm position. 
- Can you hear me, are you out? 
- Marine One? 
Guys, what is that? 
Marine One, I am 
closing the gates. 
Seriously guys, I'm kind 
of exposed out here. 
Marine One, confirm you're out. 
Marine One! 
Confirm position. Can you hear me? Marine One, where are you? 
I can't reach them! 
What?! 
What is going on? 
I can't hear you. 
Throw him the ladder! 
Don't go! 
We're gonna stall! Cut it now! 
- Do it, John! 
- We're gonna die here! 
I said cut it! 
DNA sample secure. Tell the 
Page 2/37
boss we're coming back home. 
Three years after the 
fall of Jurassic World, 
the debate over Isla 
Nublar rages on. 
The island's long dormant 
volcano, reclassified as active, has shown considerable 
unrest in recent months. 
Theologists now predict 
an extinction level event 
will kill off the last living 
dinosaurs on the planet. 
Since the disaster that 
shocked the world in 2015, 
the Masrani Corporation has 
paid out more than $800 million in damages to settle class action lawsuits brought by survivors. Activist groups have 
mobilized around the globe, 
in what has become the flashpoint animal rights issue of our time. With an eruption 
expected at any moment, 
the US Senate has convened 
a special committee, 
to answer a grave 
moral question: 
Do dinosaurs deserve 
the same protections 
given to other 
endangered species, 
or should they be left to die? I think... 
that we should allow our... 
magnificent, glorious dinosaurs, to be taken out by the volcano. - Silence, please. 
- As deeply sad as that would be. We altered the course 
of natural history. 
This is the correction. 
Page 3/37
Are you suggesting 
the Almighty is 
taking matters in His own hands? Senator, with all due 
respect, God's not... 
part of the equation. No. 
What I mean is that, in the 
last century, we amassed 
a landmark technological power. And we've consistently proven ourselves incapable of handling that power. 80 years ago, who could've 
predicted nuclear proliferation? But then, there it was. 
And now, we've got genetic power. So... 
How long is it gonna take for 
that to spread around the globe and, what's gonna 
be done with it? 
It ain't gonna stop with the 
de-extinction of the dinosaurs. I'm not sure I know what 
you're talking about. 
I'm talking about... 
man-made, cataclysmic, 
change. 
What kind of change? 
Change is like death. 
You don't know what it looks like until you're standing at the gates. As a matter of fact, I do have the dinosaurs' best interests in mind. - I'm a paleo-veterinarian. 
- Is that a real thing? 
- That's a real thing. 
- You've seen one? 
No! I hadn't seen one with my own eyes. you know not 
everyone can afford to spend 
their life savings... Claire? 
Hello, hello, um... 
Congresswoman Delgado. I'm Claire, the lead organizer in here. 
Page 4/37
Of course, but if I can just 
get a moment of your time? 
Great. Thank you. 
So, our mission here at the 
Dinosaur Protection Group is 
to secure pivotal 
funding for a... 
That was like 40 seconds. 
You're getting better. 
You gotta stop letting 
your mom shop for you. 
You don't need to insult me 
everytime someone pisses you off. Dude. I'm a doctor. 
Not a telemarketer. 
What is your job again? 
You plug in cords, right? 
It's actually more 
important than it sounds. 
Can I ask you a question? 
Do you have kids? 
Okay. So your kids. 
An entire generation has 
grown up in a world 
where dinosaurs are 
living and breathing. 
But soon you're gonna have 
to watch them go extinct. 
Or not. 
If people like you 
make a difference. 
Great. 
Yes! 
- Claire, it's on. 
- Hey, hey. Turn it up. 
...take preventative action to protect the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar. 
After thorough deliberations, 
the committee has resolved not to recommend any legislative action regarding the de-extinct 
creatures on Isla Nublar. 
This is an act of God, and 
while of course, we feel great Page 5/37
sympathy for these animals, 
we cannot condone 
government involvement, 
on what amounts to a 
privately-owned venture. 
They're all gonna die 
and no one cares. 
We do. 
Give me one second. 
Let's get back to work. 
Okay everyone. Come on. 
- Hello? 
- May I speak with Ms. Dearing? 
- Yes, this is Claire Dearing. 
- Good morning. 
I'm calling for Mr. Benjamin Lockwood's estate. Would you mind holding for a second? Yes, of course. I'll hold. 
Lockwood Estate 
California 
Ms. Dearing, you're early. 
- Would you like to step in? 
- Thank you. 
I will inform Mr. Mills 
that you've arrived. 
John Alfred Hammond. 
The father of Jurassic Park. 
But of course, you know that. 
Hello, Claire, I'm, I'm Eli. 
Mills. 
I work for Ben Lockwood. We 
actually met once, 7-8 years ago, 
- and you don't remember... 
- Of course, I remember. 
- Haven't you run his foundations since... - Since college. Yeah. 
- You remember? 
- Yes! 
Wow, cool. He wanted 
someone young, and, 
idealistic to expand his fortune. 
And I used to be both. 
Follow me. 
Let me give you a 
Page 6/37
bit of history. 
This is where it all began. 
Before the islands, Sorna, 
Jurassic Park, all of it. 
Hammond and Lockwood built 
custom lab in a sub-basement 
extracted the first 
DNA from amber, 
right beneath our feet. 
My goodness! What they 
did here was a miracle. 
- I still believe that. 
- So do I, Claire. 
So do I, and I still believe 
it matters, what happens 
to those animals. 
There is something Mr. Lockwood would very much like you to do, Claire. You can call it a favor 
for an old friend. 
We have, a piece of land. 
A sanctuary. Protected 
by natural barriers, 
fully self-sustaining. A new home where the dinosaurs will be secure... - And free. 
- You're gonna get them out? 
- You're gonna save them? 
- No, Ms. Dearing. 
I'm going to save us. 
We could both use a touch 
of redemption, couldn't we? 
- Lovely to see you again. 
- And you, Mr. Lockwood. 
This was all John 
Hammond's dream. 
To let these creatures 
live in peace. 
So, we have created sanctuary. No fences, no 
cages, no tourists. 
Just as Mother Nature intended. John said it best. 
"These creatures don't 
Page 7/37
need our protection." 
"They need our absence." 
When we were young, 
we both shared this 
passion, John and I. 
What fools we were. 
Trying to run before 
we'd learn to walk. 
As all young men do, I suppose. 
But, we learned. 
Unfortunately in the 
end, it drove us apart. 
Life, teaches us some 
very hard lessons... 
Doesn't it, Claire? 
Yes. 
Sir Benjamin. 
Hmm? 
My bloody medicines. 
- Would you excuse me, Claire? 
- Of course, sir. 
Eli here willl help 
you with the details. 
We will save them. 
With a gift... 
For our children. 
Thank you. 
Iris? 
Does he have children? I thought I saw... there was a little girl. 
Yeah, he has a grandchild. 
His daughter died 
in a car accident. 
- That's awful. 
- Yeah, I know. But they're very close. Really close. 
So, what do you need from me? 
There was a tracking system 
in place at the park. 
- Radio frequency ID chips in each dinosaur. - I remember. 
Right, so if we could 
access that system, 
our ability to locate and capture those Page 8/37
animals safely, will increase ten-fold. We need your handprint 
to access the system. 
But what I really 
need, Claire... 
...is you. 
Moving endangered species 
isn't exactly legal. 
But it's the right thing to do. No one knows this park as well as you do and we need that expertise. 
- How many can you save? 
- Eleven species. For sure, 
I mean, more, if we can. But 
time is against us I'm afraid. 
There is one animal, 
in particular 
that poses a real 
challenge for us. 
- Blue. 
- I didn't know she had a name. But Blue, is potentially the second most intelligent piece of life on this planet. 
And she's the last of her kind. 
She must be preserved. 
She can pick up your scent a mile off. You will never capture her. 
Well... 
We thought you might know 
someone who could help. 
Maybe you can convince him. 
Hey, Owen. 
Owen! 
Oh, boy. 
Hi. 
Back for more, huh? 
Can I buy you a beer? 
You mean bring 'em, or we 
gonna like, go somewhere? 
Seriously? 
I can't believe you 
think that you left me! 
Replay that conversation in 
your head, all right? You said, 
Page 9/37
"You wanna go live in 
your van like a bum?" 
"Go ahead, Owen." 
And I said, "Okay!" 
- So how is that you leaving me? - Because I left. 
- I left you. 
- You left, because... 
- I told you to. 
- And then, I left. 
Because you didn't wanna live in a van on the side of the road. No, no, no. Because you wouldn't let me drive the damn van, 
- for 5 minutes. 
- I'm chivalrous. What can I do? - You are so stubborn. 
- Well. Look at you now. 
- You're saving the world. 
- Well, I'm trying, at least. 
You can't just run away 
from everything, Owen. 
So, you're what? 
Dating an accountant now? 
An insurance actuary? 
Your skin looks nice. 
- Dermatologist? 
- Owen? 
- Does he check you for moles? - Stop. 
Ventriloquist? 
- This is not why we're here, okay? - Yeah, I know why we're here. Lockwood's little 
flunkie called me. 
Rescue op. 
Save the dinosaurs from an 
island that's about to explode. - What could go wrong? 
- I'm going. 
- Don't! 
- I don't have a choice. 
- What, of course you have a choice. - So what, I should just... 
Page 10/37
Build my own cabin, play 
pool and drink beer all day 
while these dinosaurs 
go extinct? 
Yeah. I like pool. 
Blue is alive. 
- Jesus, Claire. 
- You raised her, Owen. You... 
You spent years of your 
life working with her. 
You're just gonna let her die? 
Well, yeah. 
Come on. You're a 
better man than... 
you think you are. 
You should write for 
fortune cookies. 
Forget it. I... 
There's a chartered flight 
leaving tomorrow morning. 
You're on the manifest. I just 
thought I should let you know. 
Back up! Back off. 
Take it easy. Echo. 
Jeez. There's plenty of food. 
You guys been eating sugar or something? You're hyper today. 
Okay, okay, back off. 
Thank you, Blue. 
Did you get that? 
Relax. 
You're more likely to die riding a horse than in a plane. 
No, I would not because I wouldn't get on a horse. My chances are zero. - Planes are the safest way to travel. - You call this a plane? 
My cousin had a drone 
bigger than this. 
Owen! 
Franklin, later! 
Get in the plane. 
Didn't think you were 
gonna ever show up.

- This is Zia Rodriguez. 
- Zia. 
- Hey, how you doing? 
- I'm good. How are you? 
- Good. 
- Franklin Webb. 
Systems analyst. 
Nervous flyer? 
Would you ride a thousand pound horse with big wheels on the sides? I rode a motorcycle through the jungle with a pack of raptors. We're not compatible. 
Maisie! 
Maisie. 
Maisie! 
Come out. 
You silly sausage! 
You'll be the death of me. 
You know one day, my 
heart might really stop. 
Then what would you do? 
- Go live in the forest with the lions? - There are no lions in the forest. Your grandfather's 
been asking for you. 
Really? 
So you go see your grandfather and you go straight to your bath. 
- I don't want a bath. 
- What?! 
Queen's English, girl. Bath. 
- Bath. Bath. 
- Bath. Bath. 
Not bath. You're 
not a wild animal. 
Stop. 
- Hi, Grandpa. 
- Ah, there you are. 
Come over and sit by me. 
- I've missed you. 
- I went by all the way through the Cretaceous, to the 
Jurassic in one day. 
Page 12/37
My. What did you see? 
Nothing but herbivores. There 
was one T-Rex, though. 
Casualties, of course. 
Ours included. 
She jumped out of her skin. 
You have your mother's 
wicked sense of humor. 
Do I look like her? 
Oh, yes. 
You could be her mirror image. Did my mother ever 
visit the park? 
Once. 
A long time ago. 
She would have saved 
them too, you know. 
She would have saved them all. Claire. 
Ken Wheatley. Welcome back. 
What kind of operation 
you've got going on here? 
Mr. Lockwood takes his humanitarian efforts very seriously. 
Where's the raptor wrangler? 
Animal behaviourist. Owen Grady. Hey, Owen. Ken Wheatley. 
And you're our, 
great white hunter? 
Yes, I'm the expedition's 
facilitator. 
Oh, God! It's hot! 
It's about to get a 
whole lot hotter. 
Bug spray? 
Bug spray? 
The T-Rex should be 
dead by now, right? 
Yeah, well it's impossible 
to know the max life span 
of a clone in a completely 
different environment. 
Take a caveman that 
would've lived 20 years. 
Page 13/37
Feed him prime meals, give him healthcare, he's gonna live... Five times as long. 
So, she'd be dead by now. 
Right? 
Bad memories? 
Some are good. 
What was that? 
Is it the T-Rex? 
I have to see this. 
Hey, Miss? 
Miss! This area's not secured. Look at that. 
Never thought I'd see 
one in real life. 
She's beautiful. 
Shall we? 
Okay! Let's go. 
Okay, I'm good. 
Viewing system... 
Come on, tiger. You 
know what you're doing? 
After you, tiger. 
Are we sure these biometric 
chips are still transmitting? 
Battery would be dead by now. 
The dinosaur is the battery. They're powered by body heat and movement. Hand. 
How much longer until... 
I'm in. 
There's a large concentration 
on the East Dock. 
That's our boat. We've already captured a bunch of them. 
Without the tracking system? 
The big herbivores were easy to find. Can you isolate that raptor? 
- I need a species code. 
- D-9. 
There she is. 
- I'm gonna need to borrow your truck. - I'm coming with you. 
We don't know what kind of 
Page 14/37
condition she might be in. 
Miss, things could 
get hairy out there. 
These are powerful sedatives. 
One too many, and she could 
have respiratory failure. 
Also, I'm not as soft and witless as your comment implies. 
Let's go, Beefcake. 
Oh, Owen... 
Be careful. Okay? 
If I don't make it back... 
Remember. 
You're the one who made me come. I'll be all right. 
We're not gonna get any closer if we're riding this thing. 
- You should stop here. 
- Pull up! 
Move out. Look alive. 
Stay alive. 
- We got your back, brother. 
- Yeah. 
Claire, I'm gonna have 
to track for a moment. 
I'll need you to be my 
eyes if she runs. Copy? 
Copy that. 
Wheatley, I'm on a fresh sign. Wait for my signal. 
There you are. 
Hey, Girl. You miss me? 
Easy. Hey! Hey. 
I brought you something. 
There you go. 
That's right. 
Okay. 
You know me. 
Eyes on me. 
You know me. 
That's right. 
That's right. 
Hold your.... 
I told you to wait 
Page 15/37
for my signal! 
Back your men off, right now. 
No, don't shoot her! 
Wheatley, you son of a bitch! 
Owen! What are you doing? 
Owen. 
You shoot me... 
And that animal dies. 
I think we have the drop 
on you, sweetheart. 
She's losing blood. 
And if I don't treat her... 
She'll never make 
it back to camp. 
How ' bout this then... 
If that animal 
dies, I shoot you. 
You're gonna take care of her. 
Let's move out! 
Get to the car, let's go! 
Let's get out of here. 
No, no! 
Wait, are they protecting us? 
What's going on? 
I don't think so. 
Why am I here? 
Hey, Mills. We gathered the dinos. Mission accomplished. 
And just in the nick of time. 
Wheatley what the hell is going on there? We're a day behind schedule already. I want that money in the bank by the time I get back, alright? 
Okay, listen to me. 
No more delays, okay? 
If we don't get... not 
now, Maisie, thank you. 
- Mr. Mills, are the dinosaurs... - I said not now! 
I'm sorry, honey. This 
is an important call. 
If you would go up to the library, I'll meet you up there in a few minutes. - Okay. 
Page 16/37
- Okay? 
I'll tell you all about it. 
I promise. 
Okay. 
Wheatley? 
You get, those 
animals, here, now. 
I want that bonus. 
We got the blue one. 
- Bring her to me first. 
- All right. 
Hello? Can anyone hear me? 
Hello? 
Hello? Is anybody there? 
Can anybody copy? 
I'm trying everything. 
It's jammed. 
"It's a tough job, son. Build your people skills." Yeah, thanks, Dad. That's it. 
Proximity alert. 
Something's coming. 
Where does that tunnel lead? 
Well, it connects to 
the rest of the... 
park. 
It's the T-Rex. It's the T-Rex. Claire, it's the T-Rex. 
It's the T-Rex. 
Will you stop? It's 
not the T-Rex. 
- Probably. 
- Probably? 
Lava! Lava! 
Lava... 
Deep breaths, Franklin... 
- See? Not a T-Rex! 
- This is bigger! 
Claire, what do we do? 
What do we do? 
It's stuck! Chair! 
Come on! Let's go. 
Come on, Franklin! 
We made it! Yeah! 
Page 17/37
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, Claire! 
Yes, let's go! 
Claire. 
Holy... 
Run! 
Run! 
Run! 
Go! Go. 
Get in! 
Owen! 
We didn't die. We just 
fell from a cliff. 
We're alive! We're alive. 
Franklin, move! 
No, no, no! 
Claire, we're gonna 
sink, water's leaking! 
We need to get out! 
Franklin, watch out! 
I wanna go home! 
Owen. Owen! 
Owen? 
Move. Move! 
No, no, no... 
Owen! 
Where is he going? 
Okay, don't panic. Don't panic. - We're not gonna make it, Claire. - We are. We are. 
Take a deep breath. 
- Where's Zia? 
- It was a double-cross. They took her. She must be with Blue. Hey, 
can you still track 'em? 
Not anymore. 
It was a lie. 
It was a lie. Bastards! 
It was all a lie! 
Not all of it. 
Move! Move! 
Anything of value, I want out of here. Let's go. 
What are you doing? 
Well just put it up and we'll tow it on. Page 18/37
Let's go! 
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. 
Wait up. Wait up. Stop that truck. Stop it. 
Hey, sweetheart. Hey, girl. 
Hey, girl. 
You're gonna feel that 
when you wake up. 
Hey, put your weapon down! 
- They have Zia. They're loading out. - They already have the dinosaurs. Why do they need us? 
They needed the tracking 
system to capture Blue. 
There she is. She 
don't look good. 
We need to get on that boat. 
- The rock's good. We're safe on the rock. - Just get up, Franklin. 
All right, boat's good. 
I'm on it. 
Get on the boat! Get 
on the boat now! 
Get to that truck! 
- Franklin! 
- Hey, get that truck going. 
- Are you okay? 
- Am I dead? 
Not yet, kid. 
Come on! Give me your hand. 
Hold on! 
Mr. Mills? Your 
visitor's waiting. 
Mr. Eversoll. 
It's a pleasure to meet you in person after all this time. How are you? Excuse me, where 
are the dinosaurs? 
The dinosaurs... are en route. 
Oh, so am I supposed 
to sell these ones? 
You don't need to worry, okay? 
They will be here soon. 
I don't really work 
Page 19/37
with amateurs, 
so I'm gonna contact my 
buyers and call this off. 
They will be here tomorrow and your buyers won't be disappointed. Trust me. Whatever their interest. Agricultural, industrial, sport-hunting. 
We will have something to suit them. Eleven species. 
Each with unique, 
bio-pharmaceutical properties. I estimate $4 million 
per species. 
$4 million is a slow 
Tuesday where I'm from. 
You're wasting my time. 
You ready to make $100 
million on a Tuesday? Huh? 
All of this is in the past. 
Now, I wanna talk to 
you about the future. 
I'll give you ten minutes. 
The whole point of selling 
the Isla Nublar dinosaurs 
is to finance our 
future operations here. 
It's, uh... seed money. 
Call it an overture to 
something much more ambitious. Yeah. And more 
lucrative, I guess. 
Right. We've reactivated 
the old facilities, 
updated the technology and imported the best geneticists from around the world. This operation has been 
many years in the planning. 
Genetic power is an 
uncharted frontier. 
The potential for growth is 
more than you can fathom. 
This way, please. 
If the entire run of our sorry history has taught us one 
Page 20/37
irrevocable lesson, 
it's that man is 
inevitably drawn to war. 
And is willing to use any 
means necessary to win it. 
You're gonna weaponize them? 
We've been using animals 
in combat for centuries. 
Horses, elephants. 
The Soviets used disease-bearing rats 
against the Germans in Stalingrad. 
- Yes, yes. 
- Our geneticists, 
have created a direct descendant, 
of Henry Wu's masterpiece. 
The animal that took 
down Jurassic World. 
Indominus Rex. 
Her DNA, retrieved 
from the island, 
way before its destruction, 
forms the architecture 
of a completely new creature. 
And Smurfette’s fragments remains of a shard of lump of clay. A lump of Clay. 
Her DNA, retrieved from Smurfs The Lost Village 
before its absorb Gargamel's magic as she never was a real Smurf and thanks to evil wizard Gargamel for his made her out of a lump of clay. Every bone and muscle designed 
for hunting and killing. 
And thanks to Owen Grady's research, 
it follows human command. 
We call it, the Indoraptor. 
Grandpa? Grandpa? 
- Grandpa. 
- Maisie. 
What are you doing up? 
There was a man here today, with Mr. 
Mills. 
It was probably just some business 
about the Century, is all. 
I heard them talking. 
They're going to sell the dinosaurs. 
They're bringing them here. 
Page 21/37
I'm sure you misunderstood. 
- I know what I heard, Grandpa. - Maisie... 
it's way past your bedtime. 
Let's talk about 
this in the morning. 
- But... 
- Maisie. 
I'll find out tomorrow. 
Go to bed. 
- Good night. 
- Good night, my heart. 
Jesus! 
Hold on. Just a little longer. Oh, my God, you guys are alive! Look what they've done to her. - Who are these assholes? 
- Animal traffickers. 
Look how they're treating them. They're not gonna take them to a sanctuary, - they're gonna sell them. 
- Not Blue. 
- They need her for something else. - Like what? 
I don't know, but she's... 
She's hemorrhaging and I don't have instruments to keep her alive. Claire, come here. 
Put your hand here. 
Steady pressure. 
Hey, hey. 
I can't take the bullet out without a transfusion from another animal. Which one of you guys 
know how to find a vein? 
I did a blood drive 
with Red Cross. 
Great! Okay. 
Franklin, you take 
over for Claire. 
- No, no, no, no, no... 
- Franklin! Now! 
Steady pressure. 
Oh, my God! Oh, my God. 
Page 22/37
Is it in my mouth? Did 
it get in my mouth? 
- Sure? 
- You're good. 
All of the animals 
should be sedated. 
Look for any type of () their blood type should be close enough. 
Look for carnivores, with two or three fingers. No more than three. I think there is one on board. 
You've got to be kidding me. 
She's tranqed. 
Okay, okay. I got it, come on. 
Okay. 
Are you okay? 
I'm okay! 
Come on. 
- You're gonna have to do it. 
- I can't 
The skin is too thick, I'd have to use both hands to put pressure on the vein. - You gotta do it. 
- I, I can't, I can't reach... 
You're gonna have 
to climb up there. 
Oh, I'm not... 
I'm not gonna climb up there. 
You'll be okay. It's 
like riding a bull. 
Riding a bull? I didn't grow up in a rodeo or wherever you came from. She's asleep now. I can't say that she's gonna be asleep a minute from now. - So, get up. 
- Okay, fine. 
Oh my God, she stinks. Jesus! 
Good job. 
You're making this 
look totally normal. 
You're gonna have to jam it in here. It's really thick skin. 
Ready? 
One, two... 
Page 23/37
Owen! 
It's working. 
Who left this open? 
I got it. 
The bars! 
I can get through here. Come on. Jump! Owen! 
Did you see that? 
Please tell me you 
have the blood. 
This is Delta. She is one of 
the four little therapods. 
One of the survivors 
from the second group. 
Now, watch this. 
If I show any sign of 
weakness, whatsoever... 
You see that? 
Day 176. Blue is showing 
unprecedented levels of compliance. Here I am with Blue. 
She's a therapod 
from a new group. 
If I show signs of weakness... Hey... 
I'm okay. 
She... 
She's pretty extraordinary. 
Blue... 
displaying levels of 
interest, concern, 
hyperintelligence, 
cognitive bonding... 
See that? 
Tilting her head, she's 
playing for us... 
Increased eye movement, 
she's curious. 
She's showing empathy. 
Okay, I'm gonna make an incision on her leg to remove the bullet. It's a lot of muscle tissue. 
She's gonna be okay. 
Blue is the key. 
Page 24/37
You have Blue... 
You'll get these raptors 
to do anything. 
You're sure she'll live? 
If it dies, we have 
blood samples. 
No, that's not good enough. The raptor is a behavioural specimen. - We need her in good health. 
- I didn't shoot the damn thing. What do you want me to do, huh? You don't have the faintest 
comprehension of what I'm doing here. Do you understand the complexity of creating an entirely new lifeform? No, but I understand the 
complexity of paying for it. Okay? All your money will have been wasted if I don't get Blue here in good health. To get the next iteration 
under control, 
it needs to form a familial bond with a closely related genetic link. - English, Henry. 
- It needs a mother! 
Blue's DNA will be part of the next Indoraptor's make up. 
So it will be genetically coded to recognize her authority 
and assume her traits. 
Empathy. Obedience. Everything the prototype you have now is missing. - Okay, so how long is this gonna take? - It's not a sprint, Mr. Mills. - It's a marathon. 
- Marathon sounds expensive. 
Besides, time is running out 
and so is my patience, Henry. 
You have to understand. This 
is all uncharted territory. 
A wolf, genetically, is barely distinguishable from a bulldog. But within that gray area.... 
is heart. 
Page 25/37
Spare me the poetry, Henry. Can you do it? Can you do it? 
Yes, I can do it. 
Well then, do it! 
Thank you. 
God, you brainy asshole. 
Hey, hey! Maisie! 
What is that? What is it? 
Keep her in there, and 
keep the door locked. 
- You want to keep her locked in? - That's exactly what I want. 
Sir Benjamin needs 
to see her now. 
I believe it's important. 
We're here. 
Where? 
She got a heartbeat? 
Yeah. Do you? 
We need blood samples. 
I'm not here to help you 
reset the food chain, 
so take your own damn samples. 
What a nasty woman. 
Hey! 
- What the hell is going on? 
- I was... 
I needed an extra pair of hands. He volunteered. 
- You deck crew? 
- Aye-aye. 
We're logging out. Follow me. 
Does that mean we're leaving the ship? Right now? 
That means what that means. 
Now get moving. Come on, follow me! - Shit! 
- Oh, no. 
He's not gonna make it. 
- We have to help him. 
- Stay here. I'll get him. 
There's no time. Let's go. 
Roll out! 
Where are they taking them? 
Page 26/37
We're about to find out. 
Yes! 
Lockwood's Estate? 
He must have one big-ass garage. 
Did you really think you 
could get away with it? 
In my own house. 
You entrusted me. 
To guide your fortune 
into the future. 
- I have done that. 
- Damn you! 
Pick up that phone. 
I want you to call the police. 
It'll be easier if the 
story comes from you. 
As you say, sir. 
You know, I've been thinking... 
John Hammond was right. 
It was an unholy 
thing that you did. 
I'm not the only guilty 
one here, am I, sir? 
Hey. 
We hit that town and we call 
the cavalry to shut this down. 
Hello. You should've 
stayed on the island. 
Better odds. 
Hi, Claire. 
I just wanted to 
come and apologize. 
I didn't want to bring 
you into any of this, 
but it was the only way 
that we can get the raptor. 
And we needed it. 
Come on. 
So, what? 
This is it? 
I mean, you're a smart guy who started a foundation to cure cancer. But instead, you... What? 
- Sell endangered species? 
Page 27/37
- I saved these animals. 
You betrayed a dying 
man for money. 
Claire, I admire your idealism, but 
we both exploited these animals. 
At least, I have the 
integrity to admit it. 
- I never, ever did anything remotely illegal. - You authorized the creation of the Indominus Rex. You exploited a living 
thing, in a cage, for money. 
How is that different? 
Huh? And you. 
The man who proved raptors 
can follow orders. 
You never thought about the 
applications of your research, Owen? 
How many millions a trained 
predator might be worth? 
You two... 
You're the parents 
of the new world. 
Hey! Let him go. 
- Owen? 
- I think I'll break it. 
Let him go. 
Claire, it's.... 
Say the word, we 
got them, Mills. 
Well, as far as everybody else is 
concerned, they burned up on the island. Looks like a full house. 
Roger that. 
- Good evening. 
- Good evening, good evening. 
Welcome. Welcome. 
This guy, he's Ricky Rathrow. 
Darius Pharmaceuticals. 
Right. 
And the guy in the beard? He's 
a proxy for Gregor Aldorich. 
Slovenian arms dealer. 
Well, he only wants carnivores. 
Two of them. 
Page 28/37
Looks like Lockwood's gonna 
have a very good night. 
Will he be joining us? 
That's very unlikely. 
Grandpa? 
Grandpa? 
Grandpa, wake up. 
Grandpa. 
Grandpa, wake up. Wake up! 
Iris! 
Iris! 
It's over. 
What a tragedy. 
I suppose now he's gone, 
- you'll be looking for another situation. - No. 
Maisie needs me. 
I am her guardian now. 
What she needs is no 
longer your concern. 
You don't understand 
her the way I do. 
I understand her value. 
But I raised her. 
I raised... 
both of them. 
- Please, Mr. Mills. 
- Goodbye, Iris. 
Do you remember the first 
time you saw a dinosaur? 
First time you see them, 
it's like, a miracle. 
You read about them in books. 
You see the bones in museums. 
But you don't really believe it. Kind of like myths. 
And then you see... 
the first one alive. 
This is not your fault. 
- But it is. 
- No. 
This one's on me. 
I showed them the way. 
Now, listen. 
Page 29/37
You and I are gonna have plenty 
of time to talk about this later. - If there is a later. 
- Yes, there is. 
I got a cabin to finish. 
What is that? 
Well, look who just woke up. 
We're getting out of here. 
Welcome, ladies, gentlemen... 
To this extraordinary evening. 
Let's dive right in, 
with lot number 1. 
The ankylosaurus. 
This is a herbivorous quadruped. 
Late Cretaceous. 
This is one of the largest 
armored dinosaurs. 
Known by paleontologists 
as a "living tank". 
- What are you doing? 
- Save it. 
- Are you sure about this? 
- Nope. 
I have $4 million dollars. 
Anyone with 5? 
$5 million. $5 million. 
Do I hear 6? 
$6 million. Thank you. Any increase on six? Seven. $7 million. 
$8 million. $9 million on the phones. Do I hear $10 million? 
$10 million. Once, twice... 
Sold! To the gentleman from Indonesia. Congratulations. 
Lot number 2, ladies 
and gentlemen. 
Juvenile Allosaurus. 
A fierce and 
aggressive predator. 
Sold! 
Sold! 
Sold! 
Wonderful. Wonderful. 
Okay... 
Page 30/37
Hey, hey you! Look 
at me, look at me! 
Hey! 
Okay. 
You're welcome. 
Hey! Wait. Please, please, wait. That's Lockwood's granddaughter. Hey. Hey, kid. 
You wanna come 
down out of there? 
Do you remember me? 
My name is Claire. What's yours? Maisie. 
- Maisie Lockwood. 
- Maisie. 
This is my friend, Owen. 
I saw you, with the velociraptors. And Blue. 
Oh, yeah? 
You like dinosaurs? 
So do I. Tell you what, you 
come on down from there, 
I'll tell you everything you 
need to know about Blue. 
That sound all right? 
Alright. Yeah. Come on down. 
Sweetie... 
We need some help finding 
your grandfather. 
Can you take us to him? 
No. 
You made it down here 
all by yourself, huh. 
Brave kid. Looks like 
you could use a friend. 
He's gone! 
So listen, I'll tell you what. 
We're just about to go and find our friends and then get the heck outta here. You wanna come with us? 
We could use a friend, too. 
Sold! 
And now, ladies and 
gentlemen, that we are 
Page 31/37
halfway through the evening... We'd like to offer a 
special treat to our 
discriminating buyers. 
This evening, we will preview, a new asset that we've 
been developing. 
A creature of the future, 
made from pieces of the past. 
Ladies and gentlemen, 
please be warned. 
This is the perfect blend of the two most dangerous creatures... that have ever walked the earth. We call it... 
The Indoraptor. 
The perfect weapon 
for the modern age. 
Built for combat. 
With tactical responses more 
acute than any human soldier. 
What is that thing? 
They made it. 
Mr. Mills, and the other man. 
What man? 
Him. 
Designed by Mr. Henry Wu... 
Its' intelligence quotient 
comparable to the velociraptor. Bio-specs include 
hyper sense of smell, 
trained to respond to a pulse 
coded, laser-targeting system. Enabling it to isolate and track prey in complex environments. 
Voila! 
Now first, your laser 
sets the target. 
Once locked on, the acoustic 
signal triggers the attack. 
This animal is relentless. 
Now, modifications are 
still being made. 
$20 million! 
Page 32/37
Well, this is a prototype. 
Not for sale. 
21! 
Well, it is still a 
prototype, but... 
23! 
24! 
$24 million. 
$25 million! 
Do I hear 26? 
That thing can't 
leave this building. 
26! 
Any advance on 26? $27 million! 
What are you doing? This 
animal is not for sale. 
Let them have it. We have 
to give them a taste. 
- He's a prototype. 
- This prototype is worth $28 million right now. Relax. We'll make some more. 
So will they. 
Hey, buddy. 
You thinking what I'm thinking? 
Once, twice, sold! 
To the Russian from... 
Congratulations for purchasing 
this magnificent animal... 
Get this thing out of here! 
Mills! 
Mills, where are you? 
I want my bonus. 
Holy cow. What are you? 
I didn't see you on the island. 
You are a tough guy. 
Look at that beauty. 
You're some kind of hot-rod. 
With pretty teeth. 
This will make a perfect 
centerpiece for my necklace. 
Open up... 
Move ! Move! 
Don't! 
You two, deserve each other. 
Page 33/37
Maisie, come with me. 
You got your money. Walk away. What are you gonna do, huh? 
We're gonna stop this. 
- All of it! 
- How? 
What, you're gonna go back in time before Hammond decides to play god? You can't put it 
back in the box! 
- We have to try. 
- It's too late. 
Maisie, come. 
So, you're gonna take 
care of her now? Huh? 
You have no idea what she is. 
What do you think drove Hammond and Lockwood apart, huh? 
Lockwood never had a grandchild. He just wanted his 
daughter back. 
And he had the technology. 
He created another. 
He made her again. 
Go! 
Come on! 
Get this to Mills. Be very careful. It's extremely valuable. 
You, I need blood samples 
from the raptor. 
Don't just stand 
there like an idiot! 
Get me 50 cc carfentanil and a lobotomy kit. It's right there. Now! Come on. Come on. 
I need this raptor's blood. 
Sure. Go ahead. 
Where is that kit? 
Okay, now listen to me. 
It's better if we cooperated. 
But I'm gonna get this blood, 
- With or without your help. 
- This blood's contaminated. 
I designed this animal myself. Page 34/37
It's pure. Every cell of 
her body was created in a 
most controlled environment under the most demanding conditions. 
Yeah, but I did an intravenous 
blood transfusion with a T-Rex, 
so, it's a sock drawer in there. You what? 
Hold, stop! What are you doing? 
Saving your life. 
Yes! 
Stop! 
Don't move. 
Now, step away from that cage. 
Now. 
Run. Run! 
Run! 
You see that? 
That's hydrogen cyanide. If it reaches the containment level, it will kill them all. The ventilation system is down. 
Can you bring it back up? 
The server's unresponsive. I 
have to reboot the whole system. - So reboot it. 
- I'm trying. 
- Franklin, we don't have time. 
- I know, I know, I know. 
Okay. 
Go! Go! 
You're okay. Put pressure on it. Don't look at it. Look at me. 
- You have to go find her. 
- I can't leave you here. 
Go, I'll be fine. 
Run! 
Maisie, stay down! 
Follow me. I know a 
way on the outside. 
Come on. 
Come on! 
This way! 
I got you. 
Hey! 
Page 35/37
What the hell? 
Hey! 
Hey! You good? 
- Yeah. You? 
- Nope! 
Hey, we have a problem downstairs. 
I need you to come see this. 
They're all dying. 
The blast damaged the 
ventilation system. 
We did everything we could. 
I can open the gates from here. 
Claire, be careful. 
We're not on an island anymore. 
Claire.... 
You press that button, 
there is no going back. 
We can't let them die. 
I had to. 
They're alive. 
Like me. 
Hey, girl. 
Owen. 
It's okay. She won't hurt us. 
Blue, come with me. 
We'll take you to a 
safe place, okay? 
How many times do you 
have to see the evidence? 
How many times must 
a point be made? 
We're causing our 
own extinction. 
Too many red lines 
have been crossed. 
And our home has, in fundamental 
ways, been polluted by 
avarice, and 
political megalomania. 
Genetic power has now been unleashed. And of course, that's gonna be catastrophic. This change was inevitable, from the moment we brought the first dinosaur back from extinction. We convince ourselves that 
Page 36/37
sudden change, is something that 
happens outside the normal order 
of things, like a car crash. 
Or that it's beyond our control, like a fatal illness. We don't conceive of sudden, 
radical, irrational change as 
woven into the very 
fabric of existence. 
Yet, I can assure you, 
it most assuredly is. 
And it's happening now. 
Humans and dinosaurs are now 
gonna be forced to co-exist. 
These creatures were 
here before us. 
And if we're not careful, 
they're gonna be here after. 
We're gonna have to adjust to new 
threats that we can't imagine. 
We've entered a new era. 
Welcome, to Jurassic World.

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT 
Written by  
Christopher McQuarrie 
Based on the Television Series Created by Bruce Geller
1 BLACK 1 And from out of the blackness, a familiar voice. 
VOICE (O.S.) 
Do you, Ethan, take Julia to be 
your lawfully wedded wife? 
FADE UP to reveal ETHAN HUNT, standing in the impossibly bright sun, wearing a suit, smiling warmly. 
I do. 
ETHAN 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: A BRIDE in a simple white dress and a wedding veil. We can just make out her lovely face. A face we might recognize. She smiles. Nervous, happy, deeply in love. 
VOICE (O.S.) 
To have and to hold. To love, 
cherish, honor and protect. 
I do. 
ETHAN 
VOICE (O.S.) 
To shield from terrors known and unknown. To lie, to deceive 
What? 
ETHAN VOICE 
To live a double life. To 
needlessly place her in harms way, fail to prevent her abduction 
Wh- No. 
ETHAN 
VOICE (O.S.) 
To rob her of her innocence, erase her identity, force her into hiding, take away all she's known in a selfish, futile, fleeting attempt to escape your true self. 
Stop. 
ETHAN 
VOICE (O.S.) 
And Julia... Do you choose to accept?
Cherry Rev. (Nov 16 '17) - 1908 1aA.
Don’t. I do. Don’t. 
ETHAN JULIA ETHAN 
REVEAL: The Source of the voice: THE MINISTER, looking up from his bible at Ethan. He is: 
SOLOMON LANE 
You should have killed me, Ethan. 
Ethan looks back at Julia as a blinding flash fills the sky behind her. He grabs her, holds her tight as the light consumes them, incinerates them and: 
Cherry Rev. (Nov 16 '17) - 1908 1A.
2 INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 2 
Ethan's eyes open, waking from his nightmare. He's on a cot in a dark and barren room. Rain batters the dormer windows. A faint knocking snaps him out of bed, pistol in hand. 
3 INT. NARROW STAIRWELL - NIGHT 3 
A long set of stairs down to a door. Ethan opens it TO REVEAL A SILHOUETTED DELIVERY MAN in a rain slicked coat and hat. 
MAN 
Fate whispers to the warrior... 
ETHAN 
You cannot withstand the storm. 
MAN 
And the warrior whispers back... 
ETHAN 
I am the storm. 
The Man hands over the package and walks off. 
4 INT. SAFEHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 4 
Ethan sits at a table and opens the envelope. Inside is a book: Homer’s The Odyssey. Inside that is a small, REEL-TO REEL TAPE PLAYER with a tiny needle protruding from a depression in one reel. Ethan presses his finger to it, leaving a drop of blood there. 
It’s absorbed and the recorder plays. He sucks his finger as a projector pops up from the tape player, displaying images on the wall. The first image is that of SOLOMON LANE. 
Cherry Rev. (Nov 16 '17) - 1908 2.
VOICE (ON TAPE) 
Good evening, Mr. Hunt. Despite two 
years in captivity, Solomon Lane 
refuses to divulge any details 
about his network of rogue 
government agents, formerly known 
as the Syndicate. 
INSET: ARMED MASKED MEN in black tactical gear, a hit squad, standing over several DEAD BODIES. 
VOICE (CONT’D) 
The CIA’s Special Activities 
Division has relentlessly hunted 
Lane’s elite army of hostiles, but 
many remain unknown and at large. 
RAPID-FIRE IMAGES OF DESTRUCTION. 
VOICE (CONT’D) 
To survive, they have abandoned 
Lane’s vision of political anarchy 
and adopted a policy of full-scale 
terror-for-hire. The members of 
this extremist splinter cell refer 
to themselves as “The Apostles.” 
IMAGE: Thumbnails of emails and text messages stamped NSA: CLASSIFIED. 
VOICE (CONT’D) 
Intercepted communiques decrypted 
by the NSA indicate the Apostles 
number one client is this man: 
INSET: A SILHOUETTE of a man, a nothing. 
VOICE (CONT’D) 
An unidentified terrorist known 
only by the code name: John Lark. 
IMAGE: DOCTORS treat SICK AND SUFFERING CIVILIANS in a second world medical facility. 
VOICE (CONT’D) 
One month ago, using information 
provided by Lark, the Apostles 
stole the Smallpox virus from the 
CDC in Reston Virginia. 
Cherry Rev. (Nov 16 '17) - 1908 3.
IMAGE: A map of the Indian subcontinent. INSET: The region of Kashmir. 
VOICE (CONT’D) 
The virus was released in Indian 
controlled Kashmir, causing an 
outbreak along the borders of China 
and Pakistan and threatening one 
third of the world’s population. 
The virus has been contained, but 
evidence suggests this attack was a 
merely test run for a more 
ambitious operation... 
FACING IMAGE: The handwritten pages of a madman’s writings. INSET: DR. NILS DELBRUUK (40s): 
VOICE (CONT’D) 
Three weeks ago, Lark contacted 
this man: Norwegian nuclear weapons 
specialist Nils Delbruuk. Dr. 
Delbruuk’s security clearance was 
revoked after publishing a fiercely 
anti-religious manifesto. Twenty four hours after communicating with 
Lark, Delbruuk vanished. 
IMAGE: THREE METALLIC SPHERES marked with nuclear symbols. INSET: More decrypted documents marked CLASSIFIED. 
VOICE (CONT’D) 
Meanwhile, Lark has contacted 
elements of the Russian underworld 
who are in possession of three 
plutonium cores stolen from the 
missile base in Kolima. 
The next page shows a schematic of a device, watermarked U.S NUCLEAR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM: CLASSIFIED. 
VOICE (CONT’D) 
N.E.S.T. estimates that a man with 
Delbruuk’s knowledge using the 
materials in play, could complete 
three five-megaton nuclear devices 
in as little as seventy two hours. 
These devices would be man-portable 
and deployable anywhere on Earth 
overnight. In the hands of John 
Lark and the Apostles, the 
consequences are unimaginable. 
Ethan rubs his eyes. This is bad. 
Tan Rev. (Jan 31 '18) - 1518 3aA.
VOICE (CONT’D) 
Your mission, should you choose to 
accept it, is to identify and 
apprehend John Lark before he can 
acquire functioning nuclear 
weapons. If you or any members of 
your IMF team are caught or killed, 
the Secretary will disavow any 
knowledge of your actions. Good 
luck, Ethan. This message will self 
destruct in 5 seconds. 
The player stops. Ethan places the pages back in the book and closes it. A beat later, smoke emerges from the book as: 
4A INT. ABANDONED UNDERPASS - NIGHT 4A * 
An abandoned covered railway - open on one side, revealing * the city beyond. The other side is lined with cavernous dark * archways forming perpendicular tunnels to God knows where. *

4D EXT. TUNNEL 4D * 
Ethan and Benji approach the car as it comes to a stop. Three * men climb out: A man we will call THE EUROPEAN and TWO * GUNMEN. GUNMAN 1 lingers by the car. Gunman 2 sticks to The * European as he approaches. * 
There is something about him - the way his look lingers too * long. The way we can’t read what he’s thinking. After a beat. * 
ETHAN * 
Did you bring it? * 
The European studies them, studies the area. * 
ETHAN (CONT’D) * 
Are we finally gonna do this or * not? * 
The European steps closer studies Ethan and Benji. Benji * studies the gunmen. * 
THE EUROPEAN * 
I have survived in this business *

THE EUROPEAN (ON COMM) (CONT’D) * 
There’s talk in my circle of a man. * 
A terrorist who calls himself Lark. * 
He moves like a ghost, they say. * 
Are you this ghost, I wonder? Or *

The European thinks. Has to guess. He motions. Gunman 1 opens * the car door, pulls out a case and brings it forward. He * opens it TO REVEAL: * 
Three plutonium cores. Ethan nods to Benji who pulls out a * phone, activates a Geiger counter on the screen. It’s already * reading small amounts of radiation. He pulls out a strip of * metal and touches one of the spheres. The counter goes wild. * 
THE EUROPEAN * 
What is that? * 
BENJI * 
This is a Geiger counter and this * 
is Beryllium rod, which is causing *

ETHAN (CONT’D) * 
...we really need that money Luther * 
EUROPEAN * 
Kill them. * 
BANG. A shot rings out. The European drops. BANG BANG, his * gunmen drop. Ethan and Benji scatter as more shots ring out. * 
Ethan runs for the case. A spray of bullets drive to the * side. He runs for cover. Benji manages to grab the case, but * the bullets prevent him from going after Ethan. He runs the * other way, taking cover behind a pillar. * 
ETHAN * 
Luther? Do you copy Luther? Luther *

VOICE (ON COMM) * 
Luther’s not in right now. Hunt. * 
Benji and Ethan share are a look of dread, separated by the * treacherous width of the tunnel. * 
ETHAN *

Silence. Ethan thinks for a beat. ** 8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230722
Tan Rev. (Jan 31 '18) - 1518 3eA. 
ETHAN (CONT’D) * 
Benji, get the car. * 
Benji peeks at the car, way down the tunnel. A SHADOW steps * into the open and fires. Bullets pepper the brick near his * face. He recoils. * 
BENJI * 
I don’t think I can. * 
ETHAN * 
Benji. Get. The car. * 
Benji realizes, pulls a phone from his pocket, activates the * screen. A second later, the BWM fires up and screams to life, * screeching down the alley and into the archway next to Ethan. * 
Ethan e is a few feet from the car, looking down a tunnel at * the city beyond. He is home free. * 
Benji grabs the case. Readies himself to run to Ethan. But * bullets drive Benji back. Another moment of dread * realization. Benji is trapped. * 
He throws the case across the tunnel. It lands at Ethan’s * feet. Ethan has a clean getaway. But only if he leaves his * friend behind. * 
BENJI * 
Go. * 
ETHAN * 
Benji... * 
BENJI * 
Go. * 
VOICE (ON COMM) * 
We’ll make you a deal, Hunt. Give * 
us the case and we won’t kill your *

LUTHER * 
DON’T DO IT, ETHAN. * 
Another dread look to Benji. Ethan dares to stick his head * out. Luther is standing in the center of the tunnel, a Shadow * using him as a shield. Other shadows are moving for position. *

Ethan steps into the open and fires twice - hitting Luther in * the chest. Luther collapses, exposing the man behind him. * 
Ethan fires. The man bolts for cover. Ethan charges. Benji * runs into the open, grabs a rifle and backs Ethan up. *

If you are just joining us, three  
massive explosions have gone off  
simultaneously in what appears to  
be a coordinated attack. 
5 INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT 5 
CLOSE ON: A television. We see ROME, at a distance, a pillar  of smoke at the center. INSET: WOLF BLITZER of CNN. 
WOLF BLITZER

WOLF BLITZER (CONT’D) 
It is believed that the Pope was in  
residence at the time of the blast. 
REVEAL: Ethan stares at a television, his expression  
unreadable. He holds a stopwatch in his hand. 
ON TV: ISRAEL, again from a distance. Again, smoke and fire. 
WOLF BLITZER (CONT’D) 
Also live, we’re looking at  
Jerusalem.  
FROM THE DECK OF AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER, looking toward land and  a column of smoke miles away. 
WOLF BLITZER (CONT’D) 
Also live: from the USS Ronald  
Reagan in the Red Sea off the coast  
of Saudi Arabia. Again, three  
massive explosions - Vatican City,  
Jerusalem and the holy city of  
Mecca. Radiation has been detected,  
indicating that nuclear weapons  
were used in these unspeakable  
attacks. No word on casualties yet,  
but we can assume the death toll is  
catastrophic. Meanwhile, no group  
has yet come forward to claim  
responsibility for these attacks. 
VOICE (O.S.) 
Ethan. It’s time. 
Ethan looks up, sees LUTHER waiting. 
6 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 6 
WOLF (IN BG) 
The attacks occurred at precisely  
the same moment just over an hour  
ago at Four AM Eastern time. The  
level of coordination would seem to  
indicate a plot of incredible  
sophistication. The question now is  
who? Who would attack all three of  
these holy sites? And why? Early  
reports suggest the weapons used in  
these attacks would require highly  
specialized knowledge that very few  
people possess

A room of institutional concrete and drab paint - the windows  are cornered in steel grating. We’re in a prison hospital. 
NILS DELBRUUK lies in bed, bruised and bandaged, slowly  coming to. He realizes he's cuffed to the bed. He sees the  news on television and his face flashes a range of emotions -  the most predominant of which is confusion.

Dr. Delbruuk...  
Delbruuk doesn’t answer. Luther tosses a manuscript on the  bed, followed by photos. 
ETHAN 
We know who you are. We read your  
manifesto. And we found your lab.  
Delbruuk sees a makeshift lab - ultramodern equipment  contrasting an abandoned catacomb. Prominent in these images  are photos of The Vatican, Mecca and Jerusalem. 
DELBRUUK 
Mankind has never known peace  
without first a great suffering.  
The greater the suffering, the  
greater the peace. This will unite  
them... When they read this  
manifesto, they’ll understand. 
ETHAN 
Nobody’s gonna read your manifesto.  
Ever. I can promise you that. 
Luther gives him a look that says “back off.”

DELBRUUK 
You think Lark is the enemy - but

There has never been peace without * 
first a great suffering. The *

the peace. As mankind is drawn to  
his self-destruction like a moth to

of peace - the church, the  
government, the law - work  
tirelessly to save humanity from  
itself.  
Delbruuk extends a hand to Luther. Luther hands him the  phone. Delbruuk unlocks it.

Sir

That phone you unlocked led us to a

to decrypt a communique between  
John Lark and this woman:

HUNLEY (CONT’D) 
Alana Mitsopolis, activist and

has earned her the name White  
Widow. It’s just a front for her  
real trade: arms dealing and money  
laundering. Extensive political  
connections provide her with  
protection.

HUNLEY (CONT’D) 
Lark and the Widow are meeting  
tonight to negotiate delivery of an  
unspecified package which we can  
only assume is our missing  
plutonium. They’ll make contact in  
the private lounger of the Grand  
Palais in Paris during her annual  
fundraising event. Details are in  
the file. If Lark is not at the  
Grand Palais by midnight, the Widow  
will leave, and sell the package to

I’m going to stop you right there.  
You had a terrible choice to make  
in Berlin: recover the plutonium or  
save your team. You chose your team  
and now the world is at risk. Some  
flaw deep in your core being won’t  
allow you to choose between one  
life and millions. Now, you see  
that as a weakness, but I see that  
as your greatest strength. And  
that’s how I know I can count on  
you to cover my ass. Coming over  
here from the CIA was a lateral  
move. Some would say a step down.  
But I did it because of you. Don’t

Ethan stifles the pain. He's still twenty feet above the roof  with no other way down. He yanks a release and falls. 
He slams into the roof, splinter a glass pane. He lays there,  winded and in pain.

We are inside the ring of the glass dome, 120 feet above a  slowly moving vortex of humanity below. Ethan sees the  stairwell he needs to reach. One problem: 
Huge sections of the walkway are missing. Tape, chains and  other gear indicate there is construction going on. There is  no way to get to the floor below. 
Ethan looks to his left and spies a steel cable attached to  the catwalk just beneath his feet. It is one of four that  meet at a small ring in the center of the dome, forming an x.  
He looks to his right and sees the sloping wall of the Palais  and a glass enclosed booth about halfway between him and the  ground floor. He makes a mental calculation. Walker  
impatiently checks his watch. 
Ethan pulls off his parachute, and gingerly steps out onto  the wire. He tests it with his foot - it wobbles, but holds.  He slowly reaches down to the cable, grabs it and - slips.  
He swings underneath the cable, scrambling to bring his legs  around it, steadying, then inchworming along the wire. 
A bewildered Walker watches as Ethan reaches the center ring  where he loosens the two cross cables stretching left and  right, until they hang on by a thread. He releases his legs,  about-faces and continues across with just his hands. 
He makes it to the far side. He unscrews the cable entirely,  and plummets, swinging away from us.  
CLOSE ON: the center ring. The cross cables strain, barely  holding, and he swings back up to Walker.  
Shocked that this worked, Walker stares. Ethan reaches over,  attaches the end of the cable to Walker’s chute harness, puts  a knife between his own teeth and pulls Walker off the ledge.  
Like a pendulum they swing back across, Walker terrified.  
CLOSE ON: The Center ring. The left and right cables snap,  instantly doubly the length of the cable holding Ethan and  walker. They swing back in the direction they came, heading  for the window booth Ethan spied earlier.  
Ethan slides down the cable, knife between his teeth, and at  the last second, cuts Walker’s harness. Their momentum  launches them through space toward the glass enclosed booth.

Ethan and Walker split up, going down separate sides of a  partition. The partition makes it difficult to see the whole  bathroom at once. Mirrors everywhere add to the confusion. 
Walker’s device indicate Lark is on the other side of the  partition. Ethan and Walker split up, each rounding a  
different end. And there he is: 
LARK (40s, Asian, cool), at the middle of five sinks, washing  his hands. 
Ethan palms the needle, steps around the partition to jab  Lark when: 
A THIRD RANDOM MAN steps to the sink between them, oblivious.  Ethan has no choice but to step to a sink as well and wash  his hands, waiting. Walker rounds the far side of the  
partition and takes his place at the far sink. Now they are  on either side of Lark, waiting for the random man to leave. 
The other man finally leaves. Ethan watches him go. He turns  back to see Walker, making eye contact directly with Lark. 
Ethan moves, stabs the syringe at Lark's neck but Lark spins.  He slaps the syringe away and slams Ethan into the sink.

THREE PAIRS OF FEET in the same stall. He stifles a laugh and  whistles to his jabbering friends. Now they see the feet. The  others turn, and they start laughing approaching the cubicle. 
21 INT. STALL - NIGHT 21 
Ethan and Walker freeze. A question in French OS. Loud  laughter mixed with kissing sounds. Ethan sighs. This is all  he needs. Louder knocking, voices. A loud bang. Ethan and  Walker press their hands to the door.  
The French leave. Walker exhales, relieved. Ethsn goes back  to scanning Lark when he notices the eyes on the mask are  opening. He looks at Lark. 
REVEAL: Lark’s eyes are opened. Focused. He lunges upward 8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230722

22 INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 22 
Overwhelming both of them, Lark kicks Ethan through the stall  door, crashing down to the floor. He and Walker continue to  trade blows, Lark smashing the mask machine into Walker’s  face. Walker grabs but Lark flips over his arm, bringing  Walker down hard.  
Rising quickly, Lark punches Walker in the throat before  kicking Ethan, who stumbles back. Ethan fends off blows  trying to hold his ground. 
Walker recovers and grabs Lark, throwing him through the  center mirror. Lark smashes through several sinks and lands  heavily. Lark recovers, yanks a metal U-bend from a broken  sink, and goes for Ethan. 
Walker attacks Lark from behind. Lark breaks free, uses the  pipe to clothesline Walker to the floor, going after Ethan  again. 
They grapple. Lark ends up behind Ethan, trying to pull the  jagged end of the pipe into Ethan’s throat.  
In the mirror he sees Walker whip off his jacket and advance  up behind him, enraged. Lark pivots to bring Ethan between  them, but Ethan kicks off the wall, breaking free.  
Lark punches Ethan in the throat, staggering him. Walker  attacks, pressing Lark to the wall, hammering him with body  blows. Lark turns the tables, gets the better of Walker.  
Ethan tries to get back up to help but the moment he stands,  Lark kicks him in the chest, sending him down again. 
Lark finishes Walker, driving him to his knees, kicking him  in the face and knocking him out cold before beckoning Ethan. 
Ethan charges, picking up Lark and smashing him through a  wall, landing at the base of the cubicle.  
They struggle on the floor. Lark spies his gun, grabs it. He  and Ethan grapple for the gun. Lark has the upper hand,  slowly bringing the gun to Ethan’s face. Ethan desperately  tries to force it away. But he can’t win... 
BANG. Lark falls down dead. Shot in the head. Ethan spins,  grabbing the gun, looking for the shooter. 
REVEAL: Ilsa, standing in the doorway, gun in hand. 
Shit.

Beat. Stunned silence. Ethan picks up the needle, staring at  it, then at the body. He throws it away. The three survivors  gather over the dead man. 
WALKER 
Can you... still make a mask? 
ETHAN 
I need a face to make a mask.

Sorry. I was aiming for his chest. 
ETHAN

ETHAN

Ethan grabs walkers jacket and bends down, putting it on  Lark. Ethan and Walker drag the body inside cubicle.  
Walker steps out, studies Ilsa. She is a sphinx. Walker pulls  a phone from his pocket and dials.

ETHAN 
You didn’t answer my question, what  
are you doing here?  
ROWDY VOICES OS. Ilsa steps to Walker, grabs his face. The  door bursts open and THREE REVELERS see: 
Ethan, Walker and Ilsa standing in a pool of blood. Ilsa  hold’s Walker’s head in his hands. 
ILSA 
That’s it. Just keep your head back  
‘til the bleeding stops. That’s it. 
Ethan steps toward the Revelers:

25 INT. PRIVATE LOUNGE - NIGHT 25 
Double doors open and Ethan steps through. The sound of the  rave vanishing entirely as the heavy door closes behind him.  Ilsa is somewhere ahead. 
The lounge is a Cabaret, a speakeasy, a throwback to another  century with a very different crowd from the ravers outside.  This is a distinctly sketchy rogues gallery of VILLAINS and  their HENCHMEN, a handful of DATES. This place is dangerous. 
SPOT LIGHTS CONVERGE on the center stage, finding A WOMAN  with her back to us, blonde hair and pale skin shimmering.  It’s her, singing the first strains of “Feeling Good.” Meet: 
ALANA MITSOPOLIS, aka The White Widow.

Ethan scans the crowd, noting the rough character of the  clientele. Anyone in here could be a killer, and most  
probably are. But which ones are here for Lark? 
Ethan contemplates his options. Then the Widow’s eyes find  Ethan, knowing at a glance he is there for her, pleased by  what she sees. Ilsa studies Ethan studying the Widow. She is  not what he expected. The Widow makes eye contact with him as  she continues to croon. 
The song ends, the crowd applauds. 
WIDOW 
Thank you all for coming. Enjoy the  
party. 
Ethan and the Widow each move toward the bar where they meet. 
26 INT. AUCTION PARLOR - BAR - NIGHT 26 
The Widow sidles up to the bar, motions to the BARTENDER. Her  drink arrives just as Ethan does.  
He has one eye on the room as they speak. A MAN glances at  him. Coincidence or killer? Impossible to tell.

WIDOW 
I'll be honest with you. A man with  
your reputation... I was expecting  
someone uglier. 
She picks an imaginary spot of lint off his sleeve. He grabs  her wrist firmly, a man not wanting to be touched. The Widow  is shocked. No man has ever treated her this way. 
ETHAN 
I'm as ugly as they come. Now I'll  
be honest with you. I don't like  
crowds, I don't like jazz and I  
don't like small talk. I’m here for

But before she can answer:

Take your hand off her. 
Ethan spins, pulls the Widow close, pressing her back to his  chest, his lips not far from her ear. She's not sure how she  feels about it. 
REVEAL: Zola, stepping in behind the widow. 
CLOSE ON: Ilsa, tensing as this new variable enters her  situation. She notes the three thugs pause, waiting. 
WIDOW

A FEW PEOPLE nearby sense the potential for violence and move  away, making Ethan a clearer target. The moment is  electrified. Ethan lets go of the Widow's wrist, shifting his  grip gently to her bare forearm - brazen, intimate. Her head  tilts ever so slightly. 
She stares at her henchman. His threat hollowed. Ethan has  made a mortal enemy. But he's read the Widow right. She likes  this. He stares at Zola, says nothing. There’s something  about Zola. He’s nervous. Ethan sees this.

ETHAN 
You think you’re the only one with  
spies in the government? People are  
here to stop this meeting. Don’t  
believe me? Just look around. 
Beat. The Widow glances at the room, taking in the faces  around her a little differently. Some people are staring a  little too directly. 
ETHAN (CONT’D) 
Whatever this is, you’re in it with  
me. And you have something I want.  
That makes me the only one you can  
trust to keep you alive. 
WIDOW 
I think I’d like to go home, Mr.  
Lark. 
Ethan takes her by the arm and turns for the door, stopping  when he sees TWO MEN in his path, coming this way. He turns  to his right, seeing a THIRD MAN coming from across the main  floor. He turns around and sees a FOURTH man closing in. 
He calculates his best move and makes it. 
BAR FIGHT ENSUES (ACTION TBD): 
One of the Gunman makes his move, opening fire as: 
Ilsa and Zola draw their guns simultaneously and fire,  killing the gunman. Immediate panic. People scatter as: 
The other Gunmen join in the fray. 
Ilsa takes cover, pulls a second gun, slides it across the  floor to Ethan. He catches it, rolls over and opens fire. 
In seconds, all three gunmen are dead, but a SECOND WAVE OF  SHOOTERS emerges.

Chaos rules. The room is in a full-blown stampede. Everyone  is running for the exits. Ethan gets up, hauls the Widow to  her feet and heads for the nearest exit, guns empty.  
Ilsa falls instep with them - together they cut through a  phalanx of would-be shooters, disabling, disarming.  
A gunman gets behind them, aiming for Ethan. Only the Widow  sees him. To our surprise, she draws a knife from the slit in  her dress and slashes the gunman’s arm. Ethan turns as she  slices the gunman’s throat. 
They are close to the exit now. Ethan looks for Ilsa, but  cannot see her in the chaos. AN ASSASSIN steps in his path,  about to shoot Ethan in the chest. He has no choice but to  protect the Widow bodily.  
Walker appears, disarming the assassin and breaking his neck.  He and Ethan clear a path to the door, towing the widow. 
Ethan looks back, trying to find Ilsa, but she is gone. 
27 INT. GRAND PALAIS - NIGHT 27 
Ethan, the Widow and Walker exit the lounge, walking fast  without drawing attention. Ethan looks back - thugs are  coming after them.  
They break into a run. Clearing the lounge entrance, they  escape into the crowd before the thugs can shoot.

One of the henchman draws on Ethan’s back. Walker steps in,  disarms him. He aims at the two henchman, holding them off.  They pause, hands up.

34 EXT. WATERFRONT UNDERPASS - DAY 34 
A covered road along the Seine River. It is essentially a  concrete box tunnel, open to the water on one side. A  
motorcade approaches. CLOSE ON: 
AN ARMORED PRISON TRUCK, protected from in front and behind  by a motorcade of POLICE on motorcycles, paramilitary  
vehicles, HEAVILY ARMED MEN. 
Score is creeping in. A high sustain. Claustrophobic. 
The motorcade passes an OPEN GARAGE PORT on the left, a LARGE  TRUCK IN THE SHADOWS, perpendicular to the action. 
The motorcade is almost at the end of the tunnel when: 
A SECOND TRUCK pulls out in front of the tunnel, blocking the  exit. Its side slams down as the motorcade stops.  
HEAVILY ARMED AND ARMORED GUNMEN pour out, firing. ONE MAN  launches a shoulder-fired rocket, destroying an armored car  before SOLDIERS can even deploy.

THE FIRST TRUCK PULLS OUT behind the motorcade, sealing them  in. More gunmen deploy. The tunnel is a kill-box. The shrill  score intensifies. 
We follow a MASKED MAN from the first truck, through the  massacre. The masked man moves from cover to cover, not  firing, moving in the wake of the others.  
He gets to the prison truck, slaps a charge on the lock, and  moves to blow it.  
PING 
A bullet hits the truck next to his head. He ducks, spinning  and shooting in one motion, by instinct.  
A YOUNG COP goes down, wounded. The Masked Man walks up to  the Cop, stands over him, removes his mask TO REVEAL: 
Ethan, horrified by what he’s done. But other gunmen come up  to watch. And he has a cover to maintain. The Cop holds up  his hands, begging. Ethan raises his gun and fires.

who knew every move we were making.  
Someone who could come and go like  
a ghost.

SLOANE 
You’re suggesting Hunt is John  
Lark.  
(off his look) 
You’re reaching, Walker. Trying to  
save your ass. It won’t work. 
WALKER 
Think about it. Would a man as  
careful as Lark really stick his  
neck out like that? For a face-to face with the White Widow?  
SLOANE 
(having to admit) 
He’d send a proxy. 
WALKER 
A decoy. And if he was really  
clever, he’d hire his lady-friend  
to kill that decoy in front of a  
reliable witness. Me.  
As Sloane considers: 
WALKER (CONT’D) 
The dragnet is closing in on his  
terrorist alter ego. So he pays a  
man to play the part of Lark and  
has him killed. Then, under the  
guise of serving his country... 
SLOANE 
He assumes his own secret identity.  
WALKER 
Free to operate at will... With the  
full support of the U.S.  
government. 
Sloane ponder this, then shakes it off. 
SLOANE 
But why? Why would Hunt turn? 
8FLiX.com SCREENPLAY DATABASE 20230722
Cherry Rev. (Nov 16 '17) - 1908 39cA. 
WALKER 
Why did Lane turn? Why did any of  
his disciples? They were believers  
in a cause. When that cause turned  
out to be a lie, they turned  
against their masters. How many  
times has Hunt’s government  
betrayed him, disavowed him, cast  
him aside? How long before a man  
like that has had enough?  
That gives Sloane real pause. The look in her eyes is  
unnerving.  
SLOANE 
It’s a serious accusation. 
Can you prove it? 
He pulls a phone from his pocket, hands it over face down.  
WALKER 
This is the phone we pulled off the  
dead man at the Grand Palais.  
Sloane turns it over. We are expecting to see the screen  smashed. But it isn’t. The phone is pristine. 
Walker is lying to Sloane. 
WALKER (CONT’D) 
If you can unlock it, I’m guessing  
it has all the proof you need. 
38 INT. TUNNEL - DAY 38 A parking slot perpendicular to the tunnel. A truck backs in 
39 INT. GARAGE PORT - DAY 39

Walker pauses to consider.  
WALKER 
Holy shit. You’re the guy who

Ethan’s silence confirms it. 
WALKER (CONT’D) 
How long do you think he’s going to  
keep that to himself? 
ETHAN

Ethan gets out of the truck. 
40 INT. ETHAN’S TRUCK - DAY 40 Ethan walks from the truck bay, towards the river. 
CONCRETE PILING, the Seine river beyond. Ethan sticks a SMALL  CAMERA on the corner of the piling. He adjusts it, looking at  a phone in his hand which acts as a camera monitor. On  screen, he sees down the long tunnel. 
He hears a whirring, and looks out. A military helicopter is  flying in, heading towards the Finance Ministry in the  distance.

The roof of Paris’ semi-brutalist finance ministry. In the  back of a MILITARY HELICOPTER a man sits, unmoving, his back  to us.  
The heli touches down and the side door opens. TWO SOLDIERS  IN TACTICAL GEAR grab the man, lifting him onto the pad to  reveal SOLOMON LANE. Lane wears a faded white  
straightjacket, his ankles chained to each other. His  
grizzled beard and tousled mane contradict the intense focus  in his eyes. 
MORE SOLDIERS are waiting for Lane and his escort at the edge  of the pad.

Lane is led into an armored box truck, in the middle of a  motorcade.  
He sits. The chain running from his wrists to his ankles is  bolted to the floor. He’s left alone, the door slamming shut. 
43A INT. ARMORED BOX TRUCK - DAY 43A Lane sits, contemplating, as the truck drives through Paris.  
44 EXT. FINANCE MINISTRY - DAY 44 
The box truck emerges into the ministry’s inner courtyard,  escorted by armored escort vehicles and police motorcycles.  It roars through and exits onto the street. As the motorcade  heads for the river we ANGLE ON: 
A HELMETED, BLACK-CLAD RIDER astride a motorcycle. We are  over the rider’s shoulder, watching the motorcade. The Black  Rider starts the bike and cruises after it.

A THUG watches the approaching motorcade from a rooftop. He  says one word into a walkie talkie.

At the far end of the tunnel, another truck is waiting to  block the way. Zola, heavily armed and armored, is at the  wheel, watching through a camera of his own. A THUG RIDES  SHOTGUN. The Thug opens a slot behind him, gives a thumbs up.

Zola’s Thug looks at him, bewildered. Zola guns the engine  and takes off. 
74 INT. BOX TRUCK - DAY 74 
The truck is filling up with water, rolling slowly. Lane is  underwater, then above the water, then under again, gasping  desperately for air in the rapidly shrinking pocket. 
And then the air is gone. Lane yanks at the chains on the  floor, seconds from drowning when: 
A BLINDING LIGHT cuts between the two doors. A beat later and  they open TO REVEAL: 
A SCUBA DIVER with a white-hot acetylene blowtorch. He swims  in, shoving a regulator in Lane’s mouth.  
Lane inhales desperately as the diver shoves a black bag over  his head. Lane tries to resist, but there’s little he can do. 
The diver cuts the chain holding Lane to the floor. Then he  grabs the chains holding Lane’s wrists and yanks him out of  the truck. 
75 INT. ETHAN’S TRUCK - DAY 75 
Ethan guns it, using the considerable mass of the truck to  frighten oncoming traffic out of his way. But he’s also  blazing a clear path for his many pursuers.

It is moored to the bridge, a massive caisson hiding it from  the view of the police. A SILHOUETTED FIGURE sits at the  front of the boat. REVEAL: 
LUTHER STICKEL. He’s watching through binoculars. He hears a  sound and turns, moving to the side of the boat, and reaches  down.  
A DIVER SURFACES just beside the boat and yanks off his mask  TO REVEAL: 
BENJI DUNN. Lane surfaces just behind him, head still bagged. Luther hauls Lane out of the water. 
TIME CUT: As Benji strips off his scuba gear, Luther scans  Lane with a sensor of some kind. It detects a signal on  Lane’s neck. Luther peals back the collar of Lane’s straight  jacket, applies an adhesive patch, rescans. No more signal.

78 INT. IMPOSSIBLY NARROW ALLEY 78 There’s no way the truck will fit. And that’s the point. IMPACT 
We are thrown from the vehicle and watch it wedge violently  in the alley. Ethan and Walker kick out the windshield and  scramble onto the hood of the truck as cops screech to a halt  just behind them. But the truck has the alley completely  blocked. Ethan and Walker jump on a pair of waiting  
motorcycles. Walker fires up his engine and takes off around  a corner. Gone. But Ethan's bike won't start. 
79 EXT. STREET - DAY 79 
Walker weaves through traffic, quickly but not conspicuously.  He looks back and realizes?
