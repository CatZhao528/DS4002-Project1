E162A   Out of SHIFTING DARKNESS...                                E162A

        ... the WARNER BROS. LOGO surfaces...

        ... then VANISHES... swallowed by the shifting darkness
        once more. Slowly we discern that the darkness has form,
        surface. There is a sense of movement as we realize
        we...

        ... are RUSHING wicked fast over dark water, hastened by
        a STIFF WIND. Below, a SHADOW flickers intermittently on
        the water’s surface but it is too dark and the surface
        too uncertain for the shadow to be identified.

        We RISE SLIGHTLY, the VIEW EXPANDING until a SMALL ISLAND
        comes INTO VIEW. We CIRCLE SLOWLY. All is dark below.
        The WIND SCREAMS. Then something GLIMMERS, something
        PALE and SMOOTH, an OBELISK crafted of MARBLE.

        We DROP FROM the sky, as if on wings.


E162C   EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT                    E162C

        The obelisk looms larger from this vantage point.   A tomb
        fit for an emperor. A NAME is inscribed upon its
        surface: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE.

        The obelisk begins to TREMBLE, then DRIFTS SLOWLY ASIDE,
        revealing a TRANSLUCENT STONE SLAB, beyond which a BODY
        in REPOSE can be discerned.

        SMASH! The translucent slab SHATTERS. The air glimmers
        briefly with diamond-like shards and Dumbledore’s body is
        revealed. He appears to be sleeping. A few of the
        diamond shards cling to his cheek. A SHADOW -- the
        shadow from before -- eclipses his face and...

        ... VOLDEMORT appears, peering down at Dumbledore’s
        lifeless body. For a moment, he simply stares,
        transfixed by the sight of his old foe at peace. Then he
        reaches out and...

        ... covers Dumbledore’s interlaced hands with his own.
        The moment is oddly tender. After a moment, he retracts
        his hand, claiming the WAND clutched in Dumbledore’s
        fingers as his own. He studies it, his face a mask. The
        wind rises yet again, carrying us AWAY, BACK TO...

F162    A LAKE COMES INTO VIEW, the BLACK LAKE of HOGWARTS, its F162
        surface thick and still as tar, shrouded in what appears
        to be a FOUL MIST but which is, we come to find, in
        reality a festering cluster of DEMENTORS...

G162    The Quidditch Pitch stands silent, untended, faded House G162
        flags hanging limply...

H162    Under the slate sky, the CASTLE stands like a dark          H162
        fortress, its quirky angles and gleaming windows
        diminished in the gray light...

I162    FIGURES COME INTO VIEW, STUDENTS, marching in lines,     I162
        like GRIM REGIMENTS, across the BRIDGE, chivvied on by a
        pair of DEATH EATERS (ALECTO and AMYCUS CARROW) while
        high upon a ballustrade, his face a mask, SEVERUS SNAPE
        looks on. We DRAW CLOSER, but nothing more is revealed.
        His face remains a mask, his eyes untelling. Finally, he
        turns away, his CLOAK wiping our field, pitching us once
        more into...

        DARKNESS. The STATIC, little more than a feeble hiss
        now, dies out altogether. A SOFT WHISPER of WIND fills
        our ears, faint but clear, and we are MOVING once more,
        UP HIGH yet again. The earth falls away below us,
        revealing...

        A sea of treetops, shifting eerily as we SWEEP OVER them.
        A gravel road COMES INTO VIEW, and then, a few yards on,
        FIGURES on foot.

        SCABIOR, FENRIR GREYBACK and a ragtag group of SNATCHERS
        escort HARRY, RON and HERMIONE past thick yew hedges.
        Hermione eyes a white peacock, looking like a ghostly
        lawn ornament. Harry, his face horribly swollen,
        WHISPERS:

                                   HARRY
                     What did you put on me?

                                   HERMIONE
                     A Stinging Jinx.

                                   HARRY
                     How long will it last?

                                 HERMIONE
                   Not long.

      Harry glances down, sees his GLASSES cupped in Hermione’s
      palm. As he slips them into his pocket, the group
      suddenly slows. Up ahead, on the other side of the gate,
      BELLATRIX, LUCIUS and NARCISSA approach. Scabior grabs
      Harry’s arm, pushes his face up to the iron bars.
      Bellatrix steps close.

                                 BELLATRIX
                   Show me.

      Scabior reaches out his DIRTY FINGERS and pushes Harry’s
      hair roughly off his forehead. Bellatrix SHINES her
      wand. Despite the swelling, one intriguing feature can
      be seen: a SCAR, in the shape of a LIGHTNING BOLT?
      Bellatrix studies it long and hard... then SMILES.


164   INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER)                    164

      As Bellatrix leads the procession inside, she speaks to
      Narcissa.

                                 BELLATRIX
                   Get Draco.

      Narcissa eyes her sister briefly, warily, then strides
      off, toward the brightly-lit room ahead, where her
      husband Lucius stands, cradling a nearly-empty wine
      glass.

                                 LUCIUS
                   Why Draco?

      Narcissa passes her husband without a word.

                                 BELLATRIX
                   Just sit back and watch, Lucius.
                   Hm? Pour yourself another glass
                   of wine.

      As she passes, she flicks her finger off the rim of his
      glass -- pling!

                                 BELLATRIX
                   Where’d you find them?

                                 SCABIOR
                   In the North Forest.

      WORMTAIL quietly enters the room. As Harry eyes him,
      Bellatrix pauses, studying his scar again.

                                 BELLATRIX
                   Lovely scarf, Scabior. Though I’m
                   not sure it’s your color.

                                    SCABIOR
                   It’s not mine.

                                    BELLATRIX
                   You don’t say.

      Her eyes slide, catch him looking at Hermione.

                                 BELLATRIX
                   Fancy her, do you, Scabior? Can’t
                   say I blame you. Maybe we’ll work
                   out a little reward for you, hm?
                   That is, assuming all is as it
                   appears. Ah, Draco. Come here,
                   darling.

      From the shadows at the far end of the room Draco
      separates from Narcissa, steps cautiously forward.

                                 BELLATRIX
                   My friends here say they’ve got
                   Harry Potter. Seeing as he’s an
                   old school chum of yours, I
                   thought you could confirm the fact
                   for us.

      Draco stares at Harry.

                                    BELLATRIX
                   Well...?

                                 DRACO
                   I can’t... I can’t be sure.

      Lucius steps forward, wine glass sloshing.

                                 LUCIUS
                   Look close, Draco. If we’re the
                   ones who hand Potter over to the
                   Dark Lord, everything will be
                   forgiven. Do you understand --

                     (quietly menacing)
                Now, we won’t be forgetting who
                actually caught him, I hope, Mr.
                Malfoy?

                               BELLATRIX
                Of course not.
                     (eyes hardening)
                Narcissa. Tend to your husband.

      Lucius staggers back nervously next to his wife.

                              BELLATRIX
                     (to Draco)
                Don’t be shy, sweetheart.   Get up
                nice and close.

      Bellatrix nudges Draco forward until he’s only inches
      from Harry.

                              DRACO
                What’s wrong with his face?

                What is wrong with his face,
                Scabior?

                              SCABIOR
                He came to us that way. I reckon
                he picked it up in the forest.

                              BELLATRIX
                Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.

      Bellatrix, eyes flashing, steps up close to Hermione.

                              BELLATRIX
                Was it you, dearie? Give me her
                wand. We’ll see what the last
                spell was.

      Hermione looks alarmed as a Snatcher steps forward.

                                BELLATRIX
                What is that?

      Bellatrix’s tone is quietly murderous. She pushes past
      Scabior and Greyback, steps before another Snatcher.
      Hermione’s beaded purse dangles from one hand. In the
      other, he holds... the Sword of Gryffindor.

                It was in her bag when we searched
                her. Reckon it’s mine now.

      Bang! Quick as lightning, Bellatrix stuns the Snatcher
      and catches the sword as he drops. Scabior wheels.

      escapes his cloak. He BELLOWS in fury.

      Bellatrix stares at him, eyes full of fire, then flicks
      her wand and he slumps forward, wincing.

      across the darkness and a GASLIGHT BLOOMS faintly.
      Luna’s pale face floats forward, hovers vaguely.

                              LUNA
                You look strange, Harry. Mr.
                Ollivander, look who’s here. It’s
                Harry Potter.

      Harry looks   past Luna and sees a GOBLIN (GRIPHOOK)
      standing in   the shadows. Next to him, sitting slumped
      against the   wall, is the wandmaker OLLIVANDER, looking
      frail. His    chin lifts slightly, runny eyes glimmering
      against the   light as he studies Harry’s swollen face.

                                HARRY
                Hello, sir.

      Ollivander falters, his face troubled. Harry eyes him
      curiously, when Bellatrix’s voice ECHOES through the
      VENT.

                              BELLATRIX (O.S.)
                I’m going to ask you once again:
                what else did you and your friends
                take from my vault!

                              HERMIONE (O.S.)
                I told you. I don’t know what
                you’re talking --

      Hermione SCREAMS in pain.   Ron slams his fist against the
      wall, turns.

                              RON
                We have to do something, Harry!
                                                      (CONTINUED)
                                                                    8.

                                 OLLIVANDER
                   There’s no way out. We’ve tried
                   everything.

                                 LUNA
                   You’re bleeding, Harry.

      She points downward. Harry removes his glasses from his
      pocket, slips them on and peers at his sock, where BLOOD
      has soaked through. Harry reaches down, pulling the sock
      away from his ankle, revealing a SMALL GASH and the thing
      that caused it: the MIRROR SHARD.

                                 LUNA
                   That’s a curious thing to hide in
                   your sock.

      Taking the shard, Harry turns the silvery side toward
      himself (and only himself) -- and for a split second --
      the EYE seems to flicker there again. Harry wipes away
      the film of blood... but the eye is gone.

                                 LUNA
                   You were hiding it, weren’t you?

      Before Harry can respond, Hermione SCREAMS again. Pained
      by this, Harry debates something, then peers into the
      mirror:

                                     HARRY
                   Help us.

      The others study him curiously, then FOOTSTEPS SOUND.
      Ron CLICKS the Deluminator and all goes DARK. The cellar
      door squeals open and Wormtail’s silhouette appears in a
      shaft of light. Ron rushes forward, but Wormtail stops
      him with a gesture of his wand.

                                  RON
                   Let her go!   Let her go!

                                     WORMTAIL
                   Shut it!   You.     Goblin.   Come with
                   me.

      As Griphook mounts the stairs he turns, eyeing Harry
      curiously, then Wormtail grabs his arm, slams shut the
      door. Ron clicks the Deluminator again and -- CRACK! --
      as light returns... DOBBY materializes before them.

                                  HARRY
                   Dobby.   What’re you doing here?

                              DOBBY
                Dobby has come to rescue Harry
                Potter, of course.

      Everyone stares, stunned. Harry stares in similar
      amazement at the mirror glittering in his palm.

                              HARRY
                Do you mean to say you can
                Apparate in and out of here?    And
                take us with you?

                               DOBBY
                Of course.   I’m an elf.

                                RON
                Works for me.

                              HARRY
                Right. Dobby, I want you to take
                Luna and Mr. Ollivander to --

                              RON
                Shell Cottage on the outskirts of
                Tinworth.
                     (as Harry looks at
                      him)
                Trust me.

      Harry nods, turns to Luna.

                              HARRY
                You’ll see to Mr. Ollivander?

                              LUNA
                Of course.
                     (to Dobby)
                Whenever you’re ready, sir.

      Dobby blinks at Luna’s use of “sir.”    He GRINS.

                              DOBBY
                Like her very much.
                     (to Ron and Harry)
                Meet me at the top of the stairs
                in ten seconds.

      Luna takes Ollivander’s withered hand in hers and Dobby
      reaches out. CRACK! -- they vanish. Harry and Ron peer
      at each other, then rush up the stairs toward the SLIVER
      of LIGHT under the door above. CRACK! The knob turns
      and light splashes into the cellar as...

      ... Wormtail fills the doorway.

      Harry and Ron stiffen, then watch Wormtail fall forward,
      stiff as a board, tumbling in a heavy heap on the cement
      floor below. They turn back as Dobby appears, Wormtail’s
      wand in his tiny fist.

                                DOBBY
                  Who gets his wand?


170   INT. CORRIDOR TO MAIN ROOM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)              170

      Quickly, cautiously, Harry and Ron (brandishing
      Wormtail’s wand now) pad toward the main room as Dobby
      slips off in another direction. As Ron steps past the
      lifeless Snatcher without a glance, Harry hesitates,
      glances down.

      Something FLUTTERS WEAKLY in the Snatcher’s pocket. The
      tip of a golden wing. Harry crouches, looks. It’s the
      Snitch.

                                RON
                  Sss.

      Harry looks up, sees Ron gesturing for him.      Quickly, he
      takes the Snitch, slips it in his pocket.


      NEW ANGLE

      As Harry joins Ron and looks:

      Slowly, Bellatrix comes INTO VIEW, towering over
      Griphook, who holds the sword, studying it. Hermione
      lies at Bellatrix’s feet. Seeing her, Ron starts to
      lurch forward. Harry restrains him.

                                BELLATRIX
                  Well?

                                GRIPHOOK
                  I left Gringotts employ many weeks
                  ago, but when I was last in your
                  vault, the sword was there.

      Hermione studies the two then watches as a STRAND of
      BELLATRIX’S HAIR drifts free and, as if in a dream,
      floats through the air...

                                BELLATRIX
                  Perhaps it just walked out on its
                  own then.

                                 GRIPHOOK
                   There is no place safer than
                   Gringotts, Madam LeStrange.

      ... and catches on Hermione’s shirt.

                                  BELLATRIX
                   Liar!   You can’t deceive me!

      As Hermione looks up, away from the hair, Bellatrix
      slashes the dagger across Griphook’s cheek and a deep
      gash opens. He barely flinches, the hint of a SMILE on
      his lips. Bellatrix looks mildly unnerved by his
      reaction.

                                 BELLATRIX
                   Consider yourself lucky, Goblin.
                   The same won’t be said for this
                   one.

      Bellatrix poises the dagger over Hermione.

                   Like hell!

      Bellatrix wheels, sees Ron pelting forward.

                   Expelliarmus!

      Bellatrix’s dangling wand shoots free, tumbles end over
      end... right into Harry’s hand.

                                   HARRY
                   Stupefy!

      Lucius Malfoy drops instantly, his wine glass shattering
      in a burgundy bloom on the hearth. Narcissa and Draco
      draw their wands. JETS of LIGHT spray across the room.

                                 BELLATRIX
                   Stop or she dies!

      Harry and Ron freeze, see Hermione leaning limply against
      Bellatrix, the dagger at her throat.

                                 BELLATRIX
                   Drop your wands.

      Ron stands rigidly, staring balefully at Bellatrix.

      Bellatrix’s.

                Pick them up, Draco. Now! Well,
                well, look what we have here.
                Harry Potter. All bright, shiny
                and new again. Just in time for
                the Dark Lord.

      Harry glances in the mirror opposite, sees that the
      Stinging Jinx is wearing off.

                              BELLATRIX
                Call him, Draco.

      Draco hesitates. But Lucius doesn’t, pulling up his
      sleeve and touching his finger to the DARK MARK on his
      forearm. Harry’s SCAR CONSTRICTS and he GRIMACES in
      agony. Bellatrix CACKLES maniacally, her knife pressed
      against the tender flesh of Hermione’s neck. A bead of
      blood bubbles on the blade and then... a GRINDING NOISE
      is HEARD. Harry glances up, sees the CHANDELIER begin to
      TREMBLE. As the TINKLE of GLASS fills the room,
      Bellatrix stares directly upward, watching as...

      ... the chandelier bursts free of the ceiling and
      plummets. Bellatrix bolts and Hermione staggers clear,
      falling into Ron’s arms. Griphook grabs the sword and as
      GLASS EXPLODES in razor-sharp slivers, Draco screams and
      covers his bloody face. Harry wrests the blood-soaked
      wands from his hands and, wheeling, points all three at
      Lucius.

                              HARRY

      Lucius flies off his feet and drops in a heap.

                You dirty little monkey!    You
                could have killed me!

      Harry turns, sees Bellatrix raging at Dobby.      The elf
      stands fearlessly across from her, defiant.

                              DOBBY
                Dobby meant only to maim or
                seriously injure, not kill.

      fist and Narcissa’s wand flies from her hand.

                How dare you take a witch’s wand.

      Harry tosses Ron a wand, grabs Hermione’s beaded bag and
      joins the others in the center of the room.

                Give the Dark Lord our regards.

      Harry’s hand closes on Dobby’s and the drawing room
      begins to SPIN. Bellatrix’s face twists into an ugly
      blur. Her arm rises, dagger in hand. There is a flash
      of SILVER. Then...

      All goes BLACK.   For a long time.   Then...


171   EXT. CLIFF - SHELL COTTAGE - DAWN (SECONDS LATER)             171

      ... with a great WHOOSH, Harry and the others tumble onto
      solid earth and hear the CRASH of WAVES. As Harry
      staggers to his feet, stars whirl above him. He sees he
      is on a cliff overlooking a dark sea. Ron holds Hermione
      gently. Tears sting her eyes.

                              HARRY
                It’s all right, Hermione.    You’re
                safe. We’re all safe.

      She doesn’t respond, nor Ron. Then Harry realizes they
      are looking past him, even Griphook, the sword hanging
      limply in his hand. Harry turns. Dobby stands alone, a
      queer smile on his face, hand over his heart, the hilt of
      Bellatrix’s dagger protruding between his fingers.

                                 HARRY

      eyes rolling up to the stars.

                   -- your bag -- you must have
                   something -- Essence of Dittany --
                   something... Hermione! Help me!

      She merely stands, tears streaking her cheeks.

                                 DOBBY
                   Such a beautiful night... to be
                   with friends. Dobby is happy...
                   to be with his friend... Harry
                   Potter...

      Dobby gives a little shudder, then goes still. The
      others simply stare, mute, listening to the waves
      thunder.

      Footfalls sound. Ron turns, sees his brother Bill and
      Luna approaching from the cottage in the distance.

                                 BILL
                   Fleur’s seeing to Ollivander.
                   Anyone else need tending --

      He eyes Harry curiously, crouched, his back turned. Then
      sees Dobby’s limp little legs dangling lifelessly. As
      the others watch, Harry reaches out and -- gently as he
      can -- pulls the dagger from Dobby’s chest, then shrugs
      off his jacket and enwraps the elf’s body. Slowly, his
      shoulders begin to shake. Only Luna dares to step
      forward. Kneeling, she sees Harry is silently crying.

                                 LUNA
                   We should close his eyes.   Don’t
                   you think?

      Luna reaches out, tenderly places her fingers upon
      Dobby’s eyelids and closes them.

                                  LUNA
                   There.   Now he could be sleeping.

      She turns then, looks at Harry.

                                 LUNA
                   Harry. It’s all right. That it
                   hurts. That’s what reminds us how
                   lucky we are to be alive.

      Harry turns, studies her serene face briefly, then his
      eyes shift to Dobby, his face serene as well, in death.

       A SPADE pierces the earth as Harry begins to dig,
       fiercely obsessed by his task. A moment later, Ron
       kneels beside him and begins to do the same, then
       Hermione. CAMERA RISES and the THUNDERING OCEAN comes

       As Bill fills a kettle, Luna taps the WIND CHIME hanging
       in the window and a GHOSTLY REFRAIN fills the room.

                                LUNA
                  It’s beautiful here.

                                BILL
                  It was our Aunt’s. We used to
                  come here as kids. The Order uses
                  it now as a safe house -- what’s
                  left of us, at least.

       Luna ponders this, then taps the chime again.

                  Muggles think these keep evil

       Bill studies her curiously. Then Harry appears in the
       doorway with Ron and Hermione.

       the door, step aside for Harry, Ron and Hermione. Harry
       waits for Bill to withdraw. Turns to Griphook.

                   Soon the Death Eaters will control

                   Alone, yes.   With you, no.

      Griphook stares impassively at him, silent. He glances
      at the Sword of Gryffindor, which stands in the corner.

                It’s complicated. Why did
                Bellatrix Lestrange think it
                should be in her vault at
                Gringotts?

                              GRIPHOOK
                It’s complicated.

      Harry and the goblin stare at each other, as if testing
      one another. Finally, Harry speaks:

                              HARRY
                The sword presented itself to us
                in a moment of need. We didn’t
                steal it.

      Griphook nods, pondering this.

                              GRIPHOOK
                There is a sword in Madam
                Lestrange’s vault identical to
                this one, but it is a fake. It
                was placed there this past summer.

                              HARRY
                And she never suspected?

                              GRIPHOOK
                The replica is very convincing.
                Only a goblin would recognize that
                this is the true Sword of
                Gryffindor.

                              RON
                Who put it there?   The fake.

                It was not my place to ask, nor

                than a few curious things in the

      drift once again to the sword. Harry starts to respond,
      but the goblin cuts him off with finality.

                we’d been in there. She kept
                asking you what else we’d taken.
                I’d bet anything there’s a Horcrux
                there. If we find it, we can kill
                it. And if we kill it, we’re one
                step closer to killing him.

                                 OLLIVANDER

      Harry removes TWO WANDS.     Ollivander takes one in hand.

                                 OLLIVANDER
                   Walnut and dragon heartstring.
                   Twelve and three quarter inches.
                   Unyielding. This belongs to
                   Bellatrix Lestrange.

                   Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten
                   inches. Reasonably pliant. This
                   was the wand of Draco Malfoy.

                   of Death. But few truly believe
                   such objects exist --

                   old wives tale --

                   You’re lying. You know one exists
                   and you told him about it. You
                   told him about the Elder Wand and
                   where to go looking for it.

                                 OLLIVANDER
                   He tortured me! Besides, I
                   conveyed only rumors. There’s no
                   guarantee he will find it --

                                 HARRY

      Ollivander blinks.    Ashen.    Stunned.

                                 HARRY
                   That’s all, sir. We’ll leave you
                   to get some rest now.

      The trio begins to exit.

                   that might explain why --

      Hermione and Ron stare at him, silent, when a FLOORBOARD
      SQUEAKS. They turn, watch SHADOWS appear: Bill and
      Fleur. Fleur hands Hermione a LONG BLACK WOMAN’S CLOAK.

                                 FLEUR
                   This is the closest I could find

                   It’s perfect.    Thank you, Fleur.

      Fleur lays the cloak in Hermione’s hands, then steps back
      next to Bill. He studies the trio.

                   to it. If you don’t... he won’t
                   be forgiving.

      The trio sits in silence. Watches Bill withdraw.   Harry
      glances down at his palm again, at the Snitch.

      The ocean crashes. Harry crouches by Dobby’s fresh
      grave, which now bears a simple STONE: “Here Lies Dobby,
      A Free Elf.” Harry ponders the mirror shard, turning it
      from sky to sea when:

                The sky has lost a star.

      Luna’s image skitters across the mirror’s surface and
      Harry looks up, finds her standing there clutching a
      small TRAVELING BAG, staring at Dobby’s stone.

                              LUNA
                My father used to say that when a

                Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about
                your father, I don’t want you to
                think I --

                That’s why we don’t need to talk
                about it.

      smile, then DISAPPARATES and is gone.

      high stools. WIZARD GUARDS positioned throughout. As
      Ron and Hermione enter, WIND whistles through the
      doorway, sends the PAGES of the Goblin’s massive ledgers
      trembling. As the door closes, the room returns to its
      eerie silence. Hermione glances at Ron. He nods and she
      steps to the long counter, where an AGED GOBLIN scribbles
      in his ledger.

                                 AGED GOBLIN
                   Identification.

                                 BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)
                   I hardly think that will be
                   necessary.

                                 AGED GOBLIN
                        (looking up)
                   Madam Lestrange! Dear me!   How
                   may I help you today?

                                 BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)
                   I wish to enter my vault.

                                AGED GOBLIN
                   I see. Very well. Excuse me,
                   won’t you?

      The goblin slips off his stool, goes to consult with
      another, even more ancient goblin (BOGROD).

                                 BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)
                   I don’t like to be kept waiting.

      Hermione’s tone is harsh, authoritative. She turns to
      Ron, raises an eyebrow. He nods, mouths “Well done,”
      then looks away, eyeing the guards stationed about the
      room. One looks up, meets his gaze.

                                 TALL GOBLIN
                   Next.

      Ron turns, sees the Tall Goblin eyeing him.

                                 BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)
                   He’s with me.
                        (with utter disdain)
                   As difficult as that may be to
                   imagine.

      Ron frowns, takes in the scene again. The SCRATCH of
      goblin quills seems to grow louder. Ron fidgets, eyes
      the guard again, who is looking at him more closely now.
      Ron runs a finger under his collar, shifts his eyes to
      the Aged Goblin who continues to consult with the one
      known as Bogrod. Bogrod says something and they both
      glance at Hermione.

      Then GRIPHOOK’S VOICE HISSES in his ear:

                                 GRIPHOOK (V.O.)
                   They know!

      Ron stiffens, turns slightly toward the empty spot to his
      left. WHISPERS:

                                 RON
                   What do you mean?



                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                             28.
191   CONTINUED: (2)                                               191

                              GRIPHOOK (V.O.)
                They know she’s an imposter!
                They’ve been warned!

      Ron looks back, watches the two goblins return to
      Hermione.

                              BOGROD
                Madam Lestrange. Would you mind
                presenting your wand?

                              BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)
                And why should I do that?

      Just then, the guard across the room begins to walk
      toward Ron. Ron’s eyes dance. He averts his face,
      WHISPERS:

                              RON
                Harry, what do we do?   Harry...?

      No response. Ron extends his hand as casually as he can,
      finds only empty space. We --

                                                           CUT TO:


      ANOTHER ANGLE

      CAMERA MOVING TOWARDS Hermione, simulating Harry’s
      movement toward her.

                              BOGROD
                It’s the bank’s policy. I’m sure
                you understand, given the current
                climate --

                              BELLATRIX (HERMIONE)
                No, I most certainly do not
                understand --

      Sensing Harry’s presence, she falters, her own voice
      emerging through Bellatrix’s. Bogrod eyes her intensely.

                              BOGROD
                I’m afraid I must insist.

      As the guard closes on Ron, Ron looks about frantically,
      reaching for his wand when a GUST of WIND fills the Hall,
      sending the ledgers trembling again. The guard
      approaching Ron shifts his gaze briefly to the entrance,
      as do the Aged Goblin and Bogrod. None see Harry’s hand
      slip from the cloak, his wand pointed at Bogrod.

                Imperio.

      The door glides shut.   The wind dies.   Bogrod blinks.

                              BOGROD
                Very well, Madam Lestrange.    If
                you will follow me.

                              AGED GOBLIN
                But... Bogrod, there have been
                special instructions regarding the
                Lestrange vault.

                              BOGROD
                I’m fully aware of that. I’m also
                aware the Lestranges are one of
                our oldest and most respected
                families.

                              AGED GOBLIN
                Yes, sir, but our instructions are
                very specific --

                              BOGROD
                Let me be specific with you,
                Ricbert. I’ve run this bank for
                forty-five years, long before
                anyone had even heard of a Death
                Eater. The day may come that they
                feel they can run this place
                better than me, but that day has
                not yet arrived. Am I understood!

      The Aged Goblin hesitates, then nods.    Bogrod turns to
      Hermione.

                              BOGROD
                Madam, if you will, I will escort
                you myself.
                     (to the guard)
                Teffington, see to that door, will
                you.

      The guard glances at Ron, then reluctantly heads for the
      entrance. Ron quickly falls in line behind Hermione as
      Bogrod leads them out of the Hall.


192   OMITTED                                                         192

193   INT. TUNNEL - DAY (SECONDS LATER)                             193

      A cart hurtles through the darkness, ferrying the lot of
      them -- Harry, Ron, Hermione, Griphook and Bogrod -- down
      the rickety rails, twisting and turning, sloping ever
      downward. Harry leans toward Griphook, who commandeers
      the cart.

                                 HARRY
                   How long before they come after
                   us?

                                 GRIPHOOK
                   Time will tell.

      Harry’s eyes meet Griphook’s in the flickering darkness,
      then Ron’s face appears over Harry’s shoulder.

                                  RON
                   What’s that?   Up ahead.

      Ron points. In the distance, directly over the tracks,
      something SHIMMERS like a CURTAIN of WATER.

                                 GRIPHOOK
                   I should have known --

      Furiously, Griphook starts to throw levers, trying to
      slow the cart.

                                 HARRY
                   What is that, Griphook?

      The wheels SCREECH, throwing off SPARKS.

                                  HARRY
                   Griphook!   What is that!

      He doesn’t answer, furiously preoccupied with the cart.
      Harry turns to Hermione, hoping she has an explanation,
      but she just shakes her head, staring up ahead as...

      ... Griphook slumps back, powerless, watching in grim
      resignation as the cart careens wildly down the rail and
      PIERCES the shimmering curtain.

      Instantly, water ENGULFS them with FEROCIOUS POWER. The
      seats beneath them collapse, flipping downward and...

      They drop.

      ... in a cascade of roaring water toward the ground
      rushing up 30 feet below. Hermione SCREAMS something,
      her wand flashing and one by one...

      ... they SPLASH DOWN (relatively) gently, (relatively)
      unscathed. As the water drains away, they peer upward,
      watching as, ALARMS BLARING, the cart rattles back the
      way it came. Harry turns to Hermione as she pockets her
      wand.

                                 HARRY
                   Well done. Hey.
                        (studying her)
                   You look like... you.

      Hermione is soaking wet and looks like... Hermione.    Ron
      looks like Ron. Griphook nods to the waterfall.

                                 GRIPHOOK
                   The Thief’s Downfall. Washes away
                   all enchantments. Can be deadly.

                                  RON
                   You don’t say.
                        (as the cart’s alarms
                         grow faint)
                   Just out of interest... is there
                   any other way out of here?

                                  GRIPHOOK
                   No.

      Before the trio can savor this tidbit:

                                 BOGROD
                   What the devil are you all doing
                   down here!

      They all turn, seeing a soaking Bogrod, cleansed of the
      Imperius curse, backing away in angry confusion.

                                  GRIPHOOK
                   We need him!

                                 BOGROD
                   Is this your doing, Griphook? You
                   have no rights here anymore. When
                   you gave up your keys, you --

      Hermione and Harry raise their wands.    Too late.

                                  RON
                   Imperio!

      Bogrod blinks, resumes his mild demeanor. Harry and
      Hermione turn, see Ron, wand outstretched. Griphook
      steps past, pushes Bogrod on.

                Well done.

      The trio watch the goblins go, exchange a glance.
      Unnerved. Just then a MOAN is heard, DEEP and
      unsettling, coming from down the tunnel. Ron cocks his
      ear in disbelief.

                                RON
                No.    It’s not possible...


194   INT. OUTSIDE LESTRANGE VAULT - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)          194

      Ron appears first, trailed by Harry and Hermione, and
      finds Bogrod standing placidly by himself. As Harry and
      Hermione hang back, Ron moves forward slowly, squinting.
      Something massive shifts heavily. CHAINS CLINK. He
      looks: a GIANT DRAGON tethered to the ground, bars
      access to a DEEP VAULT. Its scales are pale and flaky,
      its eyes milky.

                               RON
                Bloody hell.   That’s a Welsh
                Green.

                              HERMIONE
                It looks like it’s been down here
                forever.

      HINGES SQUEAL SHARPLY and they jump, watch Griphook -- in
      the SHADOWS -- take something from a wooden box on the
      wall. An ODD-LOOKING METAL INSTRUMENT. As he steps into
      the light, he tosses it to Hermione. She glances from it
      to Griphook, sees him eyeing her with a strange
      intensity.

                                GRIPHOOK
                Go on.

      She looks unsure. Then gives it a SHAKE. A SHRILL
      RINGING echoes off the rocky passage, eerie and
      unpleasant. The dragon rears back instantly, howling in
      fear, then, as the ringing subsides, settles. Ron nods
      knowingly.

                              RON
                It’s been trained to expect pain
                when it hears the noise.

      Hermione’s eyes flash to Ron, then to the SCARS on the
      dragon’s face and neck.

                              HERMIONE
                That’s barbaric. I...

      She hands the instrument back, horrified.            Griphook takes
      it, unmoved.

                                 GRIPHOOK
                   We’ll only have a few seconds. In
                   other words... they’ll be no do-
                   overs. Understood?

      The trio eye the dragon, nod.

                                      GRIPHOOK
                   Ready, Bogrod?

                                      BOGROD
                   Hm?   Oh.   Yes.     Of course.

      Bogrod holds up his hand, waggles it. Griphook nods,
      eyes the dragon. Its eyes glimmer angrily. Griphook
      raises the instrument... and SHAKES IT. The cacophony is
      murderous. Harry, Ron and Hermione grimace. The dragon
      ROARS hoarsely, then slowly retreats. Bogrod strides
      forth, blissfully ignoring the dragon’s bobbing head and
      presses his hand to the vault’s door. It MELTS.

      All rush inside. In the ensuing silence, the dragon
      spits FIRE... just as the vault re-seals itself and all
      goes DARK.

                   No wonder Bellatrix thought it was
                   real.

      Harry pays no attention, having drifted away from the
      others, playing his WANDLIGHT over the glittering walls.

      The others notice and go silent, watching. Griphook eyes
      Harry with particular curiosity. Finally, Ron speaks.

                   Is it here, Harry?   Can you feel
                   anything?

      Harry doesn’t respond, his wandlight continuing to travel
      over the small treasures above. Gradually, a HUM rises
      in his ears and he closes his eyes.

      As Hermione watches, transfixed, the CAMERA TRAVELS DOWN
      her arm TO her hand, which dangles nary a quarter inch
      from the lip of a SILVER BOWL perched on the edge of the
      table beside her.

      The HUM in Harry’s ears grows LOUDER and his wand hand
      begins to TWITCH. The BEAM of LIGHT TREMBLES over the
      objects nestled nearest the ceiling, then settles on an
      ANCIENT CUP, bearing the HUFFLEPUFF CREST. Harry’s SCAR
      CONTRACTS. He opens his eyes...

      The skin of Hermione’s wrist BRUSHES the LIP of the
      BOWL...

      Harry stares at the ANCIENT CUP above, glimmering dully
      in the light of his wand when...

      Hermione YELPS. As the others turn, they see her retract
      her hand, as if stung, sending the SILVER BOWL tumbling
      to the floor. She holds up her wrist -- displays a RED
      WELT.

                                 HERMIONE
                   It’s hot!

      All eyes turn to the bowl, WOBBLING MADLY on the floor,
      when... it SPLITS APART and begins to MULTIPLY.

                                 GRIPHOOK
                   They’ve added Gemino and Flagrante
                   Curses! Everything you touch will
                   burn and multiply!

      The multiplying bowls skitter across the floor and flip
      into the air. As one caroms off Ron’s shoe, it bursts
      into twenty more.

                                 HERMIONE
                   Ron, your foot!

      It’s SMOKING. As Ron stamps the ground, Harry pivots,
      tipping a towering STACK of GALLEONS to the floor where
      they multiply like cockroaches. Instantly, the room is a
      RIOT of multiplying white-hot metal.

                                 GRIPHOOK

      Harry points his wand once again at the small cup near
      the ceiling.

                                HARRY

                Give me the sword! The real one.

      Hermione reaches into her beaded bag, tosses it to Harry,
      who catches it by the hilt. Griphook’s eyes glitter
      greedily at the sight of it. Instantly, Harry begins to
      scale the multiplying mountain of objects, climbing
      towards the cup. As the sizzling surface shifts beneath
      his feet he moves upward, beads of sweat trailing over
      his forehead. Suddenly, halfway up, he SLIPS and --
      instinctively -- to keep from falling, he reaches out and
      plants the flesh of his palm against the shifting slope.
      Instantly, OBJECTS EXPLODE FORTH, MULTIPLYING CRAZILY and
      CASCADING down onto Ron, Hermione and Griphook in a small
      avalanche.

      Harry climbs faster -- the sound DEAFENING, objects
      CLANGING off one another -- until, finally, he stops just
      shy of the ceiling. Reaching out, he extends his arm --
      further, then further still -- and slips the sword’s tip
      through the cup’s handle. As it shimmies down the blade,
      a SCREAM RISES. Harry looks down, sees a terrified
      Bogrod pinned against the door, watching as Griphook
      sinks beneath the rising tide. Ron dashes forward, grabs
      Griphook’s fingers as he’s about to go under and yanks
      the blistered Goblin free.

                               HERMIONE
                Harry!   Behind you!

      Harry turns and sees the swelling mountain has reached
      the ceiling and -- with nowhere else to go -- is about to
      spill itself down upon him. Turning back...

      Harry leaps.

      He plummets, feet first, soaring through the air, then
      crashes down on the swelling treasure. The sword -- and
      cup -- fly free.

      Harry dives into the scalding treasure, hand
      outstretched, and catches it. Instantly, DOZENS of
      Hufflepuff Cups burst from his fist, but he holds tight
      to the original, grimacing in pain.

                                HERMIONE
                In here!

      Hermione holds her beaded bag before Harry and he jams it
      inside. As they turn for the door, they stop. Griphook
      holds the sword, the real sword, in his hands, turning
      the blade in the light.

                              HARRY
                We have a deal, Griphook.

      Griphook looks up.    A kind of madness burns in his eyes.

                              GRIPHOOK
                I said I’d get you in. I never
                said anything about getting you
                out.

      Pivoting swiftly, he SLAMS Bogrod’s hand to the door and
      as it melts, Harry, Ron and Hermione ride an avalanche of
      silver and gold into the outer chamber.

      As the trio find their feet, the dragon ROARS and SPITS
      FIRE, illuminating the tunnel. SHADOWS APPROACH,
      stretching over the tunnel walls: GRINGOTTS GOBLINS and
      GUARDS.

      Harry and Ron eye the approaching throng, turn back to
      Hermione with looks of mild panic. Steeling herself, she
      raises her wand.

      Nothing. Ron and Harry glance at each other and then --
      as if reading each other’s mind -- raise their wands high
      and, as one, JAB the dragon with the tip of their wands.
      It ROARS, rears, and soars into the air. As it caroms
      off the sides of the tunnel and scrapes the ceiling, the
      trio duck, watching the goblins scatter like skittles and
      dust and debris rain down. Harry looks back, sees the
      dragon’s SPIKED TAIL THRASHING, the tunnel caving.

      Ron and Hermione, both dripping wet, eye Harry.     His
      chest heaves from the swim to shore.

                                 HARRY
                        (out of breath)
                   You-Know-Who. He knows we broke
                   into Gringotts. He knows what we
                   took. He knows we’re hunting
                   Horcruxes.

                   Horcruxes are safe.

       dragon flew off.

                  There’s something wrong with him.
                  In the past, I could always follow
                  his thoughts. Now everything

                  dangerous.

       An eerie calm. POSTERS OF HARRY -- “UNDESIRABLE NUMBER
       ONE” -- droop from every light post. SHOPS, shuttered at
       this hour, sit silently, SHROUDED IN A THICK FOG. Only
       THE THREE BROOMSTICKS evidences life, where YELLOW LIGHT
       and COURSE LAUGHTER drift from greasy windows. Just
       beyond lies Honeydukes. Suddenly, there is a DISTURBANCE

       A SCREAM rents the air. INHUMAN. SHRILL. The laughter
       dies inside THE THREE BROOMSTICKS, a MOB OF SHADOWS fills
       the windows. Instantly, the trio pelt for Honeydukes.


210A   EXT. STREET (OUTSIDE HONEYDUKES) - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 210A

       As the trio close in on Honeydukes, Death Eaters spill

       the twisting streets, glancing down alleyways for signs
       of pursuers, the mist both friend and foe. Suddenly, a
       DARK FIGURE appears on the roof above. He WHISTLES.

                                     DEATH EATER #1

       His own FACE SLIDES BRIEFLY over the surface, then the
       end of the alley comes INTO VIEW. A DEATH EATER stands
       there, wand glowing in the mist.

       Just above the rooftops, barely distinguishable from the
       night, DEMENTORS DRIFT like smoke. As Harry draws his
       wand, Hermione’s hand covers his. She WHISPERS:

                    No, you’ll give us away.

       The night grows darker, the streetlights dim. The trio’s
       breath drifts visibly in the gathering chill. As the
       Dementors descend, the trio grimace, beset by bleak
       thoughts. A tear escapes Hermione’s eye, trails down her
       cheek. Finally, Harry can take it no more.

                                  HARRY
                    Expecto Patronum!

       A SILVER STAG bursts from his wand and charges down the
       street, scattering the Dementors before vanishing around
       the other side of the HOG’S HEAD INN.

       FOOTSTEPS clatter on the cobblestones. Harry, Ron and
       Hermione glance desperately about when -- suddenly --
       BOLTS GRIND, HINGES SQUALL and a DOOR OPENS. A CAT
       SLITHERS out and a MAN (ABERFORTH) appears in SILHOUETTE,

       fireplace, above which hangs a large OIL PAINTING of a
       BLONDE GIRL with a SWEET, but VACANT STARE. He steps to
       a grimy window and peers down to the street, where half a

                              NEVILLE
                That’s because it never existed
                till now. The seven secret
                passages were sealed off before
                the start of the year. This is
                the only way in or out now. The
                grounds are crawling with Death
                Eaters and Dementors.

                              HERMIONE
                How bad is it, Neville?    With
                Snape as Headmaster.

                              NEVILLE
                Hardly ever see him. It’s the
                Carrows you have to watch out for.

                                 HARRY

                                 NEVILLE
                   Brother and sister. They’re in
                   charge of discipline. Like
                   punishment, the Carrows.

      Neville points to a GASH on his face.

                                 HERMIONE
                   They did that to you? But why?

                                 NEVILLE
                   Today’s Dark Arts lesson had us
                   practicing the Cruciatus Curse.
                   On First Years. I refused.
                   Hogwarts has changed.

      The others look shocked.    Neville grins.

                                 NEVILLE
                   Aw, c’mon. Don’t be grim. We’re
                   all used to it by now. And the
                   thing is, it helps when people
                   stand up, gives everyone hope. I
                   used to notice that when you did
                   it, Harry. C’mon, we’re almost
                   there.

      The trio exchange glances, follow Neville.


218   INT. PASSAGE - NEW ANGLE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)                218

      Neville leads them up a short flight of stone steps to a
      DOOR, pauses. Looks back. WHISPERS.

                                 NEVILLE
                   Let’s have a bit of fun, shall we?
                        (pushing open the
                         door)
                   Hey! Listen up, you lot! I’ve
                   brought you a surprise!

                                 SEAMUS (O.S.)
                   Not more of Aberforth’s cooking, I
                   hope. Be a surprise if we could
                   digest it.

      Neville looks back, jerks his head toward the open door.
      Harry, Ron and Hermione step forward, duck through and...


219   INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT            219

      ... VOICES EXPLODE. Madness ensues as the trio is
      swallowed up in a scrum of backslaps and handshakes.
      Many familiar faces are present. Luna. Dean Thomas.
      CHO CHANG. LAVENDER BROWN. Neville leans down, WHISPERS
      to NIGEL.

                                 NEVILLE
                   Get the word out to Remus and the
                   others that Harry’s back.

      Nigel nods, scrambles over to a battered WIZARD WIRELESS.
      As it CRACKLES to life he leans close, SPEAKS.

                                   NIGEL
                   River, DA   calling. Do you read?
                   We have a   new weather report:
                   Lightning   has struck. I repeat,
                   lightning   has struck...

                                 NEVILLE
                   Okay, okay! Stand down! Let’s
                   not kill them before You-Know-Who
                   gets the chance!
                        (as they settle)
                   Right then. What’s the plan,
                   Harry?

      Harry gazes out over the expectant faces in the room,
      noting the hollow eyes and broken bodies and the
      desperate, almost palpable desire for hope.

      For a moment he seems lost, awed by the sacrifice his
      friends have made, much of it for him. Finally, he
      speaks:

                                 HARRY
                   Okay. There’s something we need
                   to find, something hidden here in
                   the castle. It could help us
                   defeat You-Know-Who.

                                    NEVILLE
                   What is it?

                   We don’t know.

                   Don’t know that either.

      A confused MURMUR fills the room.

                              HARRY
                I realize it’s not much to go on.

                              SEAMUS
                That’s nothing to go on.

      Harry falters, then his gaze happens upon the RAVENCLAW
      BANNER hanging across the room, bearing the symbol of an
      EAGLE. He studies it, a notion forming.

                              HARRY
                I think it might have something to
                do with Ravenclaw. It would be
                small, easy to conceal, valuable.
                Any ideas?

      He looks up.   For a moment, there’s no response, then:

                              LUNA
                Well, there’s Rowena Ravenclaw’s
                lost diadem.

                              RON
                     (under his breath)
                Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.

                              LUNA
                The lost diadem of Ravenclaw?
                Hasn’t anyone ever heard of it?
                It’s quite famous.

                              CHO
                Yes, but Luna, it’s lost. For
                centuries now. There’s not a
                person alive today who’s seen it.

      Her fellow Ravenclaws nod.   Ron frowns.

                             RON
                Excuse me. But would someone tell
                me: what’s a bloody diadem?

                              CHO
                It’s a kind of crown.     You know,
                like a tiara.

      As she says this, Harry frowns, trying to think if he’s
      seen such a thing in the castle.

                              CHO
                Ravenclaw’s was rumored to have
                magical properties, to enhance the
                wisdom of the wearer.

       Just then QUICK FOOTSTEPS ARE HEARD and a GIRL appears
       atop the far staircase. She stops, staring at Harry.

       Ginny.

                  Snape knows. He knows that Harry

229A   EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT (LATER)                          229A

       Mist encircles the parapets of the castle itself, barely
       distinguishable from the DEMENTORS that drift like silent
       sentinels over the grounds. LIGHTS GLIMMER in the
       castle.


229B   INT. COURTYARD - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)                        229B

       A stream of HUFFLEPUFF STUDENTS move toward the Great
       Hall. They walk grimly, their faces blank, as if
       accustomed to such exercises.

229C   INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - SAME TIME - NIGHT                   229C

       The Ravenclaws walk in lockstep as well. One TINY GIRL
       (MAISY REYNOLDS) stands out, walking alongside Luna, her
       bearing more defiant than defeated. The DEATH EATER
       chivvying them along eyes her cruelly.

                 Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds.

       Slytherin House walks in rigid synchronization, backs

       As the Grffindors walk, Harry moves in their midst,
       effectively shielded. Harry slips past a few people,
       reaches out and... enfolds Ginny’s hand in his own. She
       doesn’t look back, knows it’s him, knows his touch.


230    INT. GREAT HALL - SAME TIME - NIGHT                         230

       Each House stands together as a group, the room buzzing.
       No one sits. Harry is nowhere to be seen. At the Tall
       Table at the top of the Hall two DEATH EATERS -- AMYCUS
       AND ALECTO CARROW -- stand like sinister sentinels, their
       eyes raking the crowd. PROFESSOR McGONAGALL, her face
       ashen, her bearing reduced, stands along the right wall,
       while Flitwick stands by the left wall. As Snape enters,
       the room goes slowly silent.

                               SNAPE
                 Many of you are surely wondering
                 why I have summoned you here at
                 this hour. It has come to my
                 attention that earlier this
                 evening... Harry Potter was
                 sighted in Hogsmeade.

       A MURMURED THRILL fills the Hall. McGonagall’s eyes
       glisten with curiosity. Snape raises his voice, briefly,
       to quell the noise in the Hall.

                               SNAPE
                 I mention this in the hopes that
                 truth will not be supplanted by
                 rumor.

                                 SNAPE (CONT'D)
                   For myself and a few select
                   members of the staff this comes as
                   little surprise. We have, for
                   some time, considered Mr. Potter’s
                   return to Hogwarts to be not only
                   possible but inevitable.
                   Consequently, in the past several
                   months and under my specific
                   direction, exhaustive defensive
                   strategies have been employed to
                   defeat any attempt Mr. Potter
                   might make to breach these walls.
                   But know this. Should anyone --
                   student or staff -- attempt to
                   aid Mr. Potter, that person will
                   be punished in a manner consistent
                   with the severity of their
                   transgression. Rest assured: So
                   long as I am Headmaster at
                   Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never
                   again step foot in this castle.

      As APPLAUSE erupts from the Slytherins, Maisy Reynolds,
      glowers over at them. Snape raises a hand. The room
      returns to silence.

                                 SNAPE
                   Now then. If anyone here has
                   knowledge of Mr. Potter’s
                   movements this evening... I invite
                   them to step forward now.

      Snape’s eyes rake the Hall. Dead silence.       A nervous
      shift of glances. And then...

      FOOTSTEPS.

      A FIGURE appears in the shadows at the back of the Hall.
      McGonagall’s chin rises in disbelief. Maisy’s face
      blooms with hope. And then...

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                   I think I can help you out with
                   that...

      ... Harry appears.

                                 HARRY
                   It would seem that, despite your
                   exhaustive defensive strategies,
                   you have a bit of a security
                   problem, Headmaster.

      Snape stares in stunned disbelief, then his gaze shifts
      as one by one, others emerge: Ron. Hermione. Lupin.

                               HARRY
                 And I’m afraid it’s rather
                 extensive.

      The Carrows, who had been moving towards Harry, falter,
      turn to Snape with uncertainty. Harry’s eyes narrow with
      malice as he stares at Snape.

                               HARRY
                 How dare you stand where he stood.

      Snape watches Harry draw his wand, point it at him.

                               HARRY
                 Tell them how it was that night.
                 Tell then how you looked him in
                 the eye, a man who trusted you...
                 and killed him. Tell them!

      Snape’s eyes find Harry’s, but his face remains a mask.
      McGonagall stands poised, no longer an ashen ghost.
      Flitwick’s hand twitches over his wand. The air prickles
      with anticipation.

      Snape moves as if to retrieve his wand. McGonagall steps
      forward and sends a VOLCANIC BLAST Snape’s way.
      Pivoting, he parries the spell -- barely -- and sends it
      RICOCHETING around the room.

      CHAOS ensues. Flitwick and the rest of the staff --
      inspired by Harry and McGonagall -- leap forth, wands
      out. Snape, outnumbered, standing at the epicenter,
      parries spell after spell with astonishing skill
      deflecting two of the curses into Alecto and Amycus
      Carrow.

      Snape takes the measure of the room and sweeps his wand
      over his head, reducing the TORCHES that line the wall to
      SMOKE and pitching the Hall into total DARKNESS.

      As STUDENTS SCREAM, a GREAT WHOOSHING sound fills the
      Hall and some flying thing flickers past the windows,
      RATTLING the PANES before BLASTING through one.

      Instantly, the torches BURST back to life and we see that
      it’s McGonagall, wand raised aloft, who’s done it. In
      the moonlight, Harry can see a BATLIKE CREATURE beating
      into the night. McGonagall peers bitterly into the
      darkness.

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                Coward! COWARD! And he didn’t
                even stay to fight!
                     (turning to Harry)
                Mr. Potter, do you mind telling me
                what you’re doing here, which, I
                trust you realize, is an act of
                complete and utter lunacy?

                              HARRY
                I’m a Gryffindor.

                               PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                I thought it might have something
                to do with that.
                      (turning to the room)
                All right! Settle down! Settle
                down!

      The room quiets.

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                It appears that your Headmaster,
                to use the common phrase, has done
                a bunk.

      CHEERS RISE from all Houses save Slytherin, where PANSY
      PARKINSON glowers along with Blaise and Goyle. Even
      McGonagall can’t help but smile. Just then, Harry WINCES
      slightly, pressing his fingers to his temple.

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                Potter...

      A slow RUMBLING fills the Hall. Harry, fingers trembling
      with pain, glances up, sees DARK CLOUDS coagulating in
      the Enchanted Ceiling. McGonagall follows his gaze, as
      do others, watching as the clouds shift eerily, like
      blots of blood.

      Suddenly the FLAMES in the torches along the walls
      TREMBLE as a CHILL BREEZE consumes the room. The Hall
      slowly DIMS. All grows progressively silent when...

      ... a GIRL SCREAMS, her voice rising and rising. Harry
      rushes through the throng, the students parting as he
      pelts forwards, pushing past them until he finds...

      ... Maisy, cowering on the floor in the corner, hands
      over her ears, eyes clenched tight. She seems possessed.
      Everyone watches, chilled. Finally Harry starts to move
      forward, when he himself WINCES, pressing his fingers to
      his temples. Another person SCREAMS somewhere in the
      Hall, then another. Harry glances about him, at the
      circle of faces in his vicinity.

      All are a mirror image of Maisy now, grimacing in pain.
      Harry stares, confused, stricken with pain, when...

      ... a VOICE BLOOMS in his head in a DEATHLY WHISPER.

                              VOLDEMORT (V.O.)
                I know that many of you will want
                to fight. Some of you may even
                think this wise. But this is
                folly.

      We WEAVE THROUGH the room, taking in the faces, listening
      in mute misery as Voldemort speaks. Ginny, Hermione,
      Ron, Fred, George, Seamus... on and on.

                              VOLDEMORT (V.O.)
                I wish you no harm. I have great
                respect for the students of
                Hogwarts. I was once one myself
                after all. I ask for but one
                thing and if granted no magical
                blood shall be spilt...

      For a moment they stand, hung in silence...

                              VOLDEMORT (V.O.)
                Give me Harry Potter. Do this and
                none shall be harmed. Give me
                Harry Potter and I shall leave
                Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry
                Potter and you will be rewarded.

      With that, the whisper recedes and those in the   Hall
      slowly surface back into the prickling ambience   of the
      here and now. Above them, the clouds evaporate    in the
      Enchanted Ceiling. And then, like iron filings    flaking
      to the surface of a magnet, every eye finds...

      Harry.

      For a moment, silence.   Then, Pansy Parkinson jabs her
      finger at Harry.

                              PANSY PARKINSON
                But he’s there! Potter’s there!
                Someone grab him!

      Instinctively, Ginny steps in front of Harry, wand drawn.
      Then, as one, the Gryffindors assemble in a line and face
      towards the Slytherins, shielding Harry. Moments later,
      the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs do the same. Harry’s eyes
      glitter at the sight, moved. Ginny lowers her wand.

      Just then... FILCH bursts in the Hall.

      Filch stops dead, as MRS. NORRIS wends through his legs.

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                They’re supposed to be out of bed,

      Filch begins to turn away.

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                Wait! As it turns out, Mr. Filch,
                your arrival is most opportune.
                If you would, I’d like you to lead
                Miss Parkinson and the rest of
                Slytherin House from the Hall.

                              FILCH
                Right away.
                     (stopping)
                Er, exactly where is it I’d be

                     (a thought, then...)
                The dungeons should do.

      CHEERS rise again and McGonagall’s eyes turn on Harry.
      She rises up to full height, her jaw firm.

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                I presume you have a reason for
                returning, Potter. What is it you
                need?

                               HARRY
                Time.   As much as you can give me.

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                Do what you have to do. I’ll
                secure the castle.

                              HARRY
                Is that possible, Professor?

                              PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                We teachers are rather good at
                magic, Potter. We’ve even been
                known to turn out a worthwhile
                witch or wizard on occasion.

       Harry follows McGonagall’s gaze, sees Neville and Ginny

                    spell.

       Several yards off, Flitwick holds his wand aloft, his
       face grimly determined. Momentarily a “disturbance”
       troubles the atmosphere -- this is powerful stuff --
       McGonagall and other Staff members step forward to
       assist, wands raised high. Together, they conjure...

                    Protego Maxima...

235A   EXT. HOGWARTS (AERIAL) - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT            235A

       ... a magical SHIELD, which expands ever outward,
       blooming over the castle grounds, while far below the
       STATUES march the length of the viaduct and take their
       positions along the perimeter, still as sentinels.


235B   EXT. WOODEN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT                235B

       Further on, small as ants from this vantage, Neville,
       Ginny, Seamus and half a dozen DA members approach the
       WOODEN BRIDGE.


236    EXT. HOGWARTS ROCK - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT                  236

       As we leave them behind, MOVING BEYOND the Shield’s
       reach, a MASSIVE, QUIVERING SHADOW comes INTO VIEW,
       drifting toward the castle: DEATH EATERS, their numbers
       staggering. We DESCEND INTO their midst and a FIGURE
       EMERGES, stepping onto an OUTCROPPING, robes billowing,
       flanked by Bellatrix and PIUS THICKNESSE. We SWEEP
       AROUND, FIND his face: Voldemort.


236A   INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - NIGHT                                 236A

       Controlled chaos as scores of students and Staff sweep
       over the staircase, preparing for battle. Harry moves
       quickly, followed by Ron and Hermione. They speak with
       urgency.

                                  RON
                    Harry, Hermione and I have been
                    thinking. It doesn’t really
                    matter if we find the Horcrux.

                         (stopping)
                    What’re you saying?

                                  HERMIONE

                                  RON
                    So we were thinking --

                                  HERMIONE
                    You were thinking. It’s Ron’s
                    idea. And it’s brilliant.

                                   RON
                    You destroyed Tom Riddle’s Diary
                    with a Basilisk fang, right?
                    Well, we know where we might find
                    one, don’t we?

       Harry looks at the two of them.       Ponders this.    Nods.

                                  HARRY
                    Okay. But take this. That way
                    you can find me when you get back.

       Harry hands Hermione the MARAUDER’S MAP.

                                  HERMIONE
                    Where are you going?

                                  HARRY
                    Ravenclaw Common Room.    Got to
                    start somewhere.

       Hermione nods, slips the Map in her beaded bag and she
       and Ron head off. Just before they turn the corner, Ron
       looks back, holds Harry’s glance briefly... and then is
       gone. As Harry continues on, Luna steps INTO FRAME,
       watches him vanish in the crowd.

                                 HARRY
                   I’m a bit preoccupied right now,
                   Luna.

                                 LUNA
                   But you won’t find anything where
                   you’re going. You’re wasting your
                   time.

      Harry frowns, mildly annoyed, doesn’t glance back.

                                 HARRY
                   We’ll talk later, Luna.

                   Later.

      Luna stops, watching him recede.       Then suddenly:

                                   LUNA
                   HARRY POTTER!    YOU LISTEN TO ME
                   RIGHT NOW!

      Harry stops, stunned.    Turns.      Luna collects herself.

                                 LUNA
                   Don’t you remember what Cho said
                   about Rowena Ravenclaw’s diadem:
                   ‘There’s not a person alive who’s
                   seen it.’

      Harry stares dumbly back, shrugs, “So?”

                                 LUNA
                   It’s obvious, isn’t it? We have
                   to talk to someone who’s dead.

      Harry stares at her oddly when suddenly he becomes aware
      of the DISTURBANCE in the AIR around them. He looks up,
      toward the shield above, then at the tiny figure of
      Flitwick, wand aloft, standing with McGonagall and
      Sprout.

                                 LUNA
                   He’s very impressive, isn’t he?

      Harry starts to respond when he WINCES, clutches his
      scar, sees...
                                                             66.


239   EXT. HOGWARTS ROCK - SAME TIME - NIGHT                       239

      ... Voldemort, regarding the castle pityingly as the
      Hogwarts faithful take their positions.

                              VOLDEMORT
                They never learn. Such a pity.

      Voldemort smiles, as if amused.   His eyes gleam fiercely.

                               VOLDEMORT
                Begin.

      Bellatrix RAISES HER ARM in signal and the sea of Death
      Eaters settle, poised and waiting. The air goes still...

                              THICKNESSE
                But, my Lord, shouldn’t we wait --

      Voldemort’s eyes shift, killing the remainder of
      Thicknesse’s sentence before it can escape his throat.
      Bellatrix’s eyes narrow in contempt. Chilled, Thicknesse
      looks away. Then -- as if burying a knife deep in the
      heart of an enemy... Bellatrix drops her arm.


240   EXT. SPANNING BRIDGE - SAME TIME - NIGHT                     240

      EXPLOSIONS SOUND. Harry blinks, looking upward as the
      sky blazes with light and SMOKING TENDRILS plummet
      towards the castle. BOOM! The bridge ROLLS under his
      feet but the shield holds... for now. As fire fills the
      sky again, Fred and George burst out of the castle,
      grinning madly.

                              FRED
                Nice night for it!

      Harry turns to Luna.

                               HARRY
                Okay, Luna.   Who’ve you got in

241   INT. EMPTY CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT                      241

      Ron and Hermione move down a desolate corridor. They
      react to the distant sound of MUTED EXPLOSIONS, consider
      the door to the bathroom before them, then each other.
      Without a word, they pass through. Gone.
                                                              67.


242   EXT. WOODEN BRIDGE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)                    242

      Neville limps into our FIELD OF VIEW and peers outward,
      marveling at the bombardment above.

                              SEAMUS (O.S.)
                That’s it. I want a charge on
                each and every joist.

      Neville peers below. Down amongst the pilings, Seamus
      directs KATIE BELL, CHO and NIGEL in placing magical
      “charges” (spells) on key pressure points.

                              NEVILLE
                You do know what you’re doing,
                don’t you, Seamus?

      Seamus winks, gives a thumbs-up -- he seems to be
      enjoying himself, perhaps inordinately so. Neville
      exhales, shakes his head.

                              NEVILLE
                Blimey.

      Neville looks off then, peering back along the bridge’s
      spine to where Ginny stands at the far end. Seeing him,
      she raises her hand to wave... then goes still, her hand
      suspended in the air, looking past Neville as a HOWLING
      rises on the air like a crude battle cry. Hearing it,
      too, Neville turns, our view expanding, rising,
      revealing...

      HUNDREDS OF BAYING SNATCHERS rolling in an angry wave
      over the hill opposite.

                              NEVILLE
                Not good.

                                LUNA
                   No. I think it best if you two
                   talk alone. She’s very shy.

      Luna exits.    Harry eyes the shadows ahead.


245   EXT. BATTLEMENTS - SAME TIME - NIGHT                               245

      Lupin and SHACKLEBOLT stride out into the night as Dean
      tags after. Shacklebolt gives instructions to Dean.

                                 KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT
                   Tell Professor McGonagall Remus
                   and I will handle this side of the
                   castle.

                                    DEAN
                   Yes, sir.

      As Dean starts off, the grounds beyond and below come
      INTO VIEW: a sea of Death Eaters. Kingsley and Remus
      stop dead, narrow their eyes.

                                    KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT
                   Dean!
                        (as Dean stops)
                   On second thought, tell Professor
                   McGonagall we might need one or
                   two more wands this side.

      Dean nods, continues on, merely trading a glance with
      Arthur, Fred and George as they appear, staring in
      stunned disbelief at the deadly throng across the
      landscape.

                                 LUPIN
                   It’s the quality of one’s
                   conviction that determines
                   success, not the number of one’s
                   followers.

      Lupin stares straight ahead, as does Shacklebolt.

                                    KINGSLEY SHACKLEBOLT
                   Who said that?

                   Me.

      For the first time, they look at each other, share a
      fatalistic smile. Just then TONKS appears.

                   Speaking of quality.

      Tonks rushes past the Weasleys, lightly touching Arthur’s
      arm as she leaps into Lupin’s embrace. He hugs her
      deeply.

                                  LUPIN
                   You shouldn’t have.    It’s Teddy
                   who needs you.

                                 TONKS
                   He’ll sleep ‘til dawn and snore
                   like his father. It’s you who
                   needs me tonight.

      He looks her in the eye, not denying it. Then a
      THUNDEROUS BOOM SHATTERS the night and ACRID PLUMES of
      smoke strafe the sky. As they plummet, we TRACE their
      arcs...


246   INT. GREY LADY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT            246

      ... DOWNWARD, as SHADOWS, streaking across the walls of
      the corridor Harry walks. Up ahead, a GAUZY SHADOW plays
      eerily in the corner, undulating like the fins of a
      goldfish. As he turns the corner, Harry finds a
      BEAUTIFUL GHOST (Helena Ravenclaw) floating before a
      VEINED MIRROR, her reflected eyes distant and sad. As
      her face comes INTO VIEW, he reacts, recognizing her from
      his visions.

                                 HARRY
                   It’s you...

      The sea of Snatchers close on the bridge, their HOWLS
      DEAFENING. As Neville looks on in terror, a fresh VOLLEY
      of ROCKETS lace the night sky, his skin throbbing with a
      kaleidoscope of light: Blood red. Blue moon. Bright
      sun. He glances up, watching as the bombs strike the
      SHIELD and the SKY SHIVERS like water. Suddenly, his
      expression changes, faint hope displacing dread as...

      THWACK!

      ... teeth bared, the first Snatcher runs flat into
      Flitwick’s shield and bounces back.

      THWACK!   THWACK!    THWACK!

      One after another, the Snatchers bounce back.        A grin
      blooms on Neville’s face.

                                  NEVILLE
                   Ha!   Ha!

      Scabior stops short, eyeing the area ahead warily.
      Neville begins to LAUGH, in faint disbelief at first,
      then harder, almost maniacally, consumed by a fear turned
      to ecstasy. Hoarsely, he bellows at Scabior.

                                  NEVILLE
                   Yeah!   You and whose army!

      He grins, raises his wand and, with a TRIUMPHANT WHOOP,
      WHIPS his arm (too) VIGOROUSLY into the air and fires a
      SHOT into the night sky...

                                  SEAMUS
                   Woah!   Easy up there!

      Neville looks down, sees Seamus -- draped in CHARGES --
      glaring up at him.

                                 NEVILLE
                   Sorry.
                        (rubbing his elbow)

248   INT. OUTSIDE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - SAME TIME - NIGHT                 248

      Ron and Hermione reach the SERPENT’S HATCH that bars the
      way to the chamber. Ron takes out his wand.

                                 RON

      Hermione’s eyes widen in shock.        Ron shrugs.

                                 RON
                   Harry talks in his sleep.     Haven’t

                   No.   Of course not.

      The hatch swings open.

249   INT. APPROACH TO CHAMBER OF SECRETS - SAME TIME - NIGHT        249

      Ron and Hermione make their way through the shadowy
      cavern, BONES snapping like fish scales under their feet.
      As they reach a low wall of rocks, waist-high, Ron stops.

                              RON
                I’ve never got this far before.

                              HERMIONE
                I’m scared.

      Ron looks at her, then hoists himself through.

                Me too.


250   INT. CHAMBER OF SECRETS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT            250

      Ron and Hermione spill into the soaring cavern and begin
      to walk the gauntlet of serpents. Hermione peers ahead
      into Salazar Slytherin’s sinister face.

                              HERMIONE
                I didn’t expect it to be like
                this.

                              RON
                What did you expect it to be like?

      The Grey Lady drifts eerily, staring at Harry.

                You’re the Grey Lady, the ghost of
                Ravenclaw Tower.

                              THE GREY LADY
                I do not answer to that name.

                              HARRY
                I’m sorry. It’s Helena, isn’t it?
                Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena’s
                daughter. Luna told me.

                              THE GREY LADY

                   Yes. She thought you might be
                   able to help me.

                                 THE GREY LADY
                   You seek my mother’s diadem.

      Harry stops, stunned.

                   Luna is kind. Unlike so many of
                   the others, but she was wrong. I
                   cannot help you.

      She begins to drift away. Outside, EXPLOSIONS are heard.
      The room QUAKES. Harry looks desperate.

                                      HARRY

                   Many have sought my mother’s
                   diadem. Its powers are

                   Honestly --

      But she is drifting away.         Harry watches in desperation.

                                 HARRY
                   I don’t seek it for myself!      You
                   have to believe me!

      But she only drifts on.         Helplessly, Harry watches her
      go, then... decides:

                                 HARRY
                   I want to destroy it.

      She stops. Turns. He sees this has hooked her in some
      way. Begins walking back toward her, nodding.

                                 HARRY
                   That’s what you want, isn’t it,
                   Helena? You want it destroyed.

                But I only wanted to be more like
                her, clever and wise. She wore it
                so beautifully, but on me... I
                grew to hate it... the pain I

      Suddenly, her eyes blaze with anger, her face contorting
      horribly and Harry can’t help but take a step back.

                I know what he’s done! I know who
                he is! He defiled it! With Dark
                Magic!

      Harry stares at her, watching as her eyes drift and her
      face resolves itself again, vacant but beautiful.

                              HARRY
                Yes. That’s right. But I can
                undo that, Helena. I can destroy
                it once and for all. But only if
                you tell me where he hid it. You
                know where he hid it, don’t you,
                Helena? You just have to tell me.
                Please.
                     (stepping toward her)
                Trust me.

      She looks at him, standing so close now, only inches
      apart, lost in his eyes for a moment.

      himself. EXPLOSIONS sound again, faintly this time and
      for a moment it’s as if he’s forgotten why he’s come
      here. Then, her voice brings him round:

                It’s here. In the castle. In the

      Harry probes her eyes, baffled.

                If you have to ask, you’ll never

                ask...

      Slowly, Harry’s expression changes.   Then, he is backing
      away.

      Ron emerges from the shadows, basilisk fang in hand, and
      joins Hermione on Slytherin’s altar. She reaches into
      the beaded bag and removes the cup. He extends the fang

       A strange mixture of awe and ambivalence darkens his
       face. Then, suddenly, it vanishes and he points the wand

      knights arrayed along the bridge and onto the castle
      itself.


269   EXT. COURTYARD - SAME TIME - NIGHT                            269

      The PLUMES RICOCHET madly, shattering the tracery as the
      Knights struggle to defend the castle. McGonagall looks
      up: more PLUMES light up the sky, begin to plummet.

                               PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
                Fall inside!   Everybody! Fall
                inside!


270   EXT./INT. BATTLEMENTS - SAME TIME - NIGHT                     270

      Windows shatter, pierced by PLUMES, which MATERIALIZE
      into DEATH EATERS. Instantly, students and staff engage
      the dark wizards, standing shoulder to shoulder as they
      defend the school against the onslaught. Fred and George
      fall in on either side of Arthur, wands BLAZING, while
      Lupin, Tonks and Shacklebolt battle only yards away, the
      fighting swift and lethal.


271   EXT. WOODEN BRIDGE - SAME TIME - NIGHT                        271

      Neville’s eyes rake the fiery nightscape before him, then
      shift to the more immediate vicinity. He goes still.
      Scabior. The Snatchers. Are rising. Moving forward.
      Toward... him.

                               NEVILLE
                Not good.

      Neville starts to back up slowly, then turns heel and
      pelts back up the bridge. Plumes rain down from the sky.
      Enemy spells skitter at Neville’s feet. He looks back,
      sees Scabior and the others closing like a herd of
      wildebeests.

                               GINNY
                Ready!?

                              NEVILLE
                Are you bloody joking?!

      She lifts her wand, ready to DETONATE the SPELLS, when
      Seamus pops up beside her, a rather maniacal gleam in his
      eye.

                        (to himself)
                   Oh God --

      KA-BLAAAAAM! Neville sets off the charges. Instantly,
      one bridge section after another EXPLODES, rolling up
      like a carpet. Snatchers fall from sight, plummeting
      into the darkness. Neville looks over his shoulder, sees
      Scabior closing on him, then looks back towards Ginny,
      who stands frozen, wand raised, never fired, looking
      at...

      ... Seamus, his face blooming with fanatical ecstasy as
      he watches the charges detonate. As Seamus HOWLS with
      pleasure, Neville, WHEEZING PAINFULLY at this point,
      glances back and sees that Scabior has closed the
      distance, is coming fast when -- KA-BLAM! -- Scabior is
      catapulted into the air. Neville looks momentarily
      relieved, then realizes, to his evident dismay, that the
      bridge is falling away with increasing speed. Alarmed,
      Ginny looks to Seamus.

                                  SEAMUS
                   He’s good...

      The remainders begin to discharge, tripping off like
      firecrackers, one section after another vanishing...

                                  SEAMUS
                   He’s good...

      ... including the section under Neville’s feet...

      And he is gone.

      Ginny GASPS, hands to her face.      Seamus frowns.

      The moment hangs.

      Seemingly forever.

      Then CHARRED FINGERNAILS appear over the final remaining
      section of the bridge, followed by Neville himself, teeth
      blackened, a patch of hair lost, scalp smoldering.

                                 NEVILLE
                        (sarcastically)
                   Well done, Seamus!

      As Neville glowers at him, Ginny reaches out, hoists him
      onto what’s left of the bridge. Neville shakes some
      ASHES from his head and then... GRINS unexpectedly.

                                GINNY
                What?

                              NEVILLE
                That was kind of exciting.

      Seamus grins and winks knowingly.    Ginny shakes her head.

                                GINNY
                Mad.    The both of you.

      Just then, a thundering RUMBLE almost sends Neville
      tumbling off the bridge again. As Ginny steadies him,
      they all peer into the distance: GIANTS.

                                NEVILLE
                Not good.


272   EXT. VIADUCT/ENTRANCE - SAME TIME - NIGHT                     272

      Giants crash over the viaduct, laying waste to the
      Knights as more PLUMES rocket overhead.


273   EXT. COURTYARD/VIADUCT - SAME TIME - NIGHT                    273

      Death Eaters run roughshod over the grounds. Giants step
      on anything in their path, including the occasional Death
      Eater, crushing skulls, snapping spines.

      In the midst of the mayhem, Draco appears, his face
      bearing the small gashes he suffered at Malfoy Manor.
      Slipping past the nastiest players in the fray, he enters
      the castle.


274   INT. DUNGEON CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT                     274

      A grinning Filch regards the terrified run of Slytherin
      faces peering from within the dank cages before him.

                              FILCH
                Night-tee night.

                You let us out of here, you filthy

      Filch grins, shaking the ring of keys in his hand, then
      turns away.

      We STAY WITH   him as he walks away, then -- gently at
      first -- the   chamber begins to TREMBLE, until -- with
      each step --   it shakes more and more VIOLENTLY. Finally,
      Filch stops,   glancing apprehensively about when...

      ... KA-BOOM! Plaster RAINS DOWN and a RAGGED HOLE opens
      in the CEILING, followed by another and then another. A
      HUGE EYE peers down FROM ABOVE; a MASSIVE NOSE sniffs
      stupidly. It’s...

      ... a GIANT.

      As the Slytherins scream, the giant’s FIST drops heavily
      through the hole, fingers probing the cell clumsily. As
      Filch watches in horror, the cell falls to pieces and the
      Slytherins spill forth. Goyle is ruthless, flinging
      Housemates aside while Blaise follows in his wake. As
      they reach the safety of the corridor, a hand -- this one
      of human scale -- reaches out of the darkness, grabs
      Goyle:

      Draco.

276   INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - SAME TIME - NIGHT                       276

      Harry, still feeling the effects of Voldemort’s Shield
      shattering, stumbles forward as spells fly and bodies
      fall. Like a man possessed, he veers on, fighting his
      way toward the archway opposite when he sees a Death
      Eater drawing a bead on him. With nary a thought, Harry
      drops him with a Stunning Spell just as Ginny and Neville
      appear.

                                  HARRY
                   Ginny!   Neville! You alright?

                   I’m mad for her! Think it’s about
                   time I told her, seeing as there’s
                   a pretty good chance we’ll both be

      Harry and Ginny watch him dash off, then turn quickly
      back to each other. Their eyes catch. An instant, a
      moment of meaning in the midst of madness.

                                  GINNY

277   INT. WOODEN CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)                      277

      As Harry pelts down the corridor, an EXPLOSION DETONATES
      and the windows running the length of the corridor
      EXPLODE -- one after another -- showering Harry in glass.
      Then the wall itself falls away, rubble falling into the
      night and below. Harry never breaks stride. As the
      BILLOWING SMOKE thins, Malfoy appears, flanked by Blaise
      and Goyle. They follow.

       Harry continues on, almost running now, then WINCES,
       faltering as he’s struck by a spike of PAIN, his fingers
       tracing his scar as he resumes his pace, knowing he’s
       getting closer, feeling it, his head HUMMING with the
       Horcrux’s sinister siren song, the sound growing LOUDER
       and LOUDER as he turns down yet another aisle and...

       Stops.

       A vein THROBS VISIBLY at Harry’s temple. Hand trembling,
       he reaches out, pushes aside a STACK OF DECAYING
       SPELLBOOKS and finds a PAIR OF EYES looking at him over
       the rim of a DUSTY CANISTER. He pushes the canister
       aside and reveals a POCKMARKED STONE BUST of a WARLOCK
       with GLASS EYES. Perched atop its head, dulled by time,
       is ROWENA RAVENCLAW’S DIADEM. He reaches out...

                 Well, well, what brings you here,

       Harry looks slowly over his shoulder. Draco -- Blaise
       and Goyle at his side -- steps INTO VIEW, his face
       bisected by light. He holds a wand on Harry.

                               HARRY
                 I could ask you the same.

       studies Draco’s face.

                                  HARRY
                    Why didn’t you tell her?

       Draco doesn’t respond.

                                  HARRY
                    Bellatrix. You knew it was me.
                    But you didn’t say anything.

       Blaise and Goyle, confused by this, regard Draco dimly
       from either side. Draco fidgets, his hand twitching on
       the wand.

                                  DRACO
                    Give me my wand.

       Harry continues to study Draco’s face.

                                   HARRY
                    No.   I don’t think so...

       With blithe disregard, Harry removes the wand in his own
       pocket, ponders it.

                                  HARRY
                    Besides, its allegiance is to me
                    now. If you want it, you’ll have
                    to win it back. Perhaps even kill
                    me...

       Harry looks up.      He and Draco lock eyes.

                                    GOYLE
                    C’mon, Draco.    Don’t be a prat.
                    Just do ’im.

       Draco’s hand twitches, his brow conflicted, then his eyes
       shift -- catch sight of Hermione, in SILHOUETTE, far
       beyond Harry’s shoulder, her wand pointed... at him. He
       blinks, as if she were a mirage... then... a BALL of
       SCARLET LIGHT bursts from her wand, briefly illuminating
       her face, and strikes his hand. As his wand flies free,
       Goyle steps into the breach and fires back at Hermione.

       The spell caroms off the stone bust instead, sending the
       diadem spinning into the air.

       Ron fires a flurry of spells at Goyle, but he manages to
       elude them all by crashing through the wall of junk. As
       it TEETERS, Ron pelts through the hole made by Goyle and
       gives chase. Ting! Harry looks up, sees the diadem
       bounce off the top of a BIRDCAGE, skitter along the top
       of the highest shelf and bounce... out of sight. Gone.
       Turning back, he finds Blaise taking aim at him.

                 Expelliarmus!

       Blaise’s wand flies free and he scarpers. An instant
       later, Hermione steps INTO VIEW. A MASSIVE GROAN echoes
       and the walls of towering junk SHUDDER. Harry looks up.
       Hermione looks up. Then at each other. The sky is
       falling.


       NEW ANGLE - HIGH

       One after another, the towering walls spill like dominos.


       NEW ANGLE - GROUND LEVEL

       Harry and Hermione run side by side as the world comes
       crashing down.

                               HERMIONE

       Ting! Ting! Ting! The diadem drops from the sky and
       hops, skips and jumps down the aisle in front of them.
       Harry and Hermione exchange a glance and pelt after it.
       Harry nearly has it in grasp when a small AVALANCHE of
       MOLDY BOOKS bars his path. Hermione leaps over the
       books, reaches out and... grabs it. Harry comes panting
       up.

                              HARRY
                 Well done. Let’s find Ron and get

       Harry wheels, sees Ron running towards them chased by a
       RIVER of SCARLET FLAMES.

                 RUN! Goyle’s set the bloody place
                 on fire!

       As one, the trio dashes through the remaining aisles as
       the towers of junk turn to ash all around them. The
       flames draw closer, mutating into a pack of fiery beasts:
       SERPENTS, CHIMAERAS, DRAGONS -- all nipping at their
       heels. No matter which way they turn, the flames follow
       them.

                                 HARRY
                 Split up!

       Each goes a separate way, but it’s no use. The fire
       simply divides, the serpent slithering after Harry, the
       chimaera after Hermione, the dragon after Ron. Harry
       glances up, sees Malfoy and Blaise scaling a mountain of
       burning junk, doomed. He takes one turn after another
       until he comes to a clearing and nearly runs into... Ron
       and Hermione as they arrive from separate paths. They
       glance around frantically. No free path exists. The
       flames ROAR, racing toward them.

       Harry glances around once more and sees them:

       HALF A DOZEN ANCIENT BROOMSTICKS.

                                 HARRY
                 Here!    Take one!

       He tosses Ron and Hermione broomsticks then takes one for
       himself. As Hermione slips the diadem atop her head, the
       flames EXPLODE into the clearing, ENGULFING them as
       they...

       ... SOAR FREE, just barely eluding the snap of the
       dragon’s fiery jaws. As they race away, a HORRIBLE
       SCREAM pierces the clamor and they all look below, see
       the flames devour Goyle.

       Then Harry sees them, perched atop a fragile, crumbling
       tower. Harry whips his broom around and jets forth. Ron
       shakes his head, then jets after, BELLOWING:

       Harry sweeps down, grips Malfoy’s hand while Ron takes
       Blaise’s. The instant Draco’s foot leaves the mountain
       of junk, it collapses into a great billowing cloud of
       ash, mushrooming upward and blinding Harry and Ron.
       Unable to get their bearings, they swerve dangerously,
       squinting and choking when...

       ... a GIANT BEAM of LIGHT shimmers in the distance, like
       a beacon. It’s Hermione, hovering on her broom, wand

       sees Harry looking at him. Then, as one, they fly pell-

       light burns so bright all goes white and they burst...

       diadem SPINS MADLY on the ground. Harry snatches it
       quickly, as if it might run away and Hermione tosses him
       the basilisk fang. He stares down at the smoking diadem
       and briefly pauses, reading the words etched there: Wit
       Beyond Measure Is Man’s Greatest Treasure. Then, without

                        (eyeing him with
                         disgust)
                   Go. Find Severus. Tell him I
                   need to see him immediately.

      Lucius rises quickly, exits. Voldemort fixes his eyes on
      the wand once again. The snake HISSES.

      Harry TWITCHES. His eyes flutter open. The sounds of
      battle no longer distant. Hermione and Ron wait
      expectantly. Harry nods.

      ... courtyard, where students and staff trade spells with
      Death Eaters, among them PADMA PATIL; Neville and Seamus;
      Sprout, and Kingsley.   From an upper balcony, PROFESSOR
      TRELAWNEY raises her wand, draws a bead on a Death Eater
      and with a forceful flick, sends him flying through the
      air. Seamus regards her with amazement.

                                 TRELAWNEY
                   There’s more to me than incense
                   and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan.

      Dean trades spells with a Death Eater, while Luna STUNS a
      QUARTET of Death Eaters -- one-two-three -- and watches
      the fourth fall before she can fire. She turns, sees
      Neville standing behind her, wand smoking.

       As the trio pelts through the madness, Hermione GASPS,
       catching sight of LAVENDER BROWN as she falls to the
       ground. Hermione’s eyes shift, spy FENRIR GREYBACK, lips
       still glistening with Lavender’s blood, staring at her.
       He smiles, starts forward...

                                  HERMIONE
                    NO!

       Hermione’s wand flashes. A DEAFENING BLAST. Greyback
       takes it straight to the chest, pitches up into the air
       and drops. Unmoving.

       The trio races away from the burning castle. In the
       distance part of the Dark Forest BURNS, trees shedding
       SPARKS into the sky like scarlet feathers. SHADOWS do
       battle in the distant dark. SCREAMS shatter the night.

       A THUNDEROUS SHOCK WAVE as a MONSTROUS GIANT lurches INTO
       VIEW, swinging one of the QUIDDITCH GOALS, the golden
       ring dripping BLOOD. Seeing the trio, it whips the ring
       down, strafing them with threads of blood, but missing
       them, narrowly, scooping out a massive CHUNK of earth
       instead. It GROANS in anger, lumbers stupidly off. The
       trio races on.

       Harry, Ron and Hermione pick their way forward, moving
       quietly through the eerie light, then stopping within the
       safety of the shadows. They watch:

       Voldemort steps INTO VIEW and extends the wand.    In the
       mercurial light, it looks like a living thing.

                                  VOLDEMORT
                    Why doesn’t it work for me?

                                  SNAPE
                    You have performed extraordinary
                    magic with this wand, my Lord. In
                    the last few hours alone --

      Snape studies Voldemort in the half-light, then his eyes
      shift to Nagini, who skims slowly over the wooden floor,
      circling the two wizards.

                                 SNAPE
                   There is no wand more powerful.
                   Ollivander himself said it.
                   Tonight, when the boy comes to
                   you, it will not fail you, I am
                   sure. It answers to you and you
                   only.

                                  VOLDEMORT
                   Does it?

      Voldemort holds the wand to the wavering light again, his
      eyes on Snape.

                                  SNAPE
                   My Lord?

                                  VOLDEMORT
                   The wand.   Does it truly answer to
                   me?

      Snape says nothing. For a moment, he and Voldemort stand
      perfectly still, two faces in the darkness, the only
      sound the lapping of the lake. Harry studies Snape’s
      face -- calm, composed -- then notes the hand concealed
      behind his back, twitching with tension.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                   You’re a clever man, Severus.
                   Surely you must know.

      Snape remains silent. His gaze shifts to Nagini, still
      skimming slowly over the floor.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                   Where, Severus? Where does its
                   loyalty lie?

      Snape looks away from Nagini, sees Voldemort staring at
      him.

                                 SNAPE
                   With you, of course, my Lord.

      Voldemort stares long at Snape, then, finally speaks:

                                 VOLDEMORT
                   The Elder Wand cannot serve me
                   properly, Severus, because I am
                   not its true master.

                The Elder Wand belongs to the
                wizard who killed its last owner.
                Ollivander was quite explicit
                about that. You killed
                Dumbledore, Severus. While you
                live, the Elder Wand cannot be
                truly mine.

      Snape stares at Voldemort, then his eyes shift to Nagini,
      still circling.

                                  SNAPE
                My Lord --

                You have been a good and faithful
                servant, Severus.

      Voldemort raises the wand, points it at Snape’s throat.

                              VOLDEMORT
                But only I can live forever...

      Voldemort sweeps his arm away, turning the wand on
      Nagini.

                                  VOLDEMORT
                Kill.

      Snape’s eyes shift... meet the snake’s. The snake
      strikes. Harry’s SCREAM is swallowed by Snape’s own.
      Voldemort runs a finger along the wand, eyeing it with
      wonder, transfixed, then turns away.

                                  VOLDEMORT
                Nagini!   Come!

      He sweeps from the room, toward the lake’s quivering
      darkness, the giant snake slithering after.

      Harry rushes forward, into the strange, wavering light,
      then stops in horror, watching Snape’s blood run like
      syrup over the weathered boards toward him. Ron bumps
      past, heading in the direction Voldemort took. Hermione
      pauses by Harry.

      Harry kneels by Snape. He lays his fingers upon the
      bloody wound at his neck, but it’s no use. Snape’s eyes
      shift and, briefly, look deep into Harry’s. And then he
      begins to...

      Cry.

                   Take them!

      Snape’s face SHUDDERS softly and his tears TRANSFORM,
      from clear water to SILVERY BLUE. Harry reacts to the
      color. He’s seen it before...

      Suddenly Snape grabs his collar, pulls him close.

                                  SNAPE
                   Please.

      Snape holds Harry captive briefly, then drops back to the
      floor. Harry blinks, shaken.

                   Give me something! Quickly!      A
                   flask! Anything.

      Instantly, Hermione CONJURES a flask from thin air.
      Hands trembling, Harry presses it to Snape’s ashen cheek,
      letting the fluid flow within.

                                 SNAPE
                   They are the same...

      Harry searches Snape’s face, trying to decipher his
      words. Snape stares at Harry in wonder, lost in his
      eyes, then his pupils dilate, his voice trailing off.

                                 SNAPE
                   You have your mother’s eyes...

      Snape’s face goes slack.     Harry shivers.       Ron reappears.

                                  RON
                   He’s gone.   The snake too.

      Just then the sound of THUNDER, like a GATHERING STORM,
      engulfs them. The joists of the shack GROAN, as if in
      agony. The entire room begins to tremble. Ron yanks a
      board from the window and the trio peers out. As in the
      Enchanted Ceiling before, a face appears in the dark
      clouds above. And then VOLDEMORT’S VOICE ECHOES:

                   You have fought valiantly... but

                Harry Potter, I speak now directly
                to you. On this night you have
                allowed your friends to die for
                you rather than face me yourself.
                There is no greater dishonor.

                you do so I give my word that no
                other life will be lost on this
                night. You have one hour. If, at
                the end of that time, you have not
                given yourself up, then I shall

                child who tries to conceal you
                from me.

      The joist trembles one last time, then the ambient sounds
      of the night return. The clouds separate, become just
      clouds. Ron YELLS:

                Never!   Do you hear me!   NEVER!

      THEIR POV

      Triage. The House tables have been pushed to the walls.
      The injured stand in groups, arms slung over one another,
      waiting to be treated by MADAM POMFREY. Filch’s arm
      gushes blood. Flitwick’s face is laced with GASHES.

      Harry stands in the doorway, taking it all in, as if some
      invisible force prevents him from going further, his face
      a mask as he views the DEAD laid out in the middle of the
      Hall, among them Remus and Tonks, their blood-stained
      fingers clumsily intertwined. A heartbreaking SOB draws
      his gaze to George, who kneels over a familiar body,
      tears dripping from his eyes. Beside Harry, he hears a
      GASP -- Hermione -- but he doesn’t turn, his eyes instead
      lost on Ginny, puffy-eyed and pale, standing alongside a
      distraught Arthur and Molly. Ron comes INTO VIEW then,
      having left Harry in the entryway to join his family. As
      he drapes his arm over George, drawing his brother into a
      limp embrace, the lifeless body comes INTO VIEW:

      Fred.

      Hermione glances back at Harry briefly before joining the
      Weasleys. Seeing her, Ginny begins to cry, burying her
      face in Hermione’s shoulder. Gently, slowly, Hermione
      strokes Ginny’s copper hair, over and over, murmuring
      something softly.

      For a moment, Harry stands, hung in the doorway, then the
      Great Hall seems to fly away from him, to grow smaller,
      to shrink as he reels backward, stumbling away...

      slams it onto Dumbledore’s old desk. He pries the cork
      from the flask with his teeth, tips the silvery-blue
      liquid into the basin. As the Pensieve swirls, Harry
      looks up, at the PORTRAITS of PAST HEADMASTERS hanging
      above. All the frames are empty. Harry frowns,
      disturbed by this, but looks away and PLUNGES his FACE

      VILLAGE in the distance. FRANTIC BREATHING. We stop.
      Still. A BABY’S CRY separates briefly from the breeze.

      We CIRCLE ABOUT, leaving the POV, and LOCATE a FACE
      HOVERING in the darkness. It is Snape, chest rising and
      falling. Stricken. Concerned.

      We GO TO BLACK...

      LILY EVANS emerges from some brush, a FLOWER upon her
      palm, opening and closing its petals like some bizarre
      oyster. Her sister PETUNIA stares, then KNOCKS the
      flower away.

                               PETUNIA EVANS
                 We’re going home.

      Petunia takes Lily’s arm, turns -- and stops. A SKINNY
      BOY (YOUNG SNAPE) sits beneath a tree, watching them.
      Without a word, he opens his hand and a LEAF FLUTTERS
      from his palm like a butterfly, circling Lily once, then
      drifting up and away. Lily smiles, charmed. Petunia
      eyes the boy fearfully, then pulls Lily away. The boy
      watches them go. As Lily glances back...

      We GO TO BLACK...


      FADE IN:

314   EXT. POTTER HOUSE - GODRIC’S HOLLOW - NIGHT (YEARS PAST)     314

      Snape moves   through a dark garden, his face like stone.
      He eyes the   door ahead, hanging from its hinges. He
      peers up to   the WINDOW above. The baby’s CRY rises
      again. His    eyes glitter. He moves on, disappears
      inside.
                                                              99.

      Lily and the boy lie together, staring up at the sky.

                              YOUNG SNAPE
                She’s jealous. Because she’s
                ordinary and you’re special.

                                LILY EVANS
                That’s mean.

                               YOUNG SNAPE
                It’s true.   You know so yourself.

      Snape turns his head, notes the frown knitted across
      Lily’s brow. He peers back up, staring hard at the tree
      limb above. The leaves begin to TREMBLE, then BURST
      FREE, fluttering like a cloud of butterflies. Lily
      watches impassively and then -- slowly -- smiles,
      shifting her gaze to another branch. Seconds later,
      those leaves burst free and the two fluttering veils pass
      back and forth high overhead, merging briefly, then
      separating, again and again. Lily LAUGHS -- a beautiful
      sound -- and the HISS of a TRAIN ENGINE is heard. The
      leaves turning, we --

      The boy peers out the window, watching Lily and Petunia
      on the platform ARGUING, their VOICES MUTED. Finally,
      Lily turns, dashing for the train in tears. The boy
      straightens up, running the flat of his hand over his
      lank hair. Moments later...

      Lily comes up the aisle, eyes stinging. She stops,
      seeing him. They stare at one another and then, finally,
      she steps inside the compartment, and sits down. The boy
      reaches over, pulls down the blind, WIPING the SCREEN
      and...

      Two boys -- SIRIUS BLACK and JAMES POTTER -- sit together
      at the Gryffindor table, watching as...

      A YOUNGER McGONAGALL sweeps the hat from the stool and
      calls out a name. James Potter watches Lily smile
      nervously at the boy next to her (Snape), then rise and
      make her way to the top of the Hall. As McGonagall
      lowers the hat over Lily’s brow, James watches intently,
      waiting. Finally, McGonagall speaks and all those around
      James CHEER. He merely smiles, watching Lily approach.
      He gives Sirius a nudge, to move over, making a space for
      Lily.

      As she takes her seat, she glances across the hall to the
      boy, who watches impassively as James reaches out his
      hand to introduce himself to Lily.

      Snape mounts the stairs,   peering upward in the darkness
      to the landing above and   the open bedroom door beyond.
      As his eyes become level   with the next floor, he sees a
      WAND lying there. As he    reaches the top and turns, he
      sees JAMES POTTER -- the   man -- lying dead in the middle
      of the hallway.

      SNOWFLAKES FALL LIKE BUTTERFLIES. Lily walks, hugging
      her books, as the boy harangues her. He looks driven by
      desperation and perhaps because of it, says something too
      sharp. She looks up at him, eyes stinging with tears,
      then turns away. The boy starts to call after her,
      regret in his eyes, then sees James waiting on the other
      side of the courtyard. As she reaches him, they turn and
      together exit the courtyard. The boy turns away, his own
      eyes stinging with tears, then closes his eyes and all
      goes...

      INTO VIEW, desolate but for a few LEAFLESS TREES. The
      adult Snape turns on the spot, breathing heavily, his
      expression haunted and cheerless as his gaze sweeps the
      darkness. The WIND RISES suddenly and a JAGGED JET of
      WHITE LIGHT stitches the night, sending Snape’s wand
      flying and dropping him to his knees.

      A SNAPPING of ROBES precedes Dumbledore as he APPARATES
      INTO VIEW.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   That wasn’t my intention.

      Snape stares fearfully at him.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   Stand up, Severus. I haven’t much
                   time. What message do you bring
                   from Lord Voldemort this time?

                                 SNAPE
                        (rising)
                   None. I come on my own account.
                   I come with a... request.

      Dumbledore’s eyes flicker briefly with interest.    He
      studies Snape’s fearful face.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   Is this about the Prophecy?

                                   SNAPE
                   Yes.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   How much did you relay?

                                 SNAPE
                   Only what I heard. But now... he
                   thinks it refers to her.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   The Prophecy did not refer to a
                   woman. It spoke of a boy born at
                   the end of July --

                                 SNAPE
                   Yes! But he thinks it’s her son!
                   He intends to hunt them down now!
                   To kill them!

      Dumbledore eyes Snape craftily.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   If she means so much to you,
                   surely Lord Voldemort would spare
                   her in exchange for the boy.

                You disgust me. You would
                sacrifice the life of an innocent
                child over a schoolboy crush?

                              SNAPE
                She’s more than that! She’s
                different! Beautiful. Kind.
                     (looking away)
                Hide them all. I beg you.

                And should I do so, what will you
                give me in return, Severus?

                You said you would keep her safe!

                Lily and James put their faith in
                the wrong person. Rather like
                you, Severus.

      Snape reels, staring miserably at the SLATE SKY beyond
      the windows. Dumbledore studies him cunningly.

                   His arrogance rivals even his

                   Sometimes we see what we expect to
                   see, Severus. Other teachers
                   indicate the boy is modest,
                   likeable and while no prodigy,
                   possesses above-average gifts.
                   Personally, I find him rather

      Snape ministers to his right hand, which is BLACKENED. A
      RING lies upon the desk before them.

                Why did you put it on? Surely you
                realized it carried a curse.

                But should he fail, one would
                presume the Dark Lord will turn
                to... you.

      Snape does not respond.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   You must agree.

      Snape stares in horror at Dumbledore.      Dumbledore nods.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   Yes. You must be the one to kill
                   me, Severus. It is the only way.
                   Only then will the Dark Lord trust
                   you completely.

                                 SNAPE
                   You ask too much.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                        (thundering)
                   Too much! Nothing I could ask is
                   too much. You know what is at
                   stake! You more than anyone!

      Snape says nothing.    Dumbledore sits back, painfully
      studies his hand.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   There will come a time when Harry
                   Potter must be told something.
                   But you must wait until Voldemort
                   is at his most vulnerable.

                                    SNAPE
                   Tell him what?

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   On the night Lord Voldemort went
                   to Godric’s Hollow to kill Harry,
                   and Lily Potter cast herself
                   between them, the curse rebounded.
                   When that happened, a part of Lord
                   Voldemort’s soul latched itself
                   onto the only living thing it
                   could find: Harry himself.

      Snape stares in disbelief.       Dumbledore nods.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   There’s a reason Harry can speak
                   with snakes. There’s a reason he
                   can look into Lord Voldemort’s
                   mind. A part of Lord Voldemort
                   lives inside him.

                               SNAPE
                 So when the time comes, the boy
                 must die.

                              DUMBLEDORE
                 Yes. And Voldemort himself must
                 do it. That is essential.

      Snape nods, pondering all of this.    His voice is bitter.

                                SNAPE
                 You’ve kept him alive so that he
                 can die at the proper moment.
                 You’ve been raising him like a pig
                 for slaughter.

                               DUMBLEDORE
                 But this is touching, Severus.
                 Don’t tell me you’ve grown to care
                 for the boy?

      Snape eyes Dumbledore fiercely, then:

                               SNAPE
                 Expecto Patronum!

      A blast of LIGHT bursts from his wand, soars out the
      window: a SILVER DOE.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                 Lily.    After all this time?

325   INT. PORTER HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT (YEARS PAST)              325

      In the f.g., a BABY FIDGETS in its crib. We see Snape
      enter the room, glance at the baby, then down toward the
      floor. He stands, utterly still... then his face creases
      with pain.

      Lily lies in profile, eyes open but empty, staring toward
      the ceiling. Her chest is still. Snape leans down and,
      cradling her, begins to weep...

                               DUMBLEDORE (V.O.)
                 The irony of course, Severus, is
                 that -- in the end -- you and the
                 boy desire the same thing...

      Harry emerges, dripping, from the Pensieve and stares at
      his REFLECTION in the window opposite, watching as the
      liquid runs like tears from his face, then evaporates.
      Gently, he touches the center of his chest.

328   INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)                 328

      The castle is eerily quiet as Harry walks, the PORTRAITS
      he passes EMPTY. As he reaches the end of the corridor,
      he turns and stops. In the SHADOWS of an ALCOVE,
      Hermione murmurs to Ron, their faces close. For a long
      moment, Harry simply watches them. Then, as if sensing
      his presence, Hermione turns. Instantly, she runs to
      him. Ron follows.

                              HERMIONE
                Where’ve you been?

                              RON
                We thought you’d gone to the
                forest, we thought you might be --

                              HARRY
                I’m going there now.

                               RON
                Are you mad!   No!

                              HARRY
                It’s... meant to be.

                              RON
                Rubbish! You can’t just give
                yourself up to him --

      Hermione squeezes Ron’s arm, silencing him.

                              HERMIONE
                What is it, Harry? What is it you
                know?

      Ron studies her face, then looks back to Harry.

                              HARRY
                There’s a reason I can... hear
                them -- the Horcruxes.

      Hermione begins to shake her head, not wanting to
      believe. Harry simply nods, touches the center of his
      chest.

                                 HARRY
                   I think I’ve known for awhile.
                        (studying her)
                   I think you’ve known too.

      Hermione stands still, miserable.

                                 HERMIONE
                   I’ll go with you. I’ll --

      She falters hopelessly as a single tear traces her cheek.
      Harry reaches out, wipes it away.

                                 HARRY
                   Kill the snake. Kill the snake
                   and then it’s just him. Then it
                   will be over.

      He turns then, leaving them. Ron and Hermione stand
      silently, watching every step he takes until he reaches
      the end... and is gone.


329   INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)                   329

      As Harry descends, Neville and Oliver Wood appear in the
      Entrance Hall far below, carrying the body of a smallish
      boy: Nigel.

                                 OLIVER WOOD
                   I’ll take him from here.

      Oliver throws Nigel over his shoulder, enters the Great
      Hall. Neville watches them go, looking, for a moment,
      very old. Then, wearily, he turns, heading back outside.


330   EXT. HOGWARTS - GROUNDS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)              330

      In the distance, SHADOWS collect the dead, too occupied
      with their grim task to notice Harry. He stares straight
      ahead, just walking, until a VOICE tugs his ear:

                                 GINNY
                   It’s all right. We’re going to
                   get you inside.

      Ginny crouches over the tiny Ravenclaw girl, who is
      CRYING.

                   I kept calling. No one came.

                                   GINNY
                   Don’t worry.    I won’t leave you.
                   I promise.

      Ginny strokes the sobbing girl’s hair, her own face
      haunted by sorrow. Harry studies her, moved, then
      continues on. A moment later, Ginny turns, looks to the
      place where he was standing... but finds only darkness.


331   EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - NIGHT                                   331

      Harry reaches the Forest’s edge. Within, further on, he
      can see Dementors drifting within the trees. Harry
      starts to enter, then pauses, reaches into his pocket and
      removes the Snitch. Eyes the words etched upon it: “I
      open at the close.”

      Harry frowns, then closes his eyes, brings the metal orb
      to his lips. His fingers tremble, then lowers his hand,
      watching as the metal shell FALLS AWAY to reveal... the
      RESURRECTION STONE. A JAGGED CRACK runs down its center,
      along the line representing the Elder Wand. The TRIANGLE
      and CIRCLE, representing the Cloak and Stone, are faintly
      visible. Harry stares at it, then closes his eyes and
      begins to roll the Stone over in his hand.

                                 HARRY
                        (murmuring)
                   Once. Twice. Thrice...

      Harry stands for a moment and then, slowly, opens his
      eyes. Reacts. FOUR PEOPLE stand within the Forest:
      JAMES POTTER, SIRIUS BLACK, REMUS LUPIN and LILY POTTER.
      Lily eyes him lovingly and beckons him forth. As if in a
      dream, Harry drifts through the trees, stops before her.

                                 LILY POTTER
                   You’ve been so brave, sweetheart.

                                 HARRY

                   You’re nearly there, son.

                                 HARRY
                   I’m sorry. I didn’t want any of
                   you to die for me. And Remus,

                   mother and father died for.
                   Someday he’ll understand...

      A CHILL BREEZE shakes the trees.       Harry looks ahead.

                                 HARRY
                   You’ll stay with me?

                   He won’t be able to see you?

      Sirius shakes his head, gestures to Harry’s heart.

                                  SIRIUS BLACK
                   No.   We’re here, you see.

      Harry turns to his mother.

                                 HARRY
                   Stay close to me.

                   Always...

      Harry glances back, toward the Forest’s Edge, takes a
      last look at the castle in the distance, then sets off.
      Dozens of DEMENTORS drift amongst the smoking trees, but
      his guides insulate him, and they merely peel away.
      Harry walks on, his legs driving him, until LIGHT
      splinters the trees ahead, and a CLEARING comes INTO
      VIEW.


332   EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT                           332

      A FIRE burns, its light flickering over the throng of
      DEATH EATERS present. Lucius and NARCISSA MALFOY, weary
      with fear, sit apart. BELLATRIX paces in and out of the
      shadows, MUTTERING madly.

      And then there is Voldemort, who stands with his head
      bowed, his skeletal hands folded over the Elder Wand.
      Nagini lays in a heavy coil at his feet.

      Yaxley enters the clearing.

                                 YAXLEY
                   No sign of him, my Lord.

      Voldemort nods, unmoving.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                   I thought he would come.   I was,
                   it seems... mistaken.

                   You weren’t.

      All eyes shift to Harry, standing at the clearing’s edge.
      He lets the Resurrection Stone tumble from his fingers
      and James, Sirius, Lupin and, lastly, Lily -- all vanish.
      Harry steps into the firelight.

                                   HAGRID
                   HARRY!   NO!   WHAT’RE YEH DOIN’
                   ‘ERE!

      HAGRID is trussed to a tree. The branches shake
      violently as he tries to break free.

                                   YAXLEY
                   Quiet!

      He flicks his wand and Hagrid slumps, goes silent. A
      CACKLING LAUGH rises on the air and Harry turns, sees
      Bellatrix glancing eagerly from Harry to Voldemort.

      Voldemort takes a step forward and the flickering flames
      wash over his pale skin. He tilts his head to the side.
      A smile curls on his mouth.

                                   VOLDEMORT
                   Harry Potter.    The Boy Who Lived.
                   Come to die.

      Nagini HISSES behind her protective guard of Death
      Eaters. Harry’s gaze shifts to her when Voldemort raises
      his wand. Scarlet flickers in his eyes. Then a BOLT of
      GREEN LIGHT shatters the night and all is...

      All but a BRIGHT WHITE MIST.

      Harry lies face down. For a long moment. Finally, he
      stirs, sits up. Touches his face. His glasses are gone.
      He peers into the mist. Nothing. But somewhere, out
      there, in the mist, is a SOFT THUMPING.

      He stands. Peers up. A DOMED GLASS ROOF hovers --
      familiar. The THUMPING persists. Unnerving. Harry
      squints into the mist.

      Moving, the THUMPING     growing LOUDER. Up ahead, a SMALL
      MASS quivers. Harry      slows... recoils. A thing -- like a
      small naked child --     lies SHUDDERING on the ground, its
      skin raw and rough.      Harry leans close...

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   You cannot help.

      Harry spins, finds Dumbledore standing within the mist.
      At the sight of Harry, Dumbledore beams and spreads his
      arms wide. His hand is whole, no longer damaged.

                                 DUMBLEDORE
                   Harry. You wonderful boy. You
                   brave, brave man. Let us walk.


      NEW ANGLE - HARRY AND DUMBLEDORE

      Walking.

                                 HARRY
                   Sir, this, is this... I mean,
                   forgive me, but you are dead,
                   aren’t you, sir?

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                   Oh, yes.

                                 HARRY
                   Then... I’m dead too?

                                   DUMBLEDORE
                   Ah.    That is the question, isn’t
                   it?    On the whole I think not.

                                   HARRY
                   Not?

                                   DUMBLEDORE

                              HARRY
                But I didn’t defend myself.   I let
                him kill me.

                              DUMBLEDORE
                And that will, I think, have made
                all the difference. I suspect you
                now realize that you and Voldemort
                have been connected by something
                other than fate since that night
                in Godric’s Hollow all those years
                ago, Harry.

                              HARRY
                It’s true, isn’t it, sir? A bit
                of him lives in me, doesn’t it?

                              DUMBLEDORE
                Did. It was just destroyed only
                moments ago by none other than
                Voldemort himself.

      Harry plays his fingers over his sternum.

                              DUMBLEDORE
                You were the seventh Horcrux,
                Harry; the Horcrux he never meant
                to make.

                              HARRY
                And you knew this? That’s why you
                were certain I wouldn’t die?

                              DUMBLEDORE
                Certain? No. Little is certain
                in this world, Harry. Call it an
                educated guess.

      Dumbledore smiles. Harry ponders this, then, deep in the
      mist, the THUMPING returns.

                              HARRY
                Professor, is that -- ?

                              DUMBLEDORE
                Something beyond either of our
                help.

      Harry ponders his surroundings.

                              HARRY
                Exactly where are we, sir?

                              DUMBLEDORE
                I was going to ask you that.
                Where would you say that we are?

                              HARRY
                It looks like King’s Cross station
                -- only a lot cleaner. And
                without the trains.

                              DUMBLEDORE
                King’s Cross! Is that right?
                Well, this is, as they say, your
                party.

      Harry looks perplexed by this, but Dumbledore only
      smiles.

                              HARRY
                Sir, why didn’t you just tell me
                about the Deathly Hallows?

                              DUMBLEDORE
                You will have to forgive me,
                Harry. You see... I didn’t trust
                you.

      Harry stares at him.   For the first time, Dumbledore
      looks troubled.

                              DUMBLEDORE
                I feared that you would make the
                same mistake I made, that you
                would be intoxicated by the power
                the Hallows promise their
                possessor. But I crave your
                pardon, Harry. It’s clear to me
                now, as it should have been all
                along, that you are the better
                man.

                               HARRY
                Sir --

                              DUMBLEDORE
                You are the worthy possessor of
                the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was
                fit to own the Elder Wand, because
                I took it not for gain, but to
                save others from it. But I took
                the Stone because I longed to
                recall someone who has long been
                at peace and for that I paid with
                my life.

                              DUMBLEDORE
                Yes.

      Harry ponders this, then frowns.

                              HARRY
                I used the Stone as well, sir,
                only a little while ago when I
                entered the Forest. I saw my mum
                and dad, and Sirius and Lupin...

                              DUMBLEDORE
                True. But ask yourself this:
                were you calling them? Or were
                they calling you?

      Harry studies Dumbledore, whose expression remains
      serene.

                              DUMBLEDORE
                     (looking him in the
                      eye)
                You are the true master of death,
                Harry, because the true master
                does not seek to run away from
                death. He accepts that he must
                die, and understands that there
                are far, far worse things in the
                living world.

      For a moment, they stand in silence.

                              HARRY
                I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?

                I’ve got a choice?

                Oh yes. We are in King’s Cross,
                you say? I think, should you so
                decide, you would be able to,
                let’s say, board a train.

                I have always prized my ability to
                turn a phrase -- words are, in my
                not so humble opinion, our most
                inexhaustible source of magic,
                capable both of inflicting injury
                and remedying it. But I would --
                in this case -- amend my original
                statement to this:
                      (leaning close)
                Help will always be given at

                it...

                Assuming circumstances in the main
                are favorable to such an outcome,
                of course.

                              HARRY
                With all due respect, sir, I think
                what we need here is a miracle.

                              DUMBLEDORE
                I’ve never put much stock in
                miracles, Harry. On the other
                hand, I can attest wholly to the
                extensive advantages of a related
                phenomenon.

                who live without love.

                              HARRY
                Sir, my mother’s Patronus. It was
                a doe, wasn’t it? Just like
                Professor Snape’s. Curious, don’t

                     (a smile)

                Is this real? Or has this been

                              DUMBLEDORE
                Of course it is happening inside
                your head, Harry. But why should
                that mean that it is not real?

334   EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT                     334

      Harry lies facedown, glasses askew. He OPENS his eyes a
      millimeter, finds Narcissa’s face swimming in the dawn’s
      muted light, eyeing him with a strange intensity: the
      question, he realizes, was posed to him.

334   CONTINUED:                                                  334

                                 BELLATRIX
                   My lord, let me help you --

                                 VOLDEMORT
                   I do not require assistance.

      Across the clearing, Voldemort rises shakily, Bellatrix
      at his elbow. The Death Eaters watch, stirring
      uncertainly. Voldemort glances toward Narcissa, toward
      Harry. Bellatrix detects the wary glint in his eyes.

                                  BELLATRIX
                   The boy.   Is he dead?

      Harry’s eyes shift, meet Narcissa’s once again.
      Something in her expression... He closes his eyes.   She
      places her fingers over his heart, WHISPERS:

                                  NARCISSA
                   Is he alive?   Draco?

      Harry hesitates and then... nods -- so subtly it’s barely
      perceptible. Narcissa withdraws her hand, turns to where
      Bellatrix stands alongside Voldemort. Nods. The Death
      Eaters CHEER. Hagrid HOWLS in misery. The news seems to
      rejuvenate Voldemort. A fierce glint returns to his
      eyes. His stature grows. He eyes the Elder Wand... and
      smiles.


335   EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)                      335

      Neville, battle-scared and weary, perches atop a fallen
      statue in the chill morning air. Reaching into his
      pocket, he removes his WAND, holds it to the light... and
      watches the TIP drop like the head of a drowsy child.
      BROKEN. He tosses it away.


      NEW ANGLE - NEVILLE - NIGHT

      Neville kicks through the rubble. One could reconstruct
      the history of Hogwarts from the detritus before him:
      spell books, trophies, potion boxes. But Neville’s
      expression remains stoic, unsentimental. He’s seen too
      much in the last 12 hours.


      CLOSE ON THE PEAK OF A HAT

      Neville crouches down, studies it. Reaching out, he
      wiggles it free, slaps it against his thigh to chase the
      dust.

      The Sorting Hat.
                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                             119.
335   CONTINUED:                                                    335

      He ponders it, regarding its ragged surface, singed and
      torn, then pops it on his head, a beaten jester. Again,
      his face remains blank. He squints, peering vaguely into
      the distance. As he gaze falls on the bridge, he stops.
      An odd procession approaches.


336   EXT. VIADUCT - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT                        336

      Hagrid lurches forward awkwardly, CLUTCHING a BODY in his
      arms, ropes extending in three directions from his neck
      as a trio of Death Eaters -- one in front, two behind --
      jerk him along like a tethered beast. From Hagrid,
      Neville’s gaze drifts to Bellatrix and Narcissa and then
      to Voldemort himself -- dark, fierce -- before settling
      on the most unnerving sight: a giant wending snake.


337   EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT                      337

      Suddenly a WHISPER fills Neville’s ears.

                                 SORTING HAT
                   Don’t despair, Longbottom.   I put
                   you in Gryffindor for good
                   reason...

      The Hat COUGHS then, raining dust over Neville’s brow and
      he whips it off, studies it warily.

                                 GINNY (O.S.)
                   Who’s that?

      Neville turns, sees that Ginny has come out onto the
      broken steps and is staring at the procession.

                                 GINNY
                   ... Hagrid’s carrying?

      Neville just stares, mute. Her eyes shift then, to him,
      and he sees they are glistening faintly. Her voice, when
      she speaks, nearly gets lost in the morning breeze.

                                 GINNY
                   Neville, who is that?

      Before he can answer, others begin to spill out of the
      castle. Luna and Seamus. Cho. Arthur Weasley. Ron and
      Hermione emerge and, seeing the procession... know.
      Hermione draws a sharp breath and something about it --
      the unadulterated sense of loss contained within it --
      causes those around her to look and know as well.

                                 ARTHUR WEASLEY
                   What’s going on here, Neville?
                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                             120.

      Neville starts to speak but falters and then, simply
      because he can’t bear to look at Ginny’s face and the
      faces of the others looking to him for something,
      anything, he turns his gaze to the Hat dangling in his
      hand. And as he does, something GLINTS within. As he
      stares... we --

                                                           CUT TO:


338   EXT. VIADUCT - PROCESSION - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAWN           338

      ... Voldemort and the others, moving with them, as they
      draw near. Voldemort surveys the ruins of the castle and
      the beaten posture of the throng assembled upon its
      steps. He smiles faintly, with cruel satisfaction.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                   Behold, Nagini. Our work is done.


339   EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAWN                      339

      Ron, Hermione, Ginny and the others stand silently as the
      procession comes to a halt before them. All eyes drift
      to Hagrid and what lays in his arms.

                                  GINNY
                   No... NO!

      Ginny’s primal cry echoes over the grounds as she rushes
      towards Voldemort, but Arthur steps between and wraps his
      daughter in his arms, letting her struggle briefly before
      pulling her tighter, closer, safer.

                                  VOLDEMORT
                   SILENCE!

      Voldemort points his wand to the sky with a CRACK.

                                  VOLDEMORT
                   Stupid girl.   You cry for that?

      Voldemort gestures to the body lying still in Hagrid’s
      arms.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                        (addressing all)
                   Tell me. These last few hours --
                   as you collected the dead and
                   tended your wounded -- was he by
                   your side?

      Voldemort surveys the throng, who stand mute.    He nods,
      as if their silence were answer enough.
                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                 VOLDEMORT
                   While your hands ran dark with the
                   blood of mothers and sons, fathers
                   and daughters, brothers and
                   sisters, his were clasped in
                   prayer -- but it was a prayer for
                   one and one only. While you
                   battled courageously, until you
                   could no longer will yourself to
                   stand, he had long since fallen to
                   his knees. While you cursed me
                   until your voices grew ragged, he
                   begged me for mercy in a voice as
                   meek as a child’s.

      Voldemort’s eyes narrow.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                   So do not cry for that. He’s not
                   worthy of your tears. And do not
                   despair of his betrayal. You were
                   never in his heart. Not for one
                   single solitary beat.

                                 RON
                   Liar!

      Voldemort flicks his wand and Ron drops to his knees,
      grimacing in pain. Voldemort gestures to him.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                   Did you not hear me! Harry Potter
                   is dead! From this day forward,
                   you put your faith in me or suffer
                   the consequences. HARRY POTTER IS
                   DEAD!

      Nagini HISSES MADLY as Voldemort, looking a touch mad
      himself, rakes his eyes over the students and staff.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                   Now is the time to declare
                   yourself.

      There is a nervous MURMUR among the crowd.

                                 LUCIUS MALFOY
                   Draco...

      Draco looks up, sees his father summon him forth with a
      short nod. He hesitates. Lucius smiles thinly.

                                 LUCIUS MALFOY

                                NARCISSA
                Come, Draco.

      Her tone is quiet, but absolute. Draco looks into her
      eyes, then ducks his head and steps forward, avoiding the
      baleful glances directed his way as he crosses the gulf
      between factions. Ron mutters poisonously as he passes.

                              RON
                He saved your life.

      Draco falters briefly, stung, then joins his mother. She
      hands him a WAND, Harry’s wand. He stares at it bleakly.

                              VOLDEMORT
                Well done, Draco. Who will be
                next? Hm? Come now, don’t be
                shy.

      We TRAVEL OVER FACES, weary but resolved, eyes burning
      with defiance, then LAND ON Neville, chin on chest, gaze
      to the ground. As the Sorting Hat rocks gently in his
      hand, something GLINTS within again, and a QUIVERING
      PARABOLA OF REFLECTED LIGHT dances above his brow.

      He steps forward.

      Stunned, the others watch Neville -- blackened with soot,
      Sorting Hat in hand -- limp to a halt in front of
      Voldemort, who regards him with amusement.

                              VOLDEMORT
                Well, I must say, I’d hoped for
                better. Is this truly the best
                Hogwarts has to offer?

      The Death Eaters laugh.   Bellatrix grins in cruel
      amusement.

                              VOLDEMORT
                Who might you be, young man?

                By stepping forward, he lives to
                see another day...

      Voldemort’s eyes shift, regard those standing before him.
      The implication of his statement is not lost on them.

                              NEVILLE
                I’d like to say something.

      Voldemort’s brow furrows vaguely.   As he studies Neville,

                                                          CUT TO:


      HARRY

      ... as his eyelids separate ever-so-slightly.


      HARRY’S POV OF NEVILLE

      He studies his face when... the CURIOUS REFLECTION
      QUIVERS once again. Harry watches it dance briefly
      across Neville’s cheek before vanishing. Harry’s gaze
      shifts to the Sorting Hat in Neville’s hand, then shifts
      again, to Nagini.

                all be fascinated to hear what you
                have to say.

      Neville turns to the others, their weary faces regarding
      him with confusion, suspicion.

                              NEVILLE
                It doesn’t matter that Harry is

      A troubled MURMUR ripples through the crowd.

      Seamus tries to push forward but Ron grips his arm, holds

      Neville takes a step forward, looks Voldemort in the eye
      and SPITS. Then he reaches into the Sorting Hat.

      SCARLET glints in Voldemort’s eyes and he smiles, raising
      the Elder Wand when Neville -- in keen anticipation --
      reaches into the Sorting Hat and pulls forth...

      The Sword of Gryffindor.

      As Voldemort’s wand FIRES, Neville parries and the curse
      REBOUNDS, taking out the QUARTET of DEATH EATERS flanking
      Bellatrix -- only she is quick enough to deflect the
      curse. As she SCREAMS in FURY, Harry spills from
      Hagrid’s arms.

      Voldemort wheels wildly in Harry’s direction when:

                                 DRACO
                Potter!

      Harry turns. Draco’s hand whips forward and -- to
      Harry’s shock -- tosses him his wand. Ron GRINS.

                              RON
                Well done, Malfoy!
                     (to himself)
                Can’t believe I just said that.

      Wand in hand, Harry turns and -- in one continuous
      motion -- FIRES on Voldemort. Voldemort blocks the
      spell, eyeing Harry with mild disbelief, then anger.

       NAGINI HISSES -- as if attuned to Voldemort’s emotions --
       and RIBBONS toward Harry. As she STRIKES, Harry
       sidesteps her -- by inches -- then stumbles back and
       counters.

                                HARRY
                 Confringo!

       FLAMES run the length of Nagini -- with no effect -- then
       climb the back of a nearby Death Eater and consume him.

       Enraged that Harry has attacked Nagini, Voldemort FIRES a
       VOLLEY of CURSES. Harry parries the first, then falls
       back into a cloister. The stonework EXPLODES all around
       him, creating THREE RAGGED HOLES. He pelts away.


339A   INT./EXT. COURTYARD/GREAT HALL ENTRANCE - DAWN              339A

       As Harry arrives at the doors to the Great Hall, he finds
       Ron and Hermione there.

                                HARRY
                 The snake!   We’ve got to kill the
                 snake!

       Neville, only a few yards off, sword in hand, OVERHEARS.
       As his eyes shift to Voldemort and Nagini.

                                NEVILLE
                 Harry!   Look out!

       Harry wheels, sees Voldemort drawing a bead on him. As
       Harry begins to raise his wand, Neville steps between,
       brandishing the sword...

       ... just as Voldemort’s WAND BLAZES and Neville’s world
       explodes.

       Taking the full brunt of it all, Neville grimaces,
       watching as Voldemort’s spell -- like a CURRENT OF
       ELECTRICITY -- races up the sword’s blade to the hilt...

       ... and PITCHES off his feet and fifty feet back into the
       Great Hall. Harry exchanges a glance with Ron and
       Hermione. Their faces say it all: no one could have
       survived that.

       The Entrance Hall EXPLODES with COUNTER-FIRE as members
       of the Order, students and staff return fire. Voldemort
       FLICKS his WAND, the AIR PRICKLING with DISTURBANCE as he
       SUMMONS a SHIELD of AIR insulating himself from attack.
       As he sweeps forward, he responds with a DEVASTATING
       SERIES of SPELLS and the Entrance Hall QUAKES. Harry
       turns and dashes...
                                                          126.


340   INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - DAWN (MOMENTS LATER)                 340

      ... up the stairs, picking his way through the rubble and
      limp bodies strewn upon the steps, attempting to draw
      Voldemort -- and Nagini -- away from the others.

      It works.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                  Nagini!   With me!

      Voldemort, his cloak swirling like water, the great snake
      at his heel, strides toward the stairs and FIRES.

      Harry flinches as SHARDS of MARBLE rain down upon him.
      Wheeling, he fires back.

      Voldemort parries Harry’s spells with frightening ease,
      mounting the steps and firing again and again.

      Eyes darting frantically, Harry blocks the spells with a
      mixture of skill, instinct and pure luck. He stumbles
      back, FIRING WILDLY. One of his spells skitters down the
      steps and strikes Nagini. The snake HISSES, unharmed but
      ANGRY.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                  Leave her!

      Voldemort’s eyes glitter with RAGE, as if he himself had
      been struck by the spell. Harry FIRES again, purposely
      aiming for the snake this time. Voldemort counters with
      palpable FURY, spells CAROMING MADLY up and down the
      staircase. Harry shields his eyes briefly, then looks
      down and sees...

      ... a CLOUD OF SMOKE hanging over the stairs from
      Voldemort’s spells, but Voldemort himself is... gone.
      Harry glances about frantically, then WHOOSH! The hairs
      on the back of Harry’s neck rise. He turns.

      Voldemort materializes at the top of the stairs, fires a
      RIBBON of FIRE at him. Harry counters it, but it is so
      powerful he can’t deflect it. He stands, connected to
      Voldemort by the rippling ribbon of fire. He stumbles
      back, the muscles in his forearm twitching in pain. He
      hears a HEAVY ROLLING SOUND, like meat slapping a marble
      table and looks over his shoulder, downwards.

      Nagini is undulating upward, over the steps, toward
      Harry. As the snake HISSES an oddly SIMILAR SOUND
      escapes Voldemort’s lips as he pushes his advantage. The
      ribboning flames grow more intense, begin to lick the
      flesh of Harry’s wand hand.

      Harry glances once more at Nagini who draws closer, then
      back at Voldemort, who stares fiercely at Harry, willing
      the FLAMES down the ribbon of light toward Harry. Harry
      winces as the flames SINGE the HAIR on his knuckles.
      Then, summoning every bit of strength he’s got, Harry...

      ... breaks the spell, staggering away, as the ribbon of
      light shoots upward and the ceiling above gives way,
      raining debris onto Nagini.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                   I said LEAVE HER!

      Harry peers down at the wreckage below, then watches
      Nagini slither free, her thick braids oozing with
      lacerations, but otherwise unharmed. WOOSH! Harry turns
      and Voldemort VANISHES again, only to...

      ... reappear seconds later on Harry’s blind side. Harry
      wheels and, in a sweeping motion, sends a CLUSTER of
      DEBRIS hurling at Voldemort.

      Instantly, Voldemort reaches out his hand and the debris
      grows smaller as it flies toward him, until, as it
      reaches his hand, it appears to vanish altogether. Then
      he turns his palm upward.

      SAND runs between his fingers to the floor.

      Harry stands watching, stunned.

      His eyes meet Voldemort’s. Voldemort’s eyes narrow
      eerily -- in a most unhuman way -- and he...

      HISSES.

      Harry stumbles back, freaked out, when:

                                 VOLDEMORT
                        (in Parseltongue)
                   Now, my sweet. Now.

      Harry turns, sees Nagini, only yards away, rising to
      strike. He fires instinctively, then dashes for the
      balustrade and leaps...

      ... into the air...

      ... falling...

      ... and falling...

      ... until...

       painfully. He glances up, sees Voldemort’s face.
       Instantly, Voldemort flicks his wand and the stone floor
       around Harry explodes, the surface dancing like water.
       He turns, glances around desperately, then spies...

       ... a DOOR.   Without thinking, he pelts towards it and...


341-345 OMITTED                                                 341-345

       ... through, into a corridor TEEMING with SMOKE. In the
       distance, a PATCH of LIGHT drifts oddly in the swirling
       mist, glowing weakly, then is swallowed by the smoke.
       Far off SCREAMS -- the cries of battle -- HANG in the
       air, hollow and distant. Harry moves through the mist,
       feeling his way.   The walls shimmer like skin on his
       periphery, barely discernible, melting, lost in shadow.
       A LOW BEATING rises in Harry’s ears, RAPID at first then
       growing slower and slower as it increases in volume and
       all ambient sound drifts away, revealing the low beating
       to be...

       ... the THRUMMING of Harry’s heart.


346A   INT. MARBLE STAIRCASE - SAME TIME - DAWN                       346A

       Voldemort sweeps down to the lower landing and pauses,
       eyeing the DOOR AHEAD. He glances up, in the direction
       of Nagini -- conflicted.

                                 VOLDEMORT
                  Nagini!

       He waits, sees the giant snake begin to wend its way
       down. Then passes through the door.


       NEW ANGLE - NAGINI - MOVING

       ... flowing like water ever downward when -- THWACK! -- a
       BIT of RUBBLE bounces off her slithering tail. She
       HISSES, coiling in on herself, blunt head darting about
       warily.

       Hermione stands, watching.    Rearing back, she hurls
       another SHARP FRAGMENT.

       As the fragment hits its mark, Nagini strikes blindly,
       furious, then spies Hermione. Instantly she begins to
       slither toward her.

       Ron, clutching a BASILISK FANG in his FIST.


346B   INT. OXFORD CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - DAWN                     346B

       Harry pushes himself forward, blindly, silently. He
       squints. Up ahead, DARK COILS of IMPOSSIBLY THICK smoke
       corkscrew from the stone floor.

       WHOOSH! Harry wheels, watches a FIGURE materialize back
       at the doorway. The smoke shifts, revealing Voldemort.
       He raises his wand, pointing it directly at Harry as the
       smoke thickens once again, concealing him. Seconds
       later...

       ... a RIBBON of FIRE erupts through the mist, stitching
       its way through the smoke towards Harry. Harry watches --
       transfixed for a moment -- then flings himself aside,
       narrowly eluding the sizzling ribbon of fire.

       WHOOSH! Voldemort vanishes, becoming one with the smoke,
       and Harry feels a RUSH OF AIR rocket past him. He spins,
       blindly, and watches a disturbance of smoke several
       yards.

       WHOOSH!

       ... the air TREMBLES WITH DISTURBANCE once more, but
       violently this time, the SMOKE WHIRLING crazily up and
       down the corridor. Harry spins in a circle -- wand
       raised -- paranoid.

       A second ribbon of fire comes from the blackness narrowly
       missing Harry.

       Harry staggers on, tripping over the BODIES that litter
       the stone floor, desperately gulping for air as the SMOKE
       grows thicker, CHOKING HIM, a rag doll in the eye of a
       TORNADO, the LIGHT ahead BLOOMING more BRILLIANTLY as he
       rushes on, BLINDING him as his HEART THRUMS MADLY and
       VOLDEMORT’S VOICE RISES IN HIS EARS...

       Voldemort’s face FLICKERS before him briefly, insanely,
       and HARRY SCREAMS, pitching himself forward and then he
       is IN THE LIGHT, passing through, beyond the archway
       and...

        stops, looks around. Realizes he is trapped. He turns

        Too late.

        Voldemort’s spells BLAST him off his feet.

        through the rubble that obstructs her path. Suddenly, up
        ahead, Hermione comes INTO VIEW, wand extended. She
        FIRES. Nagini HISSES, continuing on. Hermione lowers
        her wand, standing perfectly still as...

        Ron PELTS INTO VIEW, FANG IN HAND. He lifts the tusk
        when -- Nagini spies him and -- wicked fast -- uncoils
        her tail, knocking the fang from his hand. He watches it
        clatter down the stone steps, then looks back at the
        great snake. It begins to move... toward him.

        As Harry climbs to his feet, Voldemort sends a RIBBON OF
        DARK MATTER snaking through the air. Harry blocks it,
        DEFLECTING IT DOWNWARD, where it EXPLODES VIOLENTLY. As
        the walkway beneath his feet gives way, HARRY DROPS, just
        as another of Voldemort’s spells sails over his head
        and...

        ... Harry drops to a walkway below. Harry glances up,
        sees Voldemort’s SHADOW begin to move forward.

        He glances around, then dashes for a DOORWAY ahead.   He
        is almost there when:

        WHOOSH!

        TENDRILS of FABRIC encircle his ankle, arm and neck and
        SPIN HIM ROUND. Harry looks:

       Voldemort stands upon the walkway now, CLOAK SWIRLING
       MADLY as the hem UNRAVELS and CLOTH VIPERS slither across
       the walkway and up Harry’s body. Before Harry can react,
       Voldemort flicks his wand and SNAPS the cloth tight,
       reeling Harry toward him.

                                  VOLDEMORT
                    Why do you live!

       As Voldemort’s face looms close, eyeing Harry like a
       curious specimen, Harry looks up.

                                  HARRY
                    Because I have something worth
                    living for.

       Angrily, Voldemort poises the Elder Wand over HARRY’S
       SCAR. The flesh there begins to color with blood, the
       lightning bolt turning white as ice. And then...

       Voldemort’s HAND BEGINS TO TREMBLE. He stares at the
       wand and watches -- in horror -- as a CRACK APPEARS and
       begins to expand along its length. For a moment, he only
       stares, as if betrayed...

       Harry looks too, mind racing. The TENDRILS encircling
       him begin to FRAY, loosening their grip on him ever-so-
       slightly. He wiggles his hand free and LASHES OUT,
       striking Voldemort across the cheek.

       Voldemort’s eyes shift, glaring at Harry, when he looks
       down, watches a DROP of BLOOD strike the fabric
       encircling Harry’s wrist. He reaches up, fingers his
       cheek: BLOOD.

       Instantly, Harry steps back.

                                  HARRY
                    Confringo!

       The tendrils of fabric BURST INTO FLAMES. Voldemort
       falls back and -- with his fractured wand -- slices the
       burning ribbons. As they turn to ash, Harry stumbles
       back and Voldemort picks him up and hurls him INTO A
       WALL. As he rises, Voldemort fires again.

       SHADOWS streak across our PLANE OF VIEW, like warriors in
       an ancient shadow play. SOUND SURFACES SLOWLY, ODDLY, as
       if our EAR DRUMS were numb and swollen and gradually
       returning to normal.

                    Come on, granny, give us your
                    best.

       Mrs. Weasley fires a volley of spells and Bellatrix’s
       smile fades. As she counters, JETS of LIGHT fly back and
       forth, skittering off the tables and overturned benches.
       Just then...

       Neville comes INTO VIEW, clutching the Sword of
       Gryffindor now, bumping past McGonagall and Dean Thomas
       as they battle a pair of Death Eaters, his gaze fully
       forward and oddly intent.

       As Mrs. Weasley parries a ferocious BLAST from Bellatrix,
       George, Bill and Mr. Weasley leap into the breach, raise
       their wands...

                                   MRS. WEASLEY

                 It’s not like you don’t have a
                 spare.

       As Bellatrix GRINS, a MASSIVE GREEN BOLT of LIGHT spits
       from Mrs. Weasley’s wand, striking Bellatrix directly in
       the sternum. Bellatrix’s smile curdles, then she topples
       to the floor, still. A BLOOD-CHILLING SCREAM fills the
       air...

       Harry rises and Voldemort fires again, but Harry simply
       rises again. Furious, Voldemort steps forward and points
       the wand only inches from Harry’s forehead, seething.
       Harry glances behind, his vision spinning. Nothing is
       behind him. Only a void beyond the blasted battlement.
       Only sky and a great fall. He turns back to Voldemort.

                               HARRY
                 You were right.

       Voldemort’s eyes glitter curiously.   Harry’s eyes drift
       to the wand in Voldemort’s hand.

                    When you told Professor Snape it
                    was failing you. It will always

                    But what if the wand never
                    belonged to him? What if the
                    wand’s allegiance was to someone
                    else?

       Voldemort stares at him. Confused. And suddenly, in
       this moment, it is Harry, beaten and bloody, who seems in
       control. He smiles, then presses even closer, his voice
       quiet, vaguely taunting:

                                  HARRY

       twisting crazily on the steps, tail SNAPPING BACK and
       forth, shattering stairs and walls.

       Hermione and Ron watch Nagini THRASH. As rubble rains
       down, they begin to run for the Great Hall, skirting
       Flitwick and Hagrid, who battle a pair of Death Eaters on
       the stairs.

       Further up the marble stairs, PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY raises
       her wand, draws a bead on a Death Eater and with a
       forceful flick, sends him flying through the air. Seamus
       regards her with amazement.

                               TRELAWNEY

       The fighting wizards stop, peer upward at the plume
       above. As it STREAKS TOWARD THE GROUND, another CRACK
       fills the sky and Harry and Voldemort burst apart as they
       meet the ground, rolling onto their feet facing one
       another across the courtyard.

       Chests heaving, they stare at one another, then
       Voldemort’s eyes shift. Harry follows his gaze and
       watches the Elder Wand roll to a rest.

                                HARRY
                 I told you:   it’s useless to you.

       Just then, Ron and Hermione burst INTO VIEW, followed by
       Nagini. Nagini rises, ready to strike. Harry turns,
       wand in hand, but he’s too late.

       Ron reaches out... and takes Hermione’s hand.

       Voldemort freezes, watching Nagini’s body thrash madly
       for a time before going still. The great snake’s head
       tumbles end-over-end and then, as it comes to a rest...

       VOLDEMORT BELLOWS IN PAIN and turns, firing on Harry.

       Instinctively, Harry raises his wand, countering...

       ... and the Elder Wand sails from Voldemort’s hand,
       turning end-over-end, the spell...

       mother’s shoulder, her eyes distant.

       The Malfoys sit in the shadows, avoiding eye contact.

       McGonagall steps into the aisle, gives him a hug, lightly

       Aberforth and Oliver Wood sit around goblets of something

      in his massive arms. Harry WINCES, then Hagrid releases
      him, cuffs him on the arm and hobbles away, blowing his
      nose in a GIANT HANDKERCHIEF. Harry watches him go, then

      to the silence. Then -- tentatively, tenderly -- fingers
      reach out -- Hermione’s -- and brush Ron and Harry’s.
      They look over. See that her eyes are closed, as if she
      were committing the moment to memory. They glance
      briefly at one another and then -- tentatively, tenderly

                Together?

      Albus nods and, side by side, they run the trolley at the
      barrier and...
                                                             140.


369   INT. PLATFORM 9 3/4 - CONTINUOUS ACTION - MORNING             369

      ... emerge onto a new platform where a SCARLET STEAM
      ENGINE pours WHITE SMOKE into the air. Seconds later,
      Ginny and Lily appear. Albus peers about anxiously.

      There is a riot of activity, as wizarding parents see off
      their children and trunks are loaded. There are lots of
      first years like ALBUS, looking equally nervous and being
      given a final send-off. ALBUS looks at it all with
      trepidation. LILY races off chasing a paper bird that
      flies through the crowd.

      Up ahead ALBUS sees FOUR PEOPLE through the steam: Ron,
      Hermione and their two children, ROSE (11) and little
      HUGO, as ROSE’S luggage is packed onto the train --
      gentle goodbyes. RON waves over to HARRY.

      OLDER HERMIONE gives her daughter ROSE one last hug.

                              OLDER HERMIONE
                Don’t forget to give Professor
                Longbottom our best.

      ALBUS looks at the train, then back to HARRY.   Then he
      disappears...

      HARRY and GINNY share a knowing look, and then as GINNY
      takes charge of the trolley, HARRY returns to ALBUS, who
      is now kneeling down, struggling with his shoelace.

      HARRY leans down and joins him.

                              ALBUS
                Will there really be thestrals
                pulling the carriages?

      Harry eyes his son warmly.

                              OLDER HARRY
                There’s nothing scary about
                thestrals. They’re gentle things.
                Anyway, you won’t be going up to
                school in the carriages. You’ll
                be going in the boats, remember?

      Albus nods, looks down.

                                ALBUS
                Dad?

                                OLDER HARRY
                Yes?


                                                      (CONTINUED)
                                                              141.
369   CONTINUED:                                                     369

                                 ALBUS
                   What if I’m put in Slytherin?

      Harry studies his son long and hard.     Leans close.

                                 OLDER HARRY
                   Albus Severus Potter. You were
                   named after two Headmasters of
                   Hogwarts. One of them was a
                   Slytherin. And he was probably
                   the bravest man I ever knew.

      Albus nods, thinks for a moment... then frowns.

                                 ALBUS
                   But just say I am --

                                 OLDER HARRY
                   Then Slytherin House will have
                   gained a wonderful wizard. But
                   listen, if it means so much to
                   you, you can choose Gryffindor.
                   The Sorting Hat takes your choice
                   into account.

                                 ALBUS
                   Really?

                                 OLDER HARRY
                   Really.

      The TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS and Albus’ eyes go wide.

                                 OLDER HARRY
                   Ready?

                                 ALBUS
                   Ready.

      They stand, consider each other for a moment, then HARRY
      leans over and gives his son a big hug.

      ALBUS settles into his seat opposite ROSE, looks around
      him, a chocolate frog jumps up the window, a Weasley
      Firework caroms down the train corridor beyond. This is
      going to be quite a journey. ALBUS smiles and looks out
      to his Dad.

      Raises a hand to wave.

      And the train jolts to a start.

      HARRY, GINNY, RON, and HERMIONE watch with affection.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

      LILY looks like all she wants to do is to jump on the
      train and leave with it.

      The train heads off.

      We SLOWLY MOVE INTO HARRY as he waves, pride, and more
      than a little nostalgia clear in his face, as the train
      slips away.



                                                 FADE TO BLACK.

Transformers: Dark of the Moon Transcript

Transcript of Dark of the Moon, as it is filmed.

Key:
Italics: Dialogue is spoken in another language and translated. I also use it for locations subtitled in the movie.
<These brackets>: Dialogue is not given any clear subtitles, and I'm guessing.
[These brackets] are for descriptive stuff like growling.
______________________

Prologue:

Optimus Prime: We were once a peaceful race of intelligent, mechanical beings. But then... came the war, between the Autobots who fought for freedom... and the Decepticons who dreamed of tyranny. Overmatched and outnumbered, our defeat was all but certain.

Optimus Prime: But in the war's final days, one Autobot ship escaped the battle. It was carrying a secret cargo which would have changed our planet's fate.

Optimus Prime: A desperate mission. Our final hope.

Optimus Prime: A hope... that vanished.

Act One:

VLA Radio Observatory - New Mexico, 1961

Analyst: One up there. One over there. And one more down there.

Analyst: What you got?

NASA Analyst: Impact detected. We have impact confirmed... Contact at... twenty-two-fifty GMT.

NASA Director - Langley, Virginia

NASA Director: What? Get me Sec-Def on the phone right away.

Pentagon - National Security Command

President Aide: Mr. McNamara, the President is expecting you.

President Kennedy: Get Bobby in here.

McNamara: Mr. President. Designation top secret. We believe a UFO has crashed into the Moon. We think the Russians are onto it as well.

President Kennedy: Well, then you tell NASA to move heaven and earth. We need to get to the moon.

McNamara: We're going to attempt a manned mission. NASA said it would take five years.

President Kennedy: You get there before the Russians.

President Kennedy [background]: I believe that this nation should commit itself... to achieving the goal... before this decade is out... of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.

Eight years later, July 16, 1969

Countdown Guy: Ten, nine- Ignition sequence start. Five, four, three, two, one. All engines running. Liftoff. We have a liftoff. Thirty-two minutes past the hour. Liftoff on Apollo 11 [trails off]

Neil Armstrong: Neil Armstrong reporting Apollo 11 on proper heading.

Walter Cronkite: Apollo 11 is on the way, riding that pillar of flame from the Saturn Five out there two hundred and fifty miles away where the moon is waiting for man 's first arrival.

NASA Officer: Houston, you're a go for landing. Over.

Neil Armstrong: Forty feet, down two and a half. Picking up some dust. Thirty feet, two and a half down. Faint shadow.

Buzz Aldrin: Capcom, flight. Four forward. Drifting to the right a little. Down a half. Contact light. Okay, engine stop.

Neil Armstrong: Houston, uh, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.

NASA people: [cheering]

NASA Officer: We copy you down, Eagle. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again.

Walter Cronkite: Perhaps four hundred million persons are watching this broadcast today of the greatest event in our time and one of the great events of all recorded history.

Neil Armstrong: I'm at the foot of the ladder. Okay, I'm gonna step off the LEM now. That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

Black Ops Officer: Are we good?

Black Ops Technician: Yes, sir.

Neil Armstrong (?): Unofficial time on the first step, one-oh-nine, to- [static]

NASA Officer: Apollo 11? This is Houston, over.

NASA Officer: Eagle, we're getting a signal interference. Do you copy?

Walter Cronkite: We now have had confirmation of loss of signal from the Apollo Eleven. The Apollo Eleven is, at the moment, on the far side of the moon.

Black Ops Officer: Neil, you are dark on the rock. Mission is a go. We have 21 minutes.

Black Ops Officer: [obscured by static] three minutes, forty-five seconds and counting.

Neil Armstrong: My God... It's some sort of giant metal face.

Black Ops Technician: Jesus.

Neil Armstrong (could be Buzz): Control, we are inside the ship. Extensive damage. Way too big to check the entire ship. Everything's dead in here, Houston. No signs of life anywhere. These things are massive.

Black Ops Technician: We copy. You've got seven minutes on your oxygen. We are not alone after all, are we?

Neil Armstrong: No, sir. We're not alone.

Announcer: Go ahead, Mr. President.

President Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of you. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. Because of what you have done-

Announcer: We have splashdown.

President Nixon: -the heavens have become a part of man 's world. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one. One in their pride in what you have done. It inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace, and tranquility, to Earth.

Transformers: Dark of the Moon

Act Two:

Carly: My hero... needs to wake up.

Sam: What is that?

Carly: This is your new lucky bunny.

Sam: Ah, it's a beautiful thought, Carly, but I don't think it's the whole bunny that's lucky. You see, it's just this section here, you see, it's just the rabbit foot that's lucky.

Carly: Well, it's just a good luck charm. Mmm? To help you think positive? Today is important.

Sam: Mmm...

Carly: Come on, get up. Hey, wear that nice tie.

Sam: Yeah.

Carly: You need any money for lunch?

Sam: No. I don't need any money for lunch. I have money from yesterday's lunch. You love it, don't you? I'm just your American boy toy.

Carly: [chuckles] A lover boy toy.

Sam: You know how demoralizing it is to have saved the world twice and still be grovelling for a job?

Carly: People don't know you saved the world, Sam. I mean, I do. I believe you.

Sam: The government knows. I mean they could hook me up with a job right here in D.C. I mean, I should be working with the Autobots, otherwise it's not fair.

Carly: Come on, they paid for your college. The President gave you a hero medal.

Sam: Yeah.

President Obama: Thank you, man. Great job.

Sam: That's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me.

President Obama: All right, guys.

Ron: What the fuc-

Judy: Wow.

Carly: And, as I recall, that wasn't even the highlight of your day.

Carly (flashback): Mister ambassador, here.

Woman: British Embassy, you're up next.

Judy: I- I- No, you don't wear it.

Sam: It's not-

Judy: See, you've gotta- the box.

Sam: I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

Judy: You're supposed to leave it in the box, right? You keep it in this. What a gorgeous box.

Sam: Pew. [Blows] Oh, yeah. My medal. You know who gave that to me?

Carly: Who?

Sam: POTUS.

Carly: Ah.

Sam: President of the United States. I-

Carly: Aaaah!

Carly (present day): Babe, it's hard for everybody to get a job.

Sam: I don't have time. You see, my parents are gonna be here in a week on their road trip Party-bus World Tour. If my dad gets here and I don't have a job, he's gonna spank me. You know, it's go time for me.

Carly: All right, tonight, I'll give you a job. Romance me with a nice dinner and, uh, maybe you can get that bonus.

Sam: Mm. Mmm...

Brains: Whooaah...

Carly: [screams]

Brains: Ah-ha. Get lucky.

Carly: Get him out of here.

Brains: Wait. No no no no no no no. Oof! Ow.

Carly: Oh, he's gross!

Brains: She's good.

Sam: I'm sorry. But they're stranded here. Somebody's got to watch out for them.

Carly: Yesterday, that one was in my underwear drawer.

Brains: Did research. Looking real good, too. Ha ha ha ha ha! Oww! No need to hit me, man.

Carly: You are so not a normal boyfriend.

Sam: That's what you love about me, yeah?

Brains: Crybaby.

Carly: We're not at the love word yet. Maybe a little bit closer when you're covering your half of the rent.

Sam: Goodbye.

Wheelie: Frickin' shorting my circuits out here! It's inhumane, what it is! Make us live in a box on a balcony, right next to a beast! Like a common animal!

Sam: Stop, okay? You and your creepy sidekick you can't be in here without permission.

Wheelie: Oh, according to who? Miss Blondy-Blond? Giddy up, little doggie! Hyah! Yo Brains, what's up?

Brains: Doing good.

Wheelie: Ah shit, I've seen this one. It's the one where Spock goes nuts. You know, Sam, I don't know about moving in with this chick. Uh. What if she dumps us like the last girl?

Brains: She was mean. Didn't like her.

Wheelie: Us guys got to stick together.

Brains: [singing] We are family!

Sam: No, we're not family. You're a political refugee, and I have finally found someone who appreciates me for me.

Brains: Well, you tell her that we're not your pets, and we're not your toys, all right? We're an advanced, genius alien race just looking for a home.

Judy: Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.

Ron: Didn't have to stop.

Judy: Come on. What're they going to do, tow it? Where is he? Ah! Sammy!

Ron: Sam.

Judy: Oh, come on, that's funny. Ha-ha.

Ron: Sam...

Sam: I missed you guys so much.

Judy: Sure, you did. What do you think?

Sam: Look at that. Wow.

Judy: Cute.

Sam: You look old.

Judy: Stop it.

Sam: Feel like I can see the end.

Judy: I love your little tie. Hey, where's my girl? Where's my beautiful Carly?

Sam: She's at work, Ma.

Judy: Right!

Sam: She's got a new job. You guys said you were gonna be here in a week.

Judy: Yeah...

Sam: The twenty first, not the eleventh, Dad, remember?

Ron: We just hauled ass in this thing. We stopped for gas.

Judy: This thing. The love tub, it flies. Oh, are we keeping you from something? Like, say, your job?

Ron: Well, it's about time.

Judy: [giggles]

Ron: You had us worried.

Sam: I have- uh- job interviews.

Judy: Oh. That's good.

Ron: That sucks.

Judy: Stop it.

Sam: You don't have to be so negative, Dad. You know, you're in D.C. You're here with your son and your family. I mean, it's a good time.

Ron: It sucks that you don't have a job.

Sam: Yeah, but there's good things to do here, too, right?

Judy: Yeah-

Sam: Right? Museums and monuments, okay?

Judy: Nothing to worry about.

Sam: I'll see you tonight.

Ron: I'm bagging the gift.

Judy: Sam, I think for an interview you should wear real pants.

Sam: I think for life you should wear real pants.

Judy: Oh, what- what happened to Bumblebee?

Ron: Jesus.

Sam: He's off on his missions. I had to get this for backup.

Ron: Oh, your car has a job, huh?

Judy: Stop. What does it change into?

Sam: It doesn't change into anything. It's a collector's item, Ma. I got it for a steal. It just needs some work. Trust me.

Judy: Oh. No, I think it's darling. It reminds me a lot of Bumblebee, if Bumblebee were- a sad piece of shit.

Judy: Come on, we'll give you a ride!

Act Three:

Optimus Prime: In the years since our arrival, our new home, Earth, has seen much change. Energon detectors guard its cities now. Long-range defense system watch the skies.

Middle East - Illegal Nuclear Site

Optimus Prime: So now we assist our allies, n solving human conflicts, to prevent mankind from bringing harm to itself.

Guard: The Defense Minister's car.

Guard: Raise the banner!

Dino: Yah-ha-ha! On the ground, per favore! And stay there!

Guards: Aaah!

Optimus Prime: We work in secret teams on various missions around the globe. And all the while, we search for signs... of our true enemies' return.

Voshkod: I am Voshkod, General Counsel with Ukrainian Department of Energy. My government will officially deny that we're having this conversation. At one of our decommissioned facilities, a, uh, discovery was made, which I fear may be... alien in nature. The facility's name is... Chernobyl.

Lennox: Mr Voshkod. So, uninhabited since '86. I hear it won't be livable again for another twenty thousand years?

Voshkod: At least. Ukraine was the most fertile land. It's a tragedy. This way.

Lennox: Gear up! We have sixty minutes on the ground. Watch your radiation levels. Mr Voshkod, where's your protective gear?

Lennox: Where is your protective gear?

Voshkod: It would not matter. For me, it's only a matter of time. Through the school.

Voshkod: Yuri will take you below And one other thing, Colonel. In private... there were some energy experiments-

Laserbeak: [growling]

Voshkod: Ahh! It can wait.

NEST Soldier: Keep moving. Stay tight.

NEST Soldier: Okay, right here. I think I found it.

Lennox: Optimus, we got a visual. Looks like the object's clamped in some kind of a metal harness.

NEST Soldier: What's this? Guys! Why does this thing have Soviet space program markings on it?

Lennnox: Sputnik?

NEST Soldier: Energon readings, sir. It's strong... below us. It's coming fast.

Driller: [roar]

NEST Soldier: Contact, contact! Oof-

Soldiers: [screaming]

Lennox: Get topside now! Move, move, move!

Driller: [growling & roaring]

Optimus Prime: [grunting]

Lennox: Let's go!

NEST Soldier: Weapons up! Heavy weapons up!

Optimus Prime: Stay behind me!

Lennox: Optimus!

NEST Soldiers: [screaming]

Lennox: Fall back! It's circling around us!

NEST Soldier: Taking our flank! It's taking our flank! Aah!

Optimus Prime: [grunting]

Lennox: Get the heavy weapon!

Shockwave: Optimus!

Optimus Prime: Hyaaah!

Driller: [growling]

Lennox: What the hell was that thing?

Optimus Prime: That... is Shockwave.

Lennox: Why was he after this?

Optimus Prime: It's impossible. This is an engine part... from a long lost Autobot ship.

Voshkod: [panting]

Laserbeak: [screeching] Pleasure working with you.

Act Four:

Judy: Interviews! This is so exciting! Honey, do you want some gum? Your breath gets really gnarly when you're nervous.

Secretary: Mister With-weeky?

Sam: Yeah. Search is over.

Whitley: I'm Mr. Whitley.

Sam: Mr-

Sam: Is anybody else joining?

Suited Interviewer: No.

Sam: No? You want me to move right there? I'll move right there.

Suited Interviewer: I'd prefer not.

Sam: Sensei.

Matsumoto: Ready? Begin.

Sam: I graduated this year. Majored in geopolitics. Minor in tech studies. Very interested in government and technology, how that's gonna intersect and co-exist. Shape the future...

Ron: Why did we bother sending him to an lvy college for? Three months out of school and he can't find a job?

Judy: Oh-

Sam: Mr Matsuhisu-

Matsumoto: Matsumoto.

Sam: -hasi

Matsumoto: Matsumoto.

Sam: -moto.

Sam: Martha, can I call you Martha?

Martha: No, you may not.

Sam: Okay, Jack, there's two types of people in this world. There's thinkers, there's doers.

Whitley: Hmm.

Sam: There's winners, there's dreamers and there's buddies.

Whitley: What about some weaknesses?

Sam: Pfft! I don't... You have a very trustworthy face. You remind me of like, uh, an Asian Colonel Sanders. A man I can trust.

Judy: He's a millennial. That means they're the, you know, like lost generation.

Suited Interviewer: Why was the FBI looking for you?

Sam: The what? Yeah, FBI. Good of you to flag that. It was during all that alien craziness when you were... fourteen. I mean, they were very kind to me, found me in a jiffy. Uh. And that's all been expunged. Obama gave me a medal, actually. I'm just saying. It's always good to have a medal guy in the office, with a medal.

Suited Interviewer: From Obama?

Sam: Yeah.

Suited Interviewer: In this office, we're... mostly Republicans, so...

Ron: I'm not feeling too good.

Sam: No?

Ron: No.

Sam: Why don't you get a little dipping tray and dip the dog in Pepto? That's a solution.

Ron: Hmm.

Sam: Pow. I got another one. We got to go. Come on.

Judy: Really?

Brazos: Sit.

Sam: Yeah. Okay.

Brazos: Got myself a Mr Sam Witwicky, recent college graduate. Previous experience, next to zero, yet... he has a recommend letter from our board? Double-you-tee-eff to that...

Sam: Do I know somebody on your board?

Brazos: Here's the deal. You know who we are. Accuretta Systems, global leader in telecom, aerospace, seventeen billion in profit last year. We contract for DARPA, NASA, JPL, you name it. You perform here, doors open for you anywhere. First job out of college is critical, kid. You either take a step down the correct career path or you fall into a life-sucking abyss.

Sam: Mmm.

Brazos: So it all depends on how you respond to my next two words: Impress me.

Sam: Now?

Brazos: Impress me.

Sam: You catch me off guard. I'm- I don't know where to begin.

Brazos: Impress me.

Sam: I- I'm an open book. Ask me any question you like.

Brazos: So you a go-getter, ramrod-

Sam: Yes, sir.

Brazos: -take-charge kind of guy?

Sam: I'm a killer. A stone-cold killer.

Brazos: So, take-charge guy?

Sam: Take-charge, Viking, barbarian, of course, that's me. Pow! I'm here.

Brazos: We are not looking for that here. No brown-nosing. No suck up. No toolery. I-

Brazos' Aide: Yes, Mr. Brazos.

Brazos: Why is Shontel using what appears to be a red cup from the red floor when we are on the yellow floor?

Brazos' Aide: I'm on it.

Brazos: It is a visual and, therefore, a visceral betrayal. Stop it!
*
Brazos' Aide: Such a dumbass.

Brazos: Disgusting! Thank you! It's total anarchy around here.

Shontel: [sobbing]

Sam: The, uh, email I, uh, read said administrative aide?

Brazos: Nope. Mail room.

Sam: I'm gonna go.

Brazos: Do you have any idea how many lvy League Phi Beta Kappas would kill to-

Sam: Mister, I saved your life twice. Okay? I can't tell you how or when or why, but I have done shit that matters. And I'd just kind of like a job where I matter again. So thank you, but no thank you, okay?

Brazos: You know what I think? You want the job after this job. But, son, this is the job that's standing in your way. And that's why you're gonna be so very very good at it. 'Cause when I look at you, I see a younger me.

Act Five:

Classified NEST Headquarters - Washington D.C.

NEST Announcer: All arriving Autobots, in pan training and debriefing in fifteen minutes. Dino, report to bay twenty-three. Sideswipe, bay thirty-seven for weapons assessment.

Mearing: Senator, I suggest you remember that when the NSA wants funding they call me. When the CIA is gonna take out a target, they ask first for my permission. And when the President wants to know which members of Congress are politically vulnerable in terms of, let's say, undiscovered criminal conduct, I'm the number he dials.

Newscaster: U. S. Agencies say they have been monitoring the blast. But if, in fact, this was a covert military strike, no nation has yet claimed responsibility.

Mearing: CIA is up my ass about this mystery raid in the Middle East. So, it's time to come clean. Was your unit involved?

Lennox: Ah... I'm not sure, ma'am.

NEST Soldier: All right, guys. This is how you do a Decepticon head kill shot.

Bumblebee: [whistling]

Mearing: As Director of National Intelligence, I'm a really big fan of intelligent answers. I can't really tell you definitively. These Autobots are like teenage kids. They like to sneak out of the house every once in a while.

Mearing: Colonel Lennox, are you in command or are you not?

Lennox: Yes, ma'am, I am. I-

Mearing: Stop with the ma'am. Enough with the ma'am. Do I look like a ma'am?

Lennox: No, ma'am. Ye- Yes, ma'am. Yes.

Que: This gun is my perfect invention, Ironhide.

Ironhide: Right.

Que: Oh, good! You're here! Me name's Que. I do hope you have answers for him. I've never seen him so upset before.

Lennox: Optimus, you remember Charlotte Mearing? Our Director of National Intelligence?

Dino: He's in a bad mood. He's-a not talking to anybody today.

Mearing: What is this, the silent treatment?

Ironhide: We've seen that, and this is not that.

Que: Definitely not.

Ironhide: This is worse. Prime! Make something of yourself!... He's pissed.

Optimus Prime: You lied to us. Everything humans know of our planet we were told had all been shared. So why was this found in human possession?

Mearing: We were in the dark on this also. It was Director Only clearance at Sector Seven until now. The bag.

Mearing's Aide: Which bag?

Mearing: Herm�s. Birkin. Green ostrich! My God... This is a secret few men knew, and fewer still remain alive. Allow me to please introduce to you two of NASA's founding mission directors and astronaut Dr. Buzz Aldrin, one of the first two men to step foot on the moon. Sir? Optimus Prime.

Buzz Aldrin: From a fellow space traveler, it's a true honor.

Optimus Prime: The honor is mine.

Mearing: Our entire space race of the 1960's, it appears, was in response to an event.

NASA Officer: Our astronauts investigated a crashed alien ship. No survivors on board.

Buzz Aldrin: We were sworn to secrecy by our Commander in Chief.

NASA Commander (flashback): This was a mission you will never speak of.

Buzz (flashback): I understand, sir.

NASA Officer: A total of thirty five people knew the real plan at NASA.

NASA Officer: Soviets managed to land unmanned probes. Somehow they must have... picked up that fuel rod.

Mearing: We believe the Russians deduced that the rod was a fissionable fuel assembly, believed they had it mastered and tried to harness it at Chernobyl.

NASA Officer: We landed six missions in all. We took hundreds of photos and samples. We locked them away forever when the moon program was shut down.

Ironhide: Well, did you search the crash vault?

Optimus Prime: The ship's name was the Ark. I watched it escape Cybertron myself. It was carrying an Autobot technology which would have won us the war. And... its captain.

Mearing: Who was its captain?

Optoimus Prime: The great Sentinel Prime. The technology's inventor. He was commander of the Autobots before me. It's imperative that I find it before the Decepticons learn of its location. Our Autobot spacecraft has the ability to get there. And... you must pray it's in time.

Act Six:

Sam: Hi. I'm here to see Carly Spencer.

Sam: Carly!

Carly: Sorry, just gotta- You got the job?

Sam: This is crazy.

Carly: You really got it?

Sam: Yes.

Carly: See, what did I tell you? It's the bunny. [giggling] You are so welcome.

Sam: Do you like me more?

Carly: A little bit, yeah.

Sam: You said you were his assistant curator, you didn't say the guy owns Space Mountain.

Carly: I know. Isn't it beautiful in here? And, he's the coolest guy. Ever.

Dylan: Hmm.

Sam: Yeah?

Carly: Yeah.

Dylan: Sam! Dylan Gould.

Sam: Hey. A pleasure to meet you.

Dylan: Pleasure meeting you. Carly's told me a lot about you.

Sam: Well, vice versa. It's a- it's a beautiful building you got. It's like the Starship Enterprise in here.

Dylan: Heh-heh, thank you very much. It leaks. Now, before Carly came to help run the collection, it was just a... complete mess. But now, the restorations are back on track, we're going to Pebble Beach this year and we're gonna get a trophy for that stand right there. You know why? Because this woman right here is my secret weapon.

Carly: Oh.

Sam: Okay.

Carly: Mr. Gould, please, you exaggerate. All I've done is get you organized.

Dylan: Oh, you've done much more than that, my Duchess.

Sam: Oh. Nicknames, that's fun.

Dylan: Yeah. The Duchess.

Older Woman: She's adorable.

Dylan: You know, when I stole her away from the British Embassy, I said: It's easy to manage a country. Try managing a priceless collection of art. Take a look at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet. Designed by a Frenchman. Look at the curves. Elegant, isn't it? Beautiful. Sensual. Built to evoke the body of the ideal woman. Come on. My dad had a ten dollar desk and a dream, and he built it into an empire.

Sam: Whoa-ha-ha! Wow.

Dylan: We're the largest accounting firm in the U.S. I started up the venture side after he, ah, passed. Invest in the future. Try and bet on the winners. See, collecting cars helps me keep my sanity.

Sam: You guys look great.

Carly: Oh. That was a great day, Mr. Gould.

Dylan: I haven't seen that one.

Carly: No. Me neither.

Dylan: Jeans are tight.

Sam: Oh. Here we go. Here we go. You see that? Judgment. Judging a man by his car? And you're gonna wave at him while he's judging me?

Carly: What's with you? He's my boss. This job pays for our food, our rent.

Sam: No, I totally understand. I'm totally fine. I get it. I'm well fed. And guess what? I'm not your boy toy anymore. I got my big boy pants on. You see them? In the car. Thank you, Duchess.

Carly: [chuckles] My god, are you threatened by him?

Sam: [obviously fake laughter] Threatened? What am I threatened by? His money? His power? His good looks? None of the above. Check!

Carly: God! Your temper tantrums are so sexy.

Sam: Get in the car, please. Sam, he's hardly the first man to ever smile at me. I think I can handle it.

Sam: Hold on, hold on. It's the smiling back part that gets me. Okay?

Carly: No more smiles. Never again. I promise.

Sam: See, that works for me.

Carly: Yeah?

Sam: [grunting]

Dylan: Easy! Easy! You're not gonna get it started that way.

Sam: Well, I was just getting it ready. I'm about thirty-two percent done with my restoration. Some chrome work, put a spoiler on the back. Done deal.

Dylan: You know, Carly's been telling me you've been struggling job-wise. Just so you know, I'm on the board for Accuretta Systems, and I, I put in a call for you. Let's keep it between us, okay? She's so proud of you. You're a lucky man.

Act Seven:

Optimus Prime: Xantium approaching Tranquility Base

Ground Base Officer: [Something obscured by static] You're a go for landing. [More obscured by static]

Optimus Prime: Ratchet, let's roll.

Ground Base Officer: Did he get that mag-cam out? ... Inbound. Copy, contact.

Optimus Prime: We're entering the Ark.

Ratchet: His levels are faint. He locked himself away to guard the pillars.

Optimus Prime: Sentinel. You're coming home, old friend.

Act Eight:

Megatron: [assorted growling] All... hail... Megatron.

Igor: [slobbering, giggling] My master! Yes, my master! Yes!

Hatchlings: [squeaking]

Megatron: Ah, don't be greedy, my fragile ones.

Starscream: Oh, my poor master. How it pains me to see you so wounded, so weak...

Megatron: Spare me, you gaseous sycophant!

(A) Doctor: Aah!

Megatron: You know what you are told, which is nothing.

Soundwave: Soundwave reporting, Lord Megatron.

Megatron: And what news from your little assassin?

Laserbeak: Autobots have taken the bait! They've discovered the Ark and returned with its cargo.

Megatron: You did me great honor tracking that ship to the moon. Your human collaborators have served their purpose, Soundwave.

A Doctor: [screaming] Ayiiee!

Megatron: It's time to eliminate loose ends.

Soundwave: Laserbeak. Kill them all.

Laserbeak: With pleasure.

Laserbeak: Is your daddy home?

Madeline: Then Madeline said, it's about time-

Mom: Madeline!

Laserbeak: Hello, Mom!

Mom: [screaming] Get out of the house!

Dad: What are you doing in my house?

Laserbeak: Just visiting.

Act Nine:

Mailroom Guy: What is this hoochie-mama outfit?

Woman: [speaks in a foreign language]

Mailroom Guy: No, this is the aerospace division! We do not allow that here!

Woman: [continues to speak in the foreign language]

Mailroom Guy: New guy! You see that? That's a Latin meltdown, okay? You ever show up in my office with a hoochie-mama outfit, you're fired. You got that? Okay, you're gonna be on this cart for two and a half years, okay? I want you to live it, love it and name it.

Woman: [continues to rant in the background]

Mailroom Guy: There's no ladder climbing in my office. I run a tight ship. Okay?

Sam: Yes sir.

Mailroom Guy: Move.

Donny: I found that paper I was telling you about... What are we looking at?

Wang: Shut up!

Donny: You do that to me again and I'll kick your ass!

Carly: Hi.

Sam: Oh! Hi, angel.

Carly: How are you?

Sam: Good.

Carly: I had a meeting downtown. Was it okay for me to stop by?

Sam: I don't know. My five hundred page employee conduct manual isn't exactly a page turner.

Carly: This is great.

Sam: Yeah, Autobots are off saving the world, and I have organized four binders. I'm living the dream. Come on.

Mustache Guy: Visitor violation.

Sam: You okay?

Wang: Absolutely. I'm next.

Carly: Listen.

Sam: Hmm?

Carly: Saturday. Dylan's throwing a party at his house. It's a work thing but he's invited you too.

Sam: Oh, did he?

Carly: I want you to come and laugh at my bad jokes. It would really mean a lot to me, okay?

Sam: I'd love to go. How'd you get over here?

Carly: Car.

Sam: You don't have a car.

Carly: Yes I do.

Sam: What, did you win it in a raffle?

Carly: Uh, he gave me one.

Sam: He gave you a car?

Carly: Yeah, I think it was a work perk.

Sam: Huh. A work perk. What kind of car did he give you?

Carly: Uh, A Mercedes SLS-AMG. Really throaty engine.

Sam: Hmm.

Mercedes Ad: Mercedes-Benz SLS combines breathtaking performance... [Trails off]

Sam: You drove this here? That's a two hundred thousand dollar car.

Carly: I know.

Sam: You know how long it would take me to afford a car like this?

Carly: A long time?

Sam: Yeah, like fifty three years.

Carly: He said it was for both of us.

Sam: Then what we should do is, we should sell it and buy a house.

Carly: You're frustrated, I know. I've been there. It's called paying your dues. Good things will happen.

Brazos: Ladies and gentlemen, I need some lunch time filing done, stat.

Mustache Guy: He's coming.

Brazos: Who would like to score some Bruce Brazos points?

Mustache Man: Bruce, you found your guy.

Brazos: Witwicky! The man who makes this company run. Now, who have we here? Is it a sister, Facebook friend, Twitter tweeter?

Same: Carly, this is Bruce. Bruce.

Carly: Hi, I'm his girlfriend. A pleasure to meet you. Sam was right. You really do have a smashing head of hair.

Brazos: Well, thank you. Heh-heh.

Carly: Sam, I got to run.

Sam: Yeah.

Carly: Oh. Here, your present. Your favorite color. Nice to meet you, Mr. Brazos.

Brazos: And you.

Carly: See you, boys.

Donny: I'm still stewing about that binder incident, Jerry.

Wang: May I finish my Shu Hua milk, Donny?

Donny: I don't care about your exotic milk. I care about respect!

Wang: Ahh. I know who you are!

Sam: Shit!

Wang: Witwicky! Witwicky! I'm talking to you!

Sam: Excuse me. Thank you.

Wang: Whoa whoa whoa, slow down, tiger. You showed up in the background of six different photos, two continents, with aliens. That was you in Egypt, huh, right? Because you know the aliens. See, you!

Sam: Give me my jacket!

Wang: Whoa! Wah! Hai! I'm Wang. Deep Wang. Deep Wang. You're not getting it. Deep throat. Watergate? I'm talking code to you. Shhh! Damn it. They watch and listen. I can't go to the government, but you, you can! Because shit's going down, son! It is code pink, as in Floyd! Dark Side! Why do you think no one's been up there since 1972?

Sam: I know you're speaking English, it's just a very strange English. That's why I'm not- oh. Don't. I'm gonna hit you.

Wang: I'm gonna hit you right back, son. It's my manifesto. They're whacking us out. Everyone who knows what's on the dark-

Brazos: [indistinct words]

Wang: Your alien friends are in danger, you know, the good ones. It's up to you.

Wang: Calm down. Ow! Easy, Sam!

Wang: What are you looking at? Yo, dawg. Are you up in my shit? Who are you working for? Stare down, you and me. Guess I won.

Sam: Moon satellites. The Russian space program. Experts dead. Space program ends. Dark side. Dark side of the moon.

Mailroom Guy: Look what I found outside the bathroom. Huh? Is it yours? Deal with this.

Sam: Yes, sir.

Wang: I did everything you want!

Sam: I really think we should talk, cause some of the stuff-

Wang: Whoa! Knock first! Can't you see I'm busy? Who are you? Who are you?

Sam: You straddled me in the stall. That's happened to me once in this life. I wouldn't forget it.

Wang: No!

Sam: From the bathroom stall. You took your package out.

Wang: WHOA!

Sam: You took your package out.

Wang: Whoa! We are not boyfriends, okay? One phone call from me and I'll have you fired. Oh yes, I will, gaylord!

Sam: Are you okay?

Wang: Ahh- hemorrhoids!

Sam: Should I come back? When should I come back?

Wang: Come back when you learn some manners!

Wang: Ah! I don't know him! I would never say anything!

Laserbeak: [cawing, growling]

Wang: Whoa whoa whoa whoa, okay, okay! I sabotaged the mapping satellite, just like I promised, I can put a blind spot in the program as a bonus, what more do you want from me?

Laserbeak: Jerrrry, you are my favorrrite.

Wang: I'll do whatever you want me to do.

Laserbeak: I know, but my superiors need me to- [caw]

Wang: Please, please, you don't have to do-

Laserbeak: -Suicide you.

Wang: No, no no-

Laserbeak: What did you say to Witwicky?

Wang: Ah, shit! Huh? Who wants some chicken dinner now, bitch? Cause somebody messed with the wrong Wang today!

Laserbeak: [hissing]

Wang: Come on! You want some of me? Huh? Huh? Oh no no no no no no- [screaming]

Donny: I don't need any more didactic lectures from Chuck. That's not helping-

Brazos: Jesus!

Wang: Aaaaaah-

Various Employees: [talking indistinctly]

Brazos: Get legal.

Donny: That's Jerry!

Brazos: Come on, people. Yes, a workmate died but looking out the window is not going to bring him back. The man was depressed.

Woman: Don't take a picture! A little respect!

Brazos: You can keep watching him, but he's not getting up. You all read Humpty Dumpty. Okay? Witwicky. I'm spearheading the press. You clean up. Wang is everywhere. He is in the bistro. He's in the bamboo. He's on the balustrade.

Donny: You see the sidewalk down there? Man!

Brazos: Box up his personals. Get his name off his parking space. We need-

Donny: Hey, when did we get a new copier?

Brazos: Listen, I'm not gonna say anything about what I saw. Who you share a toilet stall with is totally your business.

Laserbeak: [plays out the G1 cartoon theme tune]

Donny: This is exceedingly Japanese. They never make it easy, do they- [screaming]

Laserbeak: [cawing]

Brazos: Aaah!

Sam: [assorted shouting]

Act Ten:

Carly: What is with you?

Sam: This is the real deal, Carly, okay? I need you to stay composed. It's real life. I'll explain it to you later.

Sam: We've got an emergency. You gotta get Colonel Lennox out here. I'm reporting a Decepticon. The Decepticons are back. You gotta open that gate right now.

NEST Guard: Easy, sir. This is Health and Human Services.

Sam: Right. Packing M4's? What are you protecting, colostomy bags? Bedpans? Throat lozenges?

Carly: Babe. Babe-

Sam: Where'd you get that hat from, nursing school? So, you're nurses and foot-powder protectors? Fantastic.

Carly: Babe.

Sam: Yes.

Carly: I don't think we're in the right place.

Sam: We are in the right place. We're in the right place and we're in the right place and I'm gonna talk to Optimus right now.

NEST Guard: Sir.

Sam: You're gonna get Optimus out here.

NEST Guard: Sir. Sir, you got the wrong building. I don't know what you're talking about.

Sam: What part of Decepticons are back do you not understand?

NEST Guard: Yo! You being a smartass?

Sam: DO NOT hit my car! It's a collector's item!

NEST Guard: I wouldn't do that.

Carly: You're crazy!

Sam: Whoa!

NEST Guard: We got an Energon reading!

NEST Guard: We've got aliens in the vehicle!

Sam: Whoooaaa!

NEST Guard: You move, you're dead! Out! Out! Got aliens in the vehicle!

Sam: Whoaaa!

Wheelie: Aah!

NEST Guard: Freeze! Get out!

Brains: Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! We're freezing!

Sam: Are you- are you kidding me?

Carly: Sam, they've got guns! Oh my god.

NEST Guard: I got him. Go!

Sam: Bee! Is Bee in there? Aaah! Okay, all right.

Brains: This how you treat Autobots? We're on the same team.

Wheelie: Yeah, enjoy your next job at Seven-Eleven, dickhead.

Brains: That's right!

Wheelie: A-hole.

NEST Guard: How's your car now?

Bumblebee: [whistling noises]

Sam: That's my car. Come here.

Bumblebee: [whistling noises]

Sam: Come here!

Bumblebee: {Come on! Sam...}

Sam: What is your deal, huh? I know your black ops stuff is important to you. I'm not trying to diminish it or, you know, guilt-trip you or anything, I just never see you anymore. You can't come to the garage, just hang out one night?

Bumblebee: {Sam. That makes me. Feel bad.}

Sam: Well, yeah, I hope you feel bad. You should feel bad. Look at the jalopy I'm driving now. I feel bad every single day.

NEST Guard: Yo, let's go, both of you. Lennox wants to see you.

Wheelie: What, we not good enough for you anymore?

Sam: I'm sorry, babe. They were very rude, all right? And you're fixing my car! You don't think so?

Sam: Raise your hand if you had a flying psycho-ninja copier trying to kill you today! Those are my brass knuckles. That's my anklet. Do I have to take that off too? And my toe rings?

NEST Announcer: All NEST officials clear the floor. We have 10 minutes until attempted contact.

Mearing: We've taken possession of the five devices that were hidden in the ship with Sentinel Prime. They're some kind of prototype Autobot technology. They say Sentinel was the... Einstein of his civilization, so we're gonna keep these locked up until we know what we're dealing with. Right now, no one gets access. No one.

Sam: This Wang guy recognized me. He told me to warn you, he was talking about the dark side of the moon, and then they killed him.

Lennox: Wait a minute. He mentioned the moon?

Sam: Yeah, dark side of the moon.

Carly: But why would Decepticons want to kill humans? I thought their war was with the Autobots.

Mearing: ...And that is when he made his first quick-look science report, that's what we want- who's the chick? Okay, excuse me!

Sam: These compiled-

Mearing: Colonel Lennox?

Lennox: Director Mearing, this is Sam Witwicky, a civilian-

Mearing: I know his name, Colonel. I want to know who gave him clearance?

Sam: Who gave me clearance? How about Optimus Prime, when he touched down in suburbia looking for my house?

Lennox: This is the National Intelligence Director, in case you...

Sam: Hi.

Mearing: Disrespecting a federal officer? Huh! Maybe that'll get you somewhere. Who's she?

Sam: She's my girlfriend.

Mearing: What is this, like a date?

Lennox: She knows all about the Autobots, okay? She knows Bumblebee. And she comes from a military family. I can vouch for her.

Sam: Hey, I- I- have an idea. How about we get back to the important topics, like the fact that I almost had my face cut off by a Decepticon? As a taxpayer, I would like to lodge a complaint, a- as a matter of fact.

Lennox: Okay, okay, listen, all right? One of the software engineers at Sam's office was murdered today. He was involved in NASA's lunar mapping probe.

Mearing: Here's the thing. Colonel Lennox. We cannot entrust national security to teenagers, unless I missed a policy paper. Are we doing that now? No. Good. I don't care who you are. If you breathe a word of what you see in here, you will do time for treason. Do you understand me?

Sam: I'll take my orders from the Autobots. I know them. I don't know you.

Mearing: You will.

NEST Announcer: [saying something indistinct]

Lennox: Sentinel Prime. These things run on Energon, and he's out of it. He's in a... sort of a sleep mode.

Optimus Prime: Let us begin.

Lennox: That's the great Matrix of Leadership. He holds the only thing in the universe that can re-power a Transformer's spark.

Carly: This is incredible.

Optimus Prime: Sentinel Prime, we bid you return.

Sentinel Prime: [Speaking in Cybertronian]

Optimus Prime: Unngh-

Lennox: Hold your fire!

Sentinel Prime: [Speaking in Cybertronian]

Optimus Prime: Stop! Sentinel! It is I- Optimus- Prime! It is all right. You are safe.

Ratchet: There is nothing to fear.

Optimus Prime: We are here. You are home, Sentinel.

Sentinel Prime: The war... the war!

Optimus Prime: The war was lost. Cybertron is now but a barren wasteland. We have taken refuge here, on planet Earth. Its human race is our ally.

Sentinel Prime: My ship! We came under fire. The pillars. Where are the pillars?

Optimus Prime: You saved five of them, including the control pillar.

Sentinel Prime: Only five? We once had hundreds!

Mearing: Excuse me, gentlemen. May I ask... what is this technology you're looking for?

Sentinel Prime: It is the ability to reshape the universe. Together the pillars form a Space Bridge. I designed, and I alone, can control it. It defies your laws of physics to transport matter through time and space.

Mearing: You're talking about a teleportation device, aren't you?

Optimus Prime: Yes, for resources, for refugees.

Mearing: Refugees, or troops of soldiers, weapons, maybe bombs! A means of an instant strike! That's its military function, isn't it?

Sentinel Prime: It is our technology and it must be returned.

Mearing: Yes. If humans say so! You can't just bring weapons of mass destruction into our atmosphere! Kind of have to clear customs first. A little formality called paperwork, kind of separates us from the animals.

Sentinel Prime: I will overlook your condescending tone if you heed the gravity of mine. The Decepticons must never know the Space Bridge is here. For in their hands, it would mean the end of your world.

Mearing: 'Total Nightmare' file. So, the investigation is open. We've sent agents to your office. And for the time being we're gonna send you home with Autobot protection.

Sam: Uh, who do I- who do I need to speak to to get you guys to understand that I can help, that I can contribute?

Brains: Hey, we can all help. Want to tell you what I know? I could tell you about the solar system, all the fun planets to hang out in.

Mearing: Get off my desk, please.

Brains: Oh. You pulling out guns? Oh, can't help you out now. She angry.

Mearing: Oh my God.

Sam: What do you envision for me? I go home now? I go back to work? I make copies? I mean-

Mearing: This is a unit for veteran intelligence officers and Special Forces, not for boys who once owned special cars.

Carly: That's a bit harsh isn't it, ma'am?

Mearing: Don't call me ma'am. I'm not a ma'am.

Carly: Well, you're a woman aren't you?

Sam: So-o-o, are those yours?

Mearing: Yeah. CIA.

Sam: I only ask 'cause I also have a medal, from the President.

Mearing: Yeah. Great. So, it's not that complicated, right? No one gets to work with the Autobots unless I approve it. You're breaking my chain of command.

Carly: Come on, let's go. You've done what you came for.

Mearing: With all due respect, young man, I appreciate what you did. But you're not a soldier. You're a messenger. You've always been a messenger.

Carly: He's a hero.

Sam: Bee, you take the freight elevator. I'll see you up there.

Wheelie: Eh, this blows. That lady officially kicked us out.

Brains: Yeah. Witness protection program sucks.

Wheelie: Yeah, but we're a whole lot safer with big yellow and his cannons, 'cause that dog can't protect crap.

Bumblebee: {whistling noises}

Sam: Bee? You miss hanging out?

Bumblebee: {whistling noises}

Sam: Yeah, me, too.

Bumblebee: {whistling noises}

Sam: That woman, she called me a messenger. Can you believe that? After everything I've done, I'm a messenger.

Wheelie: Oh, I believe it. I tell you, Sammy, we feel the same way. The disrespect on this rock is criminal.

Sam: We should do something about it.

Bumblebee: {whistling noises}

Sam: Bee, I need to know why they're killing humans. I say we call in the expert.

Bill O'Reilly: My next guest is a former American intelligence operative who has dared to speak out regarding our alleged military alliance with what many describe as a group of extraterrestrial mercenaries. He is the author of the bestselling book, Code-Name Hero. Former special agent, Seymour Simmons

Simmons: Bill. Big fan. Great to be here.

Bill O'Reilly: Now Agent Simmons, you would have us believe that it is in our best interest to formally take sides in this so-called alien civil war?

Simmons: Well, the other side wanted to spank us for breakfast, so I wouldn't exactly call it a toss-up. These Decepticons are lethal.

Bill O'Reilly: But polls show half the world would feel safer with the Autobots completely gone. Get them out of here! We don't need them here!

Simmons: I feel safer when I sleep with a hand grenade. Doesn't mean I'm always right.

Bill O'Reilly: Now, agent, here at the Factor we have obtained documents that show you were fired by the intelligence committee-

Simmons: Chaz, I'm doing an interview.

Chaz: Sorry, Mr. Simmons.

Simmons: Downsized, Bill. Budget cuts. Chaz, out.

Bill O'Reily: Your psych evaluation reports severe delusional tendencies!

Simmons: This is ambush journalism.

Bill O'Reilly: Look, I'm not-

Simmons: You want the truth about the alien alliance? Buy my book! Buy my book! Before it's too late, people! You want a piece of me, Bill? You want to get naked? I'm ready!

Sam: Wow.

Simmons: Interview is over! You, out- of- my- house.

Bill O'Reilly: You're sounding like a pinhead, agent. And I've got a suggestion for you...

Simmons: It's over! Understand?

Bill O'Reilly: Damage control.

Simmons: Dutch!

Dutch: You have obviously upset Mr Simmons. You have twenty-three seconds to leave the property, I have called the police. You are peasant people throwing rocks at a giant!

Simmons: What's up next? What have we got?

Dutch: Book signing, Midtown, noon. Then we pitch your reality show to the Discovery Channel. And I have this, um- um- Vitvicky, who keeps calling me, five times today.

Simmons: Kid? What does he want?

Sam: I called you because the Decepticons are back. I want to know why, and I need your help.

Simmons: They're back? Well, that's good for business.

Sam: What if I told you I know a fifty year old alien secret that nobody ever told you?

Simmons: Do not tempt... my addiction. I have gone through withdrawal, kid. Dutch! is this line secure?

Dutch: No.

Simmons: Don't take the risk. I'm rich, why should I? Do not. Relapse. I won't. Do not let the demons win.

Dutch: Got it.

Simmons: What kind of... secret?

Sam: Apollo. Moon. Aliens. Cover-up. Future tech. Assassinations. That kind of stuff.

Simmons: Ohh, Apollo...

Simmons: Dutch!

Simmons: Tell Megatron... let's tango.

Act Eleven:

Sentinel Prime: So majestic and peaceful, this planet. Unlike the final days of Cybertron.

Optimus Prime: I've wondered what might have been, if you had fought the final battle, instead of me.

Sentinel Prime: Never mourn the past, young warrior. Thanks to you... our race survives.

Optimus Prime: You were our leader, Sentinel. It is your right to lead us again.

Sentinel Prime: In a world I do not know. I am no longer your teacher, Optimus. You are mine.

Act Twelve:

Simmons: You've got to break this case down. What we have here is an astronaut epidemic. MIA. Dead. Died in a car accident. Killed. DOA. Car death. It's like these guys can't drive. They can fly into outer space, but they can't drive a car.

Brazos: Procured your information, Witwicky.

Sam: Thank you, Bruce.

Brazos: Now...would you let me see one right now. One time.

Sam: Quick.

Brazos: Very.

Sam: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. It says NASA launched it in 2009. See, forensics show Wang may have messed with the code, preventing it from mapping the far side of the moon, which is also the dark side.

Bumblebee: {whistling noises}

Brazos: F*cking awesome.

Simmons: They infiltrate us, intimidate us, coerce us to do their dirty work. And once they're done, kadoosh. A double-tap to the cerebellum.

Sam: So humans are working for the Decepticons.

Simmons: I don't think this is about the Decepticons looking for something on the moon. I think it's about something... they wanted to hide.

Brazos: Come to Daddy. Come on, throw down. Ya! Ha!

Bumblebee: {Did you eat a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?}

Simmons: He's a freak.

Brazos: Ha! Like it?

Bumblebee: {Get back!}

Brazos: [laughing] I'm ticklish! [laughing]

Simmons: Sir! We are having a pretty high-level alien intel confab here, that I don't think you're cleared for, errand boy.

Brazos: Yeah, you're right. It's a bitching robot.

Sam: I think it's time to go, Bruce.

Brazos: Thank you so much for this. And-

Sam: Got to go, Bruce.

Brains: Hey, I'm smoking over here. Downloaded missing Russian cosmonauts. Turns out the Soviets canceled a manned mission to the moon. The moon! In 1972. And two of their cosmonauts went into hiding in America. And I just found them alive!

Wheelie: You're a genius, Brains.

Bumblebee: {whistling noises, surprised noises}

Brains: Oh, that was smooth, Bumblebee.

Bumblebee: {Missed it by... that much.}

Sam: Hi.

Carly: Would somebody care to tell me what the hell's going on?

Simmons: Who are you?

Carly: Who are you?

Simmons: Who am I? Who is that? Dutch! Frisk her!

Dutch: Certainly.

Sam: No, no. Dutch, uh-

Carly: Don't touch me.

Dutch: I'm not gonna touch her.

Carly: Sam?

Sam: Angel. Uh. I was working. I'm sorry about this.

Wheelie: Great! We're homeless.

Simmons: She lives here? Wow. You had your chance to frisk her.

Dutch: I have a girlfriend.

Simmons: Really? What's her name?

Dutch: India.

Carly: We're supposed to be at Dylan's party, remember?

Sam: I do remember, but these are my friends. They need me. I have to be here right now.

Carly: So, what, the Autobots and the military, they can't handle this on their own? You know what I liked about your war stories, Sam? It's that they were stories, they were in the past.

Sam: Look, I know you're thinking about your brother, okay? And you're thinking about your family. And it's not that situation.

Carly: No?

Sam: No.

Carly: Why not? Why isn't it, Sam? You think we'd rather have his medals, or we'd rather have him?

Sam: I hear you. I get it. Where are you taking my bunny? Stop! Just stop for a second.

Carly: You think I could sleep last night? And then it hit me. No, Sam wants to be in danger! He doesn't know who he is without it.

Sam: I just want to matter.

Carly: You matter to me.

Sam: I know you're worried. I know you're worried. But I promise you, I can- I can handle this.

Carly: Can you? You can promise it?

Sam: I promise.

Carly: Sam, I don't want to lose you and I know where this leads. I'm not ready for this. Are you coming with me?

Sam: I can't.

Carly: Okay.

Sam: Hey.

Carly: Here's your foot.

Simmons: The warrior's path is a solitary one... how the hell did she afford that car?

Sam: Her boss.

Simmons: Rich bastards! I used to hate them. Now, it's-

Simmons: Going to a gig on the hunt for two Russian cosmonauts. Nothing like driving in a Maybach, eh? Germans know how to make cars, let me tell you.

Simmons:My Dutchman, former NSA cybersleuth extraordinaire, tracked them down.. here. So, these cosmonauts went into hiding. Why?

Dutch: Bingo. I got a match.

Simmons: You're a German Shepherd, Dutch. The thing about Russians is, they never like to talk. It's gonna take a little of the international language.

Simmons: Do svidaniya.

Bouncer: That means good-bye.

Simmons: Watch this. [Hands money, speaks in Russian]

Bouncer: [Speaks in Russian]

Dimitri: [Speaks in Russian]

Yuri: Stay loose. [Speaks in Russian]

Simmons: Dutch, give me something tough.

Dutch: Ah.. B- baryshnikov.

Dimitri: We do speak English.

Simmons: Dutch, you suck.

Dutch: It's a Cyrillic alphabet! It's like all the buttons you never push on a calculator!

Russians: [laughing]

Dutch: I don't suck.

Simmons: Agent Seymour Simmons, Sector Eight, formerly Seven. We know who you are, cosmonautchiks.

Yuri: So what?

Simmons: You were supposed to travel to the dark side of the moon, then... Tch, it all got shut down. The question is, why?

Russian Woman: [speaks in Russian]

Dutch: Can my child smoke in here?

Bartender: [speaks in Russian]

Russian Woman: [speaks in Russian]

Dutch: [growls]

Sam: Ah- okay, all right, okay.

Simmons: Go ahead, shoot me.

Simmons: I'm willing to die for my country. Are you?

Russian Woman: [speaks in Russian]

Simmons: Really?

Russian Woman: [speaks in Russian]

Bartender: [shouts in Russian]

Simmons: You are beautiful. Has anyone ever told you you're beautiful?

Russian Woman: [speaks in Russian]

Simmons: She's a beautiful woman.

Bartender: [shouts in Russian]

Dutch: Hyaah! [Grunts]

Bartender: [screams]

Simmons: Whoa! Hey!

Dutch: [panting]

Simmons: Dutch! Back in the cage.

Dutch: Hyaaaah!

Sam: Whoa-

Other people in the bar: [screaming]

Simmons: Dutch! Hold, Dutch, hold!

Sam: Control your boy, please! Control your boy.

Simmons: Dutch, schtop! Ich-ku-klav-kush-kash-stooop!

Dutch: I'm so sorry... That is the old me.

Simmons: Okay, let's everybody just calm down, let's lower the heat, lower the guns, let's relax. World War Two is over.

Dimitri: You are about to see one of the biggest Soviet secrets. America first to send man to the moon. But USSR first to send camera. In 1959, our Luna Three take picture of the... dark, the shadow side. Sees nothing. But in 1963, Luna Four sees-

Yuri: Strange rocks.

Dimitri: Yeah.

Yuri: Around the ship. Hundreds of them.

Dimitri: Yeah, show picture.

Yuri: With some... drag marks.

Sam: I've seen these. These aren't rocks, these are pillars. Alien pillars for a space bridge. We know about them because the Autobots have five of these.

Simmons: Decepticons must have raided the ship before Apollo Eleven ever got there, took the pillars, and hid them.

Sam: It doesn't make sense. The Decepticons have the ship. They have all those pillars. Why would they leave Sentinel when he's the only one who can use them?

Simmons: Unless...

Sam: He's the one thing they still need.

Sam: We've got to meet up with Sentinel, rendezvous with him and keep him safe.

Act Thirteen:

Sam: Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel. Optimus is ten minutes behind. We're coming to NEST now.

Mearing: Mr Witwicky, I thought I made it clear to you that I did not want you calling this phone.

Sam: Listen, the whole thing has been a setup since the beginning. The Decepticons wanted Optimus to find Sentinel because only Optimus could revive him.

Mearing: But we have the space bridge.

Sam: Mearing, you have five pillars. I just learned that they have hundreds. You're doing exactly what they wanted you to do. What do you need me to say to you? The Decepticons are coming for Sentinel Prime!

Mearing: We're going to NEST.

NEST Announcer: We have an Energon alert. Energon readings detected on the D. C. Parkway.

NEST Analyst: Currently tracking. Three black Suburbans.

Crowbar: [roaring]

Simmons: Whoa! Nooooo!

Dreads: [growling]

Sam: Bee, you got to get Sentinel out of here! You got to guard him!

Dreads: [growling]

Dutch: Oh my god I'm fired!

Hatchet: [roaring]

Sam: Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

Hatchet: [roar]

Hatchet: [pained growl]

Dino: Got you! Ah ha ha ha!

Sam: Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him, Bee!

Hatchet: [growling]

Sam: Bee, you've got to move faster! Faster, Bee! Go!

Sam: Bee! Move- [lots and lots of screaming] All right, back to NEST!

Sideswipe: Dino, I got him!

Sam: Ironhide!

Crowbar: [pained growling]

Crankcase: [growling]

Crowbar: [speaks in Cybertronian]

Ironhide: Is there a... problem?

Sideswipe: Whoa. Little Mexican standoff we got here.

Ironhide: Weapons down.

Sideswipe: And we'll let you escape with your dignity.

Crankcase: [speaks in Cybertronian]

Crowbar: [speaks in Cybertronian]

Ironhide: Drop them... That's good.

Crowbar: [growl]

Sideswipe: Ironhide, watch out!

Ironhide: Yaah!

Sideswipe: [grunting] Ironhide, catch!

Crowbar: [roaring]

Sideswipe: Behind you!

Crankcase: [growling, spluttering]

Ironhide: Decepticon punk.

Ironhide: Class dismissed.

Lennox: Get inside! Let's go!

NEST Guard: Move! Keep moving!

Sam: Lennox!

Lennox: Go go go go go.

Sam: We got Decepticons everywhere.

Lennox: I've got my whole team deployed looking for them. Ironhide! Protect Sentinel. Get him locked up inside.

Ironhide: Consider it done!

Sam: Hey, you've got to guard him, 'cause he's the key to the whole thing.

Sentinel Prime: Indeed I am. What you must realize, my Autobot brothers, is we were never going to win the war. For the sake of our planet's survival, a deal had to be made... with Megatron.

Ironhide: [grunting]

Lennox: Get back!

Ironhide: What have you- done-

Sentinel Prime: I hereby discharge you from duty.

Ironhide: No-

Bumblebee: [whistling noises]

NEST Troops: Get back! Get back!

Sam: Bee!

Lennox: Get back!

Bumblebee: [whistling noises]

NEST Troops: [screaming]

Sam: Whoa!

Lennox: Rally all NEST forces back to the base! Come on! Come on!

Ironhide: [groaning]

NEST Soldier: Get a medic down here!

Lennox: All right, we don't have enough men! Do not engage Sentinel!

Mearing: Just go to the back gate.

NEST Soldier: Take cover!

NEST Soldier: Watch left! Watch left!

Mearing: Let's go! Follow me!

NEST Soldier: Oh- hell no-

NEST Soldier: Fall back!

Mearing's Bodyguard: Director, don't go there!

Mearing: Stand down! Hey, Sentinel!

Mearing's Bodyguard: Director!

Mearing: What is going on? What do you think you are doing?

Sentinel Prime: I am a Prime! I do not take orders from you.

Lennox: Director Mearing, come on. We cannot fight him. Let's go. We have to go.

NEST Soldiers: Fall back fall back!

Sentinel Prime: Now! Return what belongs to me!

Mearing: Ohhh... my God!

Lennox: Move!

NEST Soldier: You guys okay?

NEST Soldier: Is everybody out? Is everybody out?

NEST Soldier: Everybody, stay calm. You're gonna be fine.

Mearing: Yeah, take a look, Optimus! This is all on you!

NEST Soldier: Sentinel hit the vault! Took the pillars.

Lennox: Come on, let's go. All right, notify the 101st Airborne! We need to hunt this thing down!

Act Fourteen:

Sam: [panting] Carly!

Ron: Hot from our little campfire.

Judy: Aww.

Ron: S'mores. Isn't that great? We were really living off the land.

Sam: Mom, Dad, have you guys seen Carly come home yet?

Judy: Excuse me. Can you knock, please? This is our bedroom.

Ron: Why wouldn't she be at home?

Sam: We had a fight and- we m- might have broken up, or be on a break. I don't really know.

Judy: What? No.

Sam: Look, I can't- I just can't- talk about it right now-

Judy: You've got to be kidding me.

Sam: I can't go into details, Mom. I have to find her.

Judy: Sit down! We're having a family meeting. Family meeting! You may not know this, but your father and I were not always this perfectly happy. You know, there was a time in our marriage when I thought this was not gonna work out. I just can't understand-

Sam: Can we please not?

Ron: She's damaging him.

Judy: You break up with one world-class hottie-

Sam: No. Stop. Stop, okay?

Judy: Yeah.

Sam: She dumped me, I moved on to something better. That's it. I'm a happier person.

Judy: The second beautiful girl, and you lose her-

Sam: Why don't you help me?

Ron: They had an argument.

Judy: You're a good looking kid, and-

Sam: One fight.

Judy: You're not gonna get a third one, I mean, unless you have like a, big-

Sam: What the f- Mom, mom, mom!

Judy: Maybe it's something else. Maybe you just don't know what you're doing.

Sam: [fake coughing] I don't want to talk about this anymore.

Judy: You need the book.

Ron: You're always wrong. Get used to it.

Judy: Tell him about the book. Okay. This. You've gotta read this. 'She Comes First.' There's some killer shit in here.

Sam: No. No. No.

Ron: Oh. That's it, I'm going.

Sam: No. No! No!

Judy: Sit down! Sit down! Back me up!

Ron: Happy wife happy life.

Judy: Heck yeah.

Ron: Unhappy wife, stone-cold misery for the rest of your-

Judy: Stop.

Ron: It's true.

Judy: All I'm saying is, do you love this girl?

Sam: She's the one.

Judy: Then you gotta go get her. I mean, your dad and I, when we had troubles, he moved heaven and earth to find me. Look at- Say what you said. Say it.

Ron: I will follow you to the end of time. Does that suck or what?

Judy: No, it's so sweet.

Ron: It's like a bad sci-fi film.

Sam: I want you to get out of the city. You guys get as far away from here as you can. You understand? I love you.

Act Fifteen:

Igor: [slobbering]

Starscream: Ah... My master! Such a brilliant scheme! So when Sentinel left Cybertron, it was to defect?

Megatron: He was meant to rendezvous with me here on Earth before fate waylaid us both. The only way to revive him... we needed Prime and his Matrix.

Starscream: Excellent strategy.

Megatron: [growl]

Igor: Mine, mine! [chuckling]

Starscream: So he is now your partner, master?

Megatron: He is my greatest triumph.

Starscream: So impressive.

Sentinel Prime: Commencing transport.

Optimus Prime: Stop! No, no Sentinel!

Sentinel Prime: Forgive me.

Megatron: Here we are. Fight us now.

Decepticon Troops: [lots of growling]

NEST Soldier: Contact! Watch out! Move it! Move it!

Optimus Prime: Autobots, retreat!

Humans: [screaming]

Optimus Prime: [grunting]

Optimus Prime: Nggah! Why, Sentinel? Why?

Sentinel Prime: For Cybertron! For our home! What war destroyed, we can rebuild! But only if we join with the Decepticons.

Optimus Prime: No, it's not the only way! This is our home! We must defend the humans!

Sentinel Prime: So lost you are, Optimus. On Cybertron, we were gods. And here... they call us machines. Let the humans serve us, or perish! You're lucky I didn't kill you. In time, you'll see.

Optimus Prime: It's not over.

Act Sixteen:

Dylan: Now, if I were him, I wouldn't let you out of my sight for one second.

Carly: [chuckling]

Sam: It's funny. I was just thinking on the way over here, I could really use some advice from Dylan, and there he is. Can I speak to you, Carly?

Dylan: Welcome, please, sit down. Have a drink.

Sam: You know what, I don't need a drink. Or a car, or a job. I just need to speak to my girlfriend alone. Is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?

Carly: Excuse me.

Carly: What's going on?

Sam: I'll tell you outside.

Dylan: I really think I can help you, Sam. I remember a talk I had with my dad once about tough choices.

Sam: Yeah, now's not the time. We'll set something up, though.

Dylan: Of course, it was way back, when my dad's firm was in charge of budget review and accounting for NASA. You see, the thing that he taught me was, when it's not your war, you join the side that's going to win.

Sam: Move.

Dylan: Too direct? Or is it just me?

Woman: Certainly not you, sir.

Sam and Carly: [screaming]

Soundwave: [growling]

Carly: [screaming]

Soundwave: You're mine!

Sam: Nooo!

Soundwave: [growling]

Sam: Get help.

Carly: Sam, I can't get out!

Sam: Someone get help!

Dylan: Good night.

Woman: Good night, Mr Dylan.

Carly: Get me out of here!

Laserbeak: [screeching]

Sam: Help! Get help!

Man: He is young. He will learn. Good night.

Carly: Get me out!

Dylan: It was a fun night.

Dylan: You really think you're the first man ever asked to join the noble alien cause?

Sam: Who are you?

Dylan: Do you know why we've not been back to the moon since 1972? Because these two-

Laserbeak: [screeching]

Dylan: -They came to my dad and they told him to do some creative accounting. Make it way too expensive to ever go back. So he and the others shut down the American and Russian space programs. And they've been our clients ever since.

Sam: You helped them kill people?

Dylan: You think they'd give you a choice? Besides, it's not like I personally participated. I am a liaison. I liaise.

Sam: [grunting]

Dylan: It's hostile takeover time, Sam.

Carly: [whimpering] Sam- Sam! Sam!

Sam: Let her go!

Carly: Sam!

Dylan: I've had my eye on you for years, Sam. You're the one spy I've never been able to provide as someone close to the Autobots.

Sam: [spits]

Carly: Sam! Don't do what he wants!

Dylan: Yes, he will. They all do.

Sam: [grunting]

Dylan: They will slaughter her, you understand me? In the time it takes you to blink, they'll do it to her and they'll do it to me. So you show a little respect! When someone offers you! A job! Wrist.

Sam: [grunt]

Dylan: You are to track down Optimus Prime, because you're the one human he trusts, and you will ask one question. How does he intend to fight back? Strategies, tactics, everything!

Watch Decepticon: [screeching]

Sam: Unnngggh!

Dylan: Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it? It's very high-tech. It lets us see what you see, hear what you hear and it taps your nervous system. So, if you so much as try and signal-

Sam: [grunting]

Dylan: Mm. I don't know what to tell you, Sam. Relationships have consequences. I am here because of my father. She is here because of you.

Carly: Hh. Hh-

Sam: Stop, stop! Stop! Stop!

Dylan: Soundwave, would you please? Sam, do your job. She'll be safe. I give you my word.

Sam: [panting] I'll kill you. You have my word.

Act Seventeen:

Morshower: Combatant Commands are now at DEFCON 1.

General: Approximately 200 Decepticons are now in hiding. Energon detectors have been triggered as far away as South America and China.

Morshower's Aide: The U. N. Just received an encrypted audio file. They say it's from the leader of the Autobots.

Sentinel Prime: Defenders of Earth. We have come for your natural resources to rebuild our damaged planet. When we have transported all we need, we will leave your world in peace. For such peace to exist, you must immediately exile the Autobot rebels you have harboured. Nonnegotiable. Renounce the rebels. We await your reply.

Mearing: We'll debrief you in transit.

Sam: Yeah, I really don't see how I can be of any help. I mean, you guys seem pretty busy. We could just do this another time, I think. Ow!

Mearing: I have underestimated you at every turn.

Sam: What- what?

Mearing: You warned us that they were using humans. And you knew that Sentinel was the key.

Analyst: Director!

Sam: Who am I? Hey, you're the expert. I'm just a walking security risk- ah- ah!

Mearing: Are you all right?

Sam: [grunting] Yes.

Mearing: No, you're not. You're sweating.

Sam: I'm, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm sweating because I'm nervous. I'm nervous because you got me in here with this information. Okay, I'm a Twitter junkie. I blog everything. I can't keep a secret to save my life.

Mearing: Oh, you wouldn't dare.

Sam: That's the truth. I'm telling you.

Mearing's Aide: Director, the Pentagon's calling in fifteen.

Analyst: What are you doing?

Sam: Nothing. What are you doing?

Analyst: Get away from me.

Female Newscaster: It's been a remarkable series of events today at the Capitol. Just moments ago, legislation was passed to exile the Autobots from American shores. The U. S. Military alliance with them is officially over. In the words of the House Majority Leader-

Mearing: Yeah.

Female Newscaster: the sponsor of today's resolution, we cannot in good conscience invite-

Mearing: Okay.

Sam: What? They can't do this. You gotta tell them. They can't do that.

Mearing: Okay. It's official. It's a go, people.

Sam: These are our allies. The Autobots fought for us. They fought with us.

Mearing: And where are we now? Facing an enemy invasion with an enemy that has the means to deploy countless more.

Mearing: If there is any more you know, anything at all about the enemy's intentions, now is the time to tell.

Sam: Autobots have no way of leaving this planet.

Mearing: And that is where you're wrong.

Mearing: Its name is the Xantium. It brought the second wave of Autobots, and it's been under NASA 's care and study ever since. We linked it with a decommissioned shuttle to maintain military control until they're gone.

Leadfoot: Gonna be ten thousand pounds of torque on that itsy-bitsy bolt, not nineteen!

Roadbuster: You're gonna risk the lives of all me mates! I'll ball ya! You, there- [speech obscured by Mearing]

Mearing: These guys are the Wreckers. They take care of the Xantium. We don't let them off the base much, 'cause they're assholes.

Roadbuster: You gotta pull that, ya nancy wanker!

Leadfoot: It's time to kill him!

Technician: I'm just trying to help, you know. Just doing my job.

Leadfoot: Ah, no.

Epps: Just calm down. Leave him alone. This is a human being.

Sam: Epps!

Roadbuster: You are ridiculous!

Sam: Is that you?

Epps: What up, man?

Sam: What are you doing here?

Epps: I retired from the Air Force. Can you let my hand go? What the hell was that? Now I just consult to run interference for them.

Leadfoot: Well, you're not helping!

Epps: No more combat and aliens shooting at my ass. I got a dream job.

Roadbuster: Time to get off this planet.

Leadfoot: Preflight checks are go.

Epps: Kicking the Autobots out. Can you believe this is happening?

Sam: Where do you think it's taking them?

Epps: Any planet but here.

Simmons: I wanna talk to whoever's in charge here! Well, well, well. Charlotte Mearing.

Mearing: Agent Simmons. Former Agent Simmons. So. I see you survived Washington.

Simmons: Washington, Egypt, heartbreak. I survive. I will survive. They're bringing everybody in, kid. Putting all the intel on the table. And if you think deporting nine Autobots is gonna solve a damn thing-

Mearing: It's out of my hands.

Simmons: Moving up in the world, huh? Your booty looks excellent.

Mearing: You ever say a word to anyone about what happened that night in Quantico, I'll cut your heart out.

Simmons: You already did.

Wheelie: Sammy, listen to me. Don't let them exile us.

Brains: Don't let them take us, Sam.

Wheelie: It's a Decepticon trap.

Leadfoot: Check the nitrogen levels. We're booking out of here.

Sam: Optimus?

Optimus Prime: What your leaders say is true.

Que: Aye.

Optimus Prime: This was all my fault. I told them whom to trust. I... was so wrong.

Sam: That doesn't make it your fault. It just makes you human for a change.

Optimus Prime: Remember this. You may lose your faith in us, but never in yourselves.

Sam: [soft grunting] I need to know how you're gonna fight back. I know this is strategy, I know you're... you're coming back with reinforcements, something, I know there's a plan. You can tell me. No other human will ever know.

Optimus Prime: There is no plan.

Sam: If we just do what they want, how are we gonna live with ourselves?

Optimus Prime: You are my friend, Sam. You always will be. But your leaders have spoken. From here, the fight will be your own.

Optimus Prime: Make it short. We're loading up.

Leadfoot: All right, hustle up! We launchin' at dawn.

Bumblebee: {We're gonna do whatever we can. Make it like it was. You will always be my friend, Sam. I gotta be going on.}

Sam: [sobbing]

Simmons: Years from now, they're gonna ask us. Where were you when they took over the planet? We're gonna say, we just stood by and watched.

6:30 AM

Dylan: You should really look at this as a partnership. You have to stand on the side of progress if you wanna be a part of history.

Launch Announcer: [indistinct words] Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.

Launch Announcer: Go ahead and throttle up. First flight [indistinct words] status-

Sam: You wanted an answer. You got one.

Dylan: I always get what I want, Sam. We just needed to be sure.

Sam: Sure of what?

Dylan: That they would go without a fight.

Starscream: [speaks in Cybertronian] It's begun.

Launch Announcer: Say again.

Analyst: We're tracking an incoming object.

Sam: [grunting] Ah!

Dylan: We all work for the Decepticons now.

Chicago, Illinois

Sam: I need your help to track a phone call. There's a man on this phone. He's the head of their human operations and he has Carly hostage.

Dylan: I want you to sit down. Don't move.

Dylan: Follow me. I'm watching him drive up right now.

Dutch: The call was placed en route. I'm hacking into the phone's camera now. There, that's it. That's a live stream from the camera. Someplace, right, hold on, I can triangulate this. Okay, it's Chicago cell sites. There, I've got it. Trump Tower, Chicago. Lower penthouse.

Dylan: We're on.

Sam: I'm going.

Simmons: You sure?

Sam: She's done nothing but try to help me, and I can be there in fifteen hours.

Epps: You're not going alone.

Epps: I still got my NEST friends out there. I'll round them up, we'll find your girlfriend, we're gonna bring this guy in.

Sam: Why are you helping me?

Epps: 'Cause that asshole killed my friends, too.

Carly: They said they were here for our resources, to rebuild their planet.

Dylan: Yes, but really one resource in particular. One unique to our planet.

Carly: Us?

Dylan: You're very smart. You see, they can't rebuild without a slave labor force. How many rocks up there in the universe offer six billion workers?

Carly: What are you talking about? We can't transport people.

Dylan: They're not shipping people. They're shipping their planet here.

Carly: Oh. Oh my God... what's Sentinel doing here?

Dylan: Watch. They're spreading hundreds of pillars around the globe right now. In just a few hours, they're gonna launch them into orbit and bring Cybertron into our atmosphere. The red one there controls the rest. He triggers that, it starts the whole thing.

Megatron: Begone, insect operatives. Your work is done.

Dylan: Your Excellency... He's such a dick.

Policemen: [shouting]

Carly: You want this to happen?

Dylan: I want to survive. I want forty more years. You think I asked for this? I inherited a client.

Carly: Yeah, and when Cybertron's here and we're all their slaves, I guess they'll still need a human leader.

Dylan: Don't jinx me. You want to survive, you listen to me.

Policemen: [shouting]

Civilians: [screaming]

Sentinel Prime: It is time for the slaves of Earth to recognize their masters. Seal off the city.

Humans: [screaming]

Dylan: Get the dogs outta here now! Get them in the back!

Carly: I guess they didn't tell you about this part, did they?

Dylan: You think I'm at every meeting? Look, I'm safe. They said I was safe.

Act Nineteen:

Soldier: Let's roll!

Epps: We had a signal earlier. It's not working.

Radio: This is a national emergency broadcast.

Radio: Chicago has suffered a massive attack.

Man: Wrong way! Get out of here! Go back!

General: There is a ring of alien ships around Chicago.

Morshower: Our high-range bombers were just knocked out of the sky. They can't get through enemy air defenses over the city. Our satellites have been jammed. We have no way to monitor the enemy's movement.

Lennox: Our old NEST teams are on stand-down holding at Grissom Air Force Base. We're about ten minutes from the battle zone. We have Special Forces trying to gain access to the city, and infantry is staging at the perimeter.

Simmons: Excuse me, excuse me, it just doesn't make sense! Can't we get any eyes in there at all?

Mearing: They keep shooting down our drones.

Morshower: They want us blind. But we do have a couple of mini-drones we're gonna try.

Simmons: Well, whoever's manning these UAV drones, can we try to redirect them toward Trump Tower? The kid Witwickety, was on his way to Chicago. Said some point-man human op is there, for the Decepticons! Listen, if I know anything, I know this, that kid is an alien bad news magnet.

Children: [shouting]

Sam: [panting]

Epps: My God. We came here to find her in the middle of all that?

Stone: Are we really going out there, Epps?

Eddie: I'm not going in there.

Epps: No one's going in.

Sam: I am. With or without you, I'll find her.

Epps: You're gonna get yourself killed, Sam. Is that what you want? Is that what you want? You came all the way out here to get yourself killed? Huh? Listen to what I'm saying.

Sam: She's here because of me. Do you understand?

Epps: Listen, if you go in this building, that's if she's even still alive, there's no way you're gonna be able to reach her!

Sam: What do you suggest I do?

Epps: It's over. I'm sorry, but it's over.

Sam: No.

Eddie: Whoa whoa whoa! Incoming!

Humans: [indistinct shouting]

Epps and Sam: [grunting]

Decepticon Pilot: [growling]

Optimus Prime: We will kill them all.

Leadfoot: Wreckers, kill it.

Roadbuster: This is going to hurt! A lot!

Decepticon Pilot: [growling]

Roadbuster: Ah ha ha!

Optimus Prime: Your leaders will now understand. Decepticons will never leave your planet alone. And we needed them to believe we had gone. For today, in the name of freedom, we take the battle to them!

Sam: I saw your ship blow up!

Roadbuster: The ship. We were never in the ship! We designed the damn thing, didn't we?

Leadfoot: We were hidden in the first booster rocket to separate. Splashed down back in the Atlantic, just as planned. We ain't going nowhere.

Brains: Yeah, no one's exiling us.

Wheelie: The Autobots are staying right here. We're gonna help you win this war.

Optimus Prime: They're surrounding the city to make a fortress, so that no one can see what they're up to inside. Our only chance is the element of surprise.

Sam: I think I know where to look!

Drone controller: Mini-drone is on approach to Trump Tower.

Mearing: You're telling me Sam's headed into that?

Simmons: Poor kid. Probably never got close.

Sam: So, you can fly this thing, right?

Bumblebee: [whistling radio noise]

Sam: What is that? What is that, what is that? So-so? So you so-so can fly this. That feels terrible.

Epps: We're right behind you.

Epps: All right, we're going in!

Megatron: The city is secure. The humans cannot stop us.

Sentinel Prime: As the afternoon falls, the rest of the pillars will reach their launch position.

Megatron: This is the victory I promised you so many years ago, where we rebuild Cybertron... together!

Sentinel Prime: I have deigned to work with you-

Megatron: [grunting]

Sentinel Prime: -That our planet may survive! I will never work FOR you!

Megatron: Ah!

Sentinel Prime: And you would be wise to remember the difference.

Dylan: Hah! I'm just so sick of this. I'm just sick of waiting.

Sam: Where is she? Where is she?!

Dylan: You've got some balls.

Laserbeak: [screeching]

Sam: [screaming]

Carly: No, Sam! No! No- no-

Sam: Carly! Carly!

Carly: [grunting]

Sam: Jump!

Laserbeak: [screeching]

Sam: [grunting]

Sam: Bee, fire!

Laserbeak: [screaming]

Carly: Uh- Bee!

Sam: [screaming]

Civilians: [screaming]

Sam & Carly: [screaming]

Dylan: [grunting] Autobots! They're alive! They're here! They're alive!

Megatron: Decepticons, defend the pillar! Raise the bridges! Find them!

Sam: [grunting]

Carly: Oh, Sam. Oh. You found me.

Sam: I'd follow you anywhere.

Soldier: Form a perimeter! Let's go, let's go!

Epps: Well, you're crazy.

Sam: What is that? Is that us?

Epps: This thing's a military UAV. Stone, check and see if it's still working.

Stone: Yeah, it's still got power.

Epps: Flight Control, do you copy? Can, can you rotate? Can you do something?

Controller: I think we got something.

Lennox: Epps! We got Epps!

Epps: Can you rotate? Can you do something?

Epps: Come on, man! Work! Work!

Lennox: All right, turn the volume up on that!

Simmons: The kid!

Epps: Can you rotate or something?

Epps: Yes, yes! Okay, okay, okay! They can see us.

Sam: Chicago is ground zero, do you understand? Can you hear us? You understand?

Mearing: Witwicky.

Carly: Please listen. Sentinel Prime is here and he has the pillars to his Space Bridge. They're on top of a building on Chicago River. It's owned by Hotchkiss-Gould Investments. Now, the pillar that controls everything is in the southeast cupola.

Sam: You've got to destroy the pillar. You have to shoot down the pillar or they're going to transport Cybertron here, do you understand? Do you understand?

Mearing: Cy- What?

Lennox: Give me a GPS on the building and on that drone! Let's go!

Analyst: Mensurate those coordinates. Shorten the kill chain.

Lennox: Guys on the tarmac, five minutes.

Carly: -The southeast cupola.

Lennox: All right!

Optimus Prime: We need to move before the fighters spot us. Wait here until we scout a route ahead. Let's roll.

Sideswipe: Ratchet, cover high.

Sam: Hey, think we could use that rocket to shoot down the pillar?

Epps: We're eight blocks away. We got to get closer to take a shot.

Hooch: Not closer. Higher. We need a clear line of sight.

Epps: And it's across the river. Gonna have a hell of a time trying to sneak up.

Mongo: We only got one shot.

Sam: One shot's all we need.

Simmons: We got to be able to see around that building from the ground. Get NSA to send service specs for any cameras in that area. Maybe some are working. Traffic lights. ATMs. Anything.

Lennox: Listen up. You want to hit back? We're gonna have to wingsuit in. It's the only way to get close. I can't promise anyone a ride home, but if you're with me, the world needs you now.

Babyface: I'll find my own ride home, sir.

Lennox: Who else?

NEST Soldiers: [acknowledgement noises]

Lennox: General Morshower, requesting diversionary action to the south of the city. We're coming north and low, you guys drive them to the east.

Brains: Autobot victory! Autobot victory!

Driller: [roaring]

Shockwave: [speaks in Cybertronian]

Epps: That is one scary-ass Decepticon!

Optimus Prime: They got my trailer. I need that flight tech. Shockwave can't hunt all of us at once. Wreckers, we need a diversion.

Roadbuster: Let's get some!

Leadfoot: You got that right.

Epps: Listen, we're gonna circle around to that glass building. And we'll get high enough to make the rocket shot while you guys draw his fire. Let's move!

Que: Wait a minute! I'm not letting you go out there without my urban combat prototypes.

Sideswipe: We got to go, Que! Come on.

Que: Wait, wait. They're great inventions for kicking ass!

Sam: What are these?

Que: Those are boom sticks. Armed in thirty seconds. Grapple gloves, for climbing.

Soldier: Go, go! Move your ass!

Sideswipe: Move, move! Move, move! Go, go, go!

Soldier: Move, move!

Stone: Let's go!

Shockwave: [roaring]

Wheelie: Ah!

Brains: Ow ow ow!

Soldier: Let's go! Run!

Shockwave: [growling]

Brains: Ey, ey, ey. Where you going?

Wheelie: No, no, no!

Brains: Where you going?

Wheelie: Stop, stop, stop! Don't leave!

Brains: You never leave a 'bot behind! Ahh, Shockwave's coming!

Epps: Go for the stairs!

Sam: Epps, this way!

Eddie: Let's go, let's go.

Osprey Pilot: Breaking right.

Osprey Pilot: Bead. Rolling in.

Osprey Pilot: We got another one coming around. Coming around on the left side, coming around on the right side.

Lennox: We're going to use Willis Tower for cover! Once we make altitude, we jump!

Osprey Pilot: A lot of airplanes out here!

Osprey Pilot: Contact off the nose.

Osprey Pilot: Mayday Mayday! I don't think he's gonna make it.

Osprey Pilot: Mayday, mayday! Six-one going down.

Lennox: Heads up! Heads up!

Babyface: Come on, come on, come on, come on.

Osprey Pilot: Tally on the left.

Osprey Pilot: Got him. Eagle. Time on target, twenty seconds.

Lennox: Here we go! Here we go! Keep it tight!

Osprey Pilot: Coming around.

Babyface: All right, focus focus focus.

Osprey Pilot: Threat above tower, six o'clock!

Starscream: Locusts!

Osprey Pilot: Look out! Breaking right! Breaking right!

Osprey Pilot: Watch out, watch out, watch out!

Osprey Pilot: Holy shit!

Osprey Pilot: Look out, look out, look out! Get them out, get them out, get them out!

Lennox: Everybody out! Out! Out!

NEST Soldier: Jump, jump, jump!

Osprey Pilot: Get out, get out!

NEST Soldier: I'm stuck!

Osprey Pilot: Now. Get them out now! Get them out now!

NEST Soldier: Help!

NEST Soldier: Get separation. Track away, track away!

Lennox: Hard left! Hard left! Six hundred feet.

NEST Soldier: Check your six! Check your six!

Lennox: He's on our ass!

NEST Soldier: Watch out, watch out!

Lennox: Sharp right!

NEST Soldier: Building dead ahead!

Lennox: Thread the needle!

NEST Soldier: Whoaa! Whoa!

NEST Soldier: Pull, pull!

Sam: Come on, we're high enough!

Eddie: This is a mother getting up here!

Epps: Get your fat ass over here!

Eddie: I'm coming.

Epps: Set up the rocket! They're coming.

Lennox: Weapon status?

NEST Soldier: Twenty-nine Bot-busters, twenty piercing D-Bot.

Carly: There, the building with the dome.

Lennox: For our brothers, let's make this trip worth it.

Eddie: Oh, God.

Soldiers: Oh. Whoa. Whoa!

Hooch: The building! They're shooting at the building!

Eddie: Whoa whoa-

Eddie: This is not a good idea.

Sam: What?

Eddie: This is not a good idea. This building is unstable.

Sam: Listen, stop for a second. If we don't do what we came to do, it doesn't matter, we all die, right? That's your target. Come on, man!

Eddie: I don't even care if the building collapses. I'm having a heart attack anyway.

Epps: The building is going over! Hang on!

Soldier: Take cover!

Eddie: Whoaaa!

Soldiers: Whoa!

Epps: Keep your hands up!

Soldiers: Whoaa!

Sam: [grunting]

Epps: It's okay! It stopped!

Carly: Guys, look!

Soldier: Incoming, incoming!

Epps: Everybody hide!

Decepticon Protoform: [growling]

Sam: [panting] Don't. Move.

Epps: Go, go.

Carly: Sam!

Stone: Oh no no! Eyaaah!

Shockwave: [growling]

Epps: Is everybody okay?

Sam: You okay?

Eddie: The hell was that?

Shockwave: [growling]

Epps: This evil thing's looking at me!

Sam: What?

Driller: [roaring]

Epps: It's even got an uglier Decepticon with it! We have to evac!

Shockwave: [speaks in Cybertronian] Commence.

Driller: [roaring]

People: [screaming]

Hooch: Sergeant Epps, the stairs are blocked!

Soldier: We're trapped!

Soldier: Okay. How do we get out of here? Hey! Come on!

Eddie: Oh, Lord Jesus, let me just get out of this alive. Oh Lord Jesus just let me get out of this alive.

Epps: Whoa!

Sam: Move! We got to move!

Epps: Why do the Decepticons always get the good shit?

Sam: Move!

Epps: We're about to be eaten, people!

People: [screaming]

Sentinel Prime: Decepticons around the world... launch the pillars.

Decepticon Protoform: [grunting]

Wheelie: Ah! We are so lost!

Brains: Always left out.

Wheelie: Ooh. Ka-ching! It's time to lay down the law.

Brains: About to bring some hurt now.

Sam: It's starting! You see it?

Epps: Whoa! Look out!

Epps: Where are Sam and Carly?

Eddie: Ummm...

Sam: We'll go this way.

Epps: I give you one thing to do, one thing to do, and you drop the ball on that?

Eddie: I ain't signed up for all this! Got aliens blasting at me, running around chasing me! I'm ducking through churches and buildings and all that kind of crap, man! This is bullshit! I ain't signed up for this, Epps. I'm trying to keep it together.

Starscream: What a treat! You and me, alone!

Sam: Carly!

Sam: Come on, come on! Run! Okay! He's after me, not you. Quick! Run!

Starscream: You can't hide, boy!

Sam: Oh my god-

Starscream: I just love it when your little insect feet try to run!

Carly: Sam!

Sam: Run!


Starscream: I thought you were working for us, boy? Hahahahaha!

Carly: No! Sam!

Starscream: [screaming] Ahhh, my eye!

Starscream: [grunting and screaming] My eye!

Lennox: Target the Decepticon!

Sam: [screaming]

Carly: Sam!

Carly: Please, you've got to save Sam! You've got to save him!

Lennox: What the hell is he doing?

Sam: [grunting] This better work-

NEST Soldier: D-Bots! D-Bots!

Starscream: [roaring and shouting]

Sam: [shouting]

Starscream: Ow ow ow ow! I can't see! I can't see!

Lennox: Sam! It's on my hand! Grab the knife! Knife!

Sam: I'm trying! Knife, knife, knife, knife, knife!

Starscream: [growling]

Sam: The bomb's gonna blow! The bomb's gonna-

Starscream: You human scum!

Sam: We got twenty seconds on that bomb!

Lennox: What bomb?

Sam: You see that bomb? Cut it, cut it, cut it!

Starscream: [roaring]

Lennox: I got it! How long do we have?

Sam: Whoa!

Starscream: I'm gonna kick you!

Sam: [screaming] Cut, cut, cut cut cut!

Starscream: I'm gonna kill y-

Bumblebee: [whistling noises]

Sam and Lennox: [screaming]

Lennox: [panting]

Sam: Well, he's dead.

Lennox: Mm-hmm.

Sam: Hey, Bee's going to run with the rest of the Autobots and meet us at the edge of the river.

Lennox: All right.

Decepticon Pilots: [speaking in Cybertronian]

Wheelie: It sucked me in! There was nothing I could do!

Brains: Uh-oh.

Wheelie: Ah.

Brains: This is a total clusterf-

Sam: We got to get across the river. You see that? She said the control pillar was in that first cupola.

Lennox: All right.

NEST Soldier: Let's go! Move! Let's move!

NEST Announcer: Tomahawks are inbound. ETA twenty minutes.

Dutch: I'm in the traffic cameras.

NEST Announcer: Four Autobots are captured.

Mearing: Oh, my God. We're helpless.

Simmons: Whatever's set to happen, with those pulses getting faster, it's gonna happen soon.

NEST Announcer: No sign of Optimus.

Lennox: How do we get these bridges down? Spread out. Check in there.

Lennox: Epps! Epps, I've been looking for your ass. How you doing?

Epps: Retirement is whack. Even worse, we can't get across the river to that building, and the Autobots are upstairs, surrounded.

Simmons: Just pan the camera around, all right?

Dutch: All right. Pan- pan right. That's you.

Lennox: Try getting into the bridge control room.

Mearing: What are they doing? They're just standing there.

Simmons: Hang on. Dutch, see if you can hack into the bridge.

NEST Soldier: Sir, SEALs are here.

Lennox: It's a good day, boys! What do you got?

SEAL Captain: Got a ten-man SEAL unit, sir, tasked with vectoring Tomahawks.

Lennox: How long?

SEAL Captain: Fifteen.

Soundwave: You're my prisoners!

Sideswipe: Take it easy. We surrender.

Decepticons: [growling]

Ratchet: Get off me. Get off me!

Lennox: All right, you're gonna need your forty Mike-Mikes and frags. Go full auto. The vibrations jack up their circuits. Snipers, shoot for the eyes. All right, your target is up on top of that building, that cupola.

Sentinel Prime: How doomed you are, Autobots. You simply fail to understand, that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Activating the bridge.

Decepticons: [shouting]

Brains: They happy about something.

Wheelie: We're in the heart of their ship. Let's give them a little ride.

Brains: Oh ho! We gonna screw this ship up.

Dutch: It's a 128K binary encryption code. It's difficult... but not for me, I'm in. Bridge, down.

Epps: The bridge is coming down! Someone's watching over us!

Soldier: Come on! Let's go!

Simmons: Pleasure working with you, Seymour. I believe you're supposed to say.

Mearing: Good job, Dutch.

Dutch: [speaks in German]

Ratchet: Get off me!

Bumblebee: [whistling noises]

Barricade: [growl]

Sam: [panting]

Roadbuster: Hurry! They're triggering the pillars!

Dylan: Prisoners? You're keeping prisoners?

Soundwave: Yes.

Dylan: You need to teach them about respect. This was all business, but now it's personal, do you understand me?

Soundwave: Ha ha. I understand. No prisoners, only trophies.

Que: Bee? I think they're going to kill us.

Bumblebee: [whistle]

Barricade: You! Your time is up.

Que: Wait, wait, wait! We surrendered! We're your prisoners.

Barricade: Move it!

Que: Can't we talk this out? We're all a bunch of good chaps! I mean you no- why did you- aah!

Barricade: [laughing]

Bumblebee: {Good-bye, my old friend.}

Soundwave: You're mine now.

Bumblebee: [angry whistles] {Get off me!}

Soundwave: Come along!

Sam: I got to help him.

Carly: What? What are you doing?

Sam: I got to help him.

Carly: Sam, you can't help him. Sam!

Sam: [grunting]

Soundwave: Turn around.

Bumblebee: {We- we gave them a hell of a run.}

Soundwave: [grunting]

Bumblebee: [whistle]

Wheelie: We did it, Brains! We did it!

Brains: Rip this ship apart!

Soundwave: Nngh!

Sam and Carly: [shouting]

Bumblebee: {Yeah!}

Soundwave: No- NO!

Wheelie: We had a nice run, Brains.

Brains: Yeah.

Wheelie: You and me.

Brains: We gonna die.

Epps: Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, baby! You all come with us!

NEST Soldier: Go! You guys, follow that ground team! Go!

NEST Soldier: Move, move, move!

Lennox: Epps, third floor! We're going to 45!

Lennox: All right. Two snipers, right here! All right, dock up!

NEST Soldier: We jump in three minutes!

Epps: Set up shop right here.

Lennox: All right. Set up.

Barricade: [speaking in Cybertronian]

Epps: I'm downstairs.

Lennox: We got five targets and Shockwave right below us.

NEST Soldier: Stand by to jump!

Lennox: All right, let's go! Get ready, get ready.

Barricade: [speaking in Cybertronian]

Lennox: Go!

Barricade: [speaking in Cybertronian]

Epps: Snipers, take out their eyes.

Barricade: Nngh!

Stone: All right, demo team, let's crank steel.

Decepticon Protoforms: [growling]

Barricade: [growling]

Mongo: Turning steel!

Decepticon Protoform: [grunting] Holy shit!

Shockwave: [growling]

Epps: Don't fire till I tell you!

Shockwave: [roaring]

Babyface: Woaaaah!

Lennox: Go! All right, good job, kid!

Epps: Fire!

Shockwave: [growling]

Eddie: Yeah!

Epps: We got him!

Eddie: Yeah!

NEST Soldier: He's on the run!

Sideswipe: Autobots, attack!

Ratchet: Mortar that bridge!

Sentinel Prime: It's our world now! Commence transport!

Sam: Oh my God. Oh my God.

Optimus Prime: Hah!

Sam: Optimus!

Optimus Prime: [grunting]

Shockwave: [growl]

Optimus Prime: [roaring] You die! Hyah!

Sentinel Prime: No!

Optimus Prime: Get down here, Sentinel!

Sentinel Prime: Optimus, you forget your place. I bring you Cybertron. Your home! And still you choose humanity.

Optimus Prime: You were the one who taught me freedom is everyone's right. [roaring]

Sentinel Prime: I will retrigger that pillar!

Optimus Prime: Then you'll have to go through me!

Optimus & Sentinel: [assorted grunting and roaring]

Sam: Okay, I've got to try and help. I have to. You stay here.

Carly: Don't you go. Don't go. Sam! Sam-

Sam: You'll be fine, okay? I promise. I got to get to that pillar.

Sentinel Prime: Charge the pillar!

Epps: We got Autobots!

Soldier: Right flank, right flank!

Sam: [grunting]

Soldier: Move, move!

Optimus Prime: Hah! Rrah!

Sentinel Prime: Reinforcements! Decepticon ships, fire at Optimus!

SEAL Captain: We're taking fire! I need those Tomahawks in now!

NEST Announcer: First wave inbound.

Roadbuster: We've got to cover for Optimus!

Optimus & Sentinel: [assorted grunting]

Sentinel Prime: Decepticons, trigger the pillar! Restart that pillar!

Dylan: Trigger the pillars.

Optimus Prime: I can't hold them! The ships have us pinned! No!

NEST Soldier: Inbound, ten seconds! Danger close!

SEAl Captain: Mark-Lima-Echo-Echo, one four two five zero!

Tomahawk Controller: Positive surface contact.

Tomahawk Controller: Target I.D.

Tomahawk Controller Target acquired.

Megatron: [growl]

Sam: Hah. Dylan! Wait! Wait-

Dylan: Noo!

Sam: Shit- Dylan! Stop! Stop! No! You can't do this, okay?

Dylan: There's only one future for me. Ah!

Sam: [grunting]

Megatron: Cybertron, you are saved. At last.

Megatron: Oh... Have you come to surrender?

Doctor: Hi!

Carly: Was it all worth it?

Megatron: Obviously.

Carly: All your work to bring Sentinel back and now clearly he has all the power. It's actually almost tragic.

Megatron: You dare lecture me, slave?

Carly: Your Decepticons finally conquering this planet, and yet, their leader won't be you!

Megatron: It will be me! It will always be me.

Carly: In any minute now, you'll be nothing but Sentinel's bitch.

Megatron: [roar]

Bumblebee: [whistle]

Hooch: Rocket! Die!

Sentinel Prime: [roaring and grunting]

Sam: Uh!

Dylan: You chose sides?

Sam: [grunting]

Dylan: You chose wrong.

Sam: [grunting]

Optimus Prime: Yaaah!

Sentinel Prime: Always- the bravest of us!

Optimus Prime: [grunting]

Sentinel Prime: But you could never make the hard decisions!

Optimus Prime: [grunting]

Sentinel Prime: Our planet will survive!

Optimus Prime: N- No!

Sentinel & Optimus: [various grunting]

Sentinel Prime: We were gods once. All of us.

Optimus Prime: Uh..

Sentinel Prime: But here-

Optimus Prime: Please-

Sentinel Prime: -There will only be one!

Sentinel Prime: [screaming]

Megatron: [growl] This is my planet!

Dylan: I just saved a whole other world. You think you're a hero, huh? You think you're a hero?

Sam: No. I'm just a messenger. Aaah!

Dylan: [dying screams]

Leadfoot: The pillar's still connected!

Epps: Let's go! Bring it up!

Sam: Bee! Let's do this!

Lennox: Let's go, let's go! Move, move! Pillar's still connected!

Roadbuster: Rip that pillar down!

Megatron: Now. We need a truce... All I want is to be back in charge. Besides... who would you be without me, Prime?

Optimus Prime: Time to find out.

Megatron: [grunting and roaring]

Sentinel Prime: Optimus, all I ever wanted was the survival of our race. You must see why... I had to betray you.

Optimus Prime: You didn't betray me. You betrayed yourself.

Sentinel: Prime: No, Optimus- [screaming]

Lennox: Sam.

Carly: I love you.

Sam: I love you. You're the only thing I need in this world, and I'll do anything to make it up to you, I promise.

Carly: I'm going to hold you to that. Just never let me go.

Sam: I promise.

Bumblebee: [whistling noises]

Carly: Ooo, rings.

Bumblebee: [plays the wedding tune]

Carly: I love this car.

Bumblebee: [whistling noise]

Sam: Bee, you've got to slow it down.

Carly: Hee hee.

Sam: You got to slow way down, okay?

Bumblebee: {Oh, I'm just trying to help out.}

Optimus Prime: In any war, there are calms between storms.

Ratchet: You fought bravely.

Optimus Prime: There will be days when we lose faith. Days when our allies turn against us. But the day will never come... that we forsake this planet... and its people.

Epilogue:

Mearing: Whoaa- [chuckles] Mmm!

Simmons: That's what I call the start of a beautiful future. Ha ha ha!

Mearing: [chuckles] Arrest him.

Simmons: Ha ha ha! It was worth it!

Mearing: Get him out of here!

Simmons: I'd go to jail for love! I don't care! Go ahead, take me in! I want to go in! Let's go in.

Dutch: Sir, sir-

Simmons: Come on, Charlotte, take me in right now!


BELLA: "Childhood is not
from birth to a certain age.
"And at a certain age, the child is grown
and puts away childish things.
"Childhood is the kingdom
where nobody dies."
Jake! Jacob!
(ROARlNG)
Phil!
lt's happening.
(SCRAPlNG)
You just have to break them in.
l've been breaking them in. For three days.
Can l just go barefoot?
No, absolutely not.
Just thinking it's a little much, you know?
The dress and the shoes,
and all of this.
ALlCE: No, it's exactly enough.
Tomorrow will be perfect.
Where do you want them, boss?
On either side of the aisle.
-What aisle?
-Does no one have vision?
You, go home and get lots of beauty sleep.
That's an order.
Okay.
l was just checking for cold feet.
Well, mine are toasty warm.
lt's not too late to change your mind.
What? Now you're having second thoughts?
You are.
No, l've been waiting a century
to marry you, Miss Swan.
But?
l haven't told you everything about myself.
What? You're not a virgin?
(LAUGHS)
(EXHALlNG)
Look, you can't scare me away now.
Look, a few years after Carlisle created me,
l rebelled against him.
l resented him for curbing my appetite.
And so for a while, l went off on my own.
l wanted to know how it felt to hunt.
(SCREAMlNG)
(AUDlENCE EXCLAlMS)
EDWARD: To taste human blood.
(HEART BEATlNG RAPlDLY)
(CHOKlNG)
All the men I killed
were monsters.
And so was I.
Edward, they were all murderers.
You probably saved more lives
than you took.
Bella, that's what l told myself.
But they were all human beings.
l looked into their eyes as they died
and l saw who l was,
and what l was capable of.
And what l'll be capable of.
Why are you telling me this tonight?
Did you really think
this was gonna change my mind about you?
l just wondered
if it would change your mind about yourself,
and who you wanna see when
you look in the mirror a year from now.
l know l can do this.
Let me tell you why.
Because you did.
(SCOFFS)
You should give yourself
some credit for that.
Now, hopefully, a year from now,
l'm gonna look in the mirror
and see someone like you.
l mean, someone capable of courage
and sacrifice and love.
-(EMMETT WHlSTLES)
-What is that?
-EMMETT: Come on! Let's go!
-l'm late for my bachelor party.
Send him out, Bella,
or we're coming in after him.
So, this party.
Will there be strippers?
(LAUGHS)
No, just a couple of mountain lions.
Maybe a few bears.
Don't worry, Bella,
we'll give him back in plenty of time.
Okay, go, before they break my house.
EMMETT: Let's go! Let's go!
l'll meet you at the altar.
l'll be the one in white.
That was very convincing.
(ALL LAUGHlNG)
What did l say about beauty sleep?
Sorry, bad dream.
lt was wedding jitters.
Do you need some help?
l could do her hair.
Really?
Please.
l'm not offended by your choice of groom.
Just my blatant lack of respect for mortality.
Essentially.
Weddings. They bring everyone together.
Hey, so, did you find our daughter?
Are those graduation caps?
(LAUGHS) How creative!
Or weird.
Alice? Bella?
BELLA: ln here, Mom.
(GASPS) Oh, my gosh!
You're so beautiful.
Oh, honey.
Crap! My mascara.
Mom!
Thanks.
Charlie, get in here.
You sure? l don't wanna...
l know. l look hot.
(LAUGHlNG)
We thought you needed something blue.
And something old.
-Besides your mother.
-(SCOFFS) Nice.
-lt was Grandma Swan's.
-But we added the sapphires.
lt's beautiful, you guys.
Wow. Thank you so much.
lt's your first family heirloom.
Pass on to your daughter, and her daughter.
Mom, l love it.
Nope. No smudging my masterpiece.
She's right.
Thank you.
ALlCE: Okay.
Time for the dress!
(GASPS)
ALlCE: Do you wanna see it?
RENE: l want to see it!
(CLASSlCAL MUSlC PLAYlNG)
ERlC: They have got to be related.
What a gene pool.
ERlC: Seriously.
You've got some... The drool.
So, you think Bella's gonna be showing?
Jess, she is not pregnant.
Okay. Who else gets married at 1 8?
(BREATHlNG DEEPLY)
(SlGHlNG)
You ready?
(SOFTLY) Yeah.
Just don't let me fall, Dad.
Never.
MlNlSTER: Ladies and gentlemen,
we are gathered here on this glorious day
to witness the union of Edward Cullen
and Bella Swan.
Please repeat after me.
l, Edward Cullen.
Take you, Bella Swan.
-Take you, Bella Swan.
-To have and to hold.
(ROMANTlC MUSlC PLAYlNG)
To have and to hold.
For better or for worse.
For richer, for poorer.
ln sickness and in health.
To love.
To cherish.
As long as we both shall live.
l do.
l love you.
(MUSlC CONTlNUES)
Have I found you
Flightless bird
Jealous
Weeping or lost you
American mouth
Big pill looming
Now I'm a fat house cat
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
(PLAYlNG lNSTRUMENTAL MUSlC)
Just thought it'd be bigger.
Yeah.
-Hi!
-Hi, guys.
We were just saying how pretty
everything is, you know, just saying.
Well, thanks so much.
You don't think it's too much?
-No.
-Not at all.
-No.
-No.
Hey, man. Nice to see you.
-l'm happy for you.
-Thank you.
l hope you'll be happy, Bella.
Thank you, Billy.
Have you heard from him?
l'm sure Jake wishes you the best.
Well, l plan on getting drunk.
They're serving up
some pretty fancy champagne.
Sue, can l get you a glass?
Sparkling fire water.
Sounds great.
CARMEN: Bella.
-Congratulations, Edward.
-Thank you.
Bella.
Eleazar and Carmen, right?
-Mmm-hmm.
-Hola.
Yes, and these are our cousins from Alaska.
-Tanya, Kate.
-We've heard so much about you.
-Welcome to the family.
-Bienvenida.
BELLA: Thank you.
lrina.
Come meet Bella.
-l can't do this.
-You promised.
They invited one.
lrina, he's our friend.
They killed Laurent.
He tried to kill Bella.
l don't believe that.
He wanted to be like us.
To live in peace with humans.
With me.
l'm sorry.
CARMEN: lrina!
ELEAZAR: Well.
Let's not monopolize the bride.
Congratulations.
BELLA: Thank you.
Sorry.
Well, what's a wedding
without some family drama?
-Yeah.
-EMMETT: Excuse me.
Is this on?
Hello?
(MAN WOLF-WHlSTLES)
Umm, I'd like to propose a toast.
To my new sister.
Bella, I hope you've gotten enough sleep
these last 18 years.
'Cause you won't be getting any more
for a while. (CHUCKLES)
(SlLENCE)
Well, Bella was just like everybody else,
totally mesmerized by Edward.
Or "The Hair," as l call him.
And then, suddenly,
Edward is all about Bella.
Even though she's not the captain
of the volleyball team.
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
Or the president of the student council.
Edward will be a good husband.
I know this because I'm a cop.
I know things.
Like how to hunt somebody
to the ends of the Earth.
(GUESTS LAUGHlNG)
Now that you're my sister,
you'll have to get over
your aversion to fashion.
And I know how to use a gun.
Skirts, heels, handbags.
(SlNGlNG) Go to sleep, my love
Go to sleep
When you wake
You'll see me
I'd like to thank Rene and Charlie
for bringing such a wonderful person
into the world and into our lives.
We will cherish and protect her forever.
It's an extraordinary thing
to meet someone
who you can bare your soul to.
And who will accept you for what you are.
(ROMANTlC MUSlC PLAYlNG)
I've been waiting,
what seems like a very long time,
to get beyond what I am.
And with Bella,
I feel like I can finally begin.
So I'd like to propose a toast
to my beautiful bride.
No measure of time with you
will be long enough.
But let's start with forever.
(DANCE MUSlC PLAYlNG)
Whoa!
SETH: Whoa!
Another one of your gifts just arrived.
What?
Yeah, come on.
What's a wedding present doing out here?
Just a little more private.
The best man didn't have time to get a tux.
Jacob!
Jacob.
-(BOTH LAUGHlNG)
-Hey.
-Hey, Bella.
-Hey.
This is kind of you.
Kind is my middle name.
l'll see if Rosalie wants to dance.
l'm sorry l'm late.
Doesn't matter.
Everything's perfect now.
Will you dance with me?
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)
Where have you been?
We were gonna put your face
on a milk carton.
Mostly northern Canada.
l think.
lt's weird to be back on two legs again,
in clothes.
Gotten out of practice
with the whole human thing.
Are you okay?
Being here?
Why? Afraid l'll trash your party?
(SOFT GROWLlNG)
You're not the only one.
You'd think l'd be used to telling you
goodbye by now.
Come on, you're not supposed to be
the one crying, Bella.
Everyone cries at weddings.
This is how l'm gonna remember you.
Pink cheeks.
Two left feet.
Heartbeat.
'Cause what,
soon l'm gonna be dead to you?
No.
l'm sorry.
l'm just trying to appreciate
your last night as a human.
Well, it's not my last night.
l thought you...
l didn't really wanna spend my honeymoon
writhing in pain.
What's the point?
lt's not like you're gonna have
a real honeymoon with him, anyway.
lt's gonna be as real as anyone else's.
That's a sick joke.
You are joking?
What? While you're still human?
You can't be serious, Bella.
Tell me you're not that stupid.
l mean, it's really none of your business.
-No! You can't do this!
-Jake.
-Listen to me, Bella.
-Jake, let me go!
Jacob, calm down, all right?
Are you out of your mind? Huh?
You'll kill her!
Walk away, Jake.
Enough, Jacob!
Stay out of this, Sam.
You're not gonna start something
that we'll have to finish.
She'll die.
She's not our concern anymore.
Let's go, Seth!
BELLA: l'm really, really, really stupid.
No, it's all right.
Come on, people are probably missing us.
Let's go back.
(ALL CHEERlNG)
So, he really won't tell you
where he's taking you?
No, it's a surprise.
(LAUGHS)
Well, wear a hat.
Sunscreen.
Take care of yourself.
l will.
Okay.
l love you, Bella.
l love you.
So much.
Thank you.
Everything's packed and ready to go.
Cool.
Oh.
-l'm gonna go see him.
-Yeah.
Dad.
(CHUCKLES QUlETLY)
Well...
lt's gonna be strange,
you not living under my roof.
Yeah.
lt's gonna be strange for me, too.
You know
it will always be your home, right?
l love you, Dad. Forever.
l love you, too, Bells.
l always have and l always will.
All right.
Go on.
You don't wanna miss your plane.
Wherever it's going.
(LAUGHS)
Okay.
Bye.
You ready?
(GUESTS CHEERlNG)
Yeah, l'm ready.

No, we're just passing through.
Are we close?
EDWARD: That's lsle Esme.
lt was a gift from Carlisle.
(SQUEALS)
ls this totally necessary?
l am nothing if not traditional.
You wanna take a look around?
You tired?
(SlGHlNG)
Do you wanna go for a swim?
Yeah, that sounds nice.
l could use a few human minutes.
Don't take too long, Mrs. Cullen.
(SlGHlNG) Okay.
(ROCK MUSlC PLAYlNG)
(EXHALlNG)
Okay.
She's a caged animal
London by night
Crashing lights and cymbals
Queens of twilight
And if I was you I'd use the loo
Before the long drive
We complement each other
Just like Satan and Christ
Baby, when I am laid to rest
May my laughter remain
Like your kiss blew me away
Answer your spirit
I gotta know right now
I see you before me
Won't you show me how?
Alice!
I wear my hair fizzy
I don't copy no style
But kissing and a-scrubbing
It has consequences
You're on the bus again
Past Big Ben
With your rip off Oyster card
(EXHALlNG)
Don't be a coward. (SCOFFS)
(ROMANTlC MUSlC PLAYlNG)
Gotas mnimas

You're so beautiful.

Tu vida...
(ROMANTlC MUSlC PLAYlNG)
(GlGGLlNG)
I've waited a hundred years
But I'd wait a million more
For you
(BOTH BREATHlNG HEAVlLY)
Nothing prepared me
for the privilege of being yours
lt's okay.
If I had only felt the warmth
within your touch
If I had only seen
how you smile when you blush
Or how you curl your lip
when you concentrate enough
I would have known what I was living for
What I've been living for
Your love is my turning page
Only the sweetest words remain
Every kiss is a cursive line
Every touch is a redefining phrase
I surrender who I've been for who you are
Nothing makes me stronger
than your fragile heart
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours
I would have known
EDWARD: How badly are you hurt?
What?
No, Bella, look.
Bella, l can't tell you how sorry l am.
l'm not.
Really, l'm not. l'm fine.
Don't say you're fine.
Just don't.
No, you don't.
Don't ruin this.
l've already ruined it.
Why can't you see
how perfectly happy l am?
Or was five seconds ago.
l mean, now l'm sort of pissed off, actually.
You should be angry with me.
l mean,
we knew this was gonna be tricky, right?
l think we did amazing.
l mean, it was amazing for me.
That's what you're worried about?
That l didn't enjoy myself?
l know it's not the same for you,
but for a human, l can't imagine
that it gets any better than that.
Last night
was the best night of my existence.
You're the best.
You're not gonna touch me again, are you?
You know that's not what l mean.
Let me make you breakfast.
(UPBEAT MUSlC PLAYlNG)
Dreamed last night about a time and place
Where from our troubles we had escape
I held your hand and I felt complete
As you turned and said to me
From now on
(LAUGHS)
From now on we'll be
You and me
(EDWARD FAKES SNORlNG)
We will be
From now on
From now on we'll be
You and me
You and me
We will be
(WHOOPS)
Only a dream
From now on
Only a dream
From now on
Only a dream
From now on
Only a dream
From now on
You and me, we will be
l win.
(LAUGHTER ECHOlNG)
Bella?
You having a nightmare?
No.
(SNlFFLlNG)
lt was just a dream.
lt was a really good dream.
Then why are you crying?
Because l wanted it to be real.
Tell me.
Bella, l can't.
Please.
JACOB: Maybe they'll say
she was in a car crash.
Or tripped and fell off a cliff.
PAUL: Keep it in play! Keep it in play!
Come on!
(PLAYERS LAUGHlNG)
Come on! Come on!
At least l'll get one thing out of it.
No, you won't.
Cullens are not a danger
to the town or the tribe.
Well, he's either gonna kill her
or change her.
-And the treaty says...
-l say, Jacob.
l say.
You know, if you wanted things different,
you should've become alpha.
Turning it down seemed like a good idea
at the time.
Jake, you really think you could kill Bella
if she comes back a vampire?
No, make one of us do it,
then hold a grudge against us.
Shut up, Leah.
Would you just get over it?
lt's not like you've imprinted on her.
At least they seem happy.
Yeah, some people are just lucky, l guess.
Lucky?
None of them
belong to themselves anymore.
And the sickest part is
their genes tell them they're happy about it.
Least if you imprinted on someone,
you'd finally forget about Bella.
l mean, being any kind of happy is better
than being miserable
about someone you can't have.
(CHATTlNG QUlETLY)
Bella, these are our housekeepers,
Gustavo and Kaure.
(SPEAKlNG PORTUGUESE)
This is my wife Bella.
Excuse me.
Well, l guess we just leave them to it.
What was that all about?
She's afraid for you.
Why?
Because l have you here all alone.
You mean she knows about you?
She suspects.
She's native Ticuna. They have legends
about blood-drinking demons
who prey on beautiful women.
(EXCLAlMlNG lN PORTUGUESE)

Hey, don't come in here.
You don't need to see this.

lt must have been the chicken.
Could you grab my bag?
What is it?
How many days has it been
since the wedding?
Fourteen. Why?
Will you tell me what's going on?
l'm late.
My period, it's late.
That's impossible.

Why? What's wrong? I just...
You just what?
Alice, what did you see?
-Here's Carlisle.
-CARLlSLE: Bella, what's going on?
l don't know. l'm a little worried.
Can vampires go into shock?
Has Edward been harmed?
No.
l know that it's impossible,
but l think that l'm pregnant.
Whoa!
Carlisle, l swear,
something just moved inside me.
-ls this even possible?
-I don't know.
What's he saying?
The sooner Bella's here,
the sooner we can find out what it is.
I need you to get to the mainland at once.
Yeah, yeah, l will.
Well?
Damn it.
(KNOCKlNG ON DOOR)
Kaure's making sure you're still alive.
(ROMANTlC MUSlC PLAYlNG)
Slow we paddle through the lake
Straight to the very center
Of the darkest water
Where we can embrace
The shadows on the surface
The eyes that look up lifeless
From our twins below
And though your arms and legs are under
Love will be the echo in your ears
When all is lost and plundered
My love will be there still
True, it's chilling to behold
Up close we stumble back...
(EDWARD AND KAURE ARGUlNG)
(SPEAKlNG PORTUGUESE)
What did you do with her?
What do you know about this?
l know that you are a demon!
You killed this little girl!
What?
Her people have legends.
She might have seen this before.
(SPEAKlNG PORTUGUESE)
Please.
Tell me how to help her.
You only do bad.
l am begging you.
l will do anything.
l love her.
Please.
Tell me how she can survive this.
Death.
l'm not gonna let it hurt you.
Carlisle will get that thing out.
Thing?
Wait here while we load.
-ROSALlE: Hello?
-Rosalie.
Bella?
-What's going on?
-l need your help.
Hey, Son.
What's going on?
Bella called him.
Hey, haven't seen you in a while.
-You okay?
-So, you finally heard from Bella?
They're extending their trip.
Seems she caught a bug.
They wanna wait until she feels better
before they travel.
She's sick.
Yeah, she told me not to worry,
but she sounded,
l don't know, off.
She'll be okay, Charlie.
Come on. Let's eat.
Jacob, let it go.
ls it true?
Hello, Jacob, how are you?
Listen, just give it to me straight.
BELLA: Jake, is that you?
-She's here?
-They came home two weeks ago.
Jake.
BELLA: l'm glad you came.
-Close enough.
-What's your problem?
BELLA: Rose, it's okay.
(SlGHS)
You look terrible.
Yeah, it's nice to see you, too.
So, are you gonna tell me
what's wrong with you?
Rose, you wanna help me up?
You did this!
We didn't know it was even possible.
-What is it?
-CARLlSLE: l'm not sure.
Ultrasounds and needles
won't penetrate the embryonic sac.
l can't see it, either.
And l can't see Bella's future anymore.
CARLlSLE: We've been researching legends,
but there isn't much to go on.
What we do know is that it's strong.
And fast-growing.
Why haven't you done anything?
Take it out of her!
This is none of your business, dog.
Rose!
All this fighting isn't good for Bella.
The fetus isn't good for Bella.
Say the word, Alice. "Baby."
lt's just a little baby.
Possibly.
Carlisle, you've gotta do something.
No.
lt's not his decision. lt's not any of yours.
Jacob, l need to talk to you.
l always knew you'd destroy her.
She thinks Carlisle can turn her
at the last minute,
like he did for me and Esme.
-Can he?
-Probability is slight.
And if her heart fails...
Look, Jacob,
l need you to do something for me.
(SCOFFS)
For her.
You have a connection with her
that l'll never understand.
Maybe you could talk to her,
change her mind.
You can keep her alive.
And if l can't?
lf she dies,
you get what you always wanted.
To kill me.
Rose, l'm fine, really.
-So, Edward sent you in here to talk to me?
-Sort of.
Though l can't figure out
why he thinks you'd listen to me.
l mean, you never have before.
(BOTH LAUGH)
Since when are you and blondie BFFs?
Rose understands what l want.
What are you thinking, Bella?
Seriously.
l know this seems like a scary thing,
but it's not.
lt's like this miracle or something.
l can feel him.
(SCOFFS)
So, it's a bouncing baby boy.
l'm sorry l didn't know.
Should've brought some blue balloons.
lt's just a guess.
When l picture him, l see a boy.
We'll see.
You won't.
Jake, l can do this.
-l'm strong enough.
-Come on.
You can spout that crap to your
bloodsucker, but you don't fool me.
l can see what that thing's doing to you.
lt's a killer, Bella.
-You're wrong.
-And when you die,
what was the point?
Of me loving you, you loving him.
How is that right for anyone?
Because l sure don't see it.
Listen to me, Bella.
Please.
Just don't do this.
Live, okay?
Please.
Jake, everything's gonna be okay.
Jacob, don't go.
l know how this ends.
And l'm not sticking around to watch.

BELLA: Jacob, don't go.

Do what you want.
How cool is this? Two-man pack.
Two against the world.
You're getting on my nerves, Seth.
l'll shut up. Can do.
Get ready.
They're coming for Bella.
They're not gonna touch her.
Agreed.
Man, l can smell them
from all the way out here.
What the hell are you doing here?
l'm not gonna let my little brother
get himself killed.
Go away, Leah! l can take care of myself.
That you think so
proves you need a babysitter.
Okay, would the both of you shut up?
Did Sam send you?
Sam doesn't even know l left.
(WOLVES HOWLlNG)
l think he just figured it out.
Jake.
l know what his plan is.
Sam's lost the element of surprise,
and he doesn't want
to take you on outnumbered,
so he's not gonna come at you head on.
He's got the place surrounded
and he'll wait for his opportunity.
We won't get through without a fight.
No fights.
We won't be the ones to break the treaty.
The treaty is void, at least in Sam's mind.
Not in ours.
Carlisle, no one's hunted for weeks.
We'll make do.
You've done us a great service, Jacob.
Thank you.
(WOLVES APPROACHlNG)
(GROWLlNG)
l know they're out there somewhere,
but l can't hear them anymore.
lt's so quiet.
l stopped hearing them, too,
the second l decided to leave.
lt's nice.
You know you can't stay here.
-But l don't have any place...
-l can't trust you with the Cullens.
You hate them too much.
You don't even like me.
l don't have to.
l just have to follow you.
Look, Seth doesn't want you here.
Neither do l.
Being unwanted isn't exactly
a new thing for me.
Look, l'll stay out of your way.
l'll do whatever you want,
except go back to Sam's pack and be the
pathetic ex-girlfriend he can't get away from.
You don't know how many times
l wished l could imprint on someone.
Anyone.
Just to break the connection.

-Edward.
lt's breaking her bones now.
lt's crushing you from the inside out.
Carlisle, tell her what you told me. Tell her.
Carlisle, tell me. lt's all right.
The fetus isn't compatible with your body.
lt's too strong.
lt won't allow you to get
the nutrition you need.
lt's starving you by the hour.
l can't stop it, and l can't slow it down.
At this rate, your heart will give out
before you can deliver.
Then l'll hold on as long as l can, and then...
Bella.
There are some conditions
that even venom can't overcome.
You understand?
l'm sorry.
Edward, l'm sorry.
l can't live without you.
You won't. You're gonna have a part of me.
He'll need you.
Do you honestly think that l could love it
or even tolerate it if it killed you?
lt's not his fault.
You have to accept what is.
Because you've given me no choice!
Bella, we're supposed to be partners,
remember?
But you decided this on your own.
You've decided to leave me.
Don't see it that way.
Well, l have no other way to see it.
'Cause it's me who'll lose you.
And l don't choose that.

Jacob just had an idea.
lt wasn't an idea. lt was a snide comment.
What were you thinking?
That it's probably just looking for someone
to sink its teeth into.
He's thirsty.
l know the feeling.
lf it's craving,
it's not gonna want animal blood.
l have some O negative laid aside for Bella.

You're gonna make her drink that?
lt's the fastest way to test the theory.
Only if you're comfortable with it.
l'll try anything.

This might make it a little easier to take.

Your pulse is already getting stronger.

-Well, you sound better.
-BELLA: l am.

This whole thing must've put a kink
in the honeymoon, huh?
You could say that.
Otherwise, married life treating you okay?
Edward still walks on water and all that?
Yeah, but, l mean, it is different now.
The important thing is that you're better.
And that you're coming home soon, right?
Okay, Dad, l don't want you to freak out,
but l'm going to a medical center
in Switzerland.
What? No, no, you're not.
You're not going to Switzerland.
What are you... You said you were better.
I am.
No, Bella. l'm getting on a plane. No.
No.
lt's really more of a spa.
And l'm sure that l'd be better
by the time you got there anyway.
Bells... l don't know.
Dad, don't come.
And picture me healthy,

eating pizza or something.
You want me to visualize?
They say that it helps.
Just picture me like that.

Bella...
(BREATH TREMBLlNG)

(LAUGHS)
Edward, what's going on?
He likes the sound of your voice.
You can hear him?

He likes my voice as well.
What?
What do you hear?
lt's so strange.

He's like you.

He's happy.
Of course you are.
Of course you're happy.

What do you hear now?
He loves you, Bella.
Oh, my gosh.
(EDWARD AND BELLA CHUCKLlNG)
Jacob.
So, that's the last of it?
Bella could deliver as early as tomorrow.
lf she's going to have any chance at all,
she'll need more blood.
And you need to feed.
You have to be at your strongest for her.
We need to go tonight.
Carlisle, you're the enemy now.
Sam won't hesitate. You will be slaughtered.
Emmett will come with us.
-That won't be enough.
-CARLlSLE: We have no choice, Jacob.
lf there's anything we can do to save her,
we have to try.
-You'd risk your lives for her?
-Of course we would.
Bella's a part of our family now.
Yeah.
l can see that.
This really is a family.
As strong as the one l was born into.
l know what l have to do.
SETH: Jake! They're coming.

We should phase, Jacob.
We can't protect ourselves like this.
They'll see it as a threat.

This isn't your territory anymore.
-How's the new family working out?

You coming home, Jake?

LEAH: What?
SETH: No way!

l want them safe.
And l want this over.

She hates them.

-=THE LAST FANTASY=-

(voice-mail) Hi, you've reached the office of Dr. Stuart Price.

Please note the office will be closed until the 24th.

If this is an emergency, please try...

(voice-mail) Hi! This is Dr. Stu Price. I'm getting married.

So I'll be out of the country for 2 weeks.

I'm not sure if I'll have cell service.

If this is a dental emergency...

Nothing.

(speaking in Thai)

Daddy, please! You're not helping!
I looked into his eyes. Not the eyes of a man.

The eyes of a coward.

(speaking in Thai again)

Excuse me!

- Bill! - Tracy!

- I'm sorry! - Where the hell are you?

It happened again!

Don't say that, please!

No this time we really fucked up.

Seriously! What is wrong with you three?

So much Trace, I don't even know where to begin.

Oh god! How bad?

- Like, no wedding bad? - Yeah...

a little worse than that.
THE HANGOVER PART II

ONE WEEK EARLIER

Uh, huh.

- You really need to floss more. - Fuck that! That's why I come here.

- Then you should come more than once every two years!
- Why? So you can bleed me of all my money?

I never charge you a dime, Phil!

- Hey, how do I work the nitrous? - Ah, you don't actually.

Come on! Just one hit!

Fillings look pretty good. Any other problems?

Yeah, actually. You're getting married in Thailand.

For starters, that's flights for me and Steph. That's two grand right there.

Then my mother in laws watching the kids. So now she's got this whole new thing over my head.

Plus, takes five days to get there.

It's a 16 hour flight. And it's beautiful when you get there.

- Whatever, it's a hassle! - It is kinda far.

Lauren's been there a week and she's still jet lagged.

But it's where her parents are from and it means a lot to them.

Who gives a shit about her parents! Her dad hates you!

He doesn't hate me! He's just never spoken to me...

...I think it's a cultural thing.

Why can't you just get married in Vegas like you did the last time. It's so much easier.

Why can't you just be excited for me?

This is my wedding!

- You're really happy, huh? - I really am.

Alright...

...I'm happy too.

- Thank you! - Gonna be fun.

Phil. Put the prescription pad back.

- Thank you. You know that's a felony right? - Fuck you, man!

- Was this right up against your scrotum? - Yep.

- Oh my god, I just realized. - What?

- I forgot to renew my passport! - Oh no...

Good thing I did it last week. It's in the kitchen drawer.

- You're the best! - Hey! We're a team!

You're a good guy. Like a really good guy!

Thank you!

- So I know you're not gonna get mad. - Mad? What, mad at what?

Alan found out that we're going to Thailand for Stu's wedding.

- So? - So he's heart broken Doug. You guys are like his family!

No. Your family is like his family.

All Alan talks about is the three of you.

- And that weekend. - Wait a second...

- Is he the one who keeps calling and hanging up?
- He does that when he's upset.

He doesn't understand why he's not invited.

Could you just run it by Stu? Just run it by him.

For me...

No fucking way! Absolutely not!

Come on Stu, it's killing him.

Honestly, the two of you were barely invited.

I get it. I really do. It's just, you know what...

Alan considers you to be one of his best friends.

I consider Alan to be insane.

Stu, throw him a bone! We've already said he's got to pay for everything he eats and everything he breaks.

You know what. We should see if we can squeeze the old man to cover the bachelor party.

- That's good. - I'm glad you brought that up.

- Because... this is the bachelor party! - What?

- What are you talking about? - Yeah, it's my bachelor brunch!

Go crazy. Get some chocolate chip pancakes... a lap dance from the waitress...

That's bullshit! You can't just skip out of a bachelor party, Stu.

You see that? That's orange juice with a napkin on top.

Do you know why? So nobody roofies me.

Why I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe at a bachelor party?

- C'mon Stu. Don't you think you're over reacting? - No, I don't.

I'm still putting the pieces of my broken psyche back together.

And you know what the glue is? Lauren! I'm not doing anything to screw that up.

- Oh, please. You wouldn't even be with her if it wasn't for us. - Oh, this'll be good.

Stu, think about it!

You ended up ditching Melissa, and two years later you met your true soul mate.

You take Vegas out of that equation, you would have married a cunt.

Oh that's ok. I'm allowed to say it. It's a bachelor party.

Drink up everybody.

Oh wait, there's no alcohol! I forgot we're at a fuckin IHOP!

Well it's my decision and it's final, so...how bout a toast?

This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.

- C'mon Phil, where you going? - Doug, Doug, I just don't get it!

He's getting married in Thailand! That's great for him, but what about us?

You're selfish! Come on, sweetheart...

Shame on you!

Don't worry Stu. I will stand up for you no matter what.

Thank you.

But you gotta help me out with this Alan thing.

Guys, I can't tell you how much this means...

Alan's been waiting for the invite ever since he got word of the wedding.

- I'm sure he has. - Yeah.

Been standing outside by the mailbox every day.

- Well that's tough. - Yeah.

I uh, I'm not sure he ever left Vegas.

He really needs this.

What?

Sweetie, papa! You have visitors! Go in slowly.

Give him a chance to acclimate.

- Hey, Alan! - Hey, guys! Hey, Phil!

Hey, bud!

- You guys wanna come in? - Sure. Absolutely.

- Hey. - Hey.

- Hey, Stu! - Ok. See you on the court in half...

- Pretty cool room, Alan! - Thanks, Phil! My dad pays my rent.

Alan, what the fuck! You were supposed to delete these!

You made a promise!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

What the hell? I'm not cool with this at all. You can't have these.

Relax, Stu! Nobody ever comes in here.

- A total violation of trust! - Mother I'm done with my lunch. It's just sitting here!

I'm sorry, honey. I'll be right up.

- I can't believe you guys stopped by. This is really cool. - Wait a second!

- Al, is that Mr. Chow? - Yeah. We still keep in touch.

Stu!

Chow, the guy that kidnapped us?

He didn't kidnap us. He kidnapped Black Doug.

Remember? It was a whole big misunderstanding.

He's actually quite charming.

- Alan, he's a criminal. - Excuse me, boys!

- Hi, Linda! - Hi, Dougie!

I guess we don't do desert anymore. I didn't get that memo.

I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

Would a cupcake kill you?

- You know, I don't think this was a good idea.
- Alan, we have a little surprise for you.

Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

- Well only if you're not busy. - Stu!

Well maybe the Jonas Brothers are in town.

Nope. They're in Raleigh-Durham that weekend.

Are you really being serious, Stu? You're inviting me?

Yeah why not? It's gonna be fun, right?

- Phil, are you going? - Of course!

Then it will be fun.

What the fuck are you doing, man?

It's my immunizations. It's the last day I can do it.

That's supposed to be done by a registered nurse.

I'm a nurse. Just not registered.

Stu, look at this! I bought this cause I thought of you!

- Hey, there he is! - Hey, Stu!

- Teddy! What's up? How are ya? - Hey Stu.

- Alright. Who's this guy, Stu? - This is Teddy. Lauren's little brother.

Goes to Stanford. Pre-med. This is Phil, Alan and Doug.

Hey, nice to meet you, man!

Wow, Stanford? How old are you?

- He's 17. Kind of a genius. - Actually, I'm 16.

I'm not a genius. My dad just had me take the entrance exams early.

Because you're a genius.

- So what are you, a doctor? - No, not yet. I'm premed.

- Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser? - Yeah.

- Well, he turned out to be a gay. - Alan.

It's true, I read it in Teen People.

Right, ok... well I'm gonna grab a book or something for the plane. You guys want anything?

- No, thanks. I'm good. - I would actually love a small water.

Cool.

- What's the matter with you. He's 16 years old. - Yeah, Alan. Take it easy!

I'm a little confused. Is he here just to see us off or what. How does this work?

- How does what work? - Is that person coming to the wedding?

Yes Alan. My brides little brother is coming to the wedding. Is that ok with you?

Well, it's the first time I've heard of it. You could have paged me.

Don't over react. It's gonna be fine.

- Hey. Mind if I sit? - Wolf pack only. Find another chair.

- There's no wolfpack, Alan. C'mon. - It's no problem. I'll find...

- Teddy, don't be ridiculous! You're sitting here! - Careful, that's a Louis...

That is a Louis Vuitton!

- That's a nice neck roll! - Thanks! You can use it if you want.

Ok.

Baby!

This is so absolutely beautiful! Thank you much!

Of course.

Between Teddy and me, you must be pretty excited. Pretty soon you'll have 2 doctors in the family.

You have to realize that in my country we don't consider dentists to be real doctors.

Dad...

Ok.

Anyway I have to go and talk to Teddy about his cello performance tonight.

Ouch!

I'm so sorry...

Your dad's kind of obsessed with your brother, isn't he?

Teddy is my dad's prize possession. It's always been that way.

He'll warm up, I promise! Okay?

You can just fax it over to me. I'll pick it up at the concierge.

Thanks, papa! Bye bye!

That was my dad. I'm a stay at home son.

We were discussing your wedding gift. He's sparing no expense.

Oh... That's so unnecessary.

I've been meaning to ask someone. I notice this is a fishing village.

Is there a Long John Silver's on the island?

You know. No, I don't think so. I'm so sorry.

But, we are actually serving some great fresh seafood.

- Better than Long John's? - Yes.

- I'll be the judge of that. Enjoy your evening. - You too. Ok.

All right!

Thank you, Teddy!

The hands of a brilliant musician!

And one day, a great surgeon.

I admit it...

When I first met Stu, I was not quite sold.

He seemed unattractive. He lacked intelligence and imagination.

He was missing the spark you look for in a man.

But then I looked into Stu's eyes.

It reminded me of my sweet brother, Chai Yo.

For those who do not know, Chai Yo is learning the sailboat and lives in a group home.

But Chai Yo loves "khao" .

And that's when I realized, Stu is "khao".

What is "khao"?

"Khao" is soft white rice in luke warm water.

It has no taste.

We feed it to small baby and uh, very old people.

It is nourishment that everyone can digest.

The world needs "khao", just as the world needs people like Stu.

To my sweet daughter and Stu! Congratulations!

Cheers!

And now I believe that Teddy has something to say.

Sit down! I got this. Sit down, boy!

That was a.. a great speech, sir!

I like the comparison between Stu and rice.

I've also prepared a few words.

Hey everybody. Here's some fun facts.

The population in Thailand is 63 million people.

It is twice the size of Wyoming.

It's chief exports are textiles, footwear and rice.

Each year approximately 13,000 people are killed in car accidents in Thailand.

- The climate in Thailand... - Alan!

- Why don't you skip to the last card there, buddy. - Okay. Sorry!

None of you know Stu like I do.

Not you... not you... not you...

Not nobody knows Stu like I do.

No one!

I can't even tell you what we've been through cause we made a pact.

More important than blood.

What I can tell you is this. This is not Stu's first marriage.

There was a whore in Las Vegas a couple of years ago.

Sit down...

- Enough! He'll get over it! - Okay. Thanks, Phil!

In your face!

Well that was exactly as painful as I expected it to be.

Sorry...

- Oh, rice pudding! What are you doing? - HaHa. Very funny!

Be nice, Phil! He's extra sensitive tonight.

Get over it! He's your father in law. He's supposed to hate you.

Come have a drink with me and the guys.

You know... I'm really exhausted. We're just gonna go upstairs and crash.

C'mon, I just spoke with the manager. He's gonna let us have a bonfire on the beach.

That sounds fun!

- Nyah... I'm good. - He's tired!

Stu, one drink with your friends who came all this way.

- I just wanna hang out with you! - Oh c'mon. Just go! And do me a favor.

Take Teddy with you. He never gets to have any fun.

That is a great idea. Bring the kid.

- Alright. One drink! - Perfect.

- See you later. - Have fun!

- You have the key? - Yep, got it right here!

I'll see you in 20 minutes!

My uncle Roger said that he once saw an albino polar bear.

Really? Polar bears are white. How would he know if it's an albino?

This one was black.

Did you ever think maybe it was just a black bear?

Whatever...

Ok. Here we go. American beer.

- Sealed bottle! - Thank you. Alright!

- I'm not really old enough to drink. - Yeah, it's illegal.

Would be a shame if somebody reported you.

Nobody's reporting anybody. It's fine Teddy. Have a little fun.

Careful!

What is this? Instant marshmallows? Nice touch!

- That was Alan's idea. - Good thinking, Al!

You know... I gotta hand it to you, Stu! This place is paradise.

Not bad, right?

And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually jealous of you.

- I mean, Lauren is an angel. - Yeah, she really is amazing.

Wow, you guys are sweet.

Not big breasts on her. But still, solid rack for an Asian.

- Sorry, Teddy, but it's true. - That's ok.

That is just wildly inappropriate.

And yet... I'm really glad you're here. All you guys. Even you Alan.

It means a lot that you made the trip. Thank you.

- Wouldn't have missed it buddy. - Great!

Now. Can we have our one fucking beer, dad?

Alright. Toast! C'mon stand up guys.

Come over here, Alan!

To Lauren and Stu!

- You did it, buddy. - Sure did.

Cheers!

What the hell...

What?

Phil...

I think it happened again.

- Alan, what the fuck did you do? - I didn't do anything. I swear to god.

Your hair is gone.

No, no... up.

Where the fuck are we?

Phil, I'm scared.

Stu, c'mon get up! We got a situation.

- Oh, holy shit! - Where are we?

- Oh my god, Alan. Your head. - No your head!

- Is it bald? - Stu, you're gonna freak out, but it's gonna be ok.

- Why? Was it my teeth? - Nope, it's not your teeth.

- Are you sure? - Yep.

Can you see the bottom?

Oh my god! What the fu...ck

That's good. Why don't you try to wash it off.

It's not coming off. This is a real tattoo!

- Alan, what did you do! Did you Roofie me? - I didn't do anything!

Stu, he swore to god!

What happened?

Get it off of me!

- What the hell? - It's a monkey.

What a cute little mask. Hi little monkey.

Alan...

Phone! Alan, go find the phone!

I got it!

- Doug, where the hell are you? - I'm at breakfast. By the pool.

- You guys coming down or what? - Oh Jesus. Thank god. Doug's fine.

- Stu, Doug's fine. He's at the resort. - Why aren't we at the resort.

What's going on? Where are you guys?

I do not know, man! We woke up in some shit hole room in some city.

- Oh god. What city? - I don't know, Doug!

Fuckin Asia-town.

- I do not know, I told you. - Where are we?

- Hey Stu. - What?

Check this out.

Ever seen anything like this?

- What is that? - Careful. Might be a spiders nest.

I've tangled with those before.

I don't get it man. We each had one beer last night, right? I mean you too!

- Yeah but I left early, remember? - I don't remember shit!

Tracy wasn't feeling well. She came down to get me.

- Wait and second. Is Teddy with you guys? - Teddy? What? What are you talking about?

He wasn't in his room. They've been looking for him all morning.

- Teddy went to Stanford, right? - Yeah. Why?

Fuck!

- I just found his finger! - What?

- I just found his fucking finger, Doug! - Phil, what is going on?

Alright. Alright, alright... this is what we're gonna do.

You tell the girls that we woke up early and went on a fishing trip, ok. And that's where we are.

- Right. - Right, stay by the phone!

Shit!

Uh, we got a little bit of a problem.

What is that?

We don't know.

- Is it a worm? - It's a mushroom.

Yeah, shiitake.

Monkey, taste it! Is it shiitake?

- He can't understand you. - He just did.

- Why is he pulling on it? - He's probably hungry.

Wait a second. Is that...

What the fuck man. Tell that gay monkey to leave my shit alone.

Chow?

You're fucking crazy.

It's so fucking light in here! Alan, grab me my sunglasses!

- It's great to see you, Leslie! - Nice to see you too my little popo.

Chow, what the fuck are you doing here?

Alan called me a few days ago and invited me to the wedding.

- Excuse me? - What, he's my plus one.

You don't have plus one. It's $200 a plate.

Guys, guys. Just focus, ok. -Chow, what happened?

You guys texted me, said you're fucked up and looking to party.

I picked you up on my boat and I brought you here to Bangkok.

But we had a sick night, bitches!

Wait a second Chow, we're in Bangkok?

Holler, city of squalor.

- Do you know how I got this tattoo? - Uh, yeah from a fucking tattoo guy!

Come on Stu, use that big Jewish brain.

What's the monkey holding?

- That's a finger! - Stu, I got some bad news.

Teddy was with us last night. That's his finger.

- Teddy's dead? - Teddy's not dead! He partied with us all night!

- Well then where is he? - Don't you remember anything?

- No! - No, nothing, Chow.

Ok I explain it all, ok?

Just let me do one bump, get my head straight. Come to papa.

That's a big...

You ready for craziest fucking story ever...

Chow!

Hey Chow, you okay?

You gotta be kidding me.

Fuck, he's dead!

- Help! - Stu!

- Help! - Stu, shut up!

- Call an ambulance! - Shut up! He's dead!

Look if someone comes and finds a dead body and a pile of cocaine...

We're gonna spend the rest of our fucking lives in a Thai prison.

Alan! Please don't cry!

Alright. Alright. I just need a second to figure this out.

ICE MACHINE LOCATED ON 15TH FLOOR.

Look, this is the worst idea, ever.

What the fuck is this place?

Bangkok is the capital of Thailand. Its population is 12 million people...

Alan, will you help!

- The elevator! - I'll get the button!

- What the fuck is the deal with this monkey? - That monkey gets it!

- Come on! - Fuck no!

The powers out. We gotta take the stairs.

- Oh fuck! - Come on!

Here it is!

Feet first. I've done this before.

Careful!

- Stu! - What?

- We still have to find Teddy! - Oh god.

The roof!

Teddy!

- You guys see him? - No!

He's not here.

I can't believe this is happening again.

Ok, look. We'll handle this. You get back there.

You tell them that Alan and I got drunk with him, we're still partying.

- You gotta go get married! - No! Not going back without Teddy!

He's Lauren's little brother. He's lost, he's injured.

If I fuck this up, I have to lose everything.

Ok.

Alright.

- Alan, check your pockets! - What?

You know the drill. C'mon there might be clues.

- Check your phones! Numbers, texts. - That's a good idea!

- I got nothing. Fuck! - I got an text from Chow.

- What time? - Uh, 10 o'clock last night.

- What's it say? - "On my way, Niggahs"

Oh, Niggahs... ok... hip hop.

We are so... fucked!

Hey Phil! Look who's back!

We gotta get you out of the sun. You're too hot.

Phil, I really think we should go to the American Consulate.

For what? To report a dead body we shoved into an ice machine?

What are we gonna do? Keep walking around in circles? Cause that's real productive.

You know I'm trying to figure this thing out here and your attitude is not helping.

I'm sorry. It's a 100 degrees and we don't have a plan.

And all we've done is buy him hats and sodas.

-What, it's a bag of Fanta! - Alright, what do you want to do, Stu?

I don't know!

Well then stop yelling at me like it's my fuckin fault.

It is your fault!

All I wanted was a bachelor brunch.

Shit! Shut up! It's Doug! Talk to me!

I just got off the phone with Bangkok PD. They've got him. He's ok.

Oh thank god! Doug found him.

- What happened? - He got arrested.

- Arrested? For what? - Disorderly conduct.

- Seriously? - Yeah! He's ok though.

They'll release him to you. No questions asked. No one has to know.

He's at the Ratra Wang police station.

Ok. I'll call you when we get there.

Teddy's in jail, but he's fine. We gotta get a cab.

- Ok! - Alright!

- Yes, I have his paperwork here. - Okay.

- He has been treated. - Sounds good.

We're good. They've processed him for release.

They put him in the drunk tank. He's fine.

Sixteen years old and spent a night in jail. Can you imagine?

Haha! We love to party.

Here we go!

- Wait who's this fuckin guy? - Teddy Sisay.

No, no, no, no. That's the wrong guy! Sir!

Excuse me.. I'm sorry. Officer. You brought the wrong guy. That's not Teddy!

Of course it is! We have his ID's and everything!

These were in his pocket when we made the arrest.

They were in his pocket?

Excuse me, sir! How did you get this stuff?

Hello?

Teddy doesn't speak. We tried English, Thai, Chinese... Nothing.

Let me ask you something.

Does he look like he works out at Bally Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?

Look. We arrest a lot of people. We cannot analyze everything.

- What do you expect us to do with this guy? - Not my problem!

Hey guys, I think he knows us. Hi. Hello.

Do you know where our friend is, Teddy? He's missing!

- Stu, forget it. The guys worthless. - He knows something!

He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.

Maybe he just doesn't understand. I'll act it out. Yeah, like charades. Watch.

- Two words. - Is it a movie?

This is not for you, Alan!

- American teenager... in Asia. - Karate Kid, with Jaden Smith.

It's easy cause you're talking to him.

Stu, it's a waste of time! Just leave this fucking guy here.

Here's something. There are 500 thousand monks living in Thailand.

It is not uncommon for some monks to take a vow of silence, at the age of eight.

There you go.

- Anything else in that envelope? - Nah, it's empty.

Woah, hang on. A drink card from White Lion bar in Bangkok?

Worth a shot.

Jesus christ! Is this the right street?

That's what it says.

- Whoa! This is the White Lion! - What the fuck happened here?

Holy shit!

(yelling in Thai)

- Let's... - We should probably...

That's ok.

What the fuck is going on here?

- Whoa, guys. Check it out! - Holy shit! Stu, look!

That's my face. Go, go go! Nice work, Alan!

- Hello? - Be with you in a minute!

- Excuse me. - Oh, look who it is!

- So what do ya think? - What, I'm sorry?

- The tattoo. You love it? - Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.

- No refunds. Get the fuck out! - Wait a second!

Read the sign!

NO REFUNDS. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

We don't want any refunds. We just have a couple of questions.

We're trying to figure out what went down last night.

What went down? Take a look at what you did outside. Half the neighborhood went down.

- We did that? - You don't remember getting into a bar fight at the White Lion?

- Starting a full on fuckin riot? - Sir, we don't remember anything.

Oh boy...

Check this out!

Oh shit!

Fuck the Police!

There's Teddy! He was with us!

Jesus christ!

That's when the cops arrived and started cracking skulls.

I took you guys and hid you in the shop here.

Then you decided to get a tattoo. You cried like a little bitch.

This kid is fucking nine years old. He's got balls twice your size.

- Show him your balls, Nao! - No, no, no. That's ok.

Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy. Have you seen him?

Not since last night. Why? What happened?

Yeah, I'm supposed to marry his sister tomorrow and we kinda lost him.

- Oh well. Then fuck it! - What do you mean, fuck it?

Bangkok has him now and she'll never let him go.

- You hear that, huh? Is this what you wanted? You happy now?

You're wasting your time. These monks take their vow shit seriously.

Look at this. That's the sign of the Chang Mai Monastery, just outside of town.

Maybe somebody over there can get him to talk.

- Ok, can we just go over this one more time? You got the beer from...

- The hotel bar. They gave me a sealed case. - Right.

- But, who gave it to you? - The bartender.

And then you brought em out and I opened them.

Yeah and Doug had one and he was fine so it's not the beer.

- So what the hell happened? - I have no idea!

Hey guys. Check it out. He's got a Chinese boner.

Alan, come on! Cut it out!

- That is so wrong! - Don't stop monkey, keep doing it.

When a monkey nibbles on a penis it's funny in any language!

Keep doing it!

Alright, thank you!

Bye Shannon! Bye Little Wayne!

Wow! So beautiful!

What is this, a PF Chang's?

Ah, they're meditating.

- Such a peaceful people! - Yeah.

- Knock, knock! Hello! - Alan! Show some respect!

- Don't get up guys. - We brought one of your guys back.

He's really funny. He's really nice and cool.

Hi, how you doing. You the one in charge?

- Excuse me... ow... Wait! - Stop it! Calm down!

Hold on. It's because we're talking.

God damn it! Oh! Stop!

Wait it's me!

Oh I get it.

No talk! No talk! Shh.. Ok...

Ok.

Late last night, you climbed the walls of our monastery.

Shouting out questions about love, marriage and the meaning of life.

Poor brother Han was meditating alone in the garden.

- And you took him. - Oh my god!

- We kidnapped a monk. - We live an alternative life style.

We are so sorry about that, but we weren't ourselves last night.

Yep, things kinda spun outta control a little bit. But there's a boy who's missing and hurt.

Can you find out if he knows where our friend is?

Brother Han took a vow of silence many years ago.

It would be useless to try.

Well maybe he can write down what happened, on a piece of paper?

Actually Phil, that would be cheating. Isn't that right, Grand Wizard.

- Alan! - I'm afraid fatty is right.

See?... What?

None of us will ever know what brother Han knows.

Oh, alright. Well, so much for holy people. Bunch of bald assholes. C'mon, let's go.

Hey you know what! FYI! You may want to put some signs up that say no talking...

- ...before you unleash your dragon. - Yeah, that was a little rough.

And "your welcome" for bringing him back safe.

- You know we found him in the drunk tank. - Yeah well we did take him in the first place.

- C'mon guys, let's go. - Wait!

The Buddha teach, every memory lives somewhere deep within.

Perhaps you should bring your question to the Garden of Meditation.

- Did you understand a word he just said? - Yeah, yeah. About two thirds.

He said something about the Garden of Meditation?

No, he said he's farting because of his medication.

I get that.

It's a waste of time. I don't remember anything. Do you?

No. I got nothing. Alan?

Alan!

"Every memory lives somewhere deep within"

- Sweetie. - What?

You have visitors.

- Hey, Alan! - Hey, guys!

- Hey, Phil. - Hey buddy!

Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

- Is this true, Stuart? - Yeah, why not. It'll be fun.

Fuck!

- For Lauren and Stu! - Cheers!

- Chow! - We had a sick night bitches!

Alan, what the fuck!

Is that person coming to the wedding?

- There is no wolfpack. - Alan, Alan, don't do that!

And finally...

The three best friends anyone could have.

Fuck the Police!

I know where to go.

- What do you think, Alan? - This is the place.

C'mon. Let's go.

I don't remember any of this!

- Yeah Alan, you sure this is the place? - Yeah, pretty sure.

Rose! Harmony!

Is he coming or what? I've been waiting all day for him.

- I'm sorry. Waiting for who? - Chow, that dick ass fuck!

- Why? What's wrong? - Nothings wrong.

Ok, good. Look at this. Look what I bring for him. Check it out, huh.

- No, no! - $ 6,000 American.

Wow looks so real!

Sorry!

- Alan, what the fuck! - It's ok. The gun, it's very sensitive.

Everybody ok?

Ok, then get the fuck back to work! Come on. Music, please!

Where is my 6,000 dollars?

6,000? No, no, no. This is Chow's deal. We got nothing to do with that.

Un-fucking believable.

This guy, if he backs out again, the shits gonna catch up with him.

He's made a lot of enemies in this town, and now they're gonna be your enemies.

That's not fair!

Ok listen. We're just looking for a little kid.

- 2,000 dollars. - What!

I don't know, maybe more. How young you want this kid to be?

No, no! Sorry, you misunderstood. We're looking for our friend... 16 years old.

- Teddy. - Teddy?

- Yeah he was here with you guys last night. - He was?

Do you know if he left with us?

I don't know. You were in the corner all night with Kimmy.

- I didn't see you leave. - Kimmy?

- Is she here? - Yes, she's in the back. She just came for her shit.

Go and talk to her.

Alright, listen. I'm sorry about everything that happened.

Listen to me, ok? Pay attention to what I'm going to talk to you know.

When you see Chow, you tell him Samir says "Hello".

Okay!

But do it like that, ok! "Hello" like threatening. Like, ironic.

- "Hellooo" - Okay!

Go away! Go away!

Of course I remember him. He was buying shots for everyone.

Nice kid! His parents must be so proud.

You have no idea.

Ok, so do you remember if he left with us?

Yeah, you were all leaving together, but you almost forgot this one right here.

Right, super star?

This one was following me around like a little puppy dog. All night.

Saying he'd fallen in love with me. Asked me to marry him.

Classic Stu!

- We didn't get married, did we? - Course not!

We just had some fun in the Chardonnay room.

- What happens in the Chardonnay room? - Let's just stay on task.

I danced for him. He tickled me. We had sex.

- Fuck! - It's ok. You're not married yet.

- No big deal. - It's cheating!

No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.

It's a violation of my moral code.

Don't be sad. Stu you loved it. You were crying, saying how special it was.

- Wait! I'm sorry. He was crying? - What a baby. He was crying.

You should have seen him. He was so sexy. The way he moved around.

I had to ask him to slow down so I didn't drop my load too quick.

- Load? What load? - Oh, you know... My sperms.

I think your English is off. You're talking about my sperm!

- Where would your sperm come from? - From my balls!

- Hold on! Back up! - Wait... Are you...

Hey. You're in Bangkok, sweetie.

- There's a reason they don't call it "Bang-cunt". - Oh!

- Oh god! - Wow.

I don't get it. Is this a magic show?

Come on, Stu, it was beautiful. We climaxed at the same time.

How's that work?

Shoot my load into you. Shoot your load on the floor.

- Ok! - You ruined me. Ruined bottom.

Oh god!

- Stu! It's not the end of the world. - Sorry, but I'm so confused.

I made love to a man... with boobies.

Listen. I promise you no ones ever gonna find out about this.

But we found out about it.

And then we forget. That's what we do!

I do so much fucked up shit. And I just forget about it.

- Yeah? - Yeah! Just forget! It goes away!

That might be harder to go away, but in time it'll happen.

I certainly do. Just gonna forget about it.

- Never happened. - Great!

Phone! Phone! Who is it? Answer!

Lauren's dad. He just reminded me...

- Answer it! - I can't.

What! He might know something about Teddy. C'mon we still have a shot here.

Get your head back into the fucking game, Stu!

Hello?

Who takes an all day fishing trip the day before a wedding?

- Yeah, I guess that is kinda stupid. - Put Teddy on the phone.

- Teddy's seasick actually. - Seasick?

- Teddy's been a Maritime cadet since he was nine. - That's weird, cause he's puking everywhere.

I'm gonna tell you something that you do not know.

- I don't like you. - Yeah,I knew that already.

If my daughter chooses you, that's her problem.

This is ??. Hey it's Phil Winnick!

Listen, I apologize. We've been reelin in some crazy Marlin and I just wanna say...

Phil!

- Jesus! - Phil!

Fuck me!

- Give us back our monkey! - What monkey? Get your own monkey!

Come on, you asshole, the fucking monkey!

Come on!

Anytime, Alan. He's pointing a gun at us!

This is our monkey!

No one's getting shot over a fucking monkey!

Hand him over, now!

God, I've never given him no monkeys.

No, no ...

Hey Phil, check it out. He's got a banana on his helmet. He's the real deal.

What the fuck's happening?

Hold on! How did this happen? Do you know where our friend is?

- Yeah. Sixteen years old. Asian kid. - (says something in Russian?)

No, I don't understand what you said! No, I didn't understand!

What'd he say?

He said fuck you and your questions!

- Oh, my arm! - Philip, are you okay?

Oh I got shot! Fuck! Fuck this!

It's alright, Phil! It's alright!

We'll figure this out and get the monkey back, I promise.

Who gives a fuck about the monkey!

- What the fuck is going on? - Stu, am I gonna be ok? You're a doctor.

I don't know, let me look!

What?

Don't look at it!

Stuart Price! Get your ass back over here!

- You got shot! - I know!

- Whoa, you all right? - Yeah, I'm ok.

Actually, bullet just grazed my arm. Eight stitches.

Only cost six dollars. How is that even possible?

How's any of this even possible?

If I was a foot to my left, Stu, I'd be dead.

What are we gonna do?

I'm sorry guys. This wasn't part of the plan.

- What plan, Alan? - I've said too much already.

Alan! What plan?

- It's all Teddy's fault. - What are you talking about, Alan?

Why is he even here? He's not part of the wolf pack!

- Alan, what did you do? - It's not my fault!

Teddy shouldn't have been sharing from his bag.

- What bag? - The marshmallows.

I had a separate bag just for Teddy.

But it was dark and it was hard to keep track.

And then, you almost sat on em. I couldn't tell which was which.

- It was mayhem! - What did you do to the marshmallows, Alan?

Alan, what did you do?

Isn't it obvious?

I spiked them with muscle relaxers. And plus my ADHD medication.

- What? - You drugged us again?!

Not you! I just wanted to knock out Teddy for a little while
so we could finally enjoy the weekend.

Enjoy the weekend? Alan, you told me that you didn't do anything!

Alan, you swore to god!

I just wanted things to stay the same.

Like at my face! You ruined my life!

You're not my friend!

Don't say that, Phil! You're serious? Even in America?

- Yes! - Oh God! Don't say that, Phil!

- Don't start crying, Alan! - You're the bearded devil!

You liked it! You smiled at me when I handed you the bag with marshmallows.

Because I like marshmallows, you fucking psycho!

Hey! Whoa! Hold on!

Enough!

- Why, Alan? Why? - Stu!

Because we're the three best friends, remember?

Remember?

Stu, that's enough...

Guys, we can't fall apart now. We gotta stick together.

- Alan, what's that written on your belly? - What? Huh?

Lebua Hotel, Saturday six pm.

- You write that? - No!

Shit, that's in 20 minutes.

What about England, Phil? Will we still be friends there?

Alan, I already told you. It was in the heat of the moment. We're still friends. All over the world.

- Even Great Britain? - Yeah.

What about you, Stu?

We'll see.

Gentlemen, follow me.

Here you go.

Well. About time! Sit down.

Come on, sit.

Wow, you guys look like shit.

- Uh, do we know you? - Hey!

Take off your fuckin hat. You're in a restaurant for christs sake. C'mon.

Ok, listen. We have no clue what's going on here.

You know, they sell a Plum whiskey here, it's fuckin unreal.

Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up! Oh, I'm sorry. You guys already got fucked up, didn't you.

- Uh, listen, I'm a little confused. How did you... - You know what? I am a little fuckin confused!

Where's Chow? With the fuckin account code and the fuckin password!

We don't know anything about any codes. We're just trying to find our friend.

- Teddy? - Yes! Teddy! Have you seen?

Hmm, let's see...

There's Teddy!

Holy shit! It's from last night.

- Who are you? - I'm a businessman.

And I've invested a large chunk of capital in your friend Chow.

And in return, he was supposed to transfer my profits electronically.

About five fuckin minutes ago.

So last night, we took Teddy as insurance.

- Oh my god! Is he okay? - Oh my god, I wasn't done talking.

You tell Chow, that we are having breakfast on the roof of this hotel...

...tomorrow morning at eight am.

Or if he makes the transfer, you will get Teddy.

If not well then hey, you know... it's Bangkok.

That's your cue to get the fuck out of here.

Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.

Alan leave the hat.

Atta boy.

We're fucked! Chow's dead. What do we do now?

The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow, Stu. This whole things about a fucking bank account.

Let's just go back to the hotel. We'll search Chow's body.

Hopefully the password's in his wallet or something.

- And what if it isn't? - He's gonna kill Teddy.

Just relax. We have until 8am tomorrow to figure it out.

First the monkey and now my hat. How much worse can this day get.

Jesus christ!

Well we're livin here in Alan town. And he's drivin our lives into the ground.

When we woke up we were wasted and drunk.

Phil got shot. We got beaten by a monk.

I was happy, and my life was good.

Getting married like a dentist should.

Roasting marshmallows on a stick.

I got fucked in the ass... by a girl with a dick.

Oh yeah, I will remember that.

And we're livin in Alan town.

There's water everywhere.

Yeah it's cause it melted, Stu. The fuckin powers out.

With an inadequate electrical grid, serving millions of people

Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages per year.

Seriously, Alan. That's enough!

Out of the way!

We got it.

Oh my god!

Chow, calm down!

- You put the chill on me? - No, no!

It's okay.

Relax!

It's just us. Breathe!

It was so cold.

- We're gonna warm you up. - I was so cold!

- You did good, buddy. You did good. - I did good.

Feelin better?

- Alright, you warm enough? - I don't know.

Come feel my bowels and tell me.

I've been locked in a fuckin ice box all day!

Hey Alan, if you want my sunglasses...

...just ask Chow. You don't have to kill me.

Chow, nobody killed you. You were already dead. You didn't have a pulse.

Oh, you never do blow before?

Sometimes your heart stop... start up again.

- Read a book! - Look I'm sorry. We're having a bad day.

Oh, you're having a bad day! Did you die?

- I got shot! - But did you die?

Chow, some guy told us that you got a bank code or something...

...and if we don't bring it to him first think in the morning...

...he's gonna kill Teddy.

Who, Kingsley? He harmless. Don't worry. I got the bank codes.

Great! Alright, we gotta meet him at 8am. -Who is that fuckin guy, anyway?

- An investor in my business. - Yeah, what business is that?

It's called "not your business" ok!

- Oh, where's the monkey? - The monkey...

Yeah I put the account number and password in his vest. Where is he?

- Why would you do that? - Safe keeping, pretty boy.

I got a lotta heat on my ass. I got FBI, Bangkok PD, Interpol, MSNBC...

That little monkey snorting coke with me all night...

Jerkin me off while I watched Stu make fuckin lady boy.

- He not going anywhere. - We don't have the monkey, Chow.

Oh, some Russian thugs took him from us.

Oh you fucking guys!

Okay. No problem. We just have to get him back.

- From where? - From the same place we took him from.

This monkey isn't just normal monkey.

Every night, monkey drug mule.

He take coke to buyer...

And deliver cash to dealer. He is middle man.

Dealer never handle drug directly.

He clean.

- That's terrible. - Not terrible. What he talking about. Fucking genius.

You ever see monkey go to jail?

We just take the monkey for deal, he come
close, we take his vest. That's that.

- We get some blow too, you know... bump. - No, no more bumps, Chow.

This is ridiculous.

Stu, Mr. Chow can't whistle. Shake your monkey.

Alright, here we go.

Come on!

How did we wind up with the monkey last night anyway?

I needed some blow and Alan thought he was cute...

...so we stole him!

So stupid!

Stu, ready to grab vest?

- Okay. I just grab it? - Yeah, just do it. Just do it.

- Hey, little monkey. - Alan, be quiet.

- Fuck! - We gotta go, right now!

- Pull that fuckin monkey in! - I'm trying!

Shit!

- Get that monkey in here, Stu! - He won't let go!

Stu, get back in the car! Right now!

I'm trying! Slow down!

He's so strong!

Let go you fuckin monkey!

- Look out! - Oh shit! Tight squeeze!

I got him!

- Where's the code, Chow? - Check his little vest.

- Got it, Alan? - Yes, I got a .

- Slow down Chow! - Hold on, J-Birds.

Holy Shit!

Don't worry. I got this shit!

Pig!

Oh, my word.

Sorry, Stu! My bad!

Oh, shit!

Get down!

What the fuck!

Oh no! He shot the monkey!

They shot the monkey.

I'm at my wits end.

He's coming back around.

Look out!

- Holy fuck! - Oh no...

- Everyone alright? - Yeah.

I have such an erection right now!

Are you for real?

They're gonna take good care of you here, ok ?

What's that?

Oh, yeah. Cigarettes. Got em right here. Here you go.

Right here.

Deep breathe. Good.

Soak it in.

Breathe the smoke into your tiny little lungs. There you go.

It's funny. I've never been much of a smoker, but...

Boy does it look cool on you.

Alan, c'mon! Let's go!

I'll miss you, monkey.

I wish monkeys could Skype.

Maybe one day...

Come on! Get in!

Are you guys seriously this calm?

Relax, Stuart. It's classic switcheroo.

I give him money, he gives us Teddy.

You ever do anything that doesn't end up in a standoff, Chow?

I'm an international criminal. It always ends like this.

I met my wife at one of these things.

- You got a wife? - Yeah, we married 15 years.

What, I not good looking enough for woman?

No, that's cool.

Let's do this!

- Welcome to the Tower Club. - Blah blah blah, who cares.

Stop! Chow crossing.

- Hey, Kingsley! - Well, well.

Propecia looking nice!

You been hitting the gym?

Yes I am actually. Thank you for noticing, Chow.

Hey, guys. Have a seat.

- Where's Teddy? - He's waiting downstairs in my car.

Send him up when the transfer is complete.

Tell you what. Give me extra 50 grand, you keep Teddy.

And I throw in this other fat fuck for free.

- Chow.. Chow... - Could we move this along!

Alan, account number. Come on, come on.

8-1-4, K as in knife, 2-3-9-8.
8-1-4, K, 2-3-9-8.

- Password? - "baloney1"

Your password is "baloney1" ?

Well it used to be just "baloney" but now they make you add number.

Fuckin annoying.

- And it's that easy. - Ta dah!

Oh look. You sunk my battleship.

- Great, now can we please have Teddy? - Yeah. Bring him up.

See. We go to your wedding. We have fun. I bust a nut.

We did it, Stu. It's over!

This is Bangkok police! Everybody down!

Oh, nuts!

Kingsley, you're fucking Five-O?

Gotcha, Leslie!

Get him outta here.

Go! Just do it! Go!

How the fuck...

Samir, you fucked me over six grand? You camel jockey!

You spit on me?

Six grand this time, eight grand last time. It's not the money, man, it's the principle!

Principle? Nigga, please! We both dead inside.

Call me nigga... don't call me "nigga"!

- Put em in, motherfucker! - He's an asshole, man.

You guys ok?

- What the fucks going on? - Detective Inspector Peters, Interpol.

- You're a cop? - Yes.

This sting operation has been in place for weeks.

When Samir told us that your friend was lost...

We took advantage of that information. I'm sorry.

- So can Teddy come out of the car now? - No, Alan, Teddy's not in the fuckin car!

They don't have him. They never had him.

They just needed us to bring them Chow. They used Teddy as bait.

- Do you have any leads at all? - No. We've checked everywhere.

No one has seen him. I'm sorry.

If you haven't found him by now, I'm afraid Bangkok has him.

Why do people keep saying that?

Stu... It's time.

Phill...

-I'm sorry. - Don't say that. Please.

- No this time we really fucked up. - Oh god! How bad?

Like, no wedding bad?

Yeah... a little worse than that!

Ok, how about this? He fell off the fishing boat and drowned.

No.

Ok, I got it. Teddy was hit by a truck.

- Alan! - Not a good time, Phil. Kinda busy!

How many people get run over here?

- Over 1200 a year, Phil. - Perfect!

His body was too mangled to recover. Case closed.

Can I get more ice, please?

I'm not gonna lie to Lauren.

- Stu, do you want this or not? - Look at what I've done, Phil. What I do.

I have a weakness for prostitutes. All kinds, apparently.

- I have a demon in me! - So what?

Teddy's gone, but I can still save Lauren.

Just let her live her life without me.

Stu!

I want you to call Doug and tell him I'm never coming back.

Gettin off the hamster wheel.

Gonna stay here in Bangkok. I think I belong here.

Open up a little dentists office.

Deep cleanings, with a happy ending.

You sure about this?

Hey, what the crud!

Powers out, Alan.

- Phil! - Doug.

- I need answers, man. - I know...

Doug, who are you talking to?

- What? - Give me the phone!

Lauren, no! That's a private...

Who is this?

- Lauren? - Phil? Tell me what's going on, right now!

We lost your little brother.

- What? - Bangkok has him now.

You gotta take the stairs.

You're in Bangkok?

Ooh, that's a finger!

Put Stu on the phone!

Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages per year.

Stu really doesn't want to talk to anybody.

- Water everywhere. Powers out.

Come on, Stu, use that big Jewish brain

Phil! Give me the phone!

- It's Lauren! I got it! I'm handling it! - I know.!

- Give me the fuckin... - I can handle it, Stu!

She's gonna break your heart!

Honey, sweetheart, it's me! I'm so sorry!

Stu? What the hell is going on? What does he mean you lost Teddy?

What? Is that what Phil said? No no no. We misplaced, Teddy.

But we're all good now. We heading back to the hotel. We're gonna see you soon!

I love you so much! And I gotta go, but I'll see you soon. Bye.

Stu!

- Stu! - God!

Taxi!

Come on, Alan!

Hey, you mind filling us in!

Ok, now when we woke up, the power was out.

And you found Teddy's finger in what?

- In a pool of water. - But it didn't start out as water.

No, it was ice.

Exactly! Teddy got ice from the machine...

...came back to the room. Put his finger on ice and fell asleep.

Now what do you do if you wake up...

...and you find your finger floating in a bowl of melted ice?

I'd get more ice, Stu... on the 15th fuckin floor!

Yes! Teddy goes up, the power goes out...

- Holy shit! Of course! - He's at the ice machine.

Alan, no!

It's on ten!

- Sir, is the elevator stuck? - ??.

- C'mon! - Go, go, go!

Hey, Teddy!

Look out, look out!

- Teddy! - You're ok!

Teddy, you okay? You ok, man?

- Where am I? - You're in an elevator, in the middle of Bangkok.

But we're gonna get you outta here. It's gonna be fine.

Hey Stu, nice tattoo.

Thanks, man.

Alright, let's do this! C'mon, c'mon!

Tell him we found him. Yeah, I know. But we're on our way. Ok, bye!

Alright, guests are arriving, people starting to ask questions, but we can still pull this off!

- How? - I don't know, with a taxi?

- Chow's speed boat. - What?

Last think I remember, was getting off Chow's speed boat.

- Chow has a speed boat? - "The Perfect Life".

C'mon!

Stu, get that back line.

Good jump, Phil!

- You alright? - Yeah.

- You sure you know how to drive this thing?

Please, I was raised in a yacht club. I know what I'm doing.

You know where we're going?

Leave it to the Captain!

Oh fuck you, Alan!

Do you know where we're going, Captain?

Affirmative cadet! We're going south.

- We're in the Gulf of Thailand. - Good.

Hey! You okay?

- Feeling a little better. - Alright!

Listen Teddy. I'm really sorry! We didn't mean for any of this to happen.

It's funny. I can't remember anything but... when I woke up, I was kinda happy.

Yeah!

By the way... Do you have any idea where my finger is?

Yeah, we gave it to a drug dealing monkey.

Bangkok...

Yeah, right... fuckin Bangkok!

I apologize. There will be no wedding!

He is on his way. He will be here...

Please, if you will all move to the bar. We are going to clear this area.

Please!

I'm telling you, I spoke to him. He's coming.

Look! There they are!

Stu!

- Alan, there's no dock. - Just hang on!

- Alan, it's not funny! Turn the boat! - Hang on!

- Is that Alan driving the boat? - What?

Uh, we should probably move back a little bit.

Oh my god!

Turn the boat!

Everyone back up a little bit here.

Sir, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

Hi! Hi everybody!

Came in a little hotter than we planned. I'm sorry we trenched the lawn here.

Totally fixable. A little bit of sod, it'll be fine.

- Baby! - Oh my god!

I'm so happy to see you!

- Teddy! Teddy here. - Hi, Dad!

- You alright? - Yeah, ok.

- Your hand! - I know.

We had an accident. I'm ok.

This is your fault!

- Dad. - He's right. I have not been completely honest.

- Stu? Don't do this. -Yeah?

Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it.

You said I'm a joke.Well I'm not.

I'm not some weird, milky, ricy, watery that you feed to infants and old people, ok!

Maybe I would be if you added some cayenne pepper!

I wish I was a boring dentist...

...who had a boring life and boring friends...

... but I don't and I'm not.

I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.

It's not weird. It's pretty cool actually. No membership fees.

I've had enough of this. Come here.

Whoa! Here's the deal man.

- I got a dark side!

There's a demon in me!

It's true, he has semen in him.

I said demon.

- But you also have semen in you, remember? - Not relevant, but thank you, Alan.

The point is, this demon takes me to some pretty weird places.

We lost Teddy for two days in Bangkok.

But that same demon took us to hell and back to find him.

We took on Bangkok and we won.

Now that's pretty fuckin cool if you ask me!

I love your daughter, and I'm gonna marry her.

- Unless you have any problem with that? - I'm good.

But all that said, it would actually mean a great deal to both of us...

...if we could just get your mother fucking blessing!

Hey, Alan...

- That looks pretty cool shaved. - Thanks, Phil.

You should shave your head too.

- Why would I do that? - Well than we would look exactly alike.

- Take good care of my daughter, Stu. - I will.

I'm sorry we almost killed everyone with the boat.

Just happy you're here.

And don't worry about the tattoo. I'm gonna have it lasered as soon as we're home in LA.

- That's ok. I can get used to it. - Really?

But for now, let's switch sides?

- Yeah, ok. - Thank you.

Much better.

Dear family and friends. On behalf of Stu and Lauren...

...I welcome all of you, to this marriage celebration.

We are here today to...

Hey buddy. Can you hold on for a second.

Thank you.

Hello? Hi everyone!

My name's Alan Garner.

I want to thank the Asiatic people for allowing us in your land.

I wanted to say that, um, I'm really happy to be here...

...and I have a wedding gift to present to Lauren and Stu.

And um, a lot of thought has gone into this...

...and I hope that you appreciate it as much as I did, or going to.

Okay, guys!

Oh, fuck!

Alan!

What the fuck?

- So what do ya think? - That's insane! How did you do that?

My dad had to make a lot of calls.

I told Mike that you gotta do it. It's for my third best friend.

Alan, it's amazing! I love it! Thank you so much!

We only have him for tonight. We don't have him permanently.

Understood!

- You do a lot of public speaking, Alan? - I barely ??

Mike, you were great. It's true, that was incredible.

Thanks, guys. That means a lot, really!

By the way, you really need to remove that fuckin tattoo from your face!

Yeah! On it!

Sorry about the last minute change up to the performance, Mike.

- Don't worry, Alan. - What are you talking about?

Well he was originally supposed to sing "Burning Up" by the Jonas Brothers...

...but then I remembered you don't like indie rock.

Hey guys. You're not gonna believe this.

- Is that your phone? - Yeah.

How come you never tried calling us?

It's been dead for two days.

But I recharged it and found all these photos.

What?

- Shit! - Yeah, some of it's pretty messed up.

- Awesome, let's check em out. - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

No one needs to see this stuff!

C'mon man! I'm Mike Tyson. I've seen everything!

- It'll be fine. - (mumbles something)

- Alright, we look at it once. - And then we delete them. It's gonna be ok.

- Oh, ooh! - Mother fucker!

A1   EXT. OCEAN - EVENING                                               A1
     Dark waters barely lit just past sunset. ROPES of a fishing net
     disappear into the forbidding depths. We hear the CRANK of a
     winch as it turns. On the bow of his ship, a Spanish FISHERMAN
     pulls his net up out of the sea.
     Slowly, deep underwater, the DIM OUTLINE of a SHAPE appears,
     caught in the net.
     CREE-YAK, CREE-YAK, the winch turns. The shape resolves into a
     DEAD BODY; it grows more clear as it rises closer ...
     The body breaks the surface, along with seaweed and flapping
     fish; it is an ANCIENT SAILOR. The Fisherman cries out --
                              FISHERMAN
               Capitán! Capitán!
     The net spills onto the deck. Quickly the CAPTAIN is there. At
     exactly the same time they make the sign of the cross.
     The Captain leans close. One arm across the sailor’s chest still
     clutches a wide, thin book. The Captain reaches --
     SUDDENLY the Sailor’s EYES OPEN; he GRABS the Captain’s arm --

2    EXT. SPAIN - CASTLE GATES - NIGHT                                  2
     A gold-trimmed carriage RACES over cobblestones. -- up from a
     harbor seen in the distance below. It arrives at a Spanish
     castle, silhouetted against the night sky --
     SUPERIMPOSE TITLE:
                             CADIZ, SPAIN
     Gates open just in time for the carriage to race past --
3    INT. PALACE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                                      3
     DOORS BURST OPEN. The Fisherman and Captain enter, using a sail
     as makeshift litter, carrying the ancient Sailor. Unkempt beard,
     the tattered clothes of a castaway; shivering, at death’s door.
     He still clutches the book to his chest --
     FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, hurrying across the floor, is KING
     FERDINAND. Young, dashing, the arrogance of authority.
     The Sailor is lowered to the floor as the King arrives --

                 Your Majesty, we believe he’s found --
    Ferdinand holds up a hand that they should be silent. The Sailor
    opens his eyes. Struggles, then words come, faint --
                                  SAILOR
                 Ponce de Leon.
    Ferdinand is amazed. He glances back --
    Joining the group is a darkly-tanned man. Experience in his
    eyes. He will be known only as THE SPANIARD.
    The King gently removes the book. It’s a ship’s log.
                                CAPTAIN
                 Says he found Ponce de Leon’s ship --

                 Aye, but he died searching for
                 something, didn’t he?
    Ferdinand stares at a page. Amid the hand-written entry is an
    archaic symbol drawn in ink.
                                KING FERDINAND
                 The Fountain of Youth.
    He glances down at the Sailor -- who now lies motionless.

               It’s not a hanging, dear, it’s a trial.

    A PRISONER is SLAMMED into the wall by a JAILOR. Dressed as a
    pirate. Manacled at his ankles and wrists, a black cloth bag
    over his head.
                              JAILOR

    place is packed to the gills, standing room only.
    The Prisoner is shoved into the dock.

     into the courtroom --
     He holds up his gavel, gives it a shake, drawing more CHEERS and
     FOOT-STOMPING. He has a habit of holding a lace hanky in front
     of his mouth, which he's currently doing --
     -- until he drops it for a brief moment, flashing a smile that
     includes familiar gold teeth. The judge is --

               tonight, pub called the Captain’s

                  discretion and valor --
                                 GIBBS
                  Meaning, you gave up.
                                 JACK
                  So untrue! I am just as bent as ever,
                  hellishly so. I’ll taste those waters,
                  Gibbs, mark my words --
                                 GIBBS
                  There’s the Jack I know!
                                 JACK
                  And I’ll not have it said, there’s a
                  point on the map Captain Sparrow never
                  found --
     The carriage stops. Jack frowns, pockets the map.

               Short trip.
     The doors open; Jack steps out --
13   EXT. ST. JAMES PALACE - COURTYARD - DAY                            13
     Jack emerges, comes face-to-face with --
     KING’S ROYAL GUARDS, rifles pointed at Jack. The paddy-wagon is
     in the center of a palace courtyard.
     PULL BACK to REVEAL: on the second and third story balconies
     around the courtyard, EVEN MORE GUARDS. The Driver, looking sly,
     is handed a pouch of coins by a Guard.
     Gibbs steps out behind Jack, ever-hopeful.
                              GIBBS
               All part of the plan. Yes?
     The CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS slams Jack’s head with a rifle. Jack
     crumples into Gibbs’ arms, then to the ground.
     Gibbs is shoved back into the wagon, the door SLAMMED SHUT. Jack
     looks up, answers, far too late --
                                 JACK
               No.
14   INT. ST. JAMES PALACE - DINING HALL - DAY                          14
     Two Guards march Jack down a wide elegant hallway.
     The Guards secure Jack with chains to the chair, then exit,
     closing the doors. In front of Jack is a vast table, laden with
     food. Jack licks his lips. The food beckons, but he’s too far
     away to reach it.
     He looks around. High ceiling, chandelier, tall drapes, high
     balcony. Enormous mural featuring King George II.
     Jack bounces the chair closer to the table. His wrists are bound
     to his sides. So he KICKS the table from underneath --
     A creme puff BOUNCES on its plate.
     Similar kicks bring it closer. Then he kicks the side of the
     table, maneuvering the cream puff to the edge. Finally, he can
     just get the toe of his boot under the cream puff --
     DOORS OPEN, startling Jack; he kicks the cream puff high in the
     air, onto the chandelier above -- where it STICKS. Jack settles
     back, legs crossed, going for nonchalance.

     The Captain of the Guards leads in a column of GUARDS. Next come
     a retinue of SERVANTS. Next, Lord JOHN CARTERET, Prime Minister
     HENRY PELHAM. Finally --
     KING GEORGE. He heaves his bulk into a wide chair on the other
     side of the table, opposite Jack, begins to eat.
                                 CARTERET
                  You are Jack Sparrow.

                  I am informed you have come to London to
                  procure a crew for your ship.
     Jack nervously rattles the chains.
                                 JACK
                  Vicious rumor. Not true.
                                 GEORGE
                  No, I’m quite certain that’s what my
                  ministers told me, Jack Sparrow has come
                  to London to procure a crew.
                                 JACK
                  It may be true that that’s what you were
                  told, but it’s nonetheless false that I
                  have come to London to procure a crew.
                                 GEORGE
                  Then you lied to me when you told me you
                  were Jack Sparrow.

               Ah. Someone else named Jack Sparrow.
                         (to Carteret)
               You’ve brought me the wrong wastrel.
               Find Jack Sparrow, and dispose of this
               impostor.
     Jack’s chain-rattling grows louder, more annoying.
                              JACK
               Wait! I am Jack Sparrow, the one and
               only. And I am in London.
                              GEORGE
               To procure a crew. To undertake a voyage
               to the Fountain of Youth.
                              JACK
               What?
     Jack’s rattling gets even louder. George waves a hand.
                              GEORGE
               Someone, remove those infernal chains!
     Exactly what Jack wanted. A very TALL GUARD steps forward.
                              JACK
               How much do you weigh?
     The Guard just sneers at him. He pulls away the chains. Jack
     stands. Picks up a napkin, dabs his face.

     pats his pockets. It’s really not there. Jack looks relieved.

     normal footsteps. A step, then a SCRAPE. Step, then a SCRAPE.
     Out of the darkness, emerges --
     HECTOR BARBOSSA
     But a different Barbossa. He wears a Naval officer’s hat. A
     Privateer's coat. He leans on a crutch, stands on one leg; the
     other, wooden from the knee down.
     Barbossa bows before the King.

               Afternoon, sire.
                        (notices Jack)
               Why is that man not in chains? He must
               be manacled at once.

               At the centre of my palace? Hardly.
                              BARBOSSA
               If I may be so bold. Jack Sparrow be
               easy enough to catch. It’s holding him’s
               the problem.

     Without warning, Jack springs forward -- makes it all way face-
     to-face with Barbossa before the Guards grab him --

     Suddenly, Jack slams the Guards together, shoves their rifles
     upwards; they both FIRE --
     -- bullets hit the chandelier, a rope SNAPS; one side drops,
     sending the chandelier SWINGING. Jack leaps onto the table,
     races along, knocking away food --

     FLINGS IT AHEAD into the stained glass window --
     They are on the second floor, it’s a long way down. Jack grabs
     the ropes to the curtains, just as the Tall Guard comes
     barreling his way --
     -- the Tall Guard slips on the napkin (again, as planned) --
     Out of control, the Tall Guard flails out the window. Jack
     politely hands the curtain ropes to him as he passes by. The
     Tall Guard plummets down. Jack, hanging onto the other rope,
     RISES UP just ahead --
     -- of the slashing sword blade of the Captain of the Guards --
     From the valance, Jack leaps for the chandelier (catching it
     just as it swings towards him) --
     -- and Jack swings from the chandelier to the high balcony. He
     pauses, raises a hand -- along the way, Jack has recovered the
     creme puff. He bites, chews, swallows, and is gone.

     Jack races down the stairs, passing by a slow-moving Guard laden
     with Jacks effects (two pistols, sword, and baldrick). The Guard
     sees Jack, pursues. At the bottom, he dumps Jack’s items onto a
     table to draw his own sword, and joins two other guards in
     pursuit --

     There is the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS as Guards approach --
     They arrive at the window. Jack is gone.
     OUTSIDE, Jack crawls hand-over-hand along a wire, holding onto
     Royal bunting that spans the street. He hides behind a Royal
     flag. Something falls --

     slashes the wire; it breaks, Jack swings down --
17   -- into a moving carriage, into a SOCIETY LADY’s lap. He kisses    17
     her hand (stealing her bracelet) and climbs out, onto the roof
     of the carriage. Guards spot him --

     makes it onto a slow-moving COAL WAGON.
     Jack climbs forward, pushes the DRIVER aside. Jack snaps the
     reins ... but the horses don’t respond.
     Behind Jack, the Captain, now on horseback, yells:
                                CAPTAIN
               Fire!
     His men, also on horseback, aim, shoot --
     -- the bullets hit a lantern mounted on the side of the wagon;
     it EXPLODES, lighting the coal. The horses leap forward,
     frightened -- the Driver dives off --

     on horseback.
     It careens down the street --
     AHEAD, a FATHER herds his family across the street, YOUNG BOY
     (six) on his back, YOUNG GIRL (eight) wearing a bonnet holding
     his hand.
     He hurries them across ahead of the cart -- but a gust of wind
     blows the Girl’s bonnet back into the street -- she chases after
     it --
     ON THE BONNET, in the street as she reaches for it -- then she’s
     yanked back hard by the Father as the flaming cart crushes the
     hat, THUNDERS past --

     Jack drops down to the street. Dusts himself off. Turns --
     A GUARD stands there, rifle aimed straight at Jack’s heart.

               Hello, Jackie.
24   INT. CAPTAIN’S DAUGHTER - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT                 24
     Filled with ruffians, highwaymen, drunkards, barmaids and
     painted ladies. Jack and Teague huddle in a corner.
                              TEAGUE
               Heard you were putting together a crew.
                              JACK
               If enough people keep saying it, it must
               be true.
     Teague notices a new dangle in Jack’s hair.
                              TEAGUE
               Is that your tooth?

               Broke it. Swallowed it. Sifted it.
               Retrieved it. Polished it.

                              TEAGUE
               Heard where you were headed. The
               Fountain.
                              JACK
               You’ve been there.

               Does this face look like it’s been to

               Son. The Fountain. There be items
               required, for the profane ritual. Two

                                 JACK
                  Set sail? Love to. For that I’d need a
                  ship.
                                 TEAGUE
                  Those folk. Over there. They have a
                  ship.
     At the far end of the room, next to an inner door, playing a
     mandola slung around his neck, is SCRUM. A line of sailor-types
     wait in front of him.
                                 TEAGUE (CONT'D)
                  And Jackie. One last thing. The Fountain
                  will test you, mark my words.
     Jack nods, takes a long drink. Turns back to Teague -- who isn’t
     there any more.
     Across the room, Scrum finishes an impressive lick -- and Jack
     suddenly appears behind him, knife to his throat.
                                 JACK
                  I hear you be recruiting a crew.

     Doors to the inner room open as a young pirate, DERRICK bursts

     A SILHOUETTE, in the form of Jack Sparrow.
     Jack tilts his head, admiring. He tries to see around the corner
     -- then he leaps out, into the room --
25   INT. CAPTAIN’S DAUGHTER - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT                     25
     -- but no one is there. Jack hears a noise, turns --
     JACK SPARROW steps out of the darkness. Same outfit, same
     dreads, same swagger, face obscured in shadow. Jack draws his
     sword. Other Jack draws his sword, too. A challenge.
                              JACK
               You’ve stolen me and I’m here to take
               myself back.
     The two Jacks hide behind a post, peek out at each other.
     The two Jacks leap forward at the same instant, with exactly the
     same slashing attack. Swords CLASH; the pair are completely
     evenly matched.
     The two leap onto the hearth, face off.   When Jack moves, Other
     Jack does too.
                              JACK (CONT'D)
               Stop doing that!
     Jack dodges, rolls expertly onto a crate. The other Jack
     executes the exact same roll. Jack tosses his sword back and
     forth between right and left hand. Other Jack does so too.
     The pair fight up a ramp. Other Jack rolls barrels down. Jack
     evades --
     IN THE RAFTERS, Other Jack spins, ready --
     But no one is there. Other Jack searches, looks down through the
     rafters -- nothing.
     Suddenly, a set of hanging barrels PLUMMET down. Other Jack
     springs back. Thinks, spins, raises a sword as Jack rises up
     behind, pulled up by the rope that holds the barrels --
     -- their swords clash --
     ON THE RAFTERS, they battle. Other Jack swings a pulley at Jack -
     - Jack grabs it, the pulley breaks, Jack lands on a stack of
     barrels. Other Jack leaps down, fights as barrels roll out from
     beneath them. A flash of intricate swordplay --
                              JACK (CONT'D)
               Only one person alive knows that move.
     Suddenly -- shockingly! -- Jack leans forward and KISSES Jack.
     Full on. A good kiss. Jack pulls back --

               I am touched at this most sincerest form
               of flattery. But why?
     Jack uses his sword to flip away her hat.

               That is not a compliment.

               Don't worry, I have long since forgiven

               For leaving you?
     Jack rips open her bodice, revealing a very womanly figure.
                              ANGELICA
               Recall that I left you.
     She moves away from him.

     Away from the warehouses, Angelica and Jack reach a dock on the
     far side of the Thames. They emerge from the water, still
     fighting --
                               JACK
                How can you say I used you?
                               ANGELICA
                You know exactly how!
                               JACK
                I know, but how can you say it?
     They collapse onto the wet stones, catch their breaths.
                                 ANGELICA
                So what is it.
                                 JACK
                What is what?
                               ANGELICA
                Regarding the Fountain. What do you
                know?
                               JACK
                You wouldn’t happen to have two silver
                chalices? Circa Ponce de Leon?
                                 ANGELICA
                No.
                                 JACK
                I thought not.
                                 ANGELICA
                Why?
                               JACK

     Suddenly Jack flinches. He sports a VOODOO DART in his neck. He
     plucks it out.

                  A mermaid, Jack.

     Burning torches. Gibbs hangs limp between two GUARDS, legs
     dragging, not resisting but not helping.
                               GIBBS
                There's been a mistake. It's a life
                sentence. Not death! Life!
     They pass beneath gibbeted pirates, bodies wrapped in rope, long
     dead. Ahead is a gallows, where two white-wigged OFFICERS wait --
     GROVES and GILLETTE. Guards drag Gibbs up the steps.
                               GIBBS (CONT'D)
                You forgot the rope. There’s no rope,
                hah-hah! No rope!
     Then a sound that strikes fear into Gibbs’ soul. SCRAPE-step,
     SCRAPE-step along the cobblestone. Into the light of a lantern
     appears: Barbossa, a rope wound his shoulder.
                                GIBBS (CONT'D)
                Barbossa.
                                BARBOSSA
                Off with you.
     The Guards step back. Barbossa heaves the rope at Gibbs. Groves
     and Gillette glance at each other, worried.
                               BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
                I trust you can tie a noose.
                               GIBBS
                That’s a hard thing, force a man to
                twist his own hangin’ rope.
                               BARBOSSA
                Ye must lie in your bed the way ye made
                it.

                I’m on a tight schedule, Gibbs. The
                H.M.S. Providence sails at first light,
                and if you dunnot care to watch it

                  compass, a more loyal crewman you won’t

                  headed? Have you anything to offer me,
                  Mister Gibbs? Anything at all?
     Barbossa grabs the rope, steps back, tosses it over the gallows.
     The noose falls down.
                                 GIBBS
                  Set me free. Then I give you what I

                  naked word you’ll not see the dawn!
     Gibbs pulls out the circular MAP, last seen in Jack’s pocket.

                  just like that, for nothing.

     Barbossa edges forward -- but Gibbs grabs a lantern, SMASHES it

               Her. Our First Mate is a her.

     Angelica steps up to the ship’s wheel, piloted by Gunner. She’s
     still in pirate garb, but now clearly female.
                              ANGELICA
               Steady as she goes.

     Angelica slides down the gangway. Jack springs from the shadows,
     grabs her -- holds a sharp cargo hook to her throat.
                              JACK
               You are a ruthless, soulless
               crossgrained cur.
                              ANGELICA
               I told you I had a ship.
                              JACK
               No. Blackbeard has a ship. Upon which I
               am now imprisoned.
                              ANGELICA
               We can pull this off, Jack. The Fountain
               of Youth. Like you always wanted.
                               JACK
               Blackbeard. Edward Teach. The pirate all
               pirates fear. Resurrector of the dead in
               his spare time.
                              ANGELICA
               He will listen to me.

                  Perhaps his own daughter?
     Jack stares. Pulls away the hook.
                                 JACK
                  Daughter, as in, beget by?

                  Long-lost. Recently found. Who loves her
                  dear papa with all her heart and soul.
                                    JACK
                  He bought that.
                                    ANGELICA
                  I sold that.
     Jack regards her. Calculates.
                                 JACK
                  Then it’s the Fountain of Youth for him,
                  or him and you, not you and I.
                                 ANGELICA
                  No, Jack. That’s the best part. He will
                  be dead.
                                 JACK
                  You’ll be handling that part yourself?
                                 ANGELICA
                  There is a prophecy. Perhaps you don't
                  believe in the supernatural --
                                 JACK
                  I’ve seen a thing or two.
                                 ANGELICA
                  Aye. The man with no eyes. The
                  Quartermaster. He is known as eleri
                  ipin, means witness of fate. What he
                  says comes true. He sees things happen
                  before they happen. He’s never wrong.
                                 JACK
                  I can do that too, if you don’t count
                  women, weather, and ... other things
                  that are hard to predict.
                                 ANGELICA

                He believes it. That’s why he needs the

                breath of death down his neck.
                               JACK

                The prophecy is this: Blackbeard will
                meet his death, within a fortnight ...

     Angelica wakes as Jack enters. Regards him, sleepily:

                                 ANGELICA
                  If this is a dream, you can keep the
                  sword and boots. If it is not, you
                  shouldn't be here.
                                  JACK
                  It’s a dream.
     Angelica hears sounds of fighting.
                                  ANGELICA
                  No, it’s not.
                                 JACK
                  We’re taking the ship. Fair warning. You
                  might want to --
     With a SCREAM and a series of curses, Angelica leaps out of bed,
     sword in hand --
54   INT. QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE - OUTSIDE ANGELICA’S CABIN - NIGHT       54
     -- Jack SLAMS her cabin door shut, just as her SWORD PLUNGES
     THROUGH, inches from his heart.
                                 JACK
                  ... stay out of it.
     The sword is pulled back; Jack turns just in time, taking up the
     attack of the Gunner, coming at him --
55   EXT.   QUEEN ANNE'S REVENGE - MAIN DECK - NIGHT                    55
     The fighting intensifies, pirates attacking Zombie Officers.
     Gunner gets attacked from behind, the Pirate behind him trying
     to choke him.
     Gunner draws a pistol but the Pirate sees it, reaches around and
     grabs it, trying to wrestle it free, or at least keep the Zombie
     from pointing it at him.
     Slowly, unexpectedly, Gunner forces the pistol into his own
     chest, and pulls the trigger, the bullet going though his body
     and into the Pirate, killing him.
     Elsewhere on deck, the Quartermaster takes a sword thrust right
     into his belly. He stares down; we think he’s in pain. But then
     he looks up and LAUGHS, the sword bouncing about. He pulls the
     sword out and attacks --
     Mid-deck, Jack is driven back by Gunner, but pirates come to his
     aid; Garheng, the Cook, and Salaman --
     Jack glances up. Catches the eye of Salaman, who nods --

56   EXT. QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE - MAST - NIGHT                           56
     In a flash, Jack and Salaman are in the rigging, where Philip is
     still bound. Jack cuts at the bonds, notices --
     Behind his back, Philip clutches a cloth-bound Bible. He’s
     somehow held onto it the entire time. Jack slashes the ropes.
                              SALAMAN
               You’re either with us, or against us!
                              PHILIP
               I am not with you. Neither am I against
               you.
                                 SALAMAN
               Can he do that?

                  He’s religious. I believe it’s required.
     Shouts from below --
57   EXT.   QUEEN ANNE'S REVENGE - MAIN DECK - NIGHT                    57
     Jack drops down, immediately takes on the Quartermaster, fights
     him back toward the rail --
                                 JACK
                  Fight! To the bitter end, you cack-
                  handed deck apes!
     Angelica joins the Zombies, takes on three pirates, defending
     herself expertly. Jack outduels the Quartermaster, drives him to
     his knees. Pirates swoop in behind, lash him to a mast --
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                  Take 'em, men. Tie 'em down tight!
     The crew have the numbers, and the advantage. Officers are
     overwhelmed, fighting two, three against one --
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                  The ship is ours!
     Jack thrusts his sword in the air. The pirates do not join him;
     instead, they stare with horror --
     Behind Jack, silhouetted against the moonlight, a nightmare of a
     man. Wrapped in bandoliers, draped in pistols, surrounded by
     smoke from fuses twined into his black beard. A hand hangs to
     his side, grasping a bottle of whisky.
     Edward Teach. BLACKBEARD. Jack turns as Blackbeard raises the
     whisky bottle, drains it in one long swallow.
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                  Ah.
     Blackbeard tosses the bottle away.
                                 BLACKBEARD
                  Excuse me, gentlemen. I be placed in a
                  bewilderment. There I were, resting, and
                  upon a sudden I hear an ungodly row.
                  Open my eyes, and what do I see?
     No pirate dares answer, so Blackbeard answers for them.
                                 BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                  The Captain’s quarters. Next I ken, I be
                  Edward Teach. Blackbeard. And I be in
                  the Captain’s quarters. Aye?

                  And that makes me ... it naturally
                  follows ... the Captain.
     Blackbeard's hand goes to the jewelled hilt of his sword -- both
     sword and scabbard are oversized.
     Blackbeard GRIPS his sword. At the same time, ELSEWHERE ON DECK,
     a rope uncoils on its own accord.
                                 BLACKBEARD
                  Hence, my bewilderment. What of this row
                  on deck? Sailors abandoned their posts,
                  without orders, without leave!
     Blackbeard PULLS FORTH the sword. The end is broken, yet half
     the length of this sword is the full length of some other --
58   In response, IN THE RIGGING, ROPES twist and uncurl, moving on     58
     their own, unnoticed --
                                 BLACKBEARD
                  Men before the mast, taking the ship for
                  their own selves, what be that? First
                  Mate?
                                 ANGELICA
                  Mutiny.
                                 BLACKBEARD
                  Again?
                                 ANGELICA
                  Mutiny, Captain.
                                  BLACKBEARD
                  Aye. Mutiny. And what be the fate of
                  mutineers? Now we know the answer to
                  that do we not?
                           (a sneer)
                  Mutineers HANG.
59   Blackbeard RAISES his sword. Suddenly the SAILS of the SHIP catch59
     the wind, the ship lurches forward; Pirates and Officers are knocked
     off-balance --
60   -- the Pirates cry out, as ropes wind around them, tighten,      60
     impossible to fend off -- pirates fall, dragged across the deck,
     or slammed into the bulkheads --
61   Ropes unwind their own knots -- the Officers find themselves       61
     free. Pirates scream, caught up in the unearthly lines; their
     struggles in vain as the ropes tighten --
62   Blackbeard controls the ship itself. Booms swing, cannons cut      62
     off fleeing pirates. Ropes fly everywhere --
                  POTC: On Stranger Tides -WD- 11/3/10       40.


63   IN THE RIGGING, Pirates are lifted high in the air --              63
64   The ship is a massive spiderweb of rope and rigging, crossing      64
     this way and that, all of the pirates caught in the web, bound,
     trapped like flies.
65   Blackbeard regards Jack, who hangs before him.                     65
                              JACK
               Captain. Sir. I am here to report a
               mutiny. I can name fingers and point
               names --
                              BLACKBEARD
               No need, mister Sparrow. They are sheep.
               You, their shepherd.
     Blackbeard sheaths his sword. Jack drops to the deck. Blackbeard
     pulls his pistol.
                              ANGELICA
               Father. Remember. He has been ... to
               that place we are going.
                              JACK
               Have I told you, sir, what a lovely
               daughter you have?
                              BLACKBEARD
               A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.
                              ANGELICA
               Mercy, Father. The seas, the sky know
               nothing of mercy. You can put yourself
               above them.
                              BLACKBEARD
               If I don't kill a man every now and
               then, they forget who I am.
                                 PHILIP (O.S.)
               Coward.
     All eyes turn to Philip. He alone of the crew is not bound.
                                 BLACKBEARD
               Mmm? Excuse me?
                              PHILIP
               They do not forget. Your crew sees you
               for the miscreant you are, a coward, no
               matter how many you slay.
                               BLACKBEARD

                  You are not bewildered. You are afraid.
                  You dare not walk the path of

                                  BLACKBEARD

                  than all that.
                           (comes close)

     Blackbeard raises the pistol. Angelica draws her sword, steps in

                  Father, you must not.

                  Ah, Ah, Ah. There I am again,
                  forgetting. My daughter fears for my
                  soul, what’s left of it. My eternal
                  soul.
                           (to Angelica)
                  Endless damnation, the fiery pit, should

                  Worse than all my other sins put
                  together, that’s the way of it?
     Blackbeard touches her hair. It’s a little creepy.
                                 BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                  You truly hope to save me, my child.

     IN THE OCEAN, the longboat bobbles up and down, the Cook working
     feverishly to get the oars in place.
     AT THE RAILING, Blackbeard calls out; behind him, the mutinous
     crew members have been released, the ship’s ropes back to their
     proper functions --

     IN THE OCEAN, the Cook rows for all he’s worth, putting distance
     between himself and the ship. AT THE RAILING, Blackbeard turns
     to Philip.

               Course made!
                              PHILIP
               Stop. Give that man a chance. Give
               yourself --
69   Suddenly, from the prow of the ship, GREEK FIRE flares out of     69
     the mouth of the skeleton figurehead --
70   FLAMES ROLL OVER THE WATER, toward the longboat --                70
71   ON DECK, Angelica’s face is lit by the fire; she turns away as    71
     the Cook SCREAMS. Blackbeard steps close to Philip.
                              BLACKBEARD
               You know when I feel closest to our
               Maker? When I see suffering, pain and
               anguish. That is when the veil is
               lifted, and the true design of this
               world is revealed.
                              PHILIP
               And I see it revealed when, in times of
               hardship and tragedy, kindness and
               compassion are shown to those in need.
72   The SHOOTING FIRE stops. They turn to look. The Longboat BURNS,   72
     flames reflected in the water. Philip stares --
                              BLACKBEARD
               Perhaps you will pray for him to be
               unharmed? Yes? No. Of course not. You
               pray only for what chance might offer on
               its own, lest the weakness of your God
               be revealed.
     Philip is shaken. But finds his resolve.
                              PHILIP
               Please. There is still hope for that man
               --
                              BLACKBEARD
               Again.
73   ON THE WATER, as Greek Fire from the Queen Anne’s Revenge rolls   73
     over the waves --
74   AT THE RAIL, the firelight is reflected on Jack’s face --         74

75   INT. QUEEN ANNE'S REVENGE - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT               75
     Jack is SLAMMED backwards up against the bulkhead, hard. The
     Quartermaster stabs a knife into Jack’s shirt, pinning him.
     As the Quartermaster exits, Jack looks past him to see
     Blackbeard, working on something at his desk. Jack takes in the
     cabin; notes a cabinet enclosed by bars.
                              JACK
               I’ve no interest in the Fountain, so if
               your heart’s set, just drop me off
               anywhere.
                              BLACKBEARD
               Your words surround you like fog, make
               you hard to see.
                               JACK
               And you? The mighty Blackbeard.
               Beheaded, they say, and still you swam
               three times around your ship, then
               climbed back on board.
                        (beat)
               Yet here you are, running scared --
                              BLACKBEARD
               Scared.
                              JACK
               To the Fountain.
     Blackbeard approaches Jack.
                              BLACKBEARD
               My death is nigh -- the fates have
               spoken, the threads of destiny woven.
                              JACK
               You have a high regard for fate.
                              BLACKBEARD
               And you?
                              JACK
               I'm skeptical of predicting any future
               which includes me.
                              BLACKBEARD
               It be foolish to battle fate, but I am
               pleased to cheat it. I will reach the
               Fountain. You will lead me.
     Blackbeard turns away.

     Jack tugs on the knife, pulls himself free from the wall. He
     regards the knife in his hand -- he now has a weapon.
                                 BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                  The knife will serve you no better than
                  the mutiny you devised.
                                 JACK
                  The mutiny served me well. I gained an
                  audience with you.
                                 BLACKBEARD
                  Oh?
                                 JACK
                  To warn you. Regarding your First Mate,
                  who pretends to be persons she is not.
                                 BLACKBEARD
                  Do tell.
                                 JACK
                  She is not your daughter. What she is,
                  is evil. More to be feared than a wild
                  beast. Hungry wild beast. From hell.
                           (ticks off the list on
                            his fingers)
                  Vengeful, hungry, from hell. Beast. And
                  wild.
                                 BLACKBEARD
                  You speak thusly of my own flesh and
                  blood?
     Blackbeard comes back to Jack. Pulls a dreadlock straight --
     takes the knife from Jack, saws it off.
     He moves back to his desk. Jack peeks over his shoulder, sees: a
     Jack Sparrow voodoo doll. A wooden chest and head; beads, red
     bandana with dreadlocks woven in as hair. Face drawn on, a fair
     caricature of Jack, looking shocked.
     PULL FOCUS TO: Jack also looking shocked, same expression.
                                 JACK
                  Sir. The woman is consummate in the art
                  of deception.
     OUTSIDE, near the door, Angelica stops, listens in on the
     conversation. BACK INSIDE --

               claim credit for her abundance of

               true thing I have done in this world.
               And you claim to have corrupted her?
                              JACK
               But it was so easy.
                              ANGELICA

                              JACK
               Darling!
     Angelica steps into the room --
                              ANGELICA
               Oh, good. He's still alive.
     Blackbeard takes the voodoo doll, cuts a half circle into its
     chest. Jack winces in pain, tries to hide it.
                              ANGELICA (CONT'D)
               No need to hurt him, Father. He will
               help. Won’t you, Jack?
                              BLACKBEARD
               Do you see? Even now, she attends to
               your welfare. Giving lie to the claims
               you make of her.
     He makes a final downward slash. Jack opens up his shirt. On his
     chest is a bloody cut, an upside-down half-circle with a
     downward stroke, creating a pitchfork-shaped upside-down cross.
                              ANGELICA
               You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?
     Jack looks up. Blackbeard dangles the Voodoo Doll over a candle
     flame; it starts to SMOULDER.
                              BLACKBEARD
               Put another way. If I dunnot arrive
               there in time -- neither will you.
     Jack loosens his collar, sweating -- glances over --

     Gillette pilots the ship. Gibbs beside him, studying the ship’s
     compass. Barbossa holds a silver plate bearing finely sliced
     apples; he feasts with a tiny bite, notices --
     Groves stands before him, backed by various crew members.
                                 BARBOSSA

     Angelica emerges on deck, spies --
     JACK stands facing her, a bottle of wine in hand, glasses on a
     barrel. A CIRCLE of LANTERNS glows. The deck pitches and rolls,
     the glasses slide to the edge; he deftly catches them.

                Hola. Come. A drink.
     Jack tosses a glass to Angelica, nods to Scrum, who plays a
     Spanish tune on his mandola.

                Wine, lamplight, music. We’ve travelled

                Yes. Winding, twisting, turning, and

                Hardly appropriate for a First Mate.

                Was I the first? I wondered.

                You can be charming, when you want
                something. The trick is finding out
                what.

     she ends up in his arms.

     ship he falls into her arms, as if she pulled him.
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                  Here? With your father on board? We’ll
                  have to be very quiet.
                                 ANGELICA
                  Cards on the table, Jack. Including that
                  one up your sleeve.
                                 JACK
                  The truth? You’re going to get yourself
                  killed, and I’m not inclined to stand by
                  and watch.
                                 ANGELICA
                  You want to rescue me, Jack?
                                 JACK
                  Blackbeard has served his purpose. Land
                  is within reach. You and I can flee, go
                  on to the Fountain together. There’ll be
                  fame enough to share.
                                 ANGELICA
                  And I tell you the ritual of the
                  Fountain.
                                 JACK
                  The profane ritual.
     The SWAY of the ship takes them out of the rigging. Jack turns
     it into an elegant spin.
                                 ANGELICA
                  And the fact that saving me lies
                  directly in line with your self-interest
                  is entirely coincidental.
                                    JACK
                  Coincidentally.
                                 ANGELICA
                  I don't believe you.
                                 JACK
                  When once a liar speaks the truth, he
                  yearns for trust so.
     Jack grabs a line. Gets a running start, swings off, into the
     night. Then swoops in behind her, drops lightly to the deck.

               May I cut in?
                        (Angelica laughs)
               I have something for you. Proof, you are
               never far from my thoughts. The first
               item I ever stole ...
                        (shows the ring)
               ... for someone else.
                              ANGELICA
               I had to trade it. To learn the rules of
               the Fountain.
                              JACK
               Ah. And?

               since St. Lucia. Short lived, as I
               recall.
                              JACK
                        (a whisper)
               Tell me the rules.
                              ANGELICA
               Are we partners. Can I trust you? I need

                              JACK
               We are thick as thieves. Angelica.
     He slips the ring onto her finger. In return, she whispers:

               Waters from the Fountain of Youth. The
               shimmering tear of a Mermaid. The Silver

                               JACK
                I find my desire for the Fountain
                greatly lessened.
                               ANGELICA
                Ah, but there is something on board you

                               JACK

79   EXT.   QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE - OUTSIDE CAPTAIN’S CABIN - NIGHT     79
     Angelica and Jack whisper --

                Blackbeard?

                He’s forward, in the chart room. We’ll

     Angelica inserts a heavy key into a heavy lock --
80   INT.   QUEEN ANNE’S REVENGE - CAPTAIN’S CABIN - NIGHT             80
     Jack follows Angelica inside; they move quickly to a tall
     cabinet circled with heavy chains. Angelica produces a smaller
     key, unlocks it, pulls open both doors --
     Inside, rows upon rows of shelves bearing dozens upon dozens of
     GLASS BOTTLES, displayed on their sides. A closer look reveals:
     Each bottle contains a ship. And weirdly, there is motion. Each
     ship 'sails' on a shrunken, churning ocean, their sails filled
     with captured winds --
                               ANGELICA
                He keeps each vanquished ship as a
                prize. Help me, and I promise you your
                pick.

     Jack comes upon -- the Black Pearl; distinctive black sails,
     tiny. Jack peers close --
81   INSIDE the glass bottle we see a very tiny PARROT circling,       81
     flapping tiny wings --
82   Jack's reflected face registers astonishment --                   82

                  The Black Pearl. In a bottle. My ship is
                  in a bottle.
83   INSIDE THE BOTTLE, on the deck of the Black Pearl, Jack’s face    83
     looms as large as a thundercloud. JACK THE MONKEY climbs up the
     rigging on the otherwise empty ship --
84   Suddenly the monkey's face LOOMS LARGE, DISTORTED BY THE GLASS --84
     he SCREECHES --
85   Jack jumps back.                                                  85
                                 JACK

                  man.
                                 ANGELICA
                  What about the one-legged man? I need
                  years. Not for me. For my father.
                  Jack ... I truly am the daughter of
                  Blackbeard.

                  No. He is my father. The lies I told
                  you, were not lies.
                                 JACK
                  You lied to me, by telling the truth.

                  is evil and he will kill you, given the
                  chance. He cannot be saved.
                                 ANGELICA
                  Who are you to set the limits on
                  redemption? You stole years of my life,
                  Jack. You owe me.
     Jack turns away -- feels compelled to turn back --
     Angelica holds up the JACK VOODOO DOLL. She exhales her breath
     down its neck -- and Jack shivers, shakes himself.
                                 ANGELICA (CONT'D)
                  I wonder. Does it work because it works,
                  or because you believe that it works?
     She strokes the doll softly, and again Jack shivers.
                                 JACK
                  Or because I want you to believe that it
                  works?
                                 ANGELICA
                  Or because you want me to believe you
                  are only pretending for it to work, when
                  in fact it does? Nothing is beyond you.
     She drags the Voodoo doll along her neck. Up behind her ear.
                                 ANGELICA (CONT'D)
                  You are unpredictable, Jack. Untamable.

                  And you smell nice. But that’s beside
                  the point.
     Jack is jerked forward as she drifts the doll to her bosom.
                                 ANGELICA
                  When are you going to admit, Jack

     shoreline. PULL BACK through ship's rigging to find Blackbeard
     approaching the rail, gazing with satisfaction.

     longboats, up onto the ancient pier.

                Lay 'em out flat, no tangles, mend the
                holes. Make ‘em to look purty, for our

                  Is that story still out there? A
                  mermaid’s favor, perhaps, that sounds

     The group reach the upper level of the tower.
     In its centre, the lighthouse mechanism is a Rube-Goldbergian
     wonder. A huge wick on rotating platform with a large mirror
     behind, the system fed by a series of pressure controlled pipes
     leading back to a very large tank.
                                 SALAMAN
                  Smell that? Whale oil. Stuff burns like

                  hopes up.
     But Salaman sets upon it, experiments with the turning
     mechanism. Jack examines the view out one of the archways; a
     silver crescent moon rides above the blue horizon, Earthshine
     giving a glow to the moon’s dark area.

91   EXT. WHITECAP BAY - LONGBOAT - NIGHT                               91
     Dark waters. A LONGBOAT drifts, filled with the selected
     pirates, among them Scrum, Ezekiel, Derrick, the Cabin Boy, and
     Philip. Gunner keeps watch, pistol in hand.
     The mood on the boat is somber; the pirates know the danger they
     face. Only Scrum is upbeat. Heads turn as the Lighthouse BLAZES
     to life in the distance.
                                   EZEKIEL
                  We're doomed.
                                 DERRICK
                  We're not doomed. Day we set sail, I
                  spilled a glass of wine on deck, that's
                  good luck.
                                 EZEKIEL
                  Ah, but three days out, Scrum there
                  handed a flag through the rungs of a
                  ladder. Terrible bad luck!
                                 DERRICK
                  On that same day a dolphin swam
                  alongside the ship --
                                 SCRUM
                  When the clothes of a dead sailor are
                  worn by another sailor during the same
                  voyage, misfortune will befall the
                  entire crew!
                           (heads turn to Scrum)
                  I'm just sayin’.
     Suddenly the Lighthouse BEAM finds them; they are a bright shiny
     bauble on a sea of velvet black.
                                 EZEKIEL
                  They be drawn to man-made light.

                  Sharks?
                                 EZEKIEL
                  Worse than sharks, boy. They'll be
                  mermaids upon us, within the hour, mark
                  my words. Sharks won’t dare come near.
     They grow silent. Tense.

                  I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid
                  protects a sailor from drowning. And
                  sometimes, the song of a mermaid will
                  lead a ship away from the shoals.
                                 EZEKIEL
                  Don’t be a fool! Mermaids are all
                  female, son. And lovely as a dream of
                  heaven. But when it comes time to churn
                  butter, so to speak, they snatch a
                  sailor out of a boat or off the deck of
                  a ship, have their way, then the sailors
                  are pulled to bottom, and drowned, and
                  eaten.
                                 SCRUM
                  Or sometimes the other way around.
     The pirates consider that. Gunner points a pistol at Scrum.

                  They like to hear singing.
     Scrum glances at the other Pirates. Takes a breath.

                  "My name it is Maria, a merchant's

92   ELSEWHERE in the bay, two other longboats from the Queen Anne's   92
     Revenge wait, dark and silent. These boats are loaded down with
     large barrels. Their crews are silent. The Purser rows, keeping
     his distance --
93   The lit-up LONGBOAT lies between these trapping boats and shore. 93
     Scrum's singing drifts over the inky black waters:

     a watery sky.

     Time has passed. Most of the pirates are slumped down, tired.
     Only Scrum keeps up the singing, low energy:
                                 SCRUM
                  "While up aloft, in storm or gale, from
                  me his absence mourn ..."
     Philip spots something in the water, sits up.

                  "And firmly pray, arrive the day, he
                  home will safe return ..."
     And then Scrum notices it too --
     IN THE WATER, a small ripple. Nothing much, then it’s gone.
     Philip and Scrum relax. But then Philip's eyes widen as he sees
     something over Scrum's shoulder. He can only point, Scrum turns
     slowly to look --
     At bow of the longboat is a smiling, luminescent MERMAID.
     Just her upper body is out of the water as she leans on the edge
     of the longboat; she is naked, golden hair covering her bosom.
     Her eyes are sea-grey, her pale skin blue-tinted by the light of
     the moon.
                                  SCRUM (CONT'D)

     Other pirates come awake and see the sight; their drawn swords
     glint in the moonlight. The Mermaid feints back.

     Scrum pushes Ezekiel away. The Mermaid hesitates, then ...
     REVERSE ANGLE showing her shoulders and back as she pulls
     herself out of the water. Exactly where her body meets the
     surface, she TRANSFORMS, from scales and fins to skin.
     She stares at them innocently. Her tail swishes back and forth
     beneath the water.

      pulls his legs out from under him; he lands HARD onto the rocks
      as he is pulled under, debris flies everywhere --
119   UNDERWATER, Mermaids cower; frightened, blinded, they flee the    119
      rocks, dart away from the shallows --
      Jack breaks the surface of the water, turning in place, watching
      the Mermaids flee. As his head comes around, suddenly there is a
      Mermaid RIGHT THERE, staring.
      Jack attempts a smile -- the Mermaid winds up --
                                JACK
                 Please, don’t --
      -- and SLAPS Jack, hard, his head spinning, water flying off his
      dreads. The Mermaid takes off with the others --
120   ELSEWHERE, Angelica pulls Blackbeard to his feet. Suddenly, a     120
      commotion on shore:
                                  SALAMAN
                 We got one!

      The net is pulled up, but it's a false alarm: the person caught
      is Scrum, sputtering out sea water.
                                  SCRUM
                   I’m in love!
      They have to hold him from diving back in the water --
                                  BLACKBEARD
                   Check the wounded, see if any can be

      IN THE ROCKS, Philip, on his back, opens his eyes. He is dazed,
      but notices --
      NEARBY, in a pool, movement beneath the broken lighthouse door.
      A mermaid’s tail. Philip, scared, reaches for his sword. In one
      quick movement, he draws the blade and twists, driving the blade
      through the tail and down into the sand.
      A high pitched wail, thrashing. Philip pulls away the door,
      revealing a mermaid beneath --
      This is SYRENA.
      Revealed, she HISSES at him. Philip pulls his sword from her
      tail, raises it ... and then looks closer.
      Frightened, Syrena tries to curl up more. Philip sees the fear
      in her eyes. He lowers his sword.
      Syrena raises her gaze to Philip. Their eyes meet. Something
      passes between them; an understanding, kindred spirits.
      Philip sheathes his sword. A look of gratitude from Syrena.
      Suddenly a NET comes down over her, thrown by Blackbeard and the
      Quartermaster.
                               BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                Got one! Here, lend a hand!
      Syrena struggles. But Blackbeard wraps her up tight.
                               BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                         (to Philip)
                Good work, sailor.
      Philip starts to protest -- but he has no words, and can’t deny
      his part in her capture. Syrena bites at the net, looks at
      Philip, betrayal and hate in her eyes --
      Blackbeard displays his prize to the other pirates --
                               BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                Look boys, we landed ourselves --
      Suddenly Jack steps in front of him. A little groggy.
                                JACK
                Did everyone see that? Cause I’m not
                doing it twice.
      Blackbeard glares at Jack.
                               BLACKBEARD
                Back to the ship. We make for a
                protected cove -- and quick.

      Angelica tosses Jack back his sword. Blackbeard notes the
      gesture, turns his back and moves on --

121   EXT. WHITECAP BAY - ROCKS - NEXT MORNING                         121
      Rain pours down. Dark clouds hang heavy in the sky.
      TILT DOWN to FIND: the still smoldering lighthouse. The upper
      third blown away, much of the rest of it rubble.
      A mermaid body lies on the rocks. Dead, she is in her full ocean
      form (due to the rain). A peg leg pokes the body --
      REVEAL: Barbossa and Gibbs, drenched, next to the mermaid. Other
      crew members, including Groves and Gillette, a landing party,
      climb up from what is left of the pier.
      The Providence can be seen in the distance, anchored in the bay.
      Groves looks close, incredulous.
                               GROVES
                Lord. Is that -- ?

                Give up this madness. Now.
                               BARBOSSA
                I cannot. Ever walk on the beach, look
                back, and see your footsteps in the
                sand? It's like that. Except the
                footsteps lie before me.
                               GILLETTE
                Footstep. Actually.

                Whitecap Bay, sir. We must hasten --
      Just then, faint, distant SHOUTS can be heard. GUNFIRE and
      SCREAMS. All turn --
122   IN THE BAY, the Providence is under attack ... the ship is being122
      swarmed by mermaids.
      Like piranha attacking a carcass, the ship is torn apart, and
      begins to list, amid the dim SCREAMS of dying sailors, and the
      high-pitched WAILS of attacking mermaids.

123   Barbossa turns his back to the scene. Looks away from the beach,123
      toward an enormous natural rock cavity.
                               BARBOSSA
                We travel by foot. Gibbs, I require a
                heading.
                                  GROVES
                Sir. The men --
                               BARBOSSA
                They be dead already.
                               GROVES
                They don't sound dead.
                                  BARBOSSA
                That so?
                         (pulls his pistol)
                I hear nothing but ... seagulls.
                Nesting. What is it you hear, Mister
                Groves? What is it our beloved King
                George Augustus, Duke of Luneburg, et
                cetera et cetera would hear?
      The wails of death grow louder. Groves stares at the pistol.
                               GROVES
                Seagulls. Nesting. Nothing more.
                               GILLETTE
                Could be pelicans.
      Barbossa turns his pistol on Gillette, thinks better of pulling
      the trigger. Trains it instead on Gibbs.
                                  BARBOSSA
                Heading, Gibbs?
      Groves notices Gibbs, a look of horror on his face, staring out
      at the bay; all eyes follow his gaze --
124   The Providence is pulled under.                                   124
      Gibbs takes a step toward it -- but Barbossa jams the pistol to
      Gibbs’ jaw.

      PULL BACK to REVEAL: Many boulders. Massive. Moving through is
      Blackbeard’s landing party, clambering over rocks. Jack.
      Angelica. Blackbeard. Members of the crew, including Scrum,
      Philip, Salaman, Ezekiel, Garheng, and the Cabin Boy.
      Next four Zombies, including Gunner and the Quartermaster,
      carrying among them the glass coffin. Only it’s not a coffin, it
      is a human-sized aquarium, half filled with water. Syrena floats
      inside, in her aquatic form.
      Blackbeard steps up next to Jack, yanks away a blindfold.
                                  BLACKBEARD
                   It’s to you now, Sparrow.

                   Was that necessary?

                   Best you not know the exact whereabouts
                   of my ship. I am a cautious man.
      Jack shrugs, pulls out his Compass, glances at it. The arrow
      points straight ahead.

                   What I want first is Ponce de Leon’s

      HIGH ANGLE, as the group hikes forward, strung out in a line
      with the jungle before them, the raised aquarium creating the
      look of a funeral procession --

      PAN DOWN past hanging vines; beyond the thick growth, the group
      wades through a murky river, floating the chained coffin.
      Scrum helps maneuver the aquarium beneath a fallen tree.

                                  ANGELICA
                   I’m going to say it again. Both get
                   water. One gets a tear. The person who
                   drinks the water with the tear gets all

      A rather larger snake swims near. Jack jumps behind Angelica.
      Angelica grabs it, wields it at Jack.

      The group pauses to drink, re-fill canteens, rest. The glass
      coffin is lifted and set on an outcropping. Syrena is in her
      marine state, long single fin (torn where she was stabbed).
      Jack joins Philip.

      Philip doesn’t answer; he has spotted a problem with Syrena,
      starts to move away --
130   Philip moves close to the glass. Syrena rises up, and transforms130
      to her half-human state. Her eyes, full of reproach, meet his.
      Philip notes: the glass cover is sealed, and chained closed. He
      glances back down. Looks closely. Syrena's skin is pale. Her
      eyes flutter. Breathing labored.

      The Quartermaster laughs. Philip takes the opportunity to grab
      the Quartermaster’s sword, wedges up the cover, breaking the
      seal. Syrena goes to the crack, breathes the air hungrily.

      reveals Jack, leading the way.
      PULL BACK: ahead of him is the edge of a chasm. A vast drop down

                                  ANGELICA
                   But that would take us out of the path
                   of the Chalices.
      Jack doesn’t want to admit it, but it does.
                                  JACK
                   Aye, well, then we circle back.
      Angelica glances at the Quartermaster, who shakes his head.
                                  ANGELICA
                   We don’t have time.
                                  JACK
                   Well, you insisted on bringing a mermaid
                   --
                                  ANGELICA
                   The mutiny didn’t help --
                                  JACK
                   You walk like a girl --

                   You would know --
      Blackbeard paces like a caged animal. Finally --
                                  BLACKBEARD
                   Someone must go.
                                  ANGELICA
                   You mean split up?
                                  JACK
                   You mean jump?
                            (steps back)
                   This I cannot wait to see.
      Blackbeard turns to Jack.
                                  BLACKBEARD
                   Sparrow will go, find the ship, and
                   retrieve the Chalices.
                                  ANGELICA
                   Jack? What makes you think he will come
                   back?
                                  JACK
                   What makes you think he will come back?
                                  ANGELICA
                   We cannot trust him, Father. I’ll go.

                She’ll go.
                               BLACKBEARD
                How much farther to the Fountain?
                               JACK
                A day’s march north, following that
                river, until you reach a series of
                pools. Then you’re close.
      Blackbeard plucks the Compass out of Jack’s hand. Jack reaches
      for it, thinks the better of it.
                               BLACKBEARD
                You will go.
                               JACK
                You know that feeling you get,
                sometimes, standing in a high place, a
                sudden urge to jump? I’m not feeling
                that.
      Blackbeard pulls one of his pistols, aims it a Jack.
                               BLACKBEARD
                I need those Chalices.
                               JACK
                Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.
      Blackbeard considers ... moves his pistol over to Angelica.
                               BLACKBEARD
                You will go, and you will return, or I
                will kill her.
      Jack sees he will do it. Still, Jack gives it a try --
                               JACK
                You would not kill your own daughter.
                               BLACKBEARD
                Quartermaster. Take seven pistols.
                Remove the shot in all but two. Do not
                tell me which two.
      CLOSE ON: a pistol, as it is set down by the Quartermaster, the
      last of seven pistols in line on a rock shelf.
      Blackbeard leads Jack back to the pistols.
                               BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                Choose one.

      Blackbeard indicates for Jack to choose a pistol. Disbelieving,
      Jack does so. Blackbeard points it at Angelica, pulls the
      trigger -- click!
                               JACK
                Please. None of them are loaded --

      Jack picks one of the pistols, points it a tree, pulls the
      trigger -- it FIRES. Jack is shocked.
                               JACK (CONT'D)
                If you’re so willing to kill her, let
                her jump.
                               ANGELICA
                What?
                               BLACKBEARD
                If you jump and die, then I will see she
                gets her chance.
      Blackbeard picks up another pistol. Suddenly Jack turns to the
      Quartermaster.
                               JACK
                You. If I jump. Will I survive?
      The Quartermaster stares at Jack a long time. He steps over to
      Angelica.
                               QUARTERMASTER
                The doll.
      Angelica hands him the doll. He moves to the edge -- throws the
      doll over.
      ANGLE ON: the Jack VooDoo doll as it falls, it seems to be
      SCREAMING --
      The doll SPLASHES into a narrow crevice between two rocks.
      BACK ON THE LEDGE, it was Jack who was screaming. The
      Quartermaster turns to Jack, who shuts up.
                               QUARTERMASTER (CONT'D)
                Yes. Now, you will survive.
                               ANGELICA
                This is nonsense. I’m going.
      Angelica moves to the edge of the chasm. Suddenly, with a yell,
      Jack races past her, leaping out into space. He plummets down --
132   -- lands in the river, between the rocks, with a HUGE SPLASH. A 132
      tense moment, then Jack bobs up, alive.
                               JACK
                Wet. Again. Again.
      ABOVE, on chasm edge, Angelica turns to Blackbeard.

                   guns were loaded.

      Barbossa and Gibbs slash their way through the thick jungle,
      followed by the landing party.
                                  BARBOSSA
                   Be nice to have a map about now.

                   STOP!
      Gibbs stops. Barbossa squints. CLOSE ON: an intensely bright red-
      and-black poison dart frog clings to Gibbs’ shirt.
                                  BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
                   Hold very still. Ye dare not let it
                   touch your skin.
      Barbossa pulls gloves on, then gently lifts the frog off Gibbs’
      shoulder. Groves pulls forth a GLASS JAR filled with a dozen
      other FROGS. Barbossa adds the dart-frog to his collection.
      Gibbs stares at him.
                                   BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
                   What? What be wrong with an older man
                   having a hobby?
      Behind him, the landing party catches up to them, exhausted.
                                  BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
                   What are you stopping for? Eh? Push on!

      The landing party moves past. Barbossa raises a glass to the jar
      of deadly frogs, his face and eyes distorted --

      ON JACK, alone, as he races through the jungle. Comes to a
      deserted beach, pauses and stares upwards through an enormous
      cavity in the cliff. CAMERA RISES TO REVEAL:
136   IN THE FAR DISTANCE, perched high up on a dark seaside cliff,     136
      amid the mist, a bizarre image, a shipwreck, what is left of a
      square-rigged sailing vessel.
137   Jack speaks over his shoulder, as if talking to someone:          137
                                JACK
                 The Santiago. Famously captained by
                 Ponce de Leon.
      Jack nods, then realizes nobody is there.
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                 Right, then.

      Blackbeard hurries forward. Following, moving more quickly than
      they should, the Zombie officers maneuver the aquarium over a
      low branch --
      -- the aquarium slips, falls -- and BREAKS, water streaming --
      Syrena TRANSFORMS into her human shape. The Pirates stare. She
      curls up, scared. Philip strips off his shirt, drapes it over
      Syrena. Blackbeard returns, surveys the situation. Looks to the
      Quartermaster.
                                QUARTERMASTER
                 We must not stop.

                          (to Syrena)
                 You will walk.
      She rises, stands, shaky like a newborn colt. Takes a step --
      falls to her knees; Philip sees her right foot is scarred,
      injured from where he stabbed her.
                                 SYRENA
                 I cannot.

                  But you need it.

      tentative.

      Blackbeard there, glaring at him.

                  We are in a hurry. Yes?

      Blackbeard, leading the landing party, pushing plants, branches
      out of the way with his bare hands. He pauses.
                                 BLACKBEARD
                  Water. I smell it. Wait here.
      He disappears into the jungle. Philip sets Syrena down onto the
      giant roots of a fig tree. She withdraws, eyes downcast.
                                 PHILIP
                  Such beauty. Surely you are one of God's
                  own creations, and not, as some tell, a
                  descendant of those dark creatures who
                  found no refuge on the Ark.

      Philip thinks back, working it through -- the explosion, being
      shoved to the ground -- and realizes the truth.
                                  PHILIP
                   Did you ... you pushed me down, out of

      waits. Philip is on the spot.

                   You don’t deserve to know her true name.
                   But she wants to be called --

      Blackbeard emerges onto slate rocks. Before him is a round,
      still pool. He shoves his torch low --
      CLOSE ON: a skeleton, a dead mermaid. Staked to the stone by her
      wrists. Where the skeleton meets the water, the bones transition

      Syrena, head covered, is dragged forward by the Quartermaster
      and Gunner. Philip notices as: Scrum removes a glass vial from a
      pouch.

                   Careful. These pools run deep. If the
                   creature makes the water, all is lost.
      Syrena is held down at one of the pools. Her hooded face
      uncovered.
                                  BLACKBEARD   (CONT'D)
                   Look. LOOK. Staked out to   die. To dry in
                   the sun. Only half in the   water, not
                   enough to live, enough to   make the dying
                   slow.
      Syrena stares at the scene. No emotion.
                                   BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                   Think of it. Your people. Murdered.
                   Harvested for their tears. Breaks my
                   heart to think of it, and with so few of
                   you left in this world.
                            (beat)
                   Syrena. Will you not cry?
      Syrena shifts her gaze to Blackbeard. Steady.
                                  SYRENA
                   All die. Even you. Soon, I hear.
      He grabs her hair, twists her head, forces her to look.
                                  BLACKBEARD
                   Listen. Can you not hear their screams?
                   Can you not hear?
      Blackbeard moves his hand to the hilt of his sword ...
      SOUNDS of torment can be heard, faint, as if from a great
      distance. WAILING, PLEADING, CRYING, as soft as the wind.
                                  BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                   We need but a single tear.
      Syrena listens. Then, in a feat of pure will, she overcomes her
      fear, pain, sadness. Turns to Blackbeard and forces --
      A smile.
      Blackbeard SLAPS her with the back of his hand. Philip steps
      forward -- Scrum holds him back.
                                    BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)

                of heart, when the sun rises.
                               BLACKBEARD
                Yes. She will burn. But I cannot wait

                You will not torture her.
                               ANGELICA
                Philip. We need only one tear.
                               BLACKBEARD
                I will rip every scale from her body one
                by one as I see fit. Does that displease
                you? Go pray.
      Blackbeard laughs. Philip’s resolve finally breaks.
                               PHILIP
                I was wrong. Not all souls can be saved.
                Yours cannot. You are sundered from God.

                               BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                You fancy her. Do not deny what is clear
                to my eyes. Question is, does she fancy
                you?
      He shoves Philip to his knees, stares at Syrena.
                               BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                And by God she does! We're in luck.
                Manifest a tear, harridan. Or witness
                this poor soul’s death.
                               PHILIP
                Syrena. I would prefer to not be killed
                by this man. If you could manage a tear
                ... I would be grateful.
      Scrum leans in with the vial ... but nothing.
                               BLACKBEARD
                Ah. Sadness only. No sorrow. Yet.
      Blackbeard raises his knife.

                Not by your hand!
      Blackbeard shoves Philip to the Quartermaster -- who hits him on
      the back of the head, hard. Philip crumples --
                               BLACKBEARD
                Now. The throat. Quick, and see to it!
      The Quartermaster turns Philip away, draws a knife hard across
      Philip. Syrena cries out --
      The Quartermaster holds the knife out; the blade drips with
      blood. He releases the lifeless body; it hits the ground.
      Syrena stares, anguished, on the edge of tears. Blackbeard
      watches. But she fights the sorrow.
                               BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                Aye. Tough, Mermaids are, the lot of
                them. Tie her up. Exactly as the others.

      We can see how precariously perched it is on the ridge.
142   INT. PONCE DE LEON’S SHIP - NIGHT                                 142
      Rotted planks are ripped away. A TORCH appears, then Jack,
      climbing up through the floor of the cabin.
      The torchlight illumines treasure. Treasure everywhere. Gold,
      silver, jewels, pearls. A bed in the center. Jack stands --
      ON THE BED, there is a skeleton, magnifying glass in front of
      his face, staring at a map in his hand.

                 treasure, it wouldn’t match the contents
                 of this room.
      Jack whirls, sword in one hand, torch in the other. Out of the
      shadows steps Barbossa, sword drawn.

      Jack and Barbossa spread out, until the ship settles.
                                  JACK
                   Right, then. So we each choose an item
                   of approximately equal weight, then --

                   taking treasure from a place, not
                   knowing what curse might lie upon it.
      Jack pulls his hand back.

                   Ruddy hell. I’ll have it.

                   Put it back! We touch nothing!
      Jack puts it back. The ship shifts, and a chest slides out from
      under the bed.

      a step back -- and the ship tilts, and the chest slides towards
      him.

      Jack steps forward -- the ship lurches violently. It’s a game of
      chicken. Barbossa must step past Jack, away from the chest, to
      compensate. Jack kneels to open the chest --

                Fine, then.
      Barbossa purposefully pushes the harpsichord over; the ship
      tilts, and Jack slips to the deck. Barbossa stops the chest with
      his crutch and pushes it past Jack to re-balance.
      Jack crawls, reaches, and grabs the chest. Their eyes meet --

      Intensely creepy. Jack pulls his hand back ... and Ponce turns
      back to examining the map for all eternity.

      ON SYRENA, as she lies tied to the stakes, half immersed in the
      water. She looks, sees a SHADOW among shadows. Philip steps
      forward.
                                PHILIP
                 Syrena. I am sorry, Syrena.
      He falls to her side. Begins to untie her bonds. She is amazed,
      moved.
                                SYRENA
                 You came for me.
                                PHILIP
                 Yes.

                You are different, are you not?
                         (she smiles)
                Do you know not of kindness? Compassion?
                               SYRENA

                               PHILIP
                A debt repaid, then.
      She gazes at him, the moon reflected in those deep blue eyes.
                               PHILIP (CONT'D)
                No. That is not all. Moonlight. In a
                mermaid's eyes. The mystery of the
                depths. You are lovely beyond measure.
      He offers a smile. She smiles back. Blinks, tears of gratitude
      welling up in her eyes --
                               BLACKBEARD   (O.S.)
                Now! Quick-like!
      Suddenly Blackbeard is there. Pirates swoop in. Angelica shoves
      Syrena's head down. Holds the vial under her face --
      CLOSE ON: A SINGLE TEAR, the shining crescent moon captured
      inside, as it drops into the vial.
                               BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                No tears of sorrow! Never, Mermaids be
                too tough for that. But, tears of joy,
                they say these be the more potent
                anyway.
      Angelica hands the vial to Scrum, who corks it, places it
      carefully in its leather pouch.
                               PHILIP
                On my word, I had no part in this --
                         (to Blackbeard)
                Let her go. You don’t need her now.
                                BLACKBEARD
                Let her go? Let her go? Let her go?
                Would I be Blackbeard if did such a
                thing as let her go? And have her bring
                her kind down upon us? No, I would not.
                         (beat)
                Secure her bonds. We shall leave her
                with her own.

      Barbossa’s group shoves their way through, trying to stay quiet.
      Jack and Gibbs hang behind, whisper.
                               GIBBS
                What's your play, Jack? Throwing in with
                Barbossa.
      Jack hates to admit it -- but does.
                                  JACK
                There's a girl.
                               GIBBS
                When is there not?
                               JACK
                I should say ... a damsel.
                                  GIBBS
                What? No.

                Aye.
                               GIBBS
                You're rescuing a damsel? That’s a
                first.
                               JACK
                Aye. It's just .... I may have ... done
                the lady some manner of harm, back in
                the day.
                                  GIBBS
                Pray tell.
                               JACK
                Gibbs. This is the woman from Seville.
                               GIBBS
                Ah. You pretended to love her. Left her.
                And broke her heart.
                               JACK
                Worse. I may have had, briefly mind you
                ... stirrings.
                                  GIBBS
                Stirrings?
                                  JACK
                Aye.

                                  JACK
                   No, not quite all the way to feelings.
                   All right, feelings then, damn you!
                                  GIBBS
                   And left her still. That's worse.

                   Thank you.
      Suddenly Barbossa turns -- slashes a hand across his throat,
      telling them to be quiet. Points ahead, to --
      In the distance, ruins of the long-ago fort, nearly covered by
      jungle. The Spanish have made camp.
                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                   Stealth over force. I’ll take it from
                   here, on account of your condition.
                            (low)

                                  BARBOSSA
                   Appreciate your concern, Jack, I’ll be
                   keeping you company, all the same.
                            (to Groves)
                   Hold here. Wait for my signal.
147   EXT. JUNGLE - SPANISH CAMP - NIGHT                               147
      Barbossa and Jack move into position behind some palms. Barbossa
      searches, sees --
                                  BARBOSSA
                   There. That one.
      Jack looks. Standing beneath a canopy is The Spaniard.
                                  BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
                   That be the leader. Make note of his
                   tent, that’s where -- no, wait! By God,
                   that must be them, right there!
      The Spaniard has moved aside, and there on a wooden table sit
      the two silver Chalices. The Spanish Officer writes as he
      examines them.
      Barbossa draws his sword, crawls forward, Jack next to him. Jack
      sniffs.
                                  JACK
                   Your sword smells funny.
                                  BARBOSSA
                   Aye. Poison. From the innards of
                   poisonous toads. Just a scratch, and
                   you’d be dead within minutes.

                   you?
      They reach the two palm trees. Barbossa stares, calculating.
                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                   What are you doing?

      They reach the ruins of a wall.

      CLOSE ON: the silver Chalices. The Spanish Officer polishes one
      of them. We see the elaborate carving on their side: tree roots
      that entwine upwards, enveloping the engraved words, Aqua de
      Vida.
      Jack’s eyes appear at the edge of the table. When the Officer is
      working on one Chalice, Jack’s hand takes the other.
      Barbossa’s crutch appears at the edge of the table on the other
      side. The Officer puts one Chalice down, reaches for the other --
      now gone. While he is distracted --
      Barbossa’s crutch drags away the other Chalice.
      UNDER THE TABLE, the Officer’s head appears. Jack and Barbossa
      are not there -- and he gets clonked on the head.

      Jack and Barbossa stroll, confident, like they have every reason
      to be there. Jack waves at a passing Spaniard, who goes by, does
      a double take -- draws his sword. Two other Spaniards join him;
      Jack and Barbossa working together, make quick work of them.
      Round a corner --
      Find themselves face-to-face with three dozen Soldiers.
152   EXT. PALM TREE GROVE - NIGHT                                      152
      Jack and Barbossa sit facing each other, stripped of their
      possessions, tied around the waist to a palm tree.

                                  JACK
                   Working on it. Might be able to get a
                   hand loose ...
      Barbossa reaches forward awkwardly, hands still tied. Lifts his
      wooden leg, works hard to unscrew it.
                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                   You’ve a knife. Good.

      Jack watches as Barbossa removes a cup, built into the leg. He
      tips the leg, pouring out rum.
                                  JACK
                   I want one of those!
      Barbossa scoots the cup over to Jack. Jack gets a hand loose,
      drinks. Barbossa drinks from his wooden leg.
                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                   Here’s to revenge, sweet and clear.

                   Come clean with it, Hector. If you’d
                   wanted the Chalices, you’d have seen
                   they were missing and gone. You were
                   lying in wait. For Blackbeard.

                   Taken, not lost. We were off the coast
                   of Hispaniola when we came under attack.
                   No provocation nor warning nor offer of
                   parley. We were peppered with cannon
                   fire. And then the sea beneath the Pearl
                   began to roil.
                            (beat)
                   The Pearl was pitching and yawing

                   ... so violently it actually came to my

                   But too late. The Pearl began to creak,
                   every plank, every rail, every spar all
                   at once, making a hellish noise like

                   The rigging had come to life. Our own
                   ship, turned against us. Tangling my
                   crew, wrapping around them like snakes
                   ... wrapping around ... my leg.
      Jack looks down, sympathetic.

                But my arms were free. My sword was at
                hand. I am the master of my ship, not
                Blackbeard! I am the master of my fate,
                not Blackbeard! And so I did ... what
                needed done. I ... survived.
      Barbossa screws his leg back into place on its harness.
                               JACK
                So. You’re not after the Fountain?
                               BARBOSSA
                I care not for King George, or tavern
                yarns that give hope for a healed limb.
                But I’d give my left arm for a chance a
                Blackbeard.
                                  JACK
                Not your right?
                               BARBOSSA
                Need my good arm to run this poisoned
                blade through his heart --

                I’ll see you get the chance.
      Using the rope wrapped around the tree as leverage, he
      schootches up the trunk, to a crouched position, then standing,
      then OUT OF FRAME.
      The Guards notice what is happening --
153   EXT. PALM TREE GROVE - NIGHT                                      153
      Tree top level. Jack pushes aside the fronds, peeks out, swaying
      back and forth at this great height.
      Jack pulls free a coconut. With the frayed rope, he creates a
      kind of net, securing the coconut to the end, making a bolo.
      Jack spies the next palm tree over. Swings his bolo, flings the
      rope. The coconut CATCHES on the palm tree, wraps around. He
      winds the rope around his wrist, starts to PULL --
      The palm tree BENDS, coming closer. Jack PULLS harder.
154   BELOW, Barbossa and the Guards watch, incredulous.                154
155   Jack PULLS hard as he can --                                      155
      The two palm trees inch CLOSER to each other --
      Jack suddenly LEAPS off his perch -- the force of the released
      tension SLINGSHOTS Jack onto a third palm tree --

      it toward a fourth palm tree --
156   BELOW Soldiers spread out, disappear in tall ferns, avoiding     156
      COCONUTS that rain down -- one Soldiers is taken out --

                   Fan out! Find him! Don’t let him escape!
      Soldiers spread out, searching, climb up the trunks --
157   ON BARBOSSA, as he struggles. Suddenly Groves is there with      157
      Barbossa’s and Jack’s swords.
                                  GROVES
                   I’m guessing that was the signal --
158   ABOVE, Jack flies from one tree to another, SCREAMING --         158
159   Groves hands Barbossa his sword.     They run for it.            159
160   ABOVE, Jack appears through the fronds of the tree, ties his     160
      rope around the trunk, pushes off --

                   There! Over there! That tree, that one!
                   There he is!
      Jack swoops down, knocking away the soldier, then swings back
      up, out of sight --
      Guards gather at the tree trunk, looking up, following --
      ON JACK as his momentum spins him around the tree trunk, trees
      flashing by behind him --
      Jack nears the ground, and on the run, keeps running around the
      tree, catching the Soldiers, tying them to the trunk; he gives a
      final, satisfying tug --
      Jack races away --

      Angelica, holding Jack’s Compass, winds her way through a forest
      of Banyon trees, her group following behind. She pauses to wipe
      sweat from her brow. Ducks under a branch --
      -- to find Jack’s sword inches from her face.
                               ANGELICA
                How is it we can never meet without you
                pointing something at me?
      Blackbeard appears, with the rest of the landing party.
                               BLACKBEARD
                You brought them?
                                 JACK
                Aye.
      Jack steps aside. Behind him, a good twenty feet away, Gibbs
      holds down a WILD BOAR, squealing and struggling.
      Tied to the back of the boar are the silver Chalices.
                               ANGELICA
                You’ve found an accomplice.
                               BLACKBEARD
                And the one-legged man. He is near, aye?
                               JACK
                Aye. Now, before I go just handing them
                over, I’ve one or two conditions.
                               BLACKBEARD
                Name your terms.
                               JACK
                Firstly, I’ll be having my Compass back.
                No, that’s secondly. Firstly, upon your
                word, you will bring no harm to
                Angelica.
                               BLACKBEARD

                   But it cost me nothing to admit she was
                   never in harm’s way, and I’d give the
                   last ragged shred of my soul for her.
      Angelica can’t help but be moved at his words.
                                   JACK
                   Secondly, then, priorly firstly. I’ll be

                   Fine, then, and thirdly. Mister Teach
                   more famously known as Blackbeard, you
                   are not the only man in possession of a
                   tattered soul. As I reflect on my

                   poorly I have treated my loyal First

                   Left him to rot in jail, I did, without
                   a second thought or remorseful tingle.
                   Point being, I’ll not subject him to the
                   horrors to come. You’ll let him go free.

                   Aye. Quick, or the pig runs. And good
                   luck getting those Chalices.
                                  GIBBS
                   Jack, if it’s all the same to you, I’m
                   just as happy to --

      Chalices. Carries them past Jack, hands them to Blackbeard.

      An absolutely huge palm frond is pushed aside, revealing Jack’s
      entire body. He looks this way and that.
                               JACK
                I swear, it was somewhere right around
                here.
      Jack steps forward, followed by Angelica, Blackbeard,
      Blackbeard’s entourage, and a bound Philip.
      CLOSE ON: a second frond is pushed aside; behind it is only
      Jack’s face. The frond is small. Jack examines it, notes a drop
      of water on its edge. He shakes the drop onto his hand --
      The drop dances through Jack’s fingers, moving in and around,
      seeming at times to defy gravity, dripping upwards, and bending
      forward --
      Jack follows the angle of the drop, looks THROUGH THE WATER
      DROP, and sees, carved in the rock wall, the precise archaic
      symbol that was on Ponce de Leon’s map and in the ship’s log
      book. When the drop flies upwards off Jack’s finger, the
      distortion is gone, and the symbol is gone as well.
      Beneath the rock wall is REVEALED: a cave entrance, darkness
      arching over deep still waters.
      Jack smiles. He knows he’s close.

      The group sloshes through. A blue tint to the light reflected
      off the water. Stalactites hang from the darkness above.
      Ahead of the group, a Pirate reaches out, touches one of the
      stalactites. Next to him, a huge stalactite crashes down,
      impaling a Second Pirate beneath it.

                               JACK
                It’s not the destination so much as the
                journey, they say. The Chalices, if you
                please.
      Blackbeard indicates Jack be given the Chalices. The
      Quartermaster steps forward, pulls the Chalices from a pouch. He
      is protective of them, mistrustful, and reluctantly hands them
      over.
      Jack takes them, holds one in each hand, spreads his arms, then
      with a flourish, brings them together -- they CHIME.
      All wait. The chime FADES. Jack’s confident look falters. He
      CHIMES them again. Nothing.
      Angelica moves toward Jack, stalking him.
                               ANGELICA
                Jack. Have you ever in fact seen with
                your own eyes, heard with your own ears,
                or stood with those clumsy smelly feet
                at the Fountain of Youth?
                               JACK
                You know, I never actually said that I
                had.
      Blackbeard cries out in anger, outrage. He pulls one of his
      pistols, FIRES at Jack --
      -- in reflex, Jack raises a Chalice to his face; the bullet
      ricochets off. Jack gazes at the dent in wonder.
      Blackbeard aims another pistol -- Jack raises his hand.

                Wait.
      Jack stares at the Chalices. CLOSE ON: the inscribed words:

      streams, collecting upwards into a pool above their heads.
      They stare, not sure what to do -- and then a bird flies into
      the cave, a colorful TOH with distinctive tail -- and INTO the

                Interesting.

      Jack gestures for Scrum, who steps over. Jack shoves the
      Chalices at him as he unceremoniously climbs onto Scrum’s back.
      He pulls his sword, pushes it up into the pool -- the sword is
      wrenched from his hand, a strong current carrying it UPWARDS --
      It disappears. Jack shrugs, pushes upwards INTO THE WATER --
      suddenly SHOOTS UPWARDS --
167   CLOSE ON: Jack’s sword lies on the rocks. Jack grabs it, raises 167
      his eyes -- Angelica and Blackbeard climb out of a   pool behind
      him, all look out at --
      THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH
      Before them a natural basin, filled with water; the base of a
      tall crevice, sunlight beams down from above. Lush, covered with
      vines.
      In the center,   a raised mound with stone steps littered with
      ancient, human   skeletons; all is covered with moss. On top of
      the mound is a   large, natural open stone formation in the form
      of a circle. A   delicate stream of water pours from a crack in
      its middle.
      Around the stone are huge carved structures, artifacts of some
      civilization long past. Scattered about are skeletons, victims
      of previous expeditions.
      The group moves across the cavern, through the water, onto the
      wide stepping stones, taking in the scene with awe.
                                 ANGELICA
                So beautiful.
      Jack is entranced. He comes up to the central stone. As he
      approaches, some of the vines move, growing backwards,
      withdrawing from the central stone. Jack reaches to touch the
      water --
                               BLACKBEARD
                Stand back! I’ll be the first to drink
                those waters!

      Blackbeard strides up the steps. Angelica turns to Scrum, but
      then looks past him --

      Behind them -- surprise! -- Barbossa is there; he steps forward
      leaning on his crutch, stops. Behind him, his entire party,
      including Groves and Gillette, emerge, rising up from the pool.
      Blackbeard doesn’t even need to look.
                               BLACKBEARD
                Ah. The one-legged man.
                               BARBOSSA
                Aye.
      Blackbeard glances at the Quartermaster, who nods.
                               BLACKBEARD
                You came. As you must. The instrument of

                As I musted.
      Barbossa strides forward, speaking for all to hear --
                               BARBOSSA
                Edward Teach. For crimes committed on

      Blackbeard removes his coat, readying to battle.
                               BLACKBEARD
                My trick’s over, is that it?

                torture of a most heinous sorts,

      Blackbeard draws his sword.

      Barbossa draws his own sword. Behind him, Groves and the others
      draw as well. Blackbeard closes his eyes, nods.

                Hold.
      Everyone actually stops. Jack is surprised, but goes with it. He
      counts each side, bobbing his finger.
                               JACK (CONT'D)

                Where's the sense?
      He looks at Scrum, who shrugs, he doesn't know.
                               JACK (CONT'D)
                Exactly. I say let ‘em fight each other,
                while we lay back, watch, and place
                wagers. Aye?
      For a moment it seems they all might go for it. Then --

168   The two sides rush each other, swords clashing --               168
169   Barbossa takes on Blackbeard. Two expert swordsmen, fearless,   169
      crafty, fighting over the slippery stones --
      Jack darts away from the fight, back around the Fountain.
      Barbossa loses his sword, knocks Blackbeard away with his
      crutch. Blackbeard spins, thrusts his sword, a killing blow,
      just as Gillette is knocked into the sword’s path.

      Gillette gets run through, and falls back, dead, into Barbossa’s
      arms. Barbossa stares a moment, then tosses him aside --

      out of Gillette, the two re-engage --

      pulls back his sword, and slashes hard -- but Salaman drops
      into a deep hole, and so avoids losing his head --

      helps pull Salaman out of the hole, and they race away --

                And the tear! Follow!
171   Scrum nods, clutches the pouch with the Mermaid’s tear. A        171
      British Soldier cuts him off, so he takes another route -- but
      then Jack appears, cutting him off.
                               JACK
                Hand it over. The tear. There’s a good

                I’m more afraid of her than you.
      Scrum draws his sword --
172   ELSEWHERE, the Quartermaster drives a British soldier back and   172
      slays him. He turns away. Philip slides his bound wrists onto
      the fallen soldier’s blade, trying to cut his bonds --
      Suddenly the Cabin Boy is there; he quickly cuts the rope.
                               CABIN BOY
                Now we’re square.
                                 PHILIP
                Square.
173   The Cabin boy takes off as Philip stands, and turns -- and      173
      unexpectedly takes a sword thrust into his side from a passing
      British SOLDIER. Philip spins, falls against a stone. He presses
      his hand to the wound, turns and slips off, back the direction
      they came --
174   Jack faces off against Scrum, moves his sword to his other hand,174
      and back again; Scrum puts the pouch in his mouth, and does the
      same, mirroring Jack. Jack slams his foot into Scrum’s stomach;
      the pouch pops out, Jack catches it.
                                 JACK
                Hah.
      Jack turns -- and Angelica is there, sword leveled. Two Chalices
      in her other hand. Beside him, Scrum pushes his sword into
      Jack’s neck.

                Hand it over, there’s a good lad.

                Don’t test me, Jack.
      Jack nods. Suddenly tosses the pouch toward her --
      Angelica has no free hand to catch it, so she tosses both
      Chalices to Scrum, and she catches the pouch --
      Scrum catches both Chalices, but only by dropping the sword to
      Jack’s neck --
                                  JACK
                Hah!
      Jack picks up Scrum’s sword, tosses it hilt first at Angelica.
      She has to throw the pouch to Scrum to catch the sword.
      Jack snags the pouch out of the air. Jack now has the pouch
      back, with his sword, and Scrum is standing there, holding the
      Chalices in each hand. Angelica has two swords. Jack kicks the
      Chalices away --
      Angelica and Jack look at each other, dive for them --

      Syrena, still half in the water, tied at the wrists, shuts her
      eyes, giving up. A SHADOW falls across her --

                Strange. I expected Fate ... to put up

178   THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY SPANISH SOLDIERS. Dozens of them,         178
      standing silent as sentries.
      Blackbeard spins. More Spanish soldiers step forth from hiding
      places; others can be seen emerging from the pool.
      Jack emerges from the struggle with Angelica with the dropped
      Chalices. Turns, sees the Spanish. Lots of them.
      Uh-oh. Jack realizes he doesn’t want to be caught holding the
      Chalices, shoves them at Angelica.
      Out of the fog appears --
      The Spaniard. Silent, calm, and commanding. He is backed by
      soldiers carrying tall banners of the Spanish Monarchy.

      well. Groves crumples to the ground.
                               SPANIARD
                Someone make a note of that man’s
                bravery.
                         (to Angelica)
                Senorita. The Chalices. If you please.
      Angelica hesitates. Soldiers push her to her knees, take the two
      silver Chalices. Jack looks on, hand on the pouch.
      The Chalices are given to the Spaniard. He takes them gingerly,
      looks upon them with great satisfaction.
      Blackbeard stares, livid. Angelica watches with cold fury.
      Barbossa looks on, satisfied. Jack takes in the scene,
      calculating.
      The Spaniard turns toward the Fountain. Raises the Chalices to
      the sky. He proclaims:
                               SPANIARD (CONT'D)
                There is but One Source of life eternal,
                and it is not these pagan waters.
      Behind him, all the Catholic Soldiers make the sign of the
      cross. Suddenly -- surprisingly -- the Spaniard throws the
      Chalices to the ground. Stomps on them --
      Angelica gasps -- even Jack is surprised --
      The Spaniard takes the bent Chalices and flings them far into
      the water. The silver glints as they sink into oblivion --
                               SPANIARD (CONT'D)
                Men. Destroy this profane temple. Crush
                that stone.
179   His men set quickly to work. Boulders are toppled. Ropes are      179
      tossed and pulled, the statues begin to tilt over. British
      soldiers, seeing they are outnumbered, flee.
      The Spaniard comes opposite Blackbeard. He levels his sword.
                               SPANIARD
                You are a fool. You seek in this place
                what only faith can provide.
      Blackbeard stares back. His last hope gone.

                   Faith. In faith there is light enough to
                   see ... but darkness enough to blind.
      Blackbeard raises his sword --
      Blackbeard cries out, and looks over. The back of his arm has
      been slashed.
                                  BLACKBEARD (CONT'D)
                   What devilry is this?
      He turns -- Barbossa runs his sword into Blackbeard’s gut,
      driving him to the ground.
                                     BARBOSSA
                   For the Pearl.
      The Spaniard lowers his sword.
                                     SPANIAND
                   Savages.
      He turns away to oversee the destruction. Blackbeard tries to
      rise, cannot. He begins to convulse, sweat.
      Angelica stares at Blackbeard, looks to Barbossa.
                                  ANGELICA
                   What have you done?
      Angelica races to her father. His hands are on the hilt of
      Barbossa’s sword, so she grabs it by the blade --
                                     JACK
                   Angelica, no --
      Angelica pulls the sword out and lets it drop, her hands slashed
      and bleeding.
                                     JACK (CONT'D)
                   No.
                                  BARBOSSA
                   I'm not such the fool as to take on
                   Blackbeard without a little ... venomous
                   advantage.
      She realizes what she has done. Stares at her hands --
      Barbossa lifts Blackbeard’s broken sword.
                                  BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
                   I claim Blackbeard’s ship and crew. And
                   this sword, wergild for me missing limb.

      Barbossa turns away. The pirates of Blackbeard’s crew make their
      choice, join him. They disappear, as the Spanish continue the
      destruction of the Fountain --
      Jack leans down near the surface of the water, searches
      desperately for the Chalices. Angelica collapses.
                                 ANGELICA
                Jack. Help me.
      ON JACK, as he searches the waters. Angelica and Blackbeard lay
      still, near death.
      One of the tall columns is tilted over, SMASHING onto the
      Fountain, the final destructive blow.
      The Spaniard surveys his work.
                               SPANIARD
                Thy will be done.
      Nods ... gestures for his men to withdraw.
180   Only Jack is left, still searching. He sees something. Something180
      rising toward him, out of the depths --
      It is Syrena.
      Jack watches as she emerges from the water. The silver Chalices -
      - battered and twisted -- sparkle in her hands. Syrena holds
      them out. He looks at her in wonder ... takes them, and nods his
      thanks.
      Syrena lowers her head ... suddenly twists, and disappears back
      into the water.
      Jack climbs quickly to the fallen, cracked basin. Very little
      water left. He fills one Chalice. The water is running out; he
      fills the other ... getting the very last drop.
      The Fountain is now dry. Jack removes the vial from the pouch,
      uncorks, pours. Jack rouses Angelica. She sits up, barely
      conscious.
                               ANGELICA
                I am going to die.
                               JACK
                No. You're not. Well, yes. But even so,
                you will be all right.
      Jack holds the two Chalices. Raises the right Chalice.
                               JACK (CONT'D)
                Drink this. This one has the tear.
      Angelica considers the Chalice.

                   sacrifice for the other.
                                  ANGELICA

                   Edward. She's dying. Save your daughter.
      Blackbeard takes one Chalice, then the other.
                                  BLACKBEARD
                   This one has the tear, and gives life.
                   This one takes life.
                                  JACK
                   Aye. Hurry.
      Blackbeard turns to Angelica -- and quickly drinks the cup with
      the tear.
                                  BLACKBEARD
                   I am sorry. Angelica. I am a bad man.
                   Save me, my daughter.
      She looks at him, shocked; deep in her eyes, we see a familiar
      hurt. A glance at Jack -- who takes no joy in the fact that he
      was right.
      Angelica takes the second cup. Looks up at Blackbeard.
                                  ANGELICA
                   I love you, father.
      -- and drinks. Jack frowns. Looks again at the two cups.
                                  JACK
                   Or ... wait ... was it the other way
                   around? This cup had the tear, that cup -
                   - hmmmn.
                                  BLACKBEARD
                   Devil. Trickster --
      Blackbeard leaps for Jack, but staggers. Crumples down, falls
      onto the side of the carved pedestal.

      Blackbeard stands ... and suddenly the flowing waters of the
      Fountain seem to find him. Circle him. Entwine him. He is
      covered in water, chokes, unable to breathe --
      Angelica stands, reaches for him -- his eyes bulge, he is
      drowning on dry land. Angelica glances down. The bleeding on her
      hands has stopped. Her skin closes over the wound, smooth, not
      even a scar. She whirls.
                               ANGELICA (CONT'D)
                No! Jack, you bastard --

                redeemed.
      Angelica curses, raises the sword. Hears a sound. Looks --
181   Blackbeard’s body has already completely rotted away, like a    181
      corpse many months under the water. His skin dissolves, leaving
      nothing but bones --
      Jack looks, sees -- the Zombies, looking on, collapse, begin to
      decompose.
      The water around Blackbeard suddenly drops. Nothing is left,
      now, but a standing skeleton.
      And yet Blackbeard’s will is so strong, one last, sad, reach for
      her hand ... and then his BONES loosen and FALL, his skeleton
      joining the others, a few bones separating and clattering away.
      ANGELICA’s will is gone; she crumples to the ground.

      edge of one of the pools. He dips his palm into the water,
      raises his hand for a drink.
      As the ripples in the water clear, EYES gaze up at him. It is
      Syrena, her face just below the surface.
      Syrena rises, her face emerging, TRANSFORMING into human at the

      places it on his head.
      He throws back his long coat, and draws Blackbeard's heavy sword

                   I only helped Blackbeard do what any
                   father should have done.
                                    ANGELICA
                   You are cruel.
                                  JACK
                   But fair, and fair is not the same as
                   favorable.
      She looks past him, sees the small island ahead --
191   EXT.   SOLA FIDE BEACH - DAY                                     191
      Angelica is flung down onto the sand. Jack drops a pistol beside
      her.
                                  JACK
                   A pistol. One shot.
                                  ANGELICA
                   To kill myself before I starve?
                                  JACK
                   This is a well-travelled trade route.
                   You could signal a passing ship.

                   Or you could sing, and lure some other
                   sailor to his doom.
                                  ANGELICA
                   How am I to get free of these bonds?
      Jack heads off, readies the longboat for launch.
                                  JACK
                   You worked free of your bonds about a
                   half hour ago, and you've been waiting
                   for a chance to jump me ever since.
      Jack whirls back -- and Angelica is RIGHT THERE, her hands free,
      a piece of driftwood raised to club him.
                                  ANGELICA
                   Admit it. You love me still.
                                   JACK
                   If you had a sister, and a dog ... I’d
                   choose the dog.
      Jack pushes the boat to the water. Angelica drops the driftwood,
      wades out from the shore.
                                  ANGELICA
                   Jack. I am with child. Yours.
                                  JACK
                   Funny. I don't recall that we --
                                     ANGELICA
                   You were drunk.
                                  JACK
                   There is not enough rum in the seven
                   seas.
                                     ANGELICA

                            (he stops)
                   Treasure. There is a chest. You close
                   the lid, and when you open it, whatever
                   you most desire, is inside.
      Jack laughs again, pushes the boat into the water.
                                  ANGELICA (CONT'D)
                   Jewels. Jewels with the power to rule
                   the wind and tide.
                                  JACK

                 Don't go. There's ... something I have
                 to tell you.
                          (turns him to her)
                 Words I have yearned to say from the
                 moment we first met, and every moment
                 since.

                 I love you.
                                JACK
                 As do I. And so, as an act of reverence
                 and ardor for us both --
      Jack looks very pleased with himself --
                                  JACK (CONT'D)
                 We're through.
      Angelica expected a kiss, gets only empty air. Turns to see:
      Jack has pushed the longboat well out into the waves.
                                ANGELICA
                 THIS IS NOT OVER!
      Angelica races back up the sand --
      ON JACK, as he rows away, through the surf. The SOUND of a
      single SHOT; he ducks. Behind him, water plumes.
                                  JACK
                 Missed!
192   EXT.   COASTLINE - BEACH - SUNSET                              192
      The longboat, mast in place but sail furled, is beached on a
      sandy shore. A trail of footsteps leads to Jack as he walks away
      from it, to where --
      Gibbs, perched on gnarly driftwood roots, waits for him.
                                JACK
                 Gibbs, you ugly besotted shellback, you
                 made it!

                 Aye!
                                JACK
                 And I trust we managed a profit from our
                 joint enterprise?

                   Feast your eyes.
      Gibbs hops down, points: on one of the roots is the BLACK PEARL,
      encased in its glass bottle. Jack stoops, gazes at it.
                                  GIBBS (CONT'D)
                   The Compass led me straight and true.
                                  JACK
                   What of Blackbeard’s men, guarding the
                   ship?
                                  GIBBS
                   Jack. I’m Joshamee Gibbs!
      Jack notes a gunny sack on the sand. Gibbs follow his gaze.
                                  GIBBS (CONT'D)
                   Seemed a shame to leave an entire Armada
                   behind.
                                   JACK
                   Shame indeed.
      Jack picks up the bottle. He holds it eye level, lining the
      Black Pearl up with the horizon --
                                  GIBBS
                   So. Any idea how to get it out?
193   INSIDE, Jack’s face looms huge and distorted in the sky.       193
      Cotton’s Parrot SQUAWKS from the helmsman’s wheel. Jack the
      Monkey climbs to the crow’s nest, SCREECHES out at them --
                                  JACK
                   We will need a crossbow, an hourglass,
                   three goats, and one of us must learn to
                   play the trumpet.
                                  GIBBS

194   LATER, ON THE BEACH, Gibbs stoops, hefts the sack, bottles     194
      inside clanking. He looks like some Caribbean Santa Claus.
                                  GIBBS
                   Jack, I have to ask. There you were, you
                   had the Chalices, the water, the tear.
                   You could have lived, well, maybe
                   forever.

JUDGE:
You are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life
at the Lompoc Maximum Security
Prison system
without the possibility
of early parole.
Here's what we know so far.
This is all the aftermath of
a daring, daylight breakout.
There were 26 high-risk
inmates being transferred...
A daring midday breakout where everyone
on board has been accounted for,
except for one,
Dominic Toretto.
Police have
just released the identity
of the man they believe to have
orchestrated the shocking escape
that amazingly resulted in no
fatalities this afternoon.
He is former federal agent,
Brian O'Conner.
A fierce manhunt is underway
for three fugitives tonight.
Multiple federal and local
agencies have joined forces
in the search
for Dominic Toretto
and his accomplices Brian
O'Conner and Mia Toretto.
But despite every eye in the
country looking for them
where Toretto and O'Conner
are now is anyone's guess.
It's got to be it, right?
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Let's get out of here.
VINCE:
(VINCE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

Page 2/47

Easy, friends.
She's with me.
Mia.
Vince.
Buster.
Come on.
Dom here yet?
No.
When was the last time
you heard from him?
A couple of weeks ago.
Up in Ecuador somewhere.
VINCE:
What's that?
To be on the other side
of a wanted poster?
He'll show up.
Yeah.
Dom's?
Yeah.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Time for bed little one.
Can I bring him?
Of course.
MIA:
Good night.
Excuse me, sorry.
Why Rio, Vince?
You mean after you
screwed everything up in LA?
Ended up free-falling through
South America, you know,
hitting every hellhole
on the way down.
Would have kept
on going if not for Rosa.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Does he know?
So, listen.
There is a job coming up.
I was hoping Dom
was going to be here by now

Page 3/47

but this one is clean enough
we can do it without him.
It's a good gig.
Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.
Guy I know is putting together
a team to swipe them.
Just need a few more
willing bodies.
I don't know.
Look, the way the car
scene is down here
we can unload them quick
and get top dollar.
It's easy money.
And from where I'm sitting,
it looks like you both
could use the payday.
What are you reading?
Travel guide.
Yeah?
Tokyo.
Moscow.
Goa.
You want to know what all of
these places have in common?
Huh?
No extradition.
Here we go.
Excuse me, buddy.
Okay.
Hey, we've found them.
Yeah, second-to-the-last
freighter.
What is it?
DEA tags. These cars
have been seized.
Look who showed up.
God, I'm so happy you're okay.
I thought I told you
to lay low.
Been running on fumes.
Had to make a call.
Hey! Quit talking.
We only got the two-minute window.

Page 4/47

Let's go, Vince.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
I'm taking the GT40.
Ladies first.
Hey!
MIA:
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
This car suits me better.
See you, baby.
It's okay...
we're all going to the same place.
We'll get the car there.
Change of plans.
Wait for my call.
Let's go!
Where is she going?
Where is she going?
Hey!
Hey!
We're being robbed!
Whatever happens, don't stop the train!
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Go after the girl!
Hurry up!
Access card!
Get the access card!
Shit.
Bridge! There is a bridge!
Luggage car is clear.
Freeze!
Oh, Shit!
You had to make a call, huh?
Shitty call, O'Conner.
Shitty call.
You two stirred up
quite a bit of trouble today.
Three of my men dead.
Three DEA agents
along with them.
Of course,
this is business
and sometimes
things go astray.

Page 5/47

All I care about is the car.
Tell me where it is,
and I'll let you go.
BRIAN:
you're full of shit. (REYES LAUGHING)
I don't know how you guys do
business in your part of the world,
but here in Rio,
I like it when all parties
know what they're up against.
DOM:
Because it goes both ways.
You know,
I hear your sister
is very beautiful.
Wherever she hides
I Will find her.
(NEWSCASTER SPEAKING
PORTUGUESE)
The American fugitives killed three
DEA agents during a train robbery...
...Police warn they are armed
and extremely dangerous.
Anyone with information should contact
law enforcement immediately...
BRIAN:
Hey.
You okay?
Yeah, you all right?
Hey.
Hey, yeah.
Just like a Toretto.
Where's Vince?
That's a good question.
He'll be here.
Guys, we're all over
the news.
They're blaming us for the Killing
of those DEA agents on the train.
Which means we just jumped
to the top of the wanted list.

Page 6/47

The feds have got to show everyone
their agents are off limits
and they're going to send their best guys.
We got to get out of here.
One thing we know for sure
is that they wanted this car.
Because something is in it.
If we find out what it is, we'll
know what we're up against.
HOBBS:
The men we're after are professional runners.
They like speed and are guaranteed
to go down the hardest possible way
so make sure you got
your funderwear on.
We find them, we take them as a
team, and we bring them back.
And above all else, we don't ever,
ever let them get into cars.
Crime scene is 10 hours old and counting, men.
Let's go hunting.
Agente Hobbs!
Chief of Police, Joo Alemeida.
Luke.
Sorry to hear about
the loss of your men.
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?
Let me tell you something
about these two men.
One is a former federal officer,
been in deep cover for five years.
He knows every way you're
going to come for him.
The other one is a professional
criminal, escaped prison twice,
spent half his life on the
run avoiding folks like you.
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help the DSS...
Two things.
One, I need a translator.
We have plenty in the public

Page 7/47

relations department.
Elena Neves.
A patrol officer?
You heard me.
But why? We have many
more experienced people.
I like her smile.
What's the second thing?
Stay the fuck out of my way.
Brian.
Hm?
I have something
I have to tell you.
VINCE:
What a mess!
Where you been, man?
You better check that tone.
And you just better answer
the goddamn question.
Stop it!
Both of you.
Where were you, Vince?
Guys all over the favelas
asking about you.
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.
Had to wait them out.
That is such horseshit
That was your job,
and those were your guys! Hey!
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!
If he said he didn't do it,
he didn't do it.
Go walk it off.
REYES:
my operations into your countries
but, quite frankly, your business
methods are too violent.
Let me tell you a true story.
Five hundred years ago, the
Portuguese and the Spanish came here,
each trying to get the country

Page 8/47

from their natives.
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,
determined to prove who was boss.
The natives killed
every single Spaniard.
Personally, I prefer
the methods of the Portuguese.
They came bearing gifts.
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.
Things that the natives
couldn't get on their own,
but to continue receiving them, they
had to work for the Portuguese.
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.
Now, if you dominate
the people with violence,
they will eventually fight back
because they have nothing to lose.
And that's the key.
I go into the favelas and
give them something to lose.
Electricity, running water,
school rooms for their kids.
And for that taste
of a better life,
I own them.
Gentlemen.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
I apologize for
the interruption.
Senior Reyes,
may I speak with you?
We've found them.
Pardon me, gentlemen.
DOM:
I didn't see that.
Almost.
Wait, Dom.
Mia was on that train.
My sister!
I didn't know.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

Page 9/47

You set up the deal!
I thought the job
was for the cars.
I didn't know.
All they want is the chip.
Damn!
You should've come clean.
What's going on out here?
Nothing.
Please, Dom, just let me have the chip.
I can take this to them.
They'll give it to Reyes
and set things right.
Get out.
What?
Get out!
You never listen to me.
Not when I told you
he was a cop, and not now.
You never trust me
and look where it's gotten us.
Look at our family now.
I can't go home!
Your sister is stuck in this life!
Where's Letty, Dom?
Where's Letty?
Plasma cutter.
Wilkes, I want a list
of every place within 50 miles
that distributes
compressed gas tanks.
Pass me that manifest.
Officer Neves.
Been waiting for you.
You asked for me?
I did.
May I ask why?
My smile
is not that great.
Your husband was an officer who
was gunned down in the favela.
Six months later, you upped
and joined the force.
You're motivated.

Plus, I figure you're the only
one in Rio who cant be bought.
Am I right?
Yes.
Of course I am.
Good news, bad news.
You know I like
my dessert first.
Back-checked
the rail line like you asked.
Found a couple of spots
where they unloaded the cars.
One set of tracks
headed west
until it hit the main highway,
then disappeared.
But another set
of tracks headed east.
A 107-inch wheelbase,
eight-and-a-half-inch tread.
The GT40 that was missing
from the manifest.
Followed the trail
a couple of miles.
Pretty easy in this scrub.
Can't move without
leaving a sign.
Give me the damn veggies.
The ground rolls into a hardpack
and we lost that track, too.
Not necessarily.
That road heads up through
the hills into the favelas.
Couple of years ago,
it was washed out by a storm.
It's all dirt a mile
from where you were.
If they headed that way, we'll
pick up their tracks there.
You come prepared.
I'm motivated.
HOBBS:
Let's find ourselves a car.

Page 11/47

What do you think?
Well, it's definitely
a custom chip.
Look at all these side menus
here for data entry.
Let's check this one.
Look at that.
Same building,
same order every week.
It's a delivery schedule.
What's this?
Drugs?
No. That's a dealer pack.
See, most major players,
they weigh their money
so they don't have
to constantly count it.
Right there,
that's 49 kilos.
49 kilos is a million
in twenties.
You're saying each one of these
shipments is worth 10 million dollars?
Yeah.
I thought so.
So what is that?
A 100-million plus
in cash houses?
That's how he keeps it
off the grid.
I think it's safe to say that
Reyes is smart to want this back.
It's his whole network right
there, just laid out on a chip.
Wilkes, Fusco,
up the middle.
Mac, Chato,
flank north.
What about me?
Stay here.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Go that way!
The other two
went over the wall!

Page 12/47

Come on, go! Go!
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Get on the ground.
I got Toretto.
Four blocks north of your...
They already know
who you are.
(YELLING IN PORTUGUESE)
Let's go.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
You okay here?
Yeah. I'm good.
Thank you.
They're going to be looking for
the three of us together now.
We need to split up.
You and Mia head south,
I'll lead them away.
No.
Dom is right.
Look how lucky we just got.
What happens next time?
We have no choice
but to split up.
I'm pregnant.
I already lost
my family once.
I'm not going through
that again.
Are you kidding me?
No.
I'm not going
anywhere. Okay?
Dom?
Promise me
we stick together.
I promise.
Our family
just got bigger.
Something
doesn't add up.
Toretto and O'Conner.
They stay when they're supposed to run,
they steal gas then give it away?

Page 13/47

Now they're killing
federal agents?
It doesn't make any sense.
Here's what makes sense.
All these guys are
is names on a list.
They come up,
we take them down.
Not a phone call more,
not a bullet less.
Wilkes, we get anything?
Standard forensics.
Shoe prints.
Hair and fiber.
Prints are all over the car.
Anything else?
Yeah, we tracked the owner
off the vehicle ID.
There are a couple of shell
companies in between,
but we finally traced it
back to a corporation
owned by an investor down
here named Hernan Reyes.
Investor?
If theres anything illegal happening
in Rio, Reyes is involved.
Okay, then so are we.
If he could get us any closer to our
guys, I want everything on him.
Chato, you're
on the roof.
I want you on overwatch in case
somebody comes back for something.
Mac, give me a cross-check
on Reyes, full specs.
If he goes to the john, I want to
know how many times he shakes it.
You got it, boss.
Wilkes, Fusco!
Let's put all this
mess back together.
That's going to take a while.
Then you better get started.

Page 14/47

They were taking
this car apart for a reason.
Let's put it back together
and find out what's missing.
Hey, Dom, what do you
remember about your father?
My father.
He used to...
He used to have a barbecue
every Sunday after church.
For anybody
in the neighborhood.
If you didn't go to church,
you didn't get any barbecue.
Every single day he was in the
shop, and every single night,
he was at the kitchen table with Mia,
helping her with her homework.
Even after she went to sleep,
he'd stay up
for a few more hours
so he could learn the next chapter
and help her the next day.
I remember everything
about my father.
Everything.
That's just it.
I don't remember shit
about my dad.
I don't remember
him yelling.
I don't remember
him smiling.
To be honest with you, I don't even
remember what the hell he looked like.
I don't remember.
He just...
He was just never there.
You ain't going
to be like that, Brian.
We can't keep
running, Dom.
We got to get out.
We got to get out now.

Page 15/47

You're right.
Here's how we're
going to do it.
We're going to use this.
We're going do one last job.
We're going to take
all of Reyes' money.
Every dime of it,
and disappear.
Forever.
New passports.
New lives with no more
looking over our shoulder.
And we're just going
to buy our freedom.
That's right.
You realize we're talking
about going up against
the most powerful guy
in all of Rio?
Yes, we are.
Then we're going
to need a team.
Let's run through the bases real quick.
Who do we got?
First we're going
to need a chameleon.
Someone who can
blend in anywhere.
What else?
A fast talker.
Someone who can bullshit
their way out of anything.
I got that.
This guy is going to have
a lot of surveillance.
We're going to need someone
whos good with circuits.
DOM:
Reyes is going to have wells.
We're going to need guys
to punch through those walls.

Page 16/47

MIA:
Utilities and weapons.
Someone who ain't
afraid to throw down.
Someone to back up
every position.
BRIAN:
do we need?
DOM:
we're going to need
two precision drivers.
Guys that don't crack
under pressure.
Guys that never lose.
You know we got that.
Aw, hell, no!
I see they really scraped
the bottom of the barrel, huh?
I guess they did,
since your ass is here.
When are you going to give
Martin Luther King his car back?
As soon as you give
Rick James his jacket back.
What's up, man?
What's up?
Hmm.
Sexy legs,
baby girl.
What time do they open?
They open the same time
as I pull this trigger.
Want me to open them?
(TEGO SPEAKING SPANISH)
I told you the skinny
chick had balls.
Looks like she started
the party without us.
Hey, anybody can talk shit
in Spanish, homie.
What's this guy saying?
Ugly is still ugly in

Page 17/47

Spanish or in English.
(BOTH TAUNTING IN SPANISH)
Who are these clowns, man?
Circus clowns.
I thought cockfights
were illegal in Brazil.
I see you all have met.
You know when you called me
to come to Rio
I assumed it would be for something
more exciting than this.
Look at this guy.
Long time.
I missed you, man.
Good to see you.
Brother.
What's up?
Yo, check this out.
This is Tej.
Best circuit man
on the East Coast.
And this is my boy,
Roman Pearce.
We go way back,
I met this guy in juvie.
I pulled that job
with him in Miami.
I've heard about you.
Nice digs.
Yeah, well,
the Ritz was sold out.
So what's this
all about, Dom?
Yeah, man, why did you drag
us halfway around the world?
Because we got a job.
All right, so our target's
name is Hernan Reyes.
And he runs
the drug scene down here.
He's never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.
No paper trail
means no banks.

Page 18/47

And no banks means
cash houses.
That's right.
Ten of them, to be exact.
Spread throughout the city.
And we're going
to hit them all.
All of them?
All of them.
That sounds crazy.
You bring us
to a whole other country
so we can rob
the dude who runs it?
I thought this was business.
Sounds personal to me.
Is that what this is?
I got love for y'all, but
personal ain't good business.
I can't do this, homie.
So what we're talking
about is $100 million.
You say what?
Hundred... See, sometimes
I be over thinking, man,
and I know we just met, but
you just, kind of, got to...
That's right, $100 million,
and everything we take,
we split even.
TEJ:
$11 million apiece.
I am down.
I'm in.
Eleven million.
Sounds like a whole lot of
vaginal activity to me.
You can't pull off 10 heists
on the same mark.
You just can't.
As soon as we hit
the first one,
they're going to do everything

Page 19/47

they can to protect the rest.
Exactly.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Nobody move!
That's all of it.
You a dead man.
You're all dead men!
You don't have
a place to hide.
Who's hiding?
THUG:
Are you crazy?
Do you know whose house this is?
Whose money are you stealing?
We ain't stealing it.
You tell your boss
exactly who did this.
Tell him there's more coming.
Voil.
Turn it over.
She's running on all eight.
Checks out fine.
Keep looking.
Boss, if something
was missing, we'd know.
It's a goddamn shame putting
bullshit like that on a classic.
You may as well slap
neon lights on it.
They took the chip.
We got a hit on the police scanner.
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.
Address cross-checks
against property
owned by one
of Hernan Reyes' corporations.
All right,
if that's our guys
then whatever was on that chip
led them directly to that house.
It's them, for sure.
How do you know that?
Because no one else in Rio

Page 20/47

is stupid enough to rob Reyes.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Explain.
They invaded
the Leblon house.
Who invaded?
The men from the train.
How much did they take?
They didn't
take anything.
They burned it!
They burned my money?
Yes. And said
there's more coming.
Okay...
Then this...
...is what
we're going to do.
Clean the houses.
I want that money
under lock and key...
...within an hour.
Understand?
Understood.
Number One
is on the move, man.
ROME:
I got mine.
I got eyes on Five.
I know y'all said they were
consolidating the money somewhere, but,
y'all ain't going
to believe this.
Well, this job just got
a lot harder.
If he's moving it
into a police station
he's got some serious
brass in his pocket.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Looks like this is going to be a
shorter trip than I thought...
Hell, yeah,

Page 21/47

we can't do this.
"Can't"'? You mean,
"shouldn't."
I think this doesn't
change a thing.
I say we stick to the plan.
You say what?
This just went
from Mission:
to Mission:
In-freaking-sanity.
Whatever, man.
I ain't scared, I'm just letting you all
know, going in that building is crazy.
BRIAN:
What time
was the robbery?
Around 11:
Here we go.
Enhance it.
Their faces are covered.
Run it through FRS.
Well, hello,
you son of a bitch.
Wilkes! Run the photos of known
associates of Toretto and O'Conner
against customs entries into
Brazil in the last two weeks.
Check planes, trains, boats, everything
short of the goddamn space shuttle.
They can change their names but
they can't change their faces.
Something big
is going down.
That's a 1970 Charger.
Fusco! Upload these specs
into the database.
Have the computer cross-check
it with overhead satellites
every 15 minutes,

Page 22/47

the van behind it, too.
If these vehicles move in the streets
of Rio, I want to know about it.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Everything okay?
Everything is okay.
Who is this Hobbs?
This Federal Agent running around town?
Some American cowboy.
He's handled.
He killed sixteen
of our men.
Handle him better.
Look... He requested a rookie
patrol officer as his assistant.
They won't be a problem.
It's all here?
Yes.
What about Toretto and O'Conner?
Where are they?
Nothing yet.
But I have all our
officers searching.
Not good enough.
Put a price
on their heads.
High enough...
...to get every pair of eyes in
the city searching for them.
The beauty of public offices?
Public records.
This is where he's keeping the money.
The vault in the evidence room.
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's
attention, right here, for a second?
We're talking about breaking
into a police station.
Is anyone listening
to those words?
Anybody? Popo?
Five-O. One-time. Pigs.
People we don't like.
You know, police stations are
designed to keep people in, not out.

Page 23/47

That's why it's
a stealth mission.
We'll be in and out before
they even know we were there.
Well, we'll need
to get eyes in there.
At least to find out the make
and model of that vault.
So the vault
and then, so...
it's crazy.
Who's supposed
to do all this?
What do you mean?
Why me?
Because you got
the biggest mouth.
That's for damn sure.
Ooh.
Hello, beautiful.
Look at those dimples.
Sexy, sexy.
Love those glasses.
Where did you get them from?
Are those like Gucci frames
or something?
No English?
No, no, no. Damn.
How are you, sir?
Special Agent O'Conner.
US Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It says Caucasian.
That's a tan.
You know, a tan?
Look, I'm working this case and I
got some evidence here to be held.
But I need to get in and check
your storage facility first.
Nope.
Look, I know you're a true professional,
and I respect you, I promise.
You know, it looks like you
work out a little bit, too.
What do you bench,

Page 24/47

about 350?
Ah, Shit.
Look, I'm just trying
to do my job, man.
My boss sent me here to just make
sure that everything was safe.
It will be safe.
Let me just come in
and take a quick peek.
Nope.
Come on, man.
Hook a brother up, please?
Nope. And you're
not my brother.
Brother from
another mother?
Look! No one enters the facility
but authorized evidence personnel.
Now stop wasting my time.
I'm going to call
the embassy.
No,no,no!
No, we're good.
We don't need to call them.
For what? We're good.
Here, I got the box.
We're all good.
I promise you.
Thank you so much for your time.
Swear to God, if you were on
the other side of that glass
I'd bust your damn face in.
Now translate that.
It's done. See, I think I make a better
special agent than you ever did.
Well, that depends
on how you define "special."
TEJ:
Let's see what we got.
Not funny.
All right, come on.
Dawg,
you still can't drive.

Page 25/47

Now, I see why you're always
getting into accidents.
You can't even drive
a damn remote control car.
I'm going to need you
to shut up right now.
I'm not going to shut up.
Shut up.
Strap him in his
safety belt, man.
Give me the remote,
dawg. Go left.
It looks like something right over
there to the left. What is that?
BRIAN:
Bingo.
What is that,
six-by-six?
Eight-by-twelve.
Seven-by-twelve.
Fitted with 18-inch-thick
steel reinforced walls
with a insulated copper core to
protect against thermal lance.
A Class-3 electronic lock with
a surefire Griffin retumbler
and a biometric palm scanner.
Ten tons of
top-of-the-line security.
Do I want to know
how you know all that?
I had a life before
you knew me, O'Conner.
Let's just leave it
at that, all right?
She is a beauty,
though, man.
A "beauty"
as in "good"?
"Beauty" as in, she's going to
start off playing hard to get.
Then, no matter how much I caress
her, no matter how much I love her,

Page 26/47

in the end, she still ain't
going to give up that ass.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Two to one says
you blow the wrong pipe.
Yo, why you got to be
so negative all the time, man?
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
I ain't negative.
I'm just positive
you're going to mess it up.
I'm telling you, man,
you got issues.
Next time if there's no
elevator, I'm not coming.
You need to learn
to relax, loco.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
You better hurry up,
we got less than a minute.
Why do you always set
the timer so short?
(RICO SPEAKING SPANISH)
I hope you know
where you're going.
I got this. Relax, man.
Relax.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
...a police station.
Relax.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
You used too much
explosive! Again.
Too much, too little...
it's all the same.
That's some Buddha shit you learned from
a book in the prison library, isn't it?
And what you're doing
there on the wall...
You got that from
the same book, huh?
You're so negative, bro.
Can I have some light?

Page 27/47

MIA:
BRIAN:
at four cameras.
Yo, that's some
high-end shit, too.
Marker optics.
Hundred-degree
field-of-view.
Ten seconds oscillation.
Yeah, that's
a narrow window, man.
Can't we just tap in
and replace the image?
No, it's hooked
into a digital sync.
They would know we were
in the system.
The best we can do is peek.
We're going to need some real
fast cars to get through this.
Not just fast.
You got a hard right
and a hairpin.
We're going to need
something agile.
You guys mock up a track.
O'Conner.
Let's go get some cars.
Nice.
Home sweet home.
BRIAN:
How about that?
All motor, no tuning issues.
I always wanted one of those.
Held the record on the
Avenida three years running.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Damn, bro...
You got a lot of balls to bring
your problems here, Toretto.
Not to mention a cop.
Yeah, we can keep

Page 28/47

that on the low.
Word on the street is a lot of
people are looking for you two.
What?
You didn't think
we'd recognize you?
No, we're kind
of counting on it.
That little coupe may run
the streets around here,
but that monster has never
seen a set of tail lights.
Even
Well, she's about to.
(DIOGO SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Dominic Toretto's
ride in my garage.
Now that...
will be a nice trophy.
Let's go, legend.
Car for car.
Car for car?
DIOGO:
come and get it.
Let's see what they got.
Really?
Where did you get
that from? Papa Smurf?
Okay, O'Conner,
give it your best shot.
How was that one?
Camera caught you.
What?
Yeah, it still caught you.
Man, I was milking the hell
out of that thing, too.
We're going to need
a faster car.
I want my money.
Come on, man.
Yeah!
Let's get it! Watch this.
That's exactly why your ass

Page 29/47

ain't been driving.
I think I'm in love.
That was real solid work.
I think Camera 3
still caught you, though.
Let's do it again.
TEGO:
you ordered.
You're kidding me.
Yep.
Where in the hell
did y'all get one of these?
Well, we had a life
before you met us.
All right, I'll get to work
on the electronic tumbler
but there's still
another problem.
Palm scanner.
And without Reyes' handprint,
Houdini himself
couldn't open this bitch.
How do you know
it's Reyes' handprint?
You got $100 million
in a safe.
You going to put somebody
else's handprint on it?
That shit is eating
you alive.
You check that.
Yo, check that.
Shut up!
How are we supposed to get
Reyes' handprint?
DOM:
You're up.
Sure. Nothing like
the easy stuff.
Let's go. I'll drive.
I make six bodyguards.
Seven.

Page 30/47

You think that guy with a
fanny pack is a tourist?
So, how long were
you in the army?
That gun you pulled the other
day was a Jericho 941.
Thumb-racking the slide?
That was
straight-up Mossad.
I got out of the military
probably the same time
you quit smoking.
The amount
of chips you eat,
the way you always have to keep
your hands and mouth busy,
you were a two-pack-a-day
man for sure.
Unfiltered.
Well, this is a bust.
We're not going to be able to
get his fingerprints out here.
We need to do some more recon,
call in a couple of extra guys.
Or
you don't send a man
to do a woman's job.
We're going to figure
this out, I promise you.
What's up?
I thought you were
more of a thong man.
We got the print.
Where?
Okay, that's crazy.
So, did he just slap that ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?
Hey, this will work.
TEJ:
Got it?
TEJ:
But you still didn't

Page 31/47

answer the question.
Oh, no. Guys, guys!
Guys, we have a problem.
The whole team just got burnt.
Now we're all wanted.
GISELE:
US Diplomatic Security Service
issued the warrants.
Agent L. Hobbs.
Hold on one second.
Hey, Dom.
Is that the guy you saw
in the favela?
Yeah.
Hobbs is the leader of the
elite task force for the DSS.
So he's good.
When the FBI wants to find
somebody, that's who they call.
Because he never
misses his mark.
This guy is Old Testament.
Blood, bullets, wrath of God.
That's his style.
And right now
he's hunting us?
Dom, we got to move up
our timeline.
ROME Yeah, but how?
This thing's already been difficult
without Wyatt Earp on our asses.
If anything, we need
more room to breathe.
Roman's right.
Think we need to get
some fresh air.
We've got a hit.
'70s Charger.
Let's get a move on!
Eastbound on
Avenida Atlantica.
Move, move, move, move!
It stopped about

Page 32/47

a block ahead.
Park it.
We're going on foot.
Hey, Toretto.
You're under arrest.
Arrest?
I don't feel like
I'm under arrest.
How about you,
Brian?
No, not a bit.
Not even a little bit.
Just give it a minute.
it'll sink in.
BRIAN:
those feds. That was Reyes.
HOBBS:
I'm just here to bring in two
assholes whose names hit my desk.
Yeah, that sounds
like a real hero.
That's funny.
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,
then went against everything it stood for.
Or some wannabe
tough guy prick
who beat a man half to death
with a socket wrench.
Yeah, real tough.
You turn around and put your
hands behind your back.
I don't think so.
Your mistake is thinking you
got a goddamn choice, boy.
And your mistake?
Thinking you're in America.
You're a long way from home.
This is Brazil.
Come on, boss.
Another day.
Come on, H,
it's a lot of heat.

Page 33/47

I'll see you soon,
Toretto.
I look forward to it, cop.
Yep.
Tracker's on.
Got them.
I don't understand.
Why come here?
Why risk it all
for $20 worth of silver?
Because it's worth it.
You should run,
you know.
Hobbs will find you.
You have every reason
to leave. Why stay?
Why do you?
My husband was
a good police officer.
An honest man.
We both grew up here.
Two years ago he was
murdered in the street
right outside our door.
Reyes owns this favela now.
He gives things to people.
But everything
has a price.
The people here
need a new start.
They need
to be free.
You didn't kill
those men in the train,
did you?
Now, why would you believe
anything I would tell you?
Hey!
Was she so special to you?
I never thought anyone
could understand now much.
But you do.
Yeah!
Close, but not enough.

Page 34/47

Dom, the window
is too small, man.
Only way we're going to beat the
cameras is with invisible cars.
And I know just where
to get them.
Let's take a ride, boys.
Don't hurt yourself.
It's been a while since I've been
behind the wheel of one of these.
First time I've ever
been in the front seat.
Rome, what took
you so long?
I thought for sure you'd be showing up
with some chrome spinners or something.
Real funny.
I got $100,000 that says I can take
you all in the next quarter-mile.
Yeah, your broke ass
has got a hundred grand.
If we pull off this job,
I will.
The next two lights.
Hundred thousand.
We don't pull this job off,
we're probably dead anyway.
Let's make it a million.
I like that. All right, a
million-dollar quarter-mile.
All right, then.
You only live once.
Let's do it.
What do you say, Dom?
We talking or we racing?
Just don't cheat this time.
Got to let that go.
Yeah!
Typical, Roman.
I'm going to get
this money. I'm hungry.
Don't make it too
easy for me, boys.
No!

Page 35/47

Not this time, Dom.
You got to want it, Brian.
Yeah! Owned you! Owned you!
Good race, O'Conner.
Thanks, Dom.
Do you know how long I've
been waiting for that shit?
I told you
he didn't see it.
Your man right there?
He let off the throttle
at the line.
You didn't do nothing.
He let you win.
Bullshit.
Vince, what are you doing? Quiet!
They've been tracking you.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
I know she's here!
Find her!
Go!Go!Go!
It's okay. Wait!
Reyes' guys were waiting
for me at the market.
Vince saved my life.
DOM:
Yeah, sure.
Good.
Because you're saying grace.
Thanks, Vince.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Yo, you burned it!
Yo, this is how my momma
does it. Relax.
Yeah, but your mom is the
worst cook in the world.
Yo, don't you be talking
about my momma.
Yeah, come on, baby.
Who's good living?
To you, bro.
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

Page 36/47

ROME:
it's the good life.
Yeah.
So, you got a little more than
$10 or $11 million coming.
What you going to do
with your money?
Me?
Yeah.
Actually, man, I been thinking about
opening up a garage back home.
Place where people can bring their cars
and not get completely ripped off.
You know what I mean?
Really?
Yeah.
So, your dream is
to start a day job?
That's stupid.
Like, why would...
No, it's not stupid at all.
I love what I do.
That don't make
no sense to me.
I know what I'm going
to do with my money.
Buying some cooking lessons
for my man.
See? See?
There you go with
that negativity, man.
You know me.
Money ain't a goddamn thing.
It's going to take a little more
than money to learn how to cook.
That's horrible.
But I heard they was looking for a
chef down at this animal shelter.
You might want to...
I know the manager.
Hey, Dom.
Listen.
I know that you're all set
for this job tomorrow,

Page 37/47

but if you need
an extra man, I could...
You're in.
There's always
room for family.
Thank you.
Get something to eat.
Yeah.
Can you believe
Mia calls this a curse?
She might be right.
You really like doing
that stuff, huh?
When your life is on the line that's
when you learn about yourself.
That's a fair deal.
We're less than 24 hours from the
biggest celebration of our life.
Y'all need a refill.
This is serious stuff.
No, I'm good.
Cheers, baby.
I'm good.
No, thank you.
No, she can't.
What do you mean?
She can't.
What do you mean
she can't? What is...
Are you serious right now?
Is that the reason you let him
beat you in the quarter-mile?
That was a baby gift.
No, that's messed up.
No, you're not taking
that from me.
Wait, wait,
hold on a second.
So, did he just smack the ass or
did he grab and hold on to it?
Which One was it?
Congratulations.
Thank you.

Okay, guys,

Hey, Dom.
I got eyes on Mia.
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.
And what do they all
have in common?

No extradition.
We're one hour away
from the rest of our lives.
Yeah.
Cops!
Come on. Go.
You just made a big mistake.
Took me a while to find
that tracking chip.
But not as long
to flip the receiver.
You're going down, Toretto.
I'm right here.
Dom!
Stand back. I got this.
Pull off!
Dom! Please, stop!
Dom!
Dom!
Yeah.
We're coming in now.
Have the marshals meet us
at the airport when we land.
Ambush!
Wilkes, suppression fire.
Shut them down.
Stagger-step. Cover me.
Watch them!
Cut us loose!
Come on! Cut us loose!
We're good?
Yeah, let's go, let's go!
VINCE:
You've got to meet my son.
Nico.
I will.
He's a good kid.
You know,
we named him after you.
"Dominic."
You've got
my word, Vince.
You were

I got eyes on Nico now.
We need to move.
We don't have that much time.
I got us a flight out.
We can leave Rio in the rearview
in the next five hours.
Not to run away.
To finish the job.
Are you crazy, Dom?
We can't.
ROME:
That's your man
over there on the table.
The plan is busted!
This is bullshit, man.
Reyes knows we're coming!
TEJ:
They tripled the detail
at the police station.
TEJ:
a wall of gunfire.
Reyes doesn't get
away with this.
It's a trap, man.
You know that.
Dom, listen to them.
Run, before it's
too late. Leave Rio.
You can be free.
Running ain't freedom.
You should know that.
You know you're all free
to make your own choices.
HOBBS:
I'll ride with you,
Toretto.
At least until we kill
that son of a bitch.

the plan, Dom?
We can't just go
sneaking around anymore.
We don't sneak.
The only thing he cares
about is his money.
We pull that,
we pull him.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
See?
I called in every cop
on our payroll.
We're covered.
We've got every entrance
covered with weapons teams.
God Himself couldn't get at

God isn't my worry.
You ready?
I'm ready.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
What's happening?
They're taking the vault!
What?
The vault!
Follow me! Quickly!
Let me through!
Don't move!
Stay down.
Call it out, Mia!
You've got a straight shot
for two blocks.
Go right.
Got it.
Well, the plan is working.
You guys have every corrupt cop in Rio on your tail.
You have to move fast.
What's the best route?
Okay, keep going straight another
half-mile onto Rua Fonseca,
and then go left.
That ain't going to work.
Spikes ahead, Dom.

Page 42/47

We got spikes!
We're going right!
No, it's too tight,
we're not going to fit.
We've got no choice. Now!
Shit!
Holy shit!
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter.
Did you just take out a bank?
Two inbound!
All right, there's an alley
coming up on your left.
Yeah, I got it.
You little bastard!
All right, good job, Dom.
Right-hander, right here, right-hander.
Guys, there's a big group
coming at you from the south.
You have to do something now!
Hey, go wide.
Yeah!
You're all clear on the left.
Good afternoon, officer!
License and registration,
please!
Yes! This is big-boy stuff!
We're clear on the right.
Oh, man.
Thanks, guys.
Any time.
I'll see you on

Zizi, stay on them.
They can't outrun us
on the bridge.
Shit.
They have no way out.
No!
There's too many of them.
Hey, there's too many of them.

Page 43/47

We're not going to make it.
You're right, we aren't.
You are.
What are you talking about?
Just let the vault go.
Get out of there.
You're a father now, Brian.
No, I'm not leaving you.
Now you stick with the plan!
It was always the plan.
Take care of Mia.
Dom, you listen
to me now. Okay?
You cut loose right now.
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)
Hey, what is he doing?
We've got him!
Close down the bridge!
Do something, asshole!
Kill him, dammit!
Kill him now!
I thought I told you
to go on.
Yeah, I had
to make a call.
Help me.
That's for my team,
you son of a bitch.
It's a hell of a mess.
Yeah, it is.
You know I can't
let you two go.
I ain't made that way.
The way I see it, you've
earned yourselves 24 hours.
The money stays, though.
If I were you,
I'd use the time.
Make peace with whatever

Because come tomorrow,
I will find you.

Hey, how did you open your cell door?

Hey!

What are you doing?

Open Sector 2!

How did you get out?

Get back in your cell.

I told you, get back in your cell!

Let's give you a few friends to play with.

Sorry.

Send some guards in.

I'm trying.
Okay, I'm set.
How's things going down below?

How do you think? I'm in a sewer.

The doors won't open! We're locked in!

Sound the alarm!

We've lost control!

Captain!

I'm in position.

Move to phase 2.

What are you doing?
What are you doing?

What's wrong?
What's happening, Benji?

Oh, God.
He's not going to the extraction point.

Stay focused.
He knows where he's going.

No, I'm not. I won't.
I will not open that door.

Please go to the extraction point, Ethan.
I know.
I know what this means, but I can't.
I'm not authorized...

Go to the extraction point, Ethan.

Go to the extraction point!

Oh, you're just going to wait.

We're going to wait. Great. I can wait.

Okay, fine. Fine! Fine!

There.

We'll just screw
the whole thing up on purpose.

Jane? We're going
to have a slight delay.

Why do you want to go in there?

Bogdan!

Bogdan!

Sergei?

Time to go!

Now?

Yes, now!

I don't know what he's doing,
and for some reason, I'm helping him.

As long as he's where he should be
when the song ends.

We have a passenger.

Sergei!

Open all of them!

Oh God!

Oh God oh God oh God...

Sergei, please tell me
there's more to this plan!

Let's go...

Agent Hunt?

And you are?

Agent Carter.

Okay.

Who's your pal?

I'll tell you on the way!

Light the fuse.

Sergei, what's going on?

It's OK, Bogdan.

I don't mean to bring up
the elephant in the room,

but what's with the big, hairy Russian?

Who, Bogdan? He fed me intel. If I left
him there, they would've killed him.

So we're gonna give him his freedom.

Did you call in the sweepers?

On their way.

Good, good.

Benji, how is it you're here?

Oh, I passed the field exam.

Crazy, right?

Yeah. Crazy.

- DNA test.
- It's me.

It's procedure.
I'm just confirming it's you.

- You're very thorough.
- Sergei?

Are you not Russian?

Relax.

Sweepers approaching! Brooms are out!

- Roger that.
- Sergei.

Are you not Sergei?

You'll be fine.

Bogdan.

I always take care of my friends.

My friend.

Messy bringing him along.

I thought it went rather well.

Mind telling me what you were doing
in a Russian prison?

Mind telling me why you broke me out?

This wasn't a rescue mission?

Let me put it this way.

If the Secretary wanted me out of there,

it must be pretty bad out here.

We were after a file.

We lost it.

"We"? Who lost it? You?

Agent Hanaway.

Where's Hanaway?

It was a letter drop.

Classified file.

It should have been a simple intercept.

We knew which train
the courier was on.

ETA, two minutes on the courier.

But there was one thing we didn't know.

Bobcat, your train's six minutes out.

Who the courier was.

It's now or never, Bobcat.

The courier delivering the file,
what's his name?

Go ahead. Shoot.

We are out of time.

I need a name, folks.
I can't track all these people at once.

Marek. Stefanski. For the love of God!

You got it?

Marek Stefanski.

Searching.

I'll take it from here.

Hey, you all right, buddy?

Hana way dropped the mark
and grabbed his bag.

Sit down. Catch your breath.

He had the file in his hands.
Easy in, easy out.

File secured.

But we weren't the only ones after it.

Bobcat, someone else
has crashed this party.

I'm not alone.

Local police?

No. Armed hostiles.

Hang tight, I'm coming!
Outrigger, back him up.

Negative, Outrigger.

Rendezvous southwest corner,
60 seconds.

Hana way's lens cam drew a facial
match and triggered a warning.

But it was too late.

No!

You're going to be okay.

You're so beautiful.

I'm sorry, I... I should have told you.

It was my op.

I put him in the field.

And she left him
just alive enough for me to see him die.

I'm sorry.

You know her?

That's Sabine Moreau. Contract killer.

Works for diamonds.

What was in the file?

Russian nuclear launch codes.

IMF's been looking for an emerging
extremist, code name, Cobalt.

He's determined to detonate
a nuclear weapon however he can.

We know Moreau's
worked for him before.

What else does IMF know about him?

As much as you do now.

But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes,

you can bet Cobalt's gone
from a person of interest

to enemy number one.

We're here.

Agent confirmed.

Why was he in prison?

He disappeared after he and his wife...
You know.

I thought he'd just been transferred.
Put on leave.

There were rumors, though.
Talk of an unsanctioned hit.

Welcome back, Mr. Hunt.

In your absence,
IMF has learned that Cobalt is or was

a level-1 nuclear strategist
for Russian intelligence.

Therefore, the only way to uncover
his actual identity

is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself.

In order to get past their checkpoints,

you'll be impersonating
General Anatoly Fedorov.

We believe Cobalt
will do everything he can

to destroy any record of his identity.

Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

is to penetrate the highly-secured
archive inside the Kremlin

and retrieve Cobalt's file
before he can destroy it.

New intel suggests Cobalt
is already en route, leaving you...

...4 hours 52 minutes...

...to infiltrate.

To save time,
we've chosen your team for you.

Agents Carter and Dunn.

As always, should you or any member
of your team be caught or killed,

the Secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.

This message
will self-destruct in five seconds.

Good luck, Ethan.

What do you got?

We're going into the Kremlin.

I thought you said "The Kremlin."

I thought you said "The Kremlin."

Okay.

This is very exciting.

Being out in the field.

With you, you know.

It's a bit of a dream for me.

Love your disguise, by the way
You look just like him.

It's a shame we're not wearing masks.
You know, like, full masks.

Everybody gets to
wear a mask but Benji.

Sorry.

I'm tense. I babble when I'm nervous.

I'm doing it again. Shut up, Benji.

Okay, seven security guards.

X-ray machines. Cameras.
Metal detectors.

Just what we expected. We can do this.

Releasing in three, two, one.

Game face, game face.
Kremlin game face.

General...

I am Major Egorov.

Your documents.

You should know your boss.

I can't find you.

Run it again...

...Private.

Egorov.

Excuse me, General. I didn't recognize you.

You're going to regret this, Egorov.

I think that went quite well.

Just shut it.

Sorry.

It's going to work.

I'm sorry, by the way.
About you and Julia.

You know, not working out.

I wanted to say something
before you went away, but...

I liked her, you know.

He's off the phone now.

It's empty.

The nest is empty.

Check in, Team Leader.

Over.

Repeat. Check in, Team Leader.

Have you made it to the Archive Room?

Captain! The Archive Room!

Run!

Someone is piggybacking our frequency.

Team Leader,

awaiting your go-sign.
Standing by to detonate.

Abort.

Rendezvous nine-two.

Shut the gate!

Quickly!

Our media is no more
truthful than yours,

American.

But we both know
that the real cause of the explosion

was you.

Awaiting your go-sign, Team Leader.

Standing by to detonate.

The worst part for you,

"Team Leader,"

is I am the man assigned
to make you suffer for it.

For what you did to my country.

This is a hospital...

Not a night club.

Misha... help me here...

Room twelve.

The doctors say he's lucky to be alive.

Only a mild concussion.

I don't give a damn about his health.

I have questions that need answering.

Be careful!

Prepare a transport.

Check over there!

Not a good idea.

It seemed like one a minute ago.

All agents! Hot target heading west!

Consolidated Insurance.

How may I help you?

SAT 20. Agent 82-Delta-Echo
requesting immediate evac.

Rendezvous Alpha 113.

Confirmed. Alpha 113.

Details surrounding
the intricate system of gas lines

that run beneath the square
are still forthcoming,

but the majority of
those lines date back to the Soviet era

and have not been updated in at least...

Anna... Anna... I've been thinking...

It looks like we...

We should leave town
for a couple of days.

Alex, you, me. Vacations.

- Now?
- Tonight.

Why are you speaking in English?

Just...

Just the three of us.

...may not have been an accident,
but a targeted attack.

Preliminary numbers are just starting...

Where will we go?

...to come in regarding
those wounded in the blast.

We can confirm that 11 tourists...

Leonid?

...their nationalities still unconfirmed,

have been transported
to area hospitals for treatment.

While Russian officials continue
to blame a gas-main break,

experts are citing the shape of the blast
area and the size of the debris field

as more consistent
with that of a set explosive,

leading to speculation
that this may have been

an undeclared act of aggression.

Although the Defense Ministry
is maintaining

that this is strictly an accident...

Anna, pack a bag for Alex.

We're leaving now.

Anya!

Anya!

We have work to do.

Mr. Secretary.

I wasn't aware you were in Russia.

I'm not.
Not since a bomb blew up the Kremlin.

Yesterday I flew in
to accept the Order of Friendship

from the Russian Prime Minister.

Now I'm headed back to Washington

to hand the President my resignation.

My Chief Analyst, William Brandt.

Do you have a pen?

- Pardon me?
- A pen.

Yeah.

Ethan, what happened in the Kremlin?

Chief Analyst, you say?

If you're implying that
I made a bad call...

European male.

Fifties. About six-foot,
180 pounds. Blue eyes.

Who is he?

A crude drawing,
but by your description,

that could be Kurt Hendricks.

190 IQ. Served in
Swedish Special Forces.

Professor of physics,
Stockholm University.

Specialist in nuclear endgame theory.

Asked to resign...

Well, because he's crazy.

Cobalt.

You have to alert the Kremlin
that one of their strategists

has a nuclear launch device

and one of his operatives
has the codes to activate it.

And what makes you say that?

I saw him

leaving the executive armory,
bag in hand.

He set off that explosion
to cover his tracks.

It could be weeks
before the Russians know it's missing.

Unless we tell them.

They won't listen to us.

As far as the Russians are concerned,
we just bombed the Kremlin.

The tension between
the United States and Russia

hasn't been this high
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

And the blame, right or wrong,
points to IMF.

The President has initiated
Ghost Protocol.

The entire IMF has been disavowed.

So what happens now?

Now, I've been ordered
to take you back to Washington,

where the DOD will label you
as a rogue extremist

and hang the Kremlin bombing
on you and your team.

Unless,

you were to escape

somewhere between here
and the airport,

having assaulted Mr. Brandt and me.

Sir?

You would then

illegally scrounge
whatever material you could

from a backup supply cache
that I've overlooked.

The same cache where
your team are waiting for further orders.

Sir, you may want to...

You will then disappear, and this
conversation never having taken place,

your intentions would be unclear.

But if any one of your team
is caught or killed,

they will be branded terrorists,

out to incite global nuclear war.

Your mission,

should you choose to accept it.

Ethan, you were my best man.

And I'm sorry it's come to this,

after all the sacrifices you made.

If we don't meet again,
I just want you to know,

I've always considered you a friend.

Stay down! Drive, drive, drive!

You okay?

Yeah.

Take a deep breath. Stay with me.

- Ready?
- Yeah.

What do we do?

Wait here.

Where else am I going to go?

Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

Hold your fire!

Hold your fire!

Weapons down!

What are you firing at?

Two prisoners escaped
from Rankow Prison today.

And this one?...

What do we know about him?

Why would that work?

Why would what work?

The flare on the body,
why would that work?

It did work.

- Yeah, I know, but...
- Hey!

But why? I mean, how did you know
that would draw their fire?

I didn't. I played a hunch.

Okay. All right,
so what was your scenario?

Right, you...
There's a guy being shot at in the water.

All of a sudden, decides to light up
a flare and swim around?

I mean, what did you assume
they'd be thinking?

- Thinking?
- Yeah.

I didn't assume they were thinking.

I assumed they were shooting
at anything that moved.

I just gave them a target. Look, these...

These guys aren't
Rhodes Scholars, you know?

It's really happening, isn't it?

Yeah.

Okay, you know what that sound is?

That's our ride out of here!

All right, it's a green car. Number 47.

I see green!

Okay, let's do it.

Go, go, go, go.

All right, 47.

I don't see it.

47.

Oh, shit!

This is it. The manifest.

Enter your code.

Pole!

Jeez...

Press enter.

Retinal scanner!

Retinal scan required.

Watch out!

Retinal scan required.

Agent confirmed.

Ethan? Jeez, I thought you were dead!

- We are.
- Who's this?

Agents Dunn and Carter.
William Brandt, Chief Analyst.

Analyst?

Agent confirmed.

How will the world finally end?

It is my job to predict the unthinkable.

To treat the death of billions as a game.

After 20 years of this, I was numb.

Until a new question crossed my mind.

What happens after
the end of the world?

Are you sure your line is secure?

Every two or three million years...

Are you certain your line is secure?

...some natural catastrophe
devastates all life on Earth.

But life goes on.

And what little remains
is made stronger.

Put simply,
world destruction is an unpleasant,

but necessary part of evolution.

What happens then, I wondered,

when mankind faces
the next end of the world?

I don't care what you have to do
to get him to Dubai.

I'll make it worth his while. Just do it.

I looked to Hiroshima, Nagasaki...

I'll be waiting for your call.

...thriving cities rebuilt from the ashes,

monuments to the unimaginable,

dedicated to the concept of peace.

It occurred to me here
that nuclear war might have a place

in the natural order.

But only if it could be controlled.

Only if it touched
every living soul equally.

IMF now believes this man,
Kurt Hendricks,

is the nuclear extremist,
code name Cobalt.

Today he was seen leaving the Kremlin,

with what is likely
a nuclear launch device.

Two days ago, Sabine Moreau killed
one of our agents in Budapest

and relieved him
of Russian nuclear launch codes.

Intel indicates she will check into
the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.

Marius Wistrom
is a known operative of Cobalt.

Wistrom is currently en route to Dubai.

For the launch device to work,
Cobalt needs the activation codes.

He's sending Wistrom
to buy them from Moreau.

The Secretary

is dead.

The President
has invoked Ghost Protocol.

We're shut down.

No satellite, safe house,
support, or extraction.

The four of us
and the contents of this car

are all that remain of the IMF.

And as of this moment, any action
is unsanctioned. So if you want out,

speak now.

Our mission is Hendricks.

We're all that stands
between him and his goal.

Nothing can be left to chance.

Everyone connected with this man

is considered an asset with valuable
information about our target.

No one can know we're still on line.

We lose Hendricks now,
we lose him forever.

So, what's the play?

Wistrom will take delivery from Moreau
in 36 hours.

Now we cannot let
the launch codes leave the hotel,

but we need Wistrom
to lead us to Hendricks.

He'll only do that if he has the codes.

Or if he thinks he has them.

Our objective is to intercept the sale,

replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits

and follow Wistrom to Hendricks.

Well, that's simple enough.

We snatch the codes,
we gin up some fakes.

Jane, you double Moreau, and sell the
codes to Wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

And how do you propose
we just snatch the codes from Moreau?

We take her out.

Yeah, we take her out.
But, you know, discreetly.

Discreetly?

Yeah.

Right, she's an asset. Right. I get it.
Sorry. Nothing left to chance.

He said... I'm spitballing.
It's not all gonna be gold.

- We don't touch Wistrom.
- All right.

Or Moreau.

She'll answer for Hanaway,
but it has to be when I say.

After we hit Hendricks.

Only pack what we need.

Yeah, absolutely. Only pack what we...
You never know.

So even if we can double
Wistrom and Moreau,

how do we keep them in separate rooms

while having them think that
they're in the same room?

We give the hotel a facelift.

Wistrom will think
he's arriving at Moreau's suite,

but, really, he'll be
walking into our decoy room.

Where I'll double Moreau.

Downstairs, Benji will double Wistrom.

Masks!

And meet with the real Moreau.

And...

What am I doing?

You? You're the helper!

Helper. That's great.

Okay, so to the extent I understand
what you're talking about here...

The Burj Khalifa,
it's the tallest building in the world,

and you want to alter its infrastructure

with the hopes of convincing
two people that they've

had a meeting,
which actually really never happened.

Right?

Camels.

ETA on dry cleaning.

On my way up.

Okay, 34 minutes to door knock.

Wow...

Okay, this is a slight wrinkle,
but nothing to worry about.

We're just going to have to go into
the server room from the outside.

What?

Well, the firewalls on this building's
server are military grade.

I mean, this would be a cinch

if I could call Youssef
back at headquarters,

but Youssef doesn't exist any more,
and neither do we.

I could hack it,
but it would take too long.

Then hardwire in.

And there's four layers
of next-gen security

between us and the server room.

There's no way
we can get to it from inside.

If we can't get to the server,
we don't control the elevators,

we don't control the security cameras.

This operation is over
before it even begins.

I'm telling you,
we can get to it from outside.

We"?

I'm... I'm on the computer.

I'm just...

The helper.

What floor is it on?

130.

130?

- Vent ducts.
- Pressure sensitive.

Not enough time.

- Elevator shaft.
- Infrared sensors.

Not enough time.

How am I supposed to do this?

God damn it!

Oh, that's high.

Okay, now remember, it's a rolling off
motion that disengages the bond.

When the meter is blue,
that's full adhesion.

Easy way to remember, blue is glue.

- And when it's red?
- Dead.

Here's your cutter, okay?
And your server interface.

Both going back here. One, two.

Okay, Ethan, the hotel server is
eleven stories up and seven units over.

Okay? Comm check.

Yeah. Copy.

So...

It's 26 minutes to door knock.

Yeah.

25 minutes to door knock.

What the hell is that?

Yeah, what the hell is that?

It's a sandstorm.

It's a long way off, Ethan.

Shouldn't be a problem.

24 minutes to door knock.

Where's Ethan?

You've got to be kidding me.

23 minutes to door knock.

I'm at server level.

22 minutes to door knock.

The countdown is not helping.

I'm just saying.

I'm in.

That's great, Ethan.
You're halfway home.

Located server.

Please tell me we're online.

All right, we're live.

Okay, I now have control of
the elevators and the security cameras.

Time to redecorate.

Okay, you drive.
And look out for Wistrom and Moreau.

Moreau is at the elevators
ahead of schedule.

Go.

We can't open this door, can we?

The door? No.

Ethan, you gotta get down here now.

Ethan!

Is there a problem? Ethan?

We're not gonna make it.

We have to make it.

Where's Ethan?

Your line's not long enough!

No shit!

That was not easy,

but I did it.

What'd I miss?

The lens might be a little uncomfortable.

It captures images and transmits them
to the printer in the briefcase.

All right?

I can't see out of one eye, but I'm fine.

Blink twice to activate the shutter.

Notice the numbers are in order?

A perfect copy.

But the numbers are scrambled.

Masks?

60 seconds.
You sure I shouldn't wear a mask?

You know,
'cause I'm not exactly Omar Sharif.

I'll play it French.
This is your tracking device.

- This is what you're tracking.
- The paper clip?

No, it's the paper.

It's in the briefcase. It's coated with
isotopes which give off a unique...

It just means
that you can track the documents

even if they switch briefcases.

Range?

Not that good. It's, like, half a mile.

Safest thing to do would be not let
Wistrom out of your sight.

Is that Wistrom?

Who's that with him?

I don't know. We don't have an uplink,
so there's no facial recognition.

Who's that with him?

That's Leonid Lisenker.
Polish-born cryptographer.

He redesigned Russia's nuclear
security after the Cold War.

He's here to authenticate
the launch codes.

- Yes, he is. We are blown.
- No, we're not blown.

Well, we will be as soon as he sees
the counterfeit launch codes.

We're not blown.

He's in the elevator.

Delay them.

Benji, how long would it take you
to reprogram the case?

A couple of seconds. What for, though?

To make an exact copy
of the launch codes.

- What?
- You can't do that.

- Wistrom's on 22!
- Slow him down.

I'll do what I can.

Wait, wait. Ethan, hang on now!

Hang on. Just a second.

You're talking about handing over active
nuclear launch codes to Wistrom?

Yes. Reprogram the case.

Listen... Stop!

Just listen to what you're saying.

You're fixating.
You're not thinking clearly.

It's not gonna happen. I won't let it!

33 and climbing!

Brandt, use your head now.

The mission is not the codes,
the mission is Hendricks.

Then just let it play out.
Give him bad codes. Neutralize him.

You know that won't do it.

Failure to a terrorist
is just a rehearsal for success.

41!

We lose Hendricks today,
he shows up somewhere else tomorrow.

He finds another way.

With no IMF to stop him.

No. It's now or never.
Now, Brandt, give me the case.

Nothing can be left to chance.
You said that.

You're the analyst.

Now, tell me there's not another way
for Hendricks to get those codes.

50!

You tell me that this is his only avenue,
right here, right now, today.

You tell me that, I'll walk away.

- We go without.
- Without masks?

- Jane needs to go.
- Ethan!

We have no choice.

Ethan, you'd be walking in
on Moreau unarmed.

Face-first. Literally.

How do we know they've met?

- How do we know they haven't?
- Doesn't matter!

Damn it.

We have no choice.

Goggles.

What if they have met?

Come in.

Which one of you is Wistrom?

Which one of you is Wistrom?

I am.

I admire your work.

Sit.

Where are my codes?

Where are my diamonds?

Close by.

You have my payment?

When I see the codes.

Not to worry. Come in!

I thought we could have tea.

No diamonds, no codes.

No codes, no diamonds.

Kill this one.

We didn't come alone.

That hallway out there is a kill-box.

You know who we work for.

We come back with the codes,
or we don't come back.

How good is your backup?

The best.

I've killed the best.

Do you care for some sugar?

Enough. Let's get this done.

You want payment, I want guarantees.

When he's authenticated the codes,

I'll make the call
and you get your diamonds.

That or

we all go home in buckets.

Nobody leaves this hotel alive.

Get the papers.

Is there a problem?

It's locked.

Forgive me. There must be a key.

One moment, huh?

My mistake.
It is a combination, not a key.

You tell me the numbers.

They're good.

Zero.

Zero.

Zero.

Come on, come on, come on.

It was a pleasure doing business with...

Wistrom has the launch codes.
He's on the move.

Hey, I did as you asked. I did.
Now let my family go!

Release Leonid's family.

Thank God.

You can thank him in person.

It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

Kill him!

Moreau's on the move!

I've got her.

Jane?

She's an asset!

I need her

alive!

Acknowledge!

Acknowledge!

Ethan, Wistrom is in the elevator.
I can't see Leonid, though.

Benji, slow him down.
Get me an elevator.

Find Leonid.

Benji, I've got a lock on Wistrom.
But I can't tell.

Is he still in the elevator?

Benn?

Ethan. Over?

Benj

Benji, I lost...

Ethan, can you hear me?

Ethan, can you hear me? Over.

Jesus!

Sit down!

- Watch her.
- Why me?

Because if I do, I'll kill her.

Hold it, Team Leader.

Did you really think
I wouldn't catch up with you?

You and I are not enemies.
It was a set-up...

We'll find out your lies soon enough.

Move it!

I'm sorry about this.

Leonid. Benji?

Go for Benji.

I've got Leonid by the elevators.
He's been shot.

What?

Hey, hey. Stay with me. Stay with me.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

Jane! No!

Come on. Come on.

Now, what happened
with Moreau, Jane?

She couldn't help us with Hendricks.

So let's throw her off the building!

I didn't throw her.

Let's throw her off the building!

She was not the mission, Jane!

The mission was to track the file
back to Hendricks, who is in the wind

with nuclear launch codes!

Maybe you didn't notice the gun
she had pointed at me.

Yeah, like you didn't notice
the open window,

or that we're about a mile up in the air!

It was an instinctive move.

It doesn't matter!

We're talking about a nuclear war.

The asset is more important than you.

Where do you get off telling me
how well I executed?

We inherited you.

You're just a bureaucrat!

Better have good news for me.
Is he here?

You think I need you to tell me
what the mission is?

Yeah, I got it. Dunhill lighter.
I'll be there.

And no one will be following me.

Just make sure no one's following you.

And how the hell
did the Russians find us?

- What are you asking me for?
- Because you're communications!

You're in charge of covering our tracks.

You cannot afford to make mistakes
like that now, Benji.

You're not a technician any more.
You're a field agent.

And you're just an "analyst."

Right?

Right?

Who are you really, Brandt?

- What are you asking?
- What am I asking?

Let me see if I can put it another way.

How does an agent with skills like that
end up an analyst?

Well, we all have our secrets.

Don't we, Ethan?

You tell me yours, I'll tell you mine.

I have friends in the region.
Just sit tight.

I'll send someone to get you out of here.

What about Hendricks?
What's the plan?

The plan was for us
to stop him together.

Well, what are you going to do?

Change the plan.

Wait. That's it?

What are you going to do,
go after him alone?

Would you care to explain yourself,
Agent Brandt?

I was on a protection detail in Croatia.

Shadowing the assets,
husband and wife.

They were never supposed to know
we were there.

Whole thing's routine, it was a milk run.

Three days in

we caught wind that a Serbian hit squad
was after our couple.

But my team had it under control.

We knew they were coming.

But I couldn't shake this feeling that I
should warn the couple somehow.

I wanted to find a way to let them know.

But, you know, orders are orders,
so I didn't.

One day, the husband decides
to leave the hotel and go for a run,

so I follow him,
and I leave two men with the wife.

When I get back, my guys are
unconscious and the wife is gone.

Local police found her body
three days later.

What was left of her, anyway.

That was my last day in the field.

I couldn't face another
life-or-death situation after that.

So what happened to the husband?

I never saw him again.

Until two days ago in Moscow,

when the Secretary
introduced me to Ethan Hunt.

No, that's not what happened.
She left him.

Yeah, I heard that one, too, Benji.

But, unfortunately, I was there.

Just like I was there
when the Secretary got the phone call

that Ethan was in custody for killing
six Serbian nationals in cold blood.

An unsanctioned hit.

Yeah.

Disavowed.

The next thing I know,

I'm on a plane to Dubai,

wondering the whole time, do I tell him?

How do I tell him?

That I'm responsible.

I could have warned him.

I should have warned him.

But I didn't.

And she died.

Sergei! Sergei, my friend!

I told you I would get him here.
Didn't I say?

How do I know it's him?

Yes, it's him.
You trust me, I trust you. Right?

This is the guy!

This is the guy, the one I told you about.

So we can take these things off.

Sorry. He's a great guy,
but he doesn't know you like I do.

So, you work for
the American government.

And you're an arms dealer.

No, no, no. Sergei. Sergei.

He's "independent
defense coordinator." Right?

That you are. Very classy job.

Listen. He's a friend.

Those diamonds are for Bogdan.

No, no. It's okay. You can have them.

Whatever arrangements you made with
my cousin is between you and him.

You want something from me, you pay.

You misunderstand.
I'm not buying. I'm selling.

You're selling.

Selling what?

The future.

Yeah, I got all I need, thank you.

Our countries are on the brink of war.

War is very good for business.

Nuclear war?

Go on.

I'm looking for a man
named Kurt Hendricks.

You may know him as Cobalt.

In either case,
I think you know what he wants.

I'll bet he even tried
to buy it from you at some point.

Go on.

He has a case, he has codes.

But they're worthless
without a tactical satellite.

I want to know where he'd get it.

A man with information like that
would be a potential terrorist.

And to your government,

a potential terrorist is a terrorist.

If you help me,

my friends become your friends.

Sorry.

I cannot help you.

I certainly cannot tell you
that Russia quietly sold

an obsolete tactical satellite
to a certain telecom in Mumbai.

And whoever gave them that idea?

An enterprising third party.

Working on commission.

Helping old friends. Making new ones.

Can the satellite be shut down?

That would take special skills,

and you cannot do it alone.

What's in the bags?

It's our gear.

How'd you get it?

Made a friend.

Well, I'm glad we could help.

You could help now.

Look, Ethan, before we...

Whatever happened, happened.

We still have a chance to clean this up,
but we have to do it now.

And we have to do it together.

Okay. So, where are we going?

India.

- India? India?
- Sure.

Okay. Great.

Love the jet.

Wait till you see the car.

Sidorov.

How have you been, old friend?

Oh, it's you.

I've been busy with other things.

But I'll be after you again soon enough.

I understand you're looking
for an American...

I am.

You're also looking for a nuclear launch
device stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.

You're also looking for a nuclear launch
device stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.

I am?

I can help you find both.

If... we can come to an understanding.

Brij Nath.

Brij Nath. Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.

On the surface,
his entire network is state-of-the-art.

But it's built on illegally acquired.

Cold War cast-offs, including this,
the Novosti satellite.

Hendricks needs it
to launch a nuclear strike,

and we have to shut it down
before he gets that chance.

And to do that, we need to get
the access code from him.

One way or another.

And if I don't,

none of this works.

You can do this.

Yeah.

A week ago, I would have believed you.

I don't blame you for what happened.

She took someone you cared about.
That's not something you just

let go.

Did it make you feel better?

When you killed the men
who killed your wife?

We can't get them back.

Okay, to shut down the satellite,

we have to manually tap into
the central server.

You'll enter through the exhaust vent,
wearing this under your suit.

Drop down into the computer array,
and I'll catch you,

then move you along the relay room
and you jack into the panel.

Okay, so we enter the party
separately as guests.

Ethan quarterbacks while Jane...

Gets the codes from the billionaire.

I switch off the fan,
you jump into the computer array,

and I catch you,
you plug in the transmitter

then Ethan feeds me the codes which I
then use to pinpoint Hendricks' location.

Okay, but you just breezed over
something I think is really important.

The computer array part, where I just...

Jump?

- And I catch you.
- Yeah.

I don't... Why is that so hard to grasp?

Well...

Why? It's a 25-foot drop.
And we're using magnets.

Yeah.

In light of our recent efforts,
the technology's...

The science is sound. All right?

I'd be more worried about the heat.

And then there's that. What heat?

Well, it's like any computer, isn't it?

If you switch off the fan,
it's gonna get really hot!

Of course.

Relatively, you know.

Of course it will. So I'm jumping into a...

An oven, essentially.

Yeah. Essentially.

But I'll catch you.

Great.

Aapka swagat hai, sir. Welcome, sir.

Comm check.

Saturn's got your five-by-five, Jupiter.

This is Pluto.

I have arrived at the party.

There he is.

Get us that code.

Venus moving in on target.

Hook's in.

You do make an impression.

Why am I Pluto?

It's not even a planet any more.

Well, I think Uranus is available.

It's funny 'cause you said "anus."

I'm in position.

Sending in the Rover.

He's moving to you.

Give him your back.

Don't want to make it too easy for him.

Are you gonna be talking
the whole time?

In 20 minutes, I want a glass of
Cuv?e Louis in every guest's hand.

And make sure all of them have a bottle
to take home by the end of the night.

Sure.

Impressed yet?

I'm more of a bourbon girl.

I'm Brij Nath.

Welcome to my humble home.

And Rover's in position.

Spinning down the turbine.

He's e-mailing.

Venus. Be Venus.

Be Venus.

Husband?

Boyfriend?

More of a

co-worker.

Saturn, take the leap.

Okay.

Jumping.

Jumping now.

Jump now?

Yes. Commit. Jump.

- Jump.
- Jump.

- And I catch you.
- Now.

So, you're sure
about this suit, right, Benji?

Pretty sure.

Now you're pretty sure?

Jump.

Oh, God. All right.

Jump.

Jump!

Jupiter, he's gone.

Did you jump?

Should I not have jumped?

Cause I jumped!

Stand by.

I'm playing a hunch.

Don't hit me.

Hello?

My God, you are

a passionate creature.

I would like to show you
my collection of art.

I was waiting for you to ask.

Then you have to find me.

You're on.

I'm heading upstairs.

All right, now be careful,

because it's probably getting a bit hot.

We have to get to that satellite
before Hendricks does.

Look left. Look up.

I find your capricious passion intriguing.

Let me tell you one thing.
He's not your type.

Completely not your type.
He's completely cold. I'm hot.

Like all Indian men, I'm very hot.

Eight o'clock.

Hot! Very hot.

He's at your eight o'clock.

As you move towards me,
you're getting hotter.

Whoa. Up, up! Up, Up!

Too much, too much, too much!

I see you.

I'd heard you have one of the finest
private collections in the world.

Well, at the very least, it's private.

Saturn? How we doing
in the relay room?

In position.

I see the satellite.

Can I help you, gentlemen?

I don't think so.

Need those codes, guys.

All originals from Chhatarpur District.

You know, the Tantrics believe

that the Swadhisthana chakra hides
our most subconscious of desires.

Uplink to satellite.
Reboot to original military specs.

Download the virus.

What the hell is that?

What the hell is that?

What the hell is what?

It's going haywire!

It's downloaded a virus
from the satellite.

Hendricks is killing the server

before we can kill the satellite.

Hendricks is reprogramming
the satellite.

He's gonna have launch
capability in five minutes!

- Something wrong?
- No.

Jane, you gotta move.
We need that code.

Finally we're alone.

Venus, now's the time. Kick his ass

and get the code.

We are alone, aren't we?

No one will interrupt us.

Move and I break your neck.

The override sequence
for the relay station.

Say it now or never speak again.

The codes.

46, 82,

93.

Benji, what happened?

The system's crashed! We're too late.

No, no, no. He's revealed himself.

Benji, can you pinpoint
Hendricks' location?

Hendricks is signaling out of a state-run.

TV station 6. 7 miles from here.

Send me the coordinates.

Good work, Brandt.
Now get the hell out of there.

Back me up!

Jane, tie it off with Nath
and meet me at the rally point.

Sleep tight.

Faster, Benji! Just straight through!

Wait! Stop!

Take me through!

It's not responding! A little bit of
patience would be appreciated!

I can't reach the top!

More fan! More fan!

More fan!

There's nothing I can do! It's maxed out!

Brandt?

Next time, I get to seduce the rich guy.

Satellite weaponized and online.

Upload the new authentication codes.

Lock Russian Central Command
out of the system.

Isolate the sub.

We'll fire just one missile,
an apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.

That should start the ball rolling.

I'm here, Ethan.

How long until Hendricks
can launch a missile?

Less than 30 seconds!

We need another route.

Turn left up ahead,
take the alley on the right.

We have uplink.

Ethan, Hendricks
has started the launch sequence.

How much time until missiles are flying?

Three minutes!

We're three and a half minutes out.

We can make it.

We can make it.

Captain...

Connect to Central Command
for launch verification.

Right away.

Proceed with Operation "Iron Fist".

Command to Launch is confirmed.

Cease all further communication.

Over and out.

Next left.

Proceed.

Ethan? We're too late.

The missile's in the air.

There has to be a way
to abort the warhead.

If there is one,
it'll be on the launch device.

We're gonna get that case.

May there be peace on Earth.

Disable the relay.

Get Wistrom! Inside, inside!

Wistrom destroyed the relay.

Ethan went after Hendricks
and the case, but...

Doesn't matter if he has the case.
We can't transmit the abort codes.

Can you fix it?

Yeah... It's gonna be pointless
if we don't have any power.

Wistrom!

- Jane!
- I'm okay.

No, you are not okay. She's hit.

You stay here and cover Benji.

Benji, get this thing rewired
and back online. I'll get the power on.

We can do this.

I'm taking that briefcase!

No! No!

He's been gone too long.

Damn it! Listen.

When the power comes on,
these two drives go into this bay, okay?

Mission accomplished!

Don't touch him!

This one is mine.

So, we are not enemies.

The phone call
from that arms dealer in Dubai.

You wanted me to find you.

How else to believe this?

Hospital?

And in other news, eight weeks later,

the debate continues.

Eyewitnesses remain adamant
that the object was some sort of aircraft,

but officials with the Department of
Defense insist it was simply a meteor

large enough to be
visible during daylight.

You actually said that.

Out loud.

"Mission accomplished."

I said it.

You're still corny, Ethan.

I can't imagine
the look on that guy's face.

- Hey.
- This must be them.

Luther Stickell,
the firm of Carter, Dunn and Brandt.

I blew an entire weekend
on the bottom of the San Francisco Bay

no thanks to you clowns.

No, man, you know I got this.

I know. I'll see you in Kandahar.

Thanks for meeting me.

So, I hear the insurance
company's refusing

to pay the claim
on that car you crashed, Ethan.

Something about intentional 100-meter
vertical drops not being covered.

Go figure.

How's the leg?

Still working.

You?

Heaf ing.

I'm fine, by the way.

I mean, I'm not actually sleeping, per se.

You know. Cold sweats.
Middle of the night.

All these people
are just happy and smiling

and they are completely
oblivious to the fact

that they were almost vaporized.

And if it hadn't been for...

Dumb luck?

Was it?

I mean, look,
we were unprepared, in the dark.

Disavowed.

And the only thing
that functioned properly

on that mission

was this team.

I don't know how we ended up together,

but I'm glad we did.

Your missions.

Choose to accept them.

Hey, look, I'm in.

Seriously. It's not as if any mission

is gonna be rougher
than the last one, is it?

I mean, that's just...

Bomb... Is it?

Thanks, Ethan.

Thank you.

Agent Hunt.

Agent Carter.

Brandt.

I'm not picking up that phone, Ethan,

because I don't think
you want me in the field.

I know your wife is dead.

I was there in Croatia.

I was there for one reason.

One.

And I failed.

It was my job to protect her.

How do you know she's dead?

There was a body.

Did you see it?

You killed those Serbians.

I had to get her back.

You were sent to Rankow Prison.

That was a sacrifice
I was willing to make.

IMF suspected Hendricks
had people in Rankow.

And six dead Serbians
was the ideal cover.

Waste not, want not.

The Secretary never told me.

I accepted the Rankow Prison mission
on one condition:

That no one could know
she was still alive.

But you're telling me.

When did you find out
that I was in Croatia?

I pulled your file after India.

Right.

So you had to fake your wife's death.

As long as we were together,
she could never be safe.

It wasn't your job to protect her, Brandt.

It's mine.

Okay.

So we're good.

We're good.

Come on!

Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

36 hours ago, there was a breach
in our military's communication network.

Now, an emerging terror
organization known as The Syndicate

has control of our entire drone fleet.
Their targets: Unknown.

Your mission,
should you choose to accept it...

          A TINY CRAB BOAT (CRABBY) crests over massive swells.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Alright buddy, we're here. Right

           Question is, why?
                         
          A metallic blue sports car, circa the `60s, emerges from the
           2.

                          FINN
           Exactly where I want to be.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Well I got news for you, buddy.
           There's nobody out here but us.
                         
          Suddenly, a HORN -- a COMBAT SHIP, the size of most cruise
          ships. FINN quickly backs into the shadows, out of sight.
                         
                          COMBAT SHIP
           What are you doing out here?
                         
                          CRABBY
           What does it look like, genius? I'm

                          COMBAT SHIP
           Well turn around and go back where
           you came from.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Yeah? And who's gonna make me?
                         
          A laser sight hits Crabby between the eyes.
                         
                          CRABBY
           Alright, alright! Don't get your
           prop in a twist.
           (as he turns to leave)
           What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks
           like it's the end of the line.
           Buddy?
                         
          ON CRABBY'S DECK: Finn is gone.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          FINN - He HANGS off the side of COMBAT SHIP, clandestine.
                         
          We're with Finn as the ship continues on, cuts through the
          darkness with purpose. Suddenly small flames appear, perhaps
          a knot or so away. Then WHOOSH!!! A flame rises above Finn,
          the ship. It illuminates an OIL DERRICK.
           3.
                         
                         
          THWAP! Finn fires a GRAPPLING HOOK to the derrick and SWINGS
          toward it. He's going to SLAM into the side with brute force
                         WHEN ---
                         
          --- HIS TIRES sprout a magnetic exoskeleton. He STICKS to the
          derrick and now DRIVES VERTICALLY UP UP UP...
                         
          From this vantage point, hundreds of derricks appear.

          Finn approaches a loading bay from above, hides. He watches
          as GREMLINS, PACERS and assorted other cars scurry about.
                         
           FINN (INTO RADIO)

          AN ACCESS DOOR OPENS LOUDLY below. A boxy, monacle-wearing
          German car enters. This is PROFESSOR OTTO ZUNDAPP.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           (in German and English)
           Too many cars here. Out of my way!

           Professor Zundapp?
                         
           PACER (O.S.)
           Here it is, Professor.
                         
          Zundapp approaches a NOSY PACER who idles next to a CRATE.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           You wanted to see this before we

                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Ah, yes. Very carefully...
                         
          A forklift opens the crate -- inside is a TV CAMERA, packed
          carefully in foam. Finn SNAPS PHOTOS FURIOUSLY.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           Oh. A TV camera. What does it
           actually do?
           4.
                         
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           This camera is extremely dangerous.
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           What are you up to now, Professor?
                         
          Finn, angling for a better view, FIRES SUSPENSION WIRES ---
                         
          --- which sail clear to the other side of the derrick ---
                         
          --- THOK! They hook tightly onto a steel girder.
                         
          Finn slides out ONTO THE WIRE like an acrobat, then expels
          another cross-wire for support.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           This is valuable equipment. Make
           sure it is properly secured for the
           voyage.
                         
                          NOSY PACER
           You got it.
                         
          Finn LOWERS HIMSELF. He snaps more pictures.
                         
           GREM (O.S.)
           Hey, Professor Z!
                         
          Zundapp turns as a CRANE LOWERS A CAR-SIZED CRATE. GREM and
          ACER, an orange Gremlin and a green Pacer, flank it.
                         
                          GREM
           This is one of those British spies
           we told you about.
                         
                          ACER
           Yeah. This one we caught sticking
           his bumper where it didn't belong.
                         
          Finn PRODUCES SEMI-AUTOMATIC GUNS from his side, readies
          himself for a tag-team spy fight with his buddy Leland.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Agent Leland Turbo.
                         
          The crate is lifted, revealing a CRUSHED, CUBED Leland Turbo.
                         
          Finn's eyes go wide. Suddenly --- WHOOOSHHH! Another derrick
          flame rises behind him, casts a Finn-shaped SHADOW over the
          Professor. He looks up.
           5.
                         
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the
           camera! Kill him!!
                         
          Finn UNLOADS with bullets as he starts to retreat --- He
                         STOPS:
                         
          BAD GUY CARS are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just
          came from - BLOWTORCHES ready.
                         
          Finn, stuck in midair, notices an angry CRANE. Finn GRINS,
          having just found his escape.
                         
          THWAPTHWAPTHWAP!!! Finn releases three of his four cables,
          swinging, Indiana Jones-style on the last one TOWARD THE
                         CRANE ---
                         
          --- where he lands on its BOOM, drives UP and LAUNCHES OFF IT
          where he LANDS - MOVING - onto another deck!
                         
          Finn now DRIVES, spraying oil and screeching around corners.
          A GREMLIN in pursuit hits the oil patch, loses control ---
                         
          --- and PLUMMETS OFF the side of the rig!
                         
          The Gremlin FALLS... it's like an eternity...
                         
          He smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces.
                         
          ON FINN - Now set upon by 20 or 30 MORE pursuing cars. He has
          nowhere to go but UP UP UP a ramp toward the helipad. He
          spies some GASOLINE BARRELS, fires a SINGLE BULLET which cuts
          through its leather straps, sending barrels DOWN the ramp,
          PAST FINN ---
                         
          --- PAST the pursuing CARS ---
                         
          --- to the bottom where they EXPLODE in a CHAIN REACTION back
          UP THE RAMP, taking out at least 15 CARS!
                         
          ON THE HELIPAD - Finn blasts into view, pulls to a stop. No
          more road. Nowhere else to go.
                         
          The 20 BAD GUY CARS that are still in pursuit surround him,
          fire up their blowtorches. About to pounce.
                         
          Finn GRINS. The second time we've seen this grin. It means
          he's got something cooking.
                         
          Finn's REVERSE LIGHTS appear. He DRIVES BACKWARD off the edge
          of the helipad to the SHOCK of the other cars.
                         
          Finn falls. He turns himself so he's grill first, cleanly
          cutting into the water.

          He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away.

           Get to the boats.
                         
          THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea
          and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make
          up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they
          do so.
                         
                          ACER
           He's getting away!
                         
                          COMBAT SHIP
           Not for long.
                         
          The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water.
          It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and
          EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the
          night clouds.
                         
          UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS.
          We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now
          CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four
          DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.
                         
          ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far
          away.
                         
           GREM (OVER RADIO)
           He's dead, Professor.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile
           gone, who can stop us now?
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          TOW MATER, a rusty tow truck, putters into view.
                         
                          MATER
           Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is
           here to help you!
                         
          He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He
          drives around to the front, catching OTIS' face for the first
          time.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, Otis!
           7.
                         
                         
                          OTIS
           Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I
           thought I could make it this time,
           but...
           (he tries to start his
           engine, stalls)
           Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who
           am I kidding? I'll always be a
           lemon.
                         
          Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him.
                         
                          MATER
           Well dadgum, you're leaking oil
           again. Must be your gaskets. Hey,
           look on the bright side: This is
           your tenth tow this month, so that
           means it's on the house.
                         
                          OTIS
           You're the only one that's nice to
           lemons like me, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Don't sweat it. These things happen
           to everybody, Otis.
                         
                          OTIS
           But you never leak oil.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't
           tell nobody, but I think my rust is
           starting to show through.
                         
          Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN.
          It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen."
                         
                          OTIS
           Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?
                         
                          MATER
           Not yet.
                         
                          OTIS
           He must be crazy-excited about
           winning his fourth Piston Cup.
           Four! Wow!
           8.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him.
           But I sure wish he'd hurry up and
           get back `cause we got a whole
           summer's worth of best friend fun
           to make up for. Just me and --
                         
          Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible.
                         
                          MATER
           --- McQueen!
                         
          Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him.
                         
                          OTIS
           Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You
           don't need to go so fast!
                         
          Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air.

          Lightning McQueen is surrounded by his hometown friends.
                         
                          LUIGI

                          SHERIFF
           The place wasn't the same without
           you, son.
                         
                          LIZZIE
           What? Did he go somewhere?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           It's good to be home, everybody.

           McQueen!
                         
          They all turn around, see Mater speeding into town, with Otis
          swerving behind him.

           McQueen!
                         
          Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion,
          slingshots Otis forward ---
                         
                          OTIS
           Woaahhhhh!
                         
          --- right through Ramone's front door ---
                         
          INT. RAMONE'S - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --- where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift. Ramone
          lifts him up, routine.
                         
                          RAMONE
           Hey. How far'd you make it this
           time, Otis?
                         
                          OTIS
           Halfway to the county line.
                         
                          RAMONE
           Not bad, man.
                         
                          OTIS
           I know, I can't believe it either!

                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, it's so good to see you.
                         
                          MATER
           You too, buddy.
                         
          Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump
          style).
                         
                          MATER
           Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe
           the things I got planned for us.
                         
          Everyone watches as the tire bump continues.

           longer every year.

                          MATER
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           You ready to have some serious fun?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, actually I've got something
           to show you first.
                         
          INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY
                         
          CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned
          with a small likeness of Doc. It says "Hudson Hornet Piston
          Cup."
                         
                          MATER
           Wow. I can't believe they renamed
           the Piston Cup after our very own
           Doc Hudson.
                         
          McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public.
          McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three
          Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I know Doc said these things were
           just old cups, but to have someone
           else win it just didn't feel right,
           you know?
                         
                          MATER
           Well, Doc would've been real proud
           of you. That's for sure.
                         
          McQueen takes this in.
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER
                         
          McQueen and Mater exit the Doc Hudson Museum.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Alright, pal. I've been waiting all
           summer for this. What've you got
           planned?
                         
                          MATER
           You sure you can handle it?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Come on, you know who you're
           talking to? This is Lightning
           McQueen. I can handle anything.
           11.
                         
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
                         
          Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track, their tires
          off. They're on their rims.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Uh.... Mater?!
                         
                          MATER
           Just remember, your brakes ain't
           gonna work on these!
                         
          As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL ---
                         
           MCQUEEN (O.S.)
           Mater!
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           Relax, these train tracks ain't
           been used in years!
                         
          From inside the tunnel a loud TRAIN HORN. The two friends
          emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill,
          with no tires.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Come on, come on! Faster, faster!
                         
          Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears, oversized
          horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank.
                         
          EXT. FIELD - OUTSIDE RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER
                         
          An ENORMOUS EARTH MOVER sleeps. McQueen and Mater sneak up.
                         
                          MATER
           This is gonna be good!
                         
          They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER, tractor-tipping
          style. They LAUGH at the gag, but soon realize the earth
          mover's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.
                         
          The exhaust pipe BELCHES. McQueen and Mater are BLASTED out
          of view.
                         
          INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DUSK
                         
          The sun sets. McQueen and Mater roll into town. McQueen looks
          exhausted. Mater is still full of energy.
           12.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Boy, this was the best day ever!
           And my favorite souvenir?
                         
          Mater proudly shows off a dent.
                         
                          MATER
           This new dent!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Boy, Mater. Today was, uh...
                         
                          MATER
           Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til
           you see what I got planned for
           tonight.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of
           thinking of just a quiet dinner.

           That's exactly what I was thinking.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Even better! You, me and Miss Sally
           going out for supper.
                         
          McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, I meant it would be just me
           and Sally.
                         
                          MATER
           Oh.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           It's just for tonight. We'll do
           whatever you want tomorrow.
                         
                          MATER
                          (DISAPPOINTED)
           Okay.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Thanks for understanding.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have
           fun now.
           13.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo!
                         
          McQueen drives off. Mater watches him go.
                         
          EXT. THE WHEEL WELL - NIGHT
                         
          It's been converted into a white-tablecloth restaurant, with
          cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside.
                         
          MCQUEEN AND SALLY have a prime table with a view of Radiator
          Springs and the starry night sky.
                         
                          SALLY
           This is so nice.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I can't tell you how good it is to
           be here alone. Just the two of us.
           Finally, you and me ---
                         
           MATER (O.S.)
           Good evening.
                         
          Mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter.
                         
                          MATER
           My name is Mater and I'll be your
           waiter.
                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Mater the waiter. That's funny
           right there.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you work here?
                         
                          MATER
           Well yeah I work here. What'd you
           think, I just snuck in here when
           nobody was looking and pretended to
           be your waiter, just so I could
           hang out with you?
                         
          McQueen and Sally exchange a look.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that
           be?
                         
                          MATER
           Now, can I start you two lovebirds
           off with a couple drinks?
           14.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yes. I'll have my usual.
                         
                          SALLY
           You know what? I'm going to have
           that too.
                         
          Mater blinks.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh, right. Your usual.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INSIDE AT THE BAR - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes
          drinks, ala "Cocktail." Mater arrives.
                         
                          MATER
           Guido! What's McQueen's usual?
                         
                          GUIDO
           (in Italian, subtitled)
           How should I know?
                         
                          MATER
           Perfect! Give me two of `em.
                         
                          SARGE
           Quiet! My program's on.
                         
           MEL DORADO (O.S.)
           Tonight on "The Mel Dorado Show"!
                         
          ON THE BAR TV - "THE MEL DORADO SHOW," a cable talk show,
          begins with file footage of MILES AXLEROD, a sleek SUV.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           His story gripped the world! Oil
           billionaire Miles Axlerod, in an
           attempt to become the first car to
           circumnavigate the globe without
           GPS, ironically ran out of gas and
           found himself trapped in the wild!
                         
          We see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Feared dead, he emerged 36 days
           later, running on a fuel he'd
           distilled himself from the natural
           elements! Since then he's sold his
           oil fortune, converted himself from
           a gas-guzzler into an electric car,
           and has devoted his life to finding
           a renewable, clean-burning fuel!
           15.
                         
                         
          Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting
          converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Now he claims to have done it with
           his Allinol.
                         
          Images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all
          combining to form the Allinol logo.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           And to show the world what his new
           superfuel can do, he's created a
           racing competition like no other,
           inviting the greatest champions
           from around the globe to battle in
           the first ever World Grand Prix.
           Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod.
                         
          SIR MILES AXLEROD arrives, parks across from Mel's desk.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Thank you, Mel. It is very good to
           be here. Now listen to me: Big Oil.
           It costs a fortune. Pollution is
           getting worse. I mean, come on.
           It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in
           dead dinosaurs. And we all know
           what happened to them. Alternative
           energy is the future. Trust me,
           Mel, after seeing Allinol in action
           at the World Grand Prix, nobody
           will ever go back to gasoline
           again.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FILLMORE)
           What happened to the dinosaurs,
           now?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           And on satellite, a World Grand
           Prix competitor and one of the
           fastest cars in the world,
           Francesco Bernoulli.
                         
          Across the screen: LIVE FROM ROME, ITALY. We meet Formula
          race car FRANCESCO BERNOULLI.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           It is an honor, Signore Dorado. For
           you.
           16.
                         
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Miles, why not invite Lightning
           McQueen?
                         
          Mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half-intrigued.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Of course we invited him. But
           apparently after a very long racing
           season he is taking some time off
           to rest.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Lightning McQueen would not have a
           chance against Francesco!
                         
          Mater doesn't like this.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           I can go over 300 kilometers an
           hour! In miles that is like, uh...
           way faster than McQueen.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Let's go to the phones. Baltimore,
           Maryland, you're on the air.
                         
           CALLER (ON TV)
           Am I on? Hello?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           You're on. Go ahead.
                         
           CALLER (ON TV)
           Hello?
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Go ahead, caller.
                         
          Dial tone.
                         
           MEL DORADO (ON TV)
           Let's go to Radiator Springs.
           You're on, caller.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Yeah, that Italian feller you got
           on there can't talk that way about
           Lightning McQueen. He's the bestest
           race car in the whole wide world.
                         
          Fillmore and Sarge look around. Mater is visible in the back
          of the bar on an office phone.
           17.
                         
                         
                          SARGE
           Uh-oh...
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           If he is, how you say "the bestest
           race car," then why must he rest,
           eh?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Cause he knows what's important.
           Every now and then he prefers just
           to slow down, enjoy life.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Ah, you heard it! Lightning McQueen
           prefers to be slow! Of course, this
           is not news to Francesco. When I
           want to go to sleep I watch one of
           his races. After two laps I am out
           cold.
                         
          Audible RXNS from the bar. A crowd has been forming ever
          since Mater started talking.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           That ain't what I meant.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MCQUEEN AND SALLY - They hear the commotion inside.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Hey, what's going on over there?
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          THE BAR - Sally and McQueen push through the crowd, see that
          they're watching Francesco on the television.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (TO SALLY)
           Oh, it's that Italian Formula car.
           His name is ---
                         
                          SALLY
           Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder
           there's a crowd.
                         
          When Sally says his name, she enunciates each part, as if
          Italian were her mother's tongue.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait, why do you know his name? And
           don't say it like that. It's three
           syllables, not ten.
           18.
                         
                         
                          SALLY
           What? He's nice to look at. You
           know, open-wheeled and all.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What's wrong with fenders? I
           thought you like my fenders.
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           Well let me tell you something else
           there, Mr. San Francisco ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           McQueen could drive circles around
           you.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Driving in circles is all he can
           do, no?
                         
           MATER'S VOICE (ON TV)
           No! I mean yes. I mean he could
           beat you anywhere, anytime, any
           track.
                         
          On McQueen - he looks at Guido who gives a nod over to ---
                         
          --- Mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Mel, can we move on? Francesco
           needs a caller who can provide a
           little more intellectual
           stimulation. Like a dump truck.
                         
          ON MCQUEEN. He doesn't like this at all.
                         
                          MATER
           Ha ha! That shows what you know.
           Dump trucks is dumb.
                         
          Suddenly, Mater is YANKED from the booth and replaced by
          McQueen.
                         
           MCQUEEN (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah, hi, this is Lightning
           McQueen. Look, I don't appreciate
           my best friend being insulted like
           that.
           19.
                         
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           McQueen! That was your best friend?
           This is the difference between you
           and Francesco. Francesco knows how
           good he is. He does not need to
           surround himself with tow trucks to
           prove it.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Those are strong words from a car
           that is so fragile.
                         
           FRANCESCO (ON TV)
           Fragil�!? He calls Francesco
           fragil�? Not so fast, McQueen!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           "Not so fast." What is that, your
           new motto?
                         
          Francesco goes ballistic in Italian. They cut his mic.
                         
           MILES AXLEROD (ON TV)
           Well, this sounds like something
           that needs to be settled on the
           race course. What do you say,
           Lightning McQueen? We've still got
           room for one more racer.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, I would love to. The only
           thing is my crew's off for the
           season so ---
                         
          A sound O.S. McQueen turns to see Fillmore, Sarge and Luigi
          flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar. Ramone backs
          away, having spray painted "TEAM LIGHTNING MCQUEEN" on it.
          Guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles.
                         
                          GUIDO
           Pit stop.
                         
          McQueen turns back to the phone.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           You know what? They just got back.
           Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow!
                         
          The place ERUPTS IN CHEERS.
                         
          MOMENTS LATER - General excitement as McQueen exits the phone
          booth where Sally waits. Off her look:
           20.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I know, I know. I just got back.
           But we won't be long and ---
                         
                          SALLY
           Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've
           got enough to do here. Mater's
           going to have a blast though.
           (off McQueen's silence)
           You're bringing Mater, right? You
           never bring him to any of your
           races.
                         
          McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their
          drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.
                         
                          SALLY
           Just let him sit in the pits, give
           him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a
           thrill of a lifetime for him.
                         
          Mater arrives.
                         
                          MATER
           Your drinks, sir.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           I didn't taste it!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           How'd you like to come and see the
           world with me?
                         
                          MATER
           You mean it?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           You got me into this thing. You're
           coming along.
                         
                         BEGIN MONTAGE:
                         
          - McQueen is given a new paint job and headlights by Ramone.
          Mater, now sporting a "Team McQueen" emblem, seems psyched as
          well.
                         
          - An airport DEPARTURES SIGN advertises the next flight:
          Tokyo, Japan.
                         
          - Mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside McQueen, Guido,
          Luigi, Fillmore and Sarge as ---
           21.
                         
                         
          --- the rest of Radiator Springs watches them board a plane.
          Red bawls.
                         
          - IN THE JET, LATER. McQueen and Mater are the only ones
          awake, watch an insane Japanese game show.
                         
          - JAPAN AT NIGHT. A stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour,
          scrolling billboards, vending machines and high-tech
          skyscrapers.
                         
          - INSIDE A SOUVENIR SHOP loaded with McQueen toys: Mater and
          McQueen enter. A tourist sees McQueen and faints.
                         
          - A KABUKI THEATER. Team McQueen watches a methodical dance.
          Mater, dressed in Kabuki makeup, arrives. He looks insane.
                         
          - A SUMO MATCH - Two SUZUKI SAMURAI CARS wrestle over a
          parking space. Mater, now in his element, cheers.
                         
          The MONTAGE ENDS on this high note as we CUT TO ---
                         
          EXT. MUSEUM - TOKYO - NIGHT
                         
          ---- TEAM MCQUEEN, as they roll up the red carpet. Press is
          held at bay behind ropes. WORLD GRAND PRIX and ALLINOL logos
          are strategically placed for maximum press exposure. RACERS
          are interviewed by press behind the red-carpet ropes.
                         
          INT. TOKYO MUSEUM - NIGHT
                         
          Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which
          overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As
          they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed.
                         
                          LUIGI
           Guido, look! Ferraris and tires!
           Let's go!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (IMPRESSED)
           Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater,
           remember: best behavior.
                         
                          MATER
           You got it, buddy. Hey, what's
           that?
                         
          He sees something, peels away.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater!
                         
                          LEWIS HAMILTON
           Hey, McQueen, over here!
           22.
                         
                         
          It's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen
          now has no choice but to let Mater go.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Hey, Jeff. Lewis!
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a
          pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with
          his hook.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey! You done good! You got all the
           leaves!
                         
          People turn at the noise he's making.
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          MCQUEEN, JEFF and LEWIS.
                         
                          JEFF GORVETTE
           Check out that tow truck.
                         
                          LEWIS HAMILTON
           I wonder who that guy's with?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Will you guys excuse me just for
           one little second?
                         
          He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator
           Springs.
                         
                          MATER
           You're just realizing that? Boy,
           that jet-lag really done a number
           on you.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, look -- things are different
           over here. Which means maybe you
           should, you know, act a little
           different too.
                         
                          MATER
           Different than what?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Well, just... help me out here,
           buddy. I ---
           23.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           You need help? Shoot, why didn't
           you just say so? That's what a tow
           truck does. Hey, looky there, it's
           Mr. San Francisco!
                         
          FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court.
                         
                          MATER
           I'll introduce you.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, no.
                         
                          MATER
           (already on his way)
           Look at me -- I'm helping you
           already!
                         
          On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you
           to meet ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Nice to meet you, Francesco.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are
           very good-looking. Not as good as I
           thought, but you're good.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FRANCESCO)
           Excuse me. Can I get a picture with
           you?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Anything for McQueen's friend.
                         
          As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco:
                         
                          MATER
           Miss Sally is gonna flip when she
           sees this. She's Lightning
           McQueen's girlfriend.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Oooh.
           24.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           She's a big fan of yours.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Hey, she has good taste.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater's prone to exaggeration. I
           wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.
                         
                          MATER
           You're right. She's a huge fan. She
           goes on and on about your open
           wheels here.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
           as going "on and on."
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Francesco is familiar with this
           reaction to Francesco. Women
           respect a car that has nothing to
           hide.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yeah, uh...
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Let us have a toast.
                         
          McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Let's.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           (raising a drink)
           I dedicate my win tomorrow... to
           Miss Sally.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY
           win tomorrow to her. So if we both
           do it, it's really not so special.
           Besides, I don't have a drink.
                         
                          MATER
           I'll go get you one. You mind if I
           borrow a few bucks for one of them
           drinks?
           25.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           (could kill him)
           They're free, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing
           here?
                         
          Mater ZIPS OFF.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I should probably go keep an eye on
           him. See you at the race.
                         
          McQueen starts to leave.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Yes, you will see Francesco. But
           not like this.
                         
          Francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces McQueen.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           You will see him like this, as he
           drives away from you.
                         
          Francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "Ciao, McQueen!"
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           That's cute. So you had one of
           those made up for all the racers?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           No.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Okay.
                         
          He rolls off.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           He is so getting beat tomorrow.
                         
          INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Lights caress the main stage where a crowd has formed.
                         
                          VOICE
           Ladies and gentlecars... Sir Miles
           Axlerod!
                         
          MILES AXLEROD drives through an infinity fountain, appears.
           26.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           It is my absolute honor to
           introduce to you the competitors in
           the first-ever World Grand Prix.
           From Brazil. Number eight...
                         
          ON FINN MCMISSILE. He appears from the shadows, keeps a
          careful distance from the stage. He ZEROES HIS GAZE ON ---
                         
          --- THE WORLD GRAND PRIX TV CAMERAS which roll, catching
          Miles Axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity.
                         
          Finn's ONBOARD COMPUTER ANALYZES each one, compares to the
          photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. Each one is "NOT
          A MATCH." His view is suddenly disrupted by A BEAUTIFUL
          SPORTS CAR. She approaches Finn. Meet HOLLEY SHIFTWELL.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
           radiator.
                         
                          FINN
           That's because it's air-cooled.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley
           Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I
           have a message from London.
                         
                          FINN
           Not here.
                          (LOUDLY)
           You must try the canapes on the
           mezzanine!
                         
          He moves her onto an elevator. The doors close on them.
                         
          IN THE ELEVATOR, GOING UP.
                         
                          FINN
           So the lab boys analyzed the photo
           I sent? What did they learn about
           the camera?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           It appears to be a standard
           television camera. They said if you
           could get closer photos next time,
           that would be great.
                         
                          FINN
           This was London's message?
           27.
                         
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil
           platforms you were on? Turns out
           they're sitting on the biggest oil
           reserve in the world.
                         
                          FINN
           How did we miss that?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           They'd been scrambling everyone's
           satellites. The Americans actually
           discovered it just before you did.
           They placed an agent on that
           platform, under deep cover. He was
           able to get a photo of the car
           who's running the entire operation.
                         
          The doors OPEN and they exit onto the Mezzanine.
                         
                          FINN
           Who is it? Has anyone seen the
           photo yet?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, not yet. The American is here
           tonight to pass it to you. He'll
           signal you when he's ready.
                         
                          FINN
                          GOOD ---
                         
          Finn suddenly STOPS COLD.
                         
                          FINN
           Oh no.
                         
          Professor Zundapp is visible below them. He talks with a few
          Pacers and Gremlins. Finn quickly retreats into the shadows.
          Holley follows suit.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           What is it?
                         
                          FINN
           Change of plan. You're meeting the
           American.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           What, me?
           28.
                         
                         
                          FINN
           Those thugs down there were on the
           oil platform. If they see me, the
           whole mission is compromised.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm
           in Diagnostics. I'm not a field
           agent.
                         
                          FINN
           You are now.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MATER as he grabs a drink, keeps moving.
                         
                          MATER
           I'll take one of them.
                         
          He snatches it, drops it in the back where we now see a large
          assortment of drinks balanced.
                         
                          MATER
           Never know which one McQueen'll
           have a hankering for.
                         
          He approaches a sushi bar.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, what you got here that's free?
           How about that pistachio ice cream?
                         
          He refers to wasabi, of course.
                         
                          SUSHI CHEF
           No, no. Wasabi.
                         
                          MATER
           Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up
           with you? That looks delicious.
                         
          The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           Uh, a little more, please.
           It is free, right?
           (the chef adds more)
           Keep it coming. A little more. Come
           on, let's go, it's free! You're
           getting there... Scoop scoop!
                         
          The chef gives in. Scoops a baseball-sized ball out.
           29.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of
           ice cream.
                         
                          SUSHI CHEF
           (in Japanese, subtitles)
           My condolences.
           CUT BACK TO:
                         
          MILES AXLEROD - He's now nearly done with his intros.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           ... and now, our last competitor ---
           Number 95, Lightning McQueen!
                         
          MCQUEEN approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Thank you so much for having us,
           Sir Axlerod. I really look forward
           to racing. This is a great
           opportunity.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Oh, the pleasure is all ours,
           Lightning. You and your team bring
           excellence and professionalism to
           this competition.
                         
          As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain.
          Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage,
          making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN.
                         
                          MATER
           Somebody get me water!
                         
          He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat.
                         
                          MATER
                          (LAPPING WATER)
           Sweet relief...
                         
          Miles Axlerod is shocked. The crowd can't believe it.
          Francesco cackles. Mater, now sated, approaches the mic.
                         
                          MATER
           (to the crowd)
           Whatever you do, do not eat the
           free pistachio ice cream. It has
           turned!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is
           Mater.
           30.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           I know him. This is the bloke that
           called into the television show.
                          (TO MATER)
           You're the one I have to thank.
                         
                          MATER
           No, thank you. This trip's been
           amazing.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           He's a little excited, isn't he?
                         
          TILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater!
                         
                          MATER
           But wait, I... oh, shoot.
                         
          McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles
          Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you have to get a hold of
           yourself. You're making a scene.
                         
                          MATER
           But I never leak oil. Never.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Go take care of yourself right now.
                         
          Mater drives off.
                         
          ON MATER - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          He drives through the party, frantic.
                         
                          MATER
           Coming through! Excuse me, leakin'
           oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank
           you. I gotta go!
                         
          Someone points Mater down a hallway. He whips around the
                         CORNER ---
                         
          --- and STOPS. Finds himself in front of TWO BATHROOM DOORS,
          neither of which clearly indicate MALE or FEMALE.
           31.
                         
                         
                          MATER
                          (CONFUSED)
           What the...
                         
          Mater chooses one, drives inside. A SHRIEK is heard and Mater
          zips out.
                         
                          MATER
           Sorry ladies!
                         
          He heads into the other door ---
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Mater rolls in, still `holding it in' like a kid.
                         
                          MATER
           I never leak I never leak I never
           leak...
                         
          He sees someone leaving a stall. He heads in.
                         
          IN THE STALL - Mater enters, looks up.
                         
                          MATER
           Wowee...
                         
          The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights.
          High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as
          if he's going to get an oil change.
                         
                          MATER
           What in the---
                         
          A Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR,
          followed by images of waterfalls and rivers.
                         
                          MATER

           Hey, that tickles.
                         
          The caricature starts talking in Japanese. Suddenly WATER
          FIRES UP underneath Mater's undercarriage, goosing him. He
          freaks out.
                         
          OUTSIDE THE STALL - With Mater's yells audible we see a
          GREMLIN enter, furtive. Suddenly, inexplicably, his frame
          BREAKS APART like an egg, revealing an AMERICAN MUSCLE CAR
          underneath. The pieces of the Gremlin disappear under him,
          clearly his disguise. This is ROD REDLINE - American Agent.

          Rod Redline, waiting at a sink, feels a presence behind him.
                         
          GREM and ACER have entered, hesitate briefly when they see
          Rod Redline.
                         
          Rod Redline, careful, slides a gun out of his tire. He is
          suddenly CHARGED by the AMCs --- Rod SPINS AROUND and gets a
          shot off but is SLAMMED HEAD FIRST. A TIGHT, CLOSE-QUARTERS
          FIGHT begins ---
                         
          IN THE STALL - Mater, still TRAPPED, is now being SCRUBBED as
          if in a car wash. He is helpless.
                         
          OUTSIDE THE STALL - Rod is being pulverized. Just when he
          scrambles away from one car, the other one takes over.
                         
          IN THE STALL - Mater is mercifully released, but when he
          backs out ---

          with Allinol brand gasoline.
                         
                          ROD REDLINE
           Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear
           this stuff is good for you.

           PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (O.S.)
           So you think.
                         
          The Professor emerges from the darkness, behind Rod.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Allinol by itself is good for you.
                         
          Zundapp hits a button and the TREADMILL starts Rod's wheels
          spinning at a high rate of speed.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           But after microscopic examination,
           I have found that it has one small
           weakness. When hit with an
           electromagnetic pulse, it becomes
           extremely dangerous.

          Grem pushes a World Grand Prix CAMERA - the same one that
          was in the box back at the oil derrick. He points it at Rod
          Redline.

                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           You were very interested in this
           camera on the oil platform. Now you
           will witness what it really does.
                         
                          ROD REDLINE
           Whatever you say, Professor.
                         
          Acer pushes a TV MONITOR toward Rod. On it, surveillance
          footage from the party. Clearly, they were watching and
          recording him there.

                          ROD REDLINE
           Your mother. Oh no, I'm sorry. It
           was your sister. You know, I can't
           tell them apart these days.

                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           Fifty percent power.
           (to Rod Redline)
           This camera is actually an
           electromagnetic pulse emitter.
                         
                          ACER

                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           The Allinol is now heating to a
           boil, dramatically expanding,
           causing the engine block to crack
           under the stress, forcing oil into
           the combustion chamber.
                         
          Rod Redline's engine starts to CRACK and BREAK.

           What do I care? I can replace an
           engine block.
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           You may be able to, but after full
           impact of the pulse, unfortunately,
           there will be nothing to replace.

          down the hall.
                         
          Rod Redline, seeing this, does the world's most subtle double
          take. We caught it, but there's no way anyone else in the
          room could have ---

          As Grem turns up the machine even MORE, the Professor makes a
          call.
                         
           PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP (INTO PHONE)
           Yes sir. We believe the infiltrator
           has passed along sensitive
           information.

           Japan. Land of the rising sun.
           Where ancient tradition meets
           modern technology. Welcome to the

           I'm Brent Mustangburger, here with
           racing legends Darrell Cartrip and
           David Hobbscap. There's never been

           Second, the course itself, and it's
           like nothing we've ever seen.
           David, how exactly does this
           competition work?
                         
           DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.)
           Well, Brent, all three of these
           street courses are classic round-
           the-house racetracks.

           DAVID HOBBSCAP (V.O.)
           This means that the LMP and Formula

           GT and Touring cars like Spain's
           Miguel Camino should make up some
           ground but I doubt it'll be enough
           to stop Francesco from absolutely
           running away with it.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           Woah, now just hold your
           horsepower. You're forgetting the
           most important factor here. That
           early dirt track section of the
           course! The dirt is supposed to be
           the great equalizer in this race.

           French Rally car Raoul �aRoule is
           counting on a big boost headed
           through there.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           And don't forget Lightning McQueen!
           His mentor, the Hudson Hornet, was
           one of the greatest dirt track
           racers of all time. In my opinion,
           McQueen is the best all-around
           racer in this competition.

           Really, Darrell, I think you need
           to clean your windshield. You're
           clearly not seeing this for what it
           is: Francesco's race to lose.

           Francesco. Is. Triple speed.
           Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's

           the dust.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Nice call, Mater. Keep it up!
                         
          McQueen now leads the pack, zooming out of the dirt now
          starting to relax.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           Who-hoo! Man, McQueen looks happier
           than a rollbar at a demolition
           derby!

           Everyone's jostling for position as
           we hit the asphalt again.
                         
          Francesco crests the hill, in last place. He bites down,
          determined, then CHASES.
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Francesco lost a lot of momentum in
           the dirt. He's got some serious
           work ahead of him if he wants to
           get back in this race.

          VARIOUS SHOTS OF TOKYO as the racers move through the Rainbow

          and Acer are manning this one. They focus it on the racers as

          ON THE TRACK - A racer (Miguel Camino) suddenly PLUMES WITH
          SMOKE and skids out.
                         
           DARRELL CARTRIP (V.O.)
           Oh! Miguel Camino has blown an
           engine!
                         
           BRENT MUSTANGBURGER (V.O.)
           Very unusual, Darrell. He's been so
           consistent all year.
                         
          Camino quickly pits, passing McQueen's pit where Mater is
          visible.

           It's that tow truck from the

           Let's keep this line clear.
                         
          BOOM! A racer behind McQueen suddenly expels black smoke,
          skids out of control.

           Well, all right but I usually like

          He empties the extinguisher in their eyes, speeds past. They
          try and follow, but have been blinded. One of them crashes
          right into a COP.

          IN THE BACK ALLEYS - As Mater moves on he's followed by
          Pacers and Gremlins. Suddenly ---
                         
          --- CABLES whip in front of them, pulling over flower vending
          machines and sending the shop's owners into a frenzy. They

          ON FINN, admiring his handiwork as he appears. Just as he
          turns to leave he's BROADSIDED and pushed INTO A DARK ALLEY.
                         
          IN THE ALLEY - Finn finds himself boxed by two Pacers and
          pushed toward ---

           toward that ruckus?
                         
          Mater turns INTO the alley.
                         
           HOLLEY (OVER RADIO)
           No! Don't go down that street!
                         
          IN THE ALLEY - Finn, now nearly pushed completely into the
          flame thrower, leaps into the air. He FIGHTS BACK, using his
          wheels, axle, indeed his entire car frame as if he were
          human, kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies.
                         
          Mater witnesses the whole thing.

           Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.
                         
          IN THE BACK ALLEY - Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a
          bullet into a gas main line, causing an EXPLOSION that tosses
          Acer through the air where he lands in a NOODLE SHOP'S SIGN.

          IN THE ALLEY - Finn heaves breaths, surveys his damage.
                         
                          MATER
           That was cool! Hey, can I get your
           autograph?
           51.
                         
                         
          Mater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door,
          momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn. Once the fans have
          past, Finn has disappeared.
                         
                          MATER

                          DARRELL CARTRIP
           Francesco, over here! Hey, what was
           your strategy today?
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Strategia? Francesco needs no
           strategy, it's very simple. You
           start the race, wait for Lightning
           McQueen to choke, pass him, then
           win. Francesco always wins. It's
           boring.
                         
          McQueen, waiting in the wings, rolls his eyes. He suddenly
          notices something O.S.
                         
          McQueen's P.O.V. - It's MATER, appearing from a side street,
          moving toward the pits, oblivious of the press conference.
                         
                          DARRELL CARTRIP
                          (TO FRANCESCO)
           I gotta tell you, dude. You were in
           trouble for awhile. That dirt track
           section had you crawling!
                         
          As McQueen SNEAKS AWAY ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           To truly crush one's dream, you
           must first raise their hopes very
           high.

          Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the
          race over? You won, right?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          Mater, why were you yelling things
          at me while I was racing?
                         
                          MATER
          Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's
          funny right there. Nah, see that's
          `cause I seen these two fellers
          doing some sort of karate street
          performance. It was nutso. One of
          them even had a flamethrower ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          A flamethrower? What are you
          talking about? I don't understand.
          Where were you?
                         
                          MATER

                          MATER
          She started talking to me as a
          voice in my head, telling me where
          to go ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          What?
                         
                          MATER
          Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you
          up, did I?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          I lost the race because of you!
                         
                          MATER
          Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
          An imaginary girlfriend,
          flamethrowers. This is exactly why
          I don't bring you along to these
          things.

                          MATER
           Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to
           somebody and explained what
           happened I could help.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I don't need your help. I don't
           want your help.

           Hey, there he is!!
                         
          The press finds McQueen, swarms him. Mater is pushed
          backwards as the questions fly again.
                         
                          PRESS
           - McQueen, you had it in the bag!
           - Yeah, what happened?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I made a mistake. But I can assure
           you, it won't happen again.
                         
          On Mater. He takes this badly.

           lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the
           first race of the World Grand Prix
           and three, count em, three cars
           flamed out leading some to suggest
           that their fuel, Allinol, might be
           to blame.

           Allinol is safe! Alternative fuel
           is safe! There is no way my fuel
           caused these cars to flame out!

                          DARRELL CARTRIP
           Well the jury may still be out on
           whether Allinol caused these
           accidents, but one thing's for
           sure: Lightning McQueen blew this
           race.

          AT THE SECURITY CHECK - MOMENTS LATER. Cars take off their
          tires, move through the metal detector. Mater waits in line.
          A SECURITY CAR approaches Mater.
                         
                          SECURITY CAR

          IN THE ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER. The Security Car
          leads Mater inside.
                         
                          SECURITY CAR
           Right this way.
                         
          As they move past us the Security Car covertly drops a BALL
          BEARING which rolls into a corner. The ball bearing then
          sprouts MECHANICAL LEGS, tripods itself and IRISES out,
          revealing itself to be a tiny CAMERA.
                         
          IN THE MAIN ROOM - ADMIRAL'S LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

                          MATER
           Doggone it. This is about my hook,
           isn't it? I know I should've
           checked it, but I can't really,
           look -- it's attached to me.
                         
          ZWAPPPPPP!! The Security Car suddenly DECLOAKS himself,
          reveals himself to be Finn McMissile!
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, I know you. You're that feller
           from the karate demonstration.
                         
                          FINN
           I never properly introduced myself.

                          MATER
           Let's just say I'm triple-A
           affiliated. You know, I know some
           karate. I don't wanna brag or
           nothing, but I've got me a black
           fan belt.
                         
          BEEP! Finn's rearview alarms. His camera has picked up Grem
          and Acer. They've just entered the lounge, are right around
          the corner.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, you wanna see some moves I
           made up?
                         
                          FINN
           You're being followed.
                         
          Finn quickly turns, fires a tiny GLASS CUTTING BEETLE at the
          window. As Mater talks, oblivious, the beetle cuts out a
          round hole.
                         
                          MATER
           This first one I can reach into a
           car's hood, pull out his battery,
           and show it to him before he
           stalls. I call it, "What I
           accidentally did to my friend Luigi
           once."
           56.
                         
                         
          Mater does his best (worst) karate moves as Acer and Grem
          turn the corner.
                         
                          GREM
           There he is!
                         
          The glass drops away, leaving a car-sized hole.
                         
                          MATER

           about to miss my flight.

           Don't worry.
                         
          Finn HOOKS Mater from behind. He YANKS HIM forward ---
                         
                          FINN
           I've taken care of that. Hang on.

          Finn pulls Mater down HARD onto the tarmac, towing him away
          from the terminal.
                         
                          MATER
           This is First Class service. You
           don't even have to go through the
           terminal.
                         
          ACER and GREM appear, chasing them. Mater, who is facing
          backward as he is being pulled along, faces them. They're
          about a hundred yards back.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FINN)
           Your karate partners are back here.
           They kinda look like they're trying
           to catch up!
                         
                          FINN
           Drive forward. Whatever you do,
           don't stop.
                         
          Finn SKIDS around, whipping Mater in a 180 so that Mater is
          now towing Finn.
                         
          Grem produces a ROCKET, lines up Finn as his target.

          Finn, without hesitation, fires a MINI ROLLING-JACK. The jack
          DRIVES ITSELF toward Grem, anchors itself under his frame and
          flips him like a turtle but not before Grem gets the rocket
                         OFF ---
                         
          THE ROCKET - it flies toward Mater and Finn.
                         
          FINN aims and launches a MISSILE back.

           Is everything okay back there?
                         
           SIDDELEY (O.S.)
           Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.
                         
          A GULFSTREAM JET wings into view overhead. This is SIDDELEY.
                         
                          FINN
           Roger that.
                         
          Mater looks up: ACER screeches into view up ahead, dragging a
          long row of luggage carts in Mater's path, attempting to
          create an accident.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO FINN)
           You remember that whole thing about
           me not stopping no matter what?
                         
          Just as it looks dire --- RATATATATATATAT!!! SIDDELEY
          descends, hawklike, fires bullets and blows the luggage carts
          sky-high. Mater and Finn burst through them, luggage now
          raining down from above.
                         
                          MATER
           I knew I should've done carry-on!
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO SIDDELEY)
           Thanks, old boy!
                         
          Siddeley LANDS HARD on the tarmac ahead of them. No time to
          stop, he DROPS his back open, revealing HOLLEY.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary
           girlfriend!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Come on! Get in here!
           58.
                         
                         
          Mater SPEEDS UP toward Siddeley's ramp, Holley.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           Boy I tell you what, you really do
           want this first date, don't ya?
           That's a no-quit attitude right
           there.
                         
          Just as Mater's wheels touch the ramp, BULLETS PING around
          him in a spray. Siddeley is HIT, a tire BLOWN. He yells in
          pain.
                         
                          FINN
           Hold on, Sid!
                         
          Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass.
                         
          A gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer. Finn SHOOTS ACER'S
          TIRE, blowing it and throwing him off-course.
                         
          Acer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET ---
                         
          --- OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker.
                         
          ON SIDDELEY - He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac,
          where the grass and runway meet WATER. He HITS THE GAS, his
          only hope.
                         
                          SIDDELEY
           Finn, it's now or never!
                         
          Finn BRAKES, 180s and grabs the ramp just as Siddeley gets
          air.
                         
                          SIDDELEY
           Hold on!
                         
          Mater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes
          from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds. As he's
          PULLED in through the back hatch:

          INT. LOBBY - HOTEL - TOKYO - DAY
                         
          CLOSE ON a handwritten (er, tire-written?) NOTE in childish
          scrawl. We don't see all of it, only a bit. Mater's voice
          O.S. begins the note with the first sentence, but we DISSOLVE

           I hope that device didn't fall off.
                         
                          MATER
           That's the closest I ever been to

          With a ROBOTIC ARM, Holley grabs the THE DEVICE that Rod
          Redline hid under Mater. She yanks it out with a GOOSE.
                         
                          MATER

           Still in one piece, great.
                         
          Holley drops the device into a mainframe computer. It starts

           Finally. Time to see who's behind
           all this.
                         
          AN IMAGE is blasted between the three of them. It's of a
          photograph, a complicated melange of metallic parts stuck
          together.
                         
                          HOLLEY

           Well, that's one of the worst
           engines ever made. It's an old
           aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical
           system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot,
           them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
           tell you what. Them ain't metric,
           they ain't inches...

                          FINN
           Holley, in how many makes and
           models did this type of engine
           appear?
                         
          Holley has these stats in seconds. Kid's play.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           It was standard in seven models
           over a 12-year period. At least
           35,000 cars were made with this
           engine.
                         
          Mater MOVES HIS SEAT FORWARD, through one part of the
          hologram so he's face-to-face with Holley.
                         
                          MATER

           Just pay attention.

           This seems like a dead end. If
           there were something in the photo

           I'd be a lot happier.
                         
                          MATER
           You might not be happy, but I bet
           this feller is. See how he's had
           most of his parts replaced? And see
           all them boxes over there? Them's
           all original parts. They ain't easy

           I know of a black-market parts
           dealer in Paris, a treacherous
           lowlife. But, he's the only car in

                          MATER
           Yeah, two of them sweets for me
           too, Sid!
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           You know, I always wanted to be a
           spy.
                         
                          HOLLEY
                          (SMILING SWEETLY)
           Really? Me too.
                         
                          SIDDELEY
           Afterburners, sir?
                         
                          FINN
           Is there any other way?
                         
          EXT. JET - MOVING
                         
          Siddeley HITS THE JUICE, they kick forward like a mule as we
          CUT TO ---
                         
          A MONTAGE OF PARIS: Mater attempts to merge into roundabout
          traffic; mimes annoy tourists at the Eiffel Tower; a painter
          works his magic on an unattractive couple; a couple kisses on
          the most romantic spot in the world; we might even catch
          GASTOW'S RESTAURANT.

          The charming, low-key introduction ends with a SWEEPING VISTA
          of Paris's center from far away as we CRANE DOWN INTO ---
                         
          EXT. STREET - DAY
                         
          --- a dirty street in the 1st Arrondissement. Finn and Holley
          drive along together as Mater, playing "spy," darts back and
          forth behind them from doorway to dumpster, "hiding out."
          He's having a ball.

           Once we're inside, stay close.
           Don't bother checking VIN numbers
           for criminal records, they're all
           dodgy here.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No VIN scans. Got it.
                         
                          FINN
           Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at
           anyone. And absolutely, positively
           no idling. Are we clear?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir.

                          MATER
           Yeah, Finn?
                         
                          FINN
           We're not here to go shopping.
                         
          As Finn and Holley and Mater turn the corner...
                         
                          MATER
           Shopping? What do you mean? Why

          Mater turns the corner and enters a massive Les Halles-
          inspired Parisian market filled with car parts. A tow truck's
          dream.

          IN THE MARKET - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Mater rolls along, impressed by the goods for sale.
                         
                          MATER
           You gotta be kidding me - they've
           got everything here. Look at them
           hoods! I could use a hood.
                         
          Mater continues on though, heeding Finn's advice.
                         
                          MATER
           Sorry fellers, I gotta go.
                         
          INT. ENCLOSED MARKETPLACE - DAY
                         
          Mater, now out of sight of Finn and Holley, passes a darkened
          stall. He STOPS, peers in. There's someone in there.
                         
                          MATER
           Excuse me. What are you selling?
                         
          It suddenly OPENS its headlights revealing... EYES!! In
          French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater. Mater
          FREAKS OUT, speeds off, TERRIFIED.
                         
          AROUND THE CORNER - FINN AND HOLLEY
                         
          A few car lengths ahead of Mater. They roll along, looking
          for... Aha! Finn and Holley recede into the shadows.
                         
          In FINN'S SIDE MIRROR: TOMBER, a three-wheeled parts dealer,
          argues with a French customer.
                         
                          FINN
           There you are.
                         
          Mater suddenly turns the corner, sees Finn and Holley.
                         
                          MATER
           Man, there are some great ---
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, get back!
                         
          Too late. Tomber sees Mater, then notices FINN, reflected in
          a hubcap. He BOLTS. Finn and Holley give chase.
                         
                          MATER
           Hey, wait for me!
                         
          Tomber, skidding away, kicks a tent in Finn's way. Holley
          quickly pivots RIGHT and disappears. Where did she go?
           66.
                         
                         
          Finn, hot in pursuit, leaps another obstacle and loses ground
                         TO ---
                         
          --- Tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to
          grill with HOLLEY. He whips to the left but TURNS OVER,
          rolling sideways and CRASHING to a stop.
                         
          Holley ZAPS him with ELECTROSHOCKERS. Finn suddenly arrives,
          stops her.
                         
                          FINN
                          (TO HOLLEY)
           Have you lost your mind?!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           But I thought ---
                         
                          FINN
           Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook
           him up.
                         
                          MATER
           Sure thing.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MOMENTS LATER - Mater tows Tomber, following Finn and Holley.
                         
                          TOMBER
           You rusty piece of junk, get your
           dirty hook off me!
                         
          INT. A SMALL GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Finn throws open a door. Cars scatter like cockroaches.
                         
                          FINN
           (to the cars)
           Allez! Maintenant - vite!
                         
          Mater unhooks an angry Tomber who spits in French. Finn pulls
          the door down. As it LATCHES TIGHT ---
                         
                          TOMBER
                          (TO FINN)
           Electroshock! Are you kidding me??
                         
                          FINN
           Easy, Tomber. This is her first
           field assignment - she didn't know
           you were my informant.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Informant?
           67.
                         
                         
                          TOMBER
           A rookie, eh? I never liked new car-
           smell.
                         
          Holley FUMES with anger.
                         
                          FINN
           Tomber was doing 20 to life in a
           Moroccan impound the first time I
           saved him, if I recall correctly.
                         
                          TOMBER
           Speaking of recalls, you're getting
           up there in mileage aren't you,
           Finn?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Alright, we get it. You both know
           each other, you're both old. So.
                         
          Holley shoots a HOLOGRAPHIC PHOTO of the engine in front of
          Tomber.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           There you go, informant. Inform us.
                         
          Tomber eyes the photo. He recoils, unimpressed.
                         
                          TOMBER
           That is the worst motor ever made.
                         
          Suddenly, Tomber narrows his gaze.
                         
                          TOMBER
           Wait. That oil filter... those
           wheel bearings.
                         
                          FINN
           Do those parts look familiar,
           Tomber?
                         
                          TOMBER
           They should. I sold them.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           To whom?
                         
                          TOMBER
           No idea. He's my best customer, but
           he always does his business over
           the phone. I was always wondering
           why he needs so many parts. Now I
           know.
           68.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't
           nothing truer than that.
                         
                          FINN
           "Lemon?"
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, you know. Cars that don't
           ever work right. Lemons is a tow
           truck's bread and butter. Like them
           Gremlins and Pacers we run into at
           the party and the race and the
           airport.
                         
                          FINN
           Holley, pull up the pictures from
           the oil platform. I want to know
           what other type of cars were out
           there.
                         
          Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL
          PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Right. Let's see. There were Hugos.
           And Trunkovs.
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, are these cars considered
           lemons?
                         
                          MATER
           Is the Popemobile Catholic?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Finn. Everyone involved in this
           plot is one of history's biggest
           loser cars.
                         
          Holley refers to the ENGINE PHOTO, which now rises forward as
          the prominent picture, perhaps the only one in view.
                         
                          FINN
           And they're all taking their orders
           from the car behind this engine.
                         
                          TOMBER
           This explains it!
                         
                          FINN
           What, Tomber?
           69.
                         
                         
                          TOMBER
           Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkovs
           never get together. But they're
           having a secret meeting in two
           days.
                         
                          FINN
           Where's this meeting taking place?
                         
                          TOMBER
           Porto Corsa, Italy.
                         
                          MATER
           That's where the next race is!
                         
                          FINN
           Then there's a good chance our
           mystery engine will be there too.
                         
                          TOMBER
           Your chances are more than good. I
           just sent him a new clutch assembly
           yesterday... to Porto Corsa.

           Holley, contact Stephenson and have

           wheeled feller had to be right
           about a big meeting.

          Mater, Finn and Holley scroll through surveillance-style
          photos of TRAFFIC on an Italian street. They're in the front
          train car, which doubles as a luxury seating area and
          intelligence command center.

           You never see this many lemons in
           one town. Unless there's a swap
           meet, or something.

           Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto

           recognition scans.
                         
                          MATER
           Wow, not only is you the prettiest
           car I ever met, but you the
           smartest too.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Thank you. I think.
                         
                          MATER
           That's a familiar sight.
                         
          Mater refers to a photo of VICTOR HUGO, the HUGO Lemonhead,
          being towed by an EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK.

           A Hugo being towed. But he looks

           Of course. They must be the heads
           of the lemon families.
                         
                          MATER
           Makes sense. If I was rich and
           broke down every day, I'd hire me
           to tow me around all the time too.
                         
                          FINN
           We've got to infiltrate that
           meeting. It's the only way to find
           out who's behind all this.

           Hang on a minute.
                         
                          MATER
           What?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Hold still.
                         
          Holley SNAPS Mater's picture, temporarily blinding him.
                         
                          MATER
           Ahh!

          Holley turns back to her monitor. Mater's face appears on
          screen. She quickly GRAFTS it over the Hugo's tow truck's.

           Good job, Miss Shiftwell.
                         
          Holley isn't sure what surprises her more: the compliment or
          how pleased it makes her.
                         
                          HOLLEY

          UNCLE TOPOLINO, a distinguished 1937 Fiat Topolino, rolls

           You look so down, so low. Is like
           you have flat tires.
                         
          MAMA TOPOLINO, a hefty Italian grandmother pipes up, a mile a
          minute then drives off, now a car on a mission.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           She said you look like you're
           starving. That she's going to make
           you a big meal, and fatten you up.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No, Mama Topolino, please. You
           don't need to make a fuss!
                         
          Too late. She's disappeared inside her kitchen.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           Capisco. I understand. Is a
           problem, yes? Between you and a
           friend?

                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           That, and Luigi told me. While Mama

           I brought my friend Mater along on
           the trip. And I told him he needed
           to act different, that we weren't
           in Radiator Springs.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           This Mater. He's a close friend?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           He's my best friend.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           Then why would you ask him to be
           someone else?
                         
          McQueen considers this - a realization.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What did I do? I said some things
           during our fight...
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           You know, back when Guido and Luigi
           used to work for me, they would
           fight over everything.
                         
          IN THE SQUARE - Guido dances with a girl. Luigi suddenly CUTS
          IN. They begin to ARGUE.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           They fight over what Ferrari was
           the best Ferrari; which one of
           them look more like a Ferrari...
           There were even some non-Ferrari
           fights.
                         
          Guido now LIFTS Luigi, cuts BACK in.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           So I tell them, va bene. It's okay
           to fight. Everybody fights now and
           then, especially best friends.
                         
          McQueen takes this in. Seems to take some small comfort.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           But you gotta make up fast.
                         
          McQueen's comfort quickly evaporates.
                         
                          UNCLE TOPOLINO
           No fight more important than
           friendship.

          Guido and Luigi now dance together with the girl and her
          friend who has just arrived. All having a great time. They
          dance past us, crossing in front of MCQUEEN AND UNCLE
          TOPOLINO. We STAY WITH them.

          Holley turns back to her work. The disguise's cloaking is

          MATER, now looking a bit nervous. He backs out of sight.
                         
                          MATER
           I don't know about this, Finn.
           What if I screw things up?
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           Impossible. Just apply the same
           level of dedication you've been
           using to play the "idiot tow truck"
           and you'll be fine.
                         
                          MATER
           It's just that them guys look
           pretty tough and --- Wait, did you
           say "idiot"? Is that how you see
           me?
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           That's how everyone sees you. Isn't
           that the idea? I tell you, that's
           the genius of it. No one realizes
           they're being fooled because
           they're too busy laughing at the
           fool. Brilliant.
                         
          While Finn talks, Mater takes this in. He catches his own
          reflection in a nearby window. Seems to be seeing himself
          with new eyes.

           Ivan!
                         
          Mater realizes Victor is talking to him. He hops to it.
                         
                          VICTOR HUGO
           Ivan, why do you insult me so by
           making me wait?
                         
          Mater, now with Victor hooked, tows him in the front doors of
          the casino.

           That's because it is, Mater. Now,

           They laughed at us. But now it's

          BOOM! Another racer blows an engine. Mater JUMPS again.

          Holley replays that last crash. The OUTLINE OF THE BEAM is
          seen hitting the racer. Holley TRACES THIS to its source ---
                         
          --- a WGP CAMERA, which Grem and Acer have pointed at the
          racers from a tower position.

          The Lemons and Lemonheads hit the deck and RETURN FIRE ---
                         
          Mater is THROWN BACKWARD by the force of the guns, back
          through some double doors and onto a BALCONY.
                         
                          MATER

          catches air and is YANKED INTO THE SKY!
                         
          The Lemonheads watch him float away, amazed.
                         
          ON MATER, out of the frying pan but still toasty. He looks
          around, notices:
                         
          LIGHTNING MCQUEEN, far away, leaving the press podium.
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen!
                         
          Mater looks down at the harbor, over which he flies. He spots
          a MOTORBOAT. Mater WHIPS his hook down, steals a ride behind
          the boat TOWARD MCQUEEN.
           96.

           Aspetti!
                         
          The motorboat isn't happy about this, tries to shake him.
          Mater is THROWN INTO A "HOTEL" sign, then SMASHES down
          through a Francesco souvenir stand. As he CRASHES onto the
          ground hard, we SMASH CUT TO ---
                         
          EXT. SECURITY CHECKPOINT - WINNERS CIRCLE

          ITALIAN SECURITY TRUCKS stand guard.
                         
                          MATER
           Lemme through! Lemme through!
                         
          MATER barrels around a corner. He's now covered in Francesco
          memorabilia and palm leaves. The word `HOT' now dangles off
          him like the world's biggest bling. He looks INSANE.
                         
                          MATER
                          (TO SECURITY)
           You gotta let me in! I gotta get
           through to warn McQueen!
                         
          Security eyes one another. This is serious.

           No, listen! I was disguised as a

           Lemonhead meeting and my weapons

          Mater spots McQueen far off in the distance.
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen! McQueen!

           Mater?
                         
          McQueen looks up but can only see A SEA OF VEHICLES,
          flashbulbs, cameras, TV trucks with those tall satellite
          antennae things that spindle toward the sky...
                         
          BACK AT THE SECURITY BARRICADE - Mater, like a nimble running
          back, dances around to avoid capture by security.
                         
                          MATER

           Back up, sir. Stop moving! Stop!
                         
          Mater head fakes them and pushes through, into the crowd ---
                         
                          ITALIAN SECURITY #1
           Oy! Stop! Ferma li!
                         
          IN THE CROWD - Mater shoves his way through. He's still far
          in the back.
                         
                          MATER

                          MCQUEEN
           That really sounded like Mater.
           Mater?
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           Signore...
                         
          ON MATER, getting CLOSER...
                         
                          MATER
           McQueen, they're gonna kill you!!
                         
          ON MCQUEEN - Okay, he's positive that was his friend, but
          where is he?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater?!
                         
          McQueen spots a TOW HOOK, moving through the crowd toward
          him, "Jaws"-like.
           98.
                         
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Excuse me.
                         
          McQueen disappears into the press crowd.
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
           No, no, where are you going?
           Please, Mr. McQueen!
                         
          McQueen pushes through the press.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Scusi. Mater! Scusi...
                         
          McQueen tracks the tow hook, gets closer. He pushes through
          the last few vehicles ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm
           so sorr ---
                         
          It's NOT MATER. It's IVAN, the Hugo Thug's tow truck.
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
           Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (CONFUSED)
           Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I heard---
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
           Yes, but that was me. I said, "You
           killed out there today." You're
           the best.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           What? Oh. I mean, thanks.
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
           Right this way, signore ---
                         
          Now the Press Liaison and his assistants are pushing McQueen
          back in the other direction ---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           (as he's pulled away)
           I really thought I heard my friend.
                         
          As he's pulled away, press and onlookers start to come
          between him and Ivan, who hasn't moved.
           99.
                         
                         
           IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
                          (TO MCQUEEN)
           In England you'll be finished. At
           the finish line.
                         
          Ivan is now obscured again.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait, what?
                         
          The ITALIAN PRESS being to swarm.
                         
                          PRESS LIAISON
           Please, the world press is waiting.
           You come with me, please.
                         
          McQueen is pulled back ---
                         
          EXT. STREET - PORTO CORSA - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          --- just as Mater, now BOUND and with HIS MOUTH TAPED, is
          pulled away and thrown into the back of a transport vehicle.
          He lands hard on his side, spits out his TAPE.
                         
                          MATER
           Let me go!
                         
                          PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
           You actually care about that race
           car. A pity you didn't warn him in
           time.
                         
          As the doors close on Mater --- PHHHHHSSSSSSTTTTTTT! A
          thick, noxious gas starts to fill the truck.
                         
          On MATER as the knockout gas works its magic. HIS EYES CLOSE.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          BLACK SCREEN.
                         
           MATER (V.O.)
           Idiot? Is that how you see me?
                         
           FINN (V.O.)
           That's how everyone sees you. I
           tell you, that's the genius of it.
                         
          FADE IN on Mater, back at the Casino, eyeing his reflection
          in the glass window. It's the same moment from before except
          now we are watching it from a DETACHED, FLOATING PERSPECTIVE.
           100.
                         
                         
           FINN (OVER RADIO)
           No one realizes they're being
           fooled because they're too busy
           laughing at the fool.
                         
          - IN THE KABUKI THEATER IN JAPAN - Again, from before. Mater
          makes a spectacle of himself, WHOOPING AND HOLLERING in the
          stands with the face paint on.
                         
                          MATER
           Domo arigato!
                         
          McQueen, Fillmore, Guido, Luigi, Sarge and patrons eye Mater,
          embarrassed and angry.
                         
          - IN THE JAPANESE MUSEUM - The moment of Mater banging on the
          Zen rock garden's glass. Except that now we see all sorts of
          disappointed and eyebrow raising reactions.
                         
                          MATER
           You done good! You got all the
           leaves!
                         
                          JEFF GORVETTE
           Check out that tow truck.

           I wonder who that guy's with?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (HUMILIATED)
           Will you guys excuse me just for
           one little second?
                         
          We now REVEAL that this FLOATING, THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE is
          MATER. He's INSIDE his past, watching it from others' points
          of view. He doesn't like what he sees.
                         
          - ON MATER, now at the sushi bar.
                         
                          MATER
           Now that's a scoop of ice cream!
                         
          Mater swallows the wasabi with one big bite. He SCREAMS! The
          sushi bar patrons blanch with revulsion at his wail.
                         
          - ON THE FOUNTAIN, as Mater peels into full view of everyone
          else at the party. As Mater laps up water from a fountain:
                         
                          MCQUEEN
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Mater?!

          ALL THE RACERS, with FRANCESCO front and center, guffaw at
          Mater.
                         
          - On MCQUEEN, now scolding Mater moments later.
                         
                          MATER
           I never leak oil. Never.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, you have to get a hold of
           yourself. You're making a scene!
                         
          - IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE, after the Japanese race.
                         
                          MATER
           Wait a minute. I didn't screw you
           up, did I?
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I lost the race because of you!
                         
                          MATER
           Maybe if I talked to somebody, or---
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I don't need your help. I don't
           want your help!
                         
          - Now BACK AT THE PARTY, a moment we didn't see before but
          which presumably happened. Mater is BANGING a ceremonial
          GONG, to the horror of Japanese guests.
                         
                          MATER
           Bang a gong, get it on!
                         
          GONNNNNNG!!! ---
                         
          On the PARTYGOERS, RACE CARS, PARTY STAFF - they're all
          laughing at Mater as McQueen's final words blend in, making a
                         DISSATISFIED CACOPHONY
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Listen, this isn't Radiator
           Springs. This is exactly why I
           don't bring you along to these
           things!
                         
          Off the GONG at the party ---
                         
          INT. BIG BENTLEY - DAY

          CLOSE ON MATER as he OPENS HIS EYES.
           102.
                         
                         
          All around him, all he sees are GIANT PIECES OF MECHANIZED
          CLOCKWORK.
                         
          HOLLEY and FINN are here too, strapped bumper to bumper in
          the divots of large clock movements.
                         
                          MATER
           Holley! Finn! Where are we?
                         
                          FINN
           We're in London, Mater. Inside Big

          INT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Suddenly Mater DROPS QUICKLY down toward ---

           Woaaaah! ---
                         
          WHAP! The chain yanks to a STOP.
                         
          Mater, instead of being 30 feet from death, is now 20.
                         
          Finn and Holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed
          themselves. The clock ticks to 3:01.
                         
                          MATER
           This... this is all my fault.
                         
                          FINN
           Don't be a fool, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           But I am, remember? You said so.
                         
                          FINN
           When did I... Oh. Mater, I was
           complimenting you on what a good
           spy you are.
                         
                          MATER
           I'm not a spy!
                         
          This echoes throughout the clock.
           103.
                         
                         
                          MATER
           I've been trying to tell you that
           the whole time. I really am just a
           tow truck.
                         
          Finn and Holley take this in.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Finn, he's not joking.
                         
                          FINN
           I know.
                         
                          MATER
           You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
           And what's happened to McQueen is
           `cause I'm such a big one. This is
           all my fault.
                         
          GREM and ACER arrive on a lift, roll into view on a catwalk.

           Professor Z wanted you to have a
           front row seat for the death of
           Lightning McQueen.

           He's still alive?
                         
          Acer whips a sheet away, revealing the WGP CAMERA, turns it
          toward the clock face.
                         
                          ACER
           Not for much longer.
                         
          He pushes the camera through an open small window, turns it
          toward the course. Mater DROPS down again ---

           I called to talk to Mater. It never
           occurred to me that he wouldn't be
           there.
                         
                          RAMONE
           Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard

                          FLO

                          SALLY
           You just need to focus on the race.

          A HORN O.S. Someone's entering the pit. Everyone parts,

           No, no, it's all right.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           I just wanted to come down here and
           personally thank you. Because after
           Italy, I was finished. And then you
           gave me one last shot.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Listen, I ---
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           And I probably shouldn't be saying
           this at all but... I hope you win
           today. Show the world that they've
           been wrong about Allinol.
                         
          McQueen takes this in. He looks at Sally.

          They're all talking at once and for a moment we cannot

                          MCQUEEN
           Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
           That's what I'm trying to say here.
           You've always been the bomb! And
           you'll always be the bomb.
                         
                          MATER
           Stay away!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           No! Never!

          He's going to catch him now.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           ...get away again!
                         
          McQueen JUMPS FORWARD, in an attempt to grab Mater's HOOK ---

                          (TO HIMSELF)
           Gotta keep away from McQueen.
                         
          McQueen hooks Mater with his bumper JUST AS ---

           Oh my gosh!
                         
          BAWHOOOOOOM!!!!! Mater JOLTS forward with a rocket blast and
          disappears, taking McQueen with him.
                         
          ON ZUNDAPP. He now freely PUSHES the detonator, but it says
          "OUT OF RANGE."
                         
          Zundapp can't believe it. He FLIPS OUT.
                         
          FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Francesco speeds along. ZHWAAAAAP!!!
          Mater and McQueen ZING PAST HIM with a RED BLUR.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           What is happening? It's a bad
           dream.
                         
          NOW EVEN FARTHER UP THE TRACK - Mater takes a turn, SMASHES
          THROUGH A FENCE and skids around a corner out of sight. A
          white, smoky JET TRAIL is all that remains.
                         
          IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - All of Radiator Springs watches the

          Freaked, Zundapp does a 180 and SMASHES out a plate glass

          where a COMBAT SHIP waits.

           Hurry, Professor!
                         
          ON ZUNDAPP - With Finn gaining fast, he accelerates. Suddenly
          --- WHAP!
                         
          He's been TETHERED by Finn with tensile cables now attached
          to his rear end. Zundapp SCREAMS like a little girl.
                         
                          FINN
           Do you really think I'm going to
           let you float away, Professor?
                         
          Finn reels him in. Zundapp spins his wheels, caught.
                         
          Suddenly Zundapp miraculously, inconceivably, GAINS TRACTION!
          Now it's FINN'S WHEELS that are spinning.
                         
          ON THE COMBAT SHIP - the ELECTROMAGNET has been turned
          outward and switched on. He's PULLING ZUNDAPP AND FINN IN
          with the magnetic force. He pulls out a laser, TARGETS it at
          Finn's windshield.

          FINN, tires squealing, loses more and more ground to the

          bullets. They're BOMBS, GRENADES, ROCKETS and one little
          detonator with a flashing, beeping light.

          Mater and McQueen, speeding up the street.

          bearing down on them from a side street. They're going to

          Holley DROPS FROM THE SKY, hits the pavement, SKIDS into the

          McQueen turns to Mater - he wasn't expecting that.
                         
          The Lemons all eye each other, considering Mater's words.

           Yeah, but it's worth a shot.
                         
          WHOOM!!! He's BROADSIDED by a blast of water from O.S.
                         
          It's Red! He's sitting outside an underground entrance,

          ALL OUT WAR ensues between the LEMONS, RADIATOR SPRINGS along
          with FINN and HOLLEY.
                         
          FINN attaches his four-way cable hooks to the thugs and
          springs high in the air, crushing the four of them together.

          This is a light bulb moment for Mater. He eyes the bolts.

           people aren't taking you seriously,
           then they need to change. Not you.

           It's him.

                          MATER
           I figured it out when I realized
           you all attached this ticking time
           bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same
           bolts that hold together that old
           British engine from the photograph.
           Holley! Show that picture.

           O-kay...
                         
          Holley projects the much discussed PHOTO OF THE ENGINE.
                         
                          MATER
           And then I remembered what they say
           about old British engines - "If
           there ain't no oil under `em, there
           ain't no oil in `em."
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           What is he talking about?
                         
                          MATER
           It was you leaking oil at the party
           in Japan. You just blamed it on me.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Electric cars don't use oil, you
           twit.
                         
                          MATER
           Then you're faking it. You didn't
           convert to no electric. We pop that
           hood we gonna see that engine from
           that picture right there.
                         
          Mater moves toward Miles Axlerod to pop his hood.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           This lorry's crazy. He's going to
           kill us all!
                         
          Miles Axlerod BACKS UP to the edge of the stage.
           125.
                         
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           Stay away!
                         
                          HOLLEY
           But Sir Axlerod created the race,
           Mater. Why would he want to hurt
           anyone?
                         
                          MATER
           To make Allinol look bad so
           everybody'd go back to using oil. I
           mean, he said it himself with that
           disguised voice.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           "Dee-sguised voice?" What are you
           talking about? You're nuts, you
           are!
                         
          The QUEEN'S GUARDS have had ENOUGH. As has the PRINCE.
                         
                          PRINCE WHEELIAM
           This is going nowhere fast. We
           really should go, Grandmother.
                         
                          QUEEN
           One moment. I'd like to see where
           this is going.
                         
                          FINN
           Mater, he created Allinol.
                         
                          MATER
           Yeah, but what if he found that
           huge oil field just as the world
           was trying to find something else?
                         
          Mater sticks his ticking bomb-nose into Miles Axlerod's
          grill.
                         
                          MATER
           What if he came up with Allinol
           just to make alternative fuel look
           bad?
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD
           "What if?" You're basing this on a

           crazy!
                         
          Now it's just Miles Axlerod, Mater, McQueen, Finn and Holley.
          Miles Axlerod's back tires slip on the edge of the podium as
          he is cornered by Mater.
                         
                          MILES AXLEROD

           THE BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE
           Bomb deactivated. Have a nice day,
           Sir Axlerod.
                         
          General shock all around. Miles Axlerod realizes what he's
          done, looks terrified. Police surround him.
                         
          Mater FLINGS Miles Axlerod's hood open with his hook,
          revealing AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, oil dripping from
          all sides. It MATCHES the photo.

          EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          A massive crowd packs the adjacent streets and parks.
                         
          INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          Mater does the requisite "silly faces" in an attempt to break
          the composure of a Buckingham Palace Guard. It isn't working.
          McQueen approaches.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater, let's go. You're on.
                         
          INT. QUEEN'S CHAMBER - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
                         
          The Queen sits in attention at the front of the Main
          Ballroom. As Mater and McQueen approach:
                         
                          LORD STEWARD
           Your Majesty. May I present for the
           investiture of honorary Knighthood
           of the British Realm. Tow Mater of
           Radiator Springs.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Go get `em, buddy.
                         
          McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls
          forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day.
                         
                          QUEEN
           I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater."
                         
          Applause from all around.
                         
                          MATER
                          (LOOKS UP)
           "Sir?" Shoot, you can just call me
           Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna
           hear none of this "Sir" business.
           By the way, have y'all met each
           other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen,
           Queen. McQueen? McMissile.

          The town sign now reads "WELCOME TO RADIATOR SPRINGS - HOME
          OF LIGHTNING MCQUEEN AND SIR TOW MATER."
                         
          EXT. FLO'S - DAY
                         
          Cars surround Mater and McQueen. The rest of the Radiator
          Springs gang is here too, watches. VAN and MINNY are front
          and center.
                         
                          MATER
           So there I was: rocket jets going
           full blast, McQueen hanging on for
           dear life when suddenly them two
           nasty lemons come out of nowhere,
           guns drawed. We was goners. But
           then out of nowhere, this beautiful
           spy car swoops in from the sky to
           save us!
                         
                          MINNY
           That's a very entertaining story,
           young man.
                         
                          VAN
           Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of
           this happened. Rocket jets? Flying
           spy cars?
                         
                          HOLLEY
           No, you're quite right. It does
           sound a bit far-fetched.
                         
          The crowd turns, sees HOLLEY, wings out, swooping in. FINN is
          right below her, driving up the street.
                         
                          MATER
           Holley! Finn!
                         
                          HOLLEY

           nice to meet you all.

          Indeed, Holley still wears the dent from when she saved Mater
          from Grem and Acer.

           It's way too valuable.

           You know, there's one thing I still
           don't get. The bad guys hit me with
           the beam from the camera, right? So

           Our investigation proved that
           Allinol was actually gasoline. And
           Miles Axlerod engineered it so that
           when it got hit by the beam it
           would explode.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Wait a second. Fillmore, you said

                          FRANCESCO
           What is that?
                         
          McQueen has a new bumper sticker: "Ka-ciao, Francesco."
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           It's just something I had made up
           for the occasion.
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Is good, McQueen. Very funny. It
           was funnier when I did it, but
           it's very funny. What are you going
           to do next? Are you going to take
           off your fenders? Try it. You'll
           like it.
                         
          Francesco leaves. We stay with McQueen and Sally.
                         
                          SALLY
           So he's not so good-looking.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Yeah. Nice try.
                         
                          SALLY
           I'm serious.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           That's why I love you, Sally.
           (as he leaves)
           Wish me luck.
                         
                          SALLY
           You don't need it!
                         
          He drives off. Flo approaches Sally.
                         
                          FLO
           Mmm-mmm. That Francesco is fine-
           looking.
                         
                          SALLY
           And those open wheels.
                         
                          FLO
           I'm gonna have to go get myself
           some coolant.
           133.
                         
                         
          EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER
                         
          The racers at the starting grid. ON THE TRAFFIC LIGHT in the
          center of town. It goes from RED to GREEN!
                         
          The RACERS SPEED OFF, tearing up main street and out of town,
          blazing past tourists ---
                         
          EXT. WILLY'S BUTTE - DAY
                         
          As the racers, led by McQueen and Francesco, take the wide,
          sweeping turn around Willy's Butte we CRANE UP to see MATER,
          FINN, HOLLEY, and the Radiator Springs gang watching.
          Everyone CHEERS.
                         
                          MATER
           Go McQueen!! Whoo-hoo!!!
                         
          Holley gets an alert.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Finn, time to go. Siddeley's
           gassed, geared and ready to fly.
                         
          Finn starts to back up.
                         
                          MATER
           You're leaving already?
                         
                          FINN
           We've got another mission, Mater.
           Just stopped by here to "pick
           something up."
                         
          They both eye Mater, expectantly.
                         
                          MATER
           Something tells me you're not
           talking about souvenir bumper
           stickers.
                         
                          FINN
           Her Majesty asked for you
           personally, Mater.
                         
                          MATER
           But I told you all before. I'm not
           a spy.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           We know.
           134.
                         
                         
                          FINN
           Spy or not, you're still the
           smartest, most honest chap we've
           ever met.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           Don't forget massively charming.
                         
          Mater looks over at Holley. He looks touched.
                         
                          MATER
           Well, thanks. But as much fun as it
           was hanging with y'all, this...
                         
          He looks over to his friends who watch the race, CHEER
          MCQUEEN ON.
                         
                          MATER
           This is home.
                         
                          HOLLEY
           That's alright, we understand. But
           I'll be back. You still owe me that
           first date.
                         
                          FINN
           If there's ever anything I can do
           for you, just let me know.
                         
                          MATER
           Well, I sure appreciate that, thank
           you.
                          (THINKS)
           Actually... there is one thing.
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          MATER, blazing forward fast.
                         
                          MATER
           Whoo-hoo!!!
                         
          He ROCKETS FORWARD, through the whole town. In doing so he
          GRABS A BROKEN DOWN OTIS, hooking him ---
                         
                          OTIS
           Whoa!!!
                         
          --- and TOSSING him right into Ramone's.
                         
           OTIS (O.S.)
           Thanks, Mater!
           135.
                         
                         
          ON THE "RACE TRACK" - Mater flies past ALL the racers,
          including Francesco ---
                         
                          FRANCESCO
           Impossible!
                         
          --- until he approaches MCQUEEN.
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           Mater!?
                         
                          MATER
                          (KEEPING PACE)
           Check it out. They let me keep the
           rockets!
                         
                          MCQUEEN
           I'll see you at the finish line,
           buddy!
                         
                          MATER
           Not if I see you first!
                         
          McQueen and Mater peel away from the rest of the racers, lead
          them off the road and into the dirt for another lap. The two
          friends are side by side when we FADE OUT.
                         
                         
                          THE END





The year was 1891.

Storm clouds were brewing over Europe.

France and Germany were at each other's throats... the result of a series of b*mb.

Some said it was Nationalists... others, the anarchists.

But as usual... my friend Sherlock Holmes had a different theory entirely.

b*mb in Strasbourg! Read all about it!

Thank you. Anarchists suspected... in Strasbourg b*mb!

b*mb in Strasbourg!

When did you start working for the postal service?

That was you back there.

Shame your activities have landed you in the gutter.

A curious parcel. Who's the intended recipient?

Why don't we discuss that over dinner tonight?

I'm free for lunch. Hmm. I'm not.

How about the Savoy, 8:00?

Splendid. Hmm.

And will you be coming as yourself?

Most likely.

Three men have been following you for the last half mile... their motives highly unsavory.

No.

Oh, and, by the way, they're not pursuing me, they're escorting me.

And instead of three, there seems to be, uh, four.

Steady hands with that, Irene.

Oh, I don't think it's my hands you have to worry about.

Be careful with the face, boys. We do have a dinner date tonight.

Don't fill up on bread.

I forgot the rest.

Oh, it's coming back now.

Peelers!

We now come to Lot 34...

Egyptian sarcophagus of outstanding provenance... retrieved from the Valley of the Kings.

Your payment, doctor. He sends his thanks.

Who will bid...

100 pounds?

One hundred. Thank you, sir.

Please, give this to him. He's expecting it.

Tell him our friend thinks I delivered it to his sister.

Uh-- Stay... while I check the contents.

I was assured full payment would be there.

Yes, but assured by whom?

Have you ever met him in person?

Or like me, have you been--?

Hold it, hold it. Please, don't move it.

Judging from size and weight, it's not the payment you were expecting.

I'd wager the contents are rather more incendiary.

Who is this? It's--

Hello, darling.

Oh, dear. I told you not to move it. It seems a secondary charge has been activated.

Sweet thing, I might need your help in the disposal of this parcel.

One thousand six hundred, 1700, 1800.

Well, good luck. One million pounds.

Oh, and by the way, f*re.

f*re!

Leave my side, you'll be d*ad in an hour.

And don't be late for dinner.

My schedule will be quite tight because of these activities here.

I've never been late in my life, only early. Fashionably.

Very witty. So confident, even in retreat.

I'll hold onto that. We'll read it together over an aperitif.

Fine. Dinner and a show.


Stay. Trust me. This is what I do for a living.

Herr Hoffmanstahl, you should count yourself lucky.

This faceless man with whom you find yourself in business is no ordinary criminal.


He's the Napoleon of crime. Fortunately, you now have me as an ally.

I'm a consulting detective of some repute.

Perhaps you've heard of me? My name is Sherlock--

Holmes.

A fresh pot of tea. Thank you, George.

Yes, Miss Adler.

Fine choice, this place.

Do you have the letter?

It was taken.

Taken? Now, that is unfortunate.

During the chaos created by your package.

Thank you.

Perhaps if you had shared your plans.

You wish to know my plans now, do you?

Did you imagine, Miss Adler, that something would happen to you?

Is that why you chose to meet here in a public place?

Your favorite restaurant?

I don't blame you.

I blame myself.

It's been apparent to me for some time that you had succumbed to your feelings for him.

And this isn't the first occasion Mr. Holmes has inconvenienced me in recent months.

The question is... what to do about it.

But that's my problem to solve now.

I no longer require your services.

Mrs. Hudson?

Oh, Mrs. Hudson?

Holmes, you in there?

Your hedge needs trimming.

Where am I?

I don't care where you are as long as you're ready.

I'm waiting.

I'm not gonna play this game.

Remember, I have to catch the last--

train.

That's you d*ad, I'm afraid. You win.

I lose. Game over.

Still don't see me?

I'm not going out with you dressed like that.

Would you prefer I joined you in the fashion faux pas... of wearing fine m*llitary dress with that heinous handmade scarf... clearly one of your fianc�e's early efforts?

Oh, how I've missed you, Holmes.

Have you? Why?

I've barely noticed your absence. Then again, I'm knee-deep in research.

Extracting fluids from the adrenal glands of sheep... and designing my own urban camouflage... all the while verging on a decisive breakthrough... in the single most important case of my career, perhaps of all time.

Mrs. Hudson, how are you?

Oh. I'm so pleased to see you, doctor. Thank you for inviting me tomorrow.

And thank you for looking after Gladstone.

Dear, dear sickly-sweet Nanny, might I have a word?

Yummy. Feed the snake, woman.

You feed it.

Touchy, touchy.

Doctor, you must get him to a sanatorium.

He's been on a diet of coffee, tobacco, and coca leaves.

He never sleeps. I hear multiple voices as if he's rehearsing a play.



Leave him to me. Don't you have a goat that needs worming?

Oh, how kind of you to remind me.

So much to look forward to. What would I do without you?

Good luck with your patient, doctor.

Why are you here?

I'm getting married tomorrow.

Oh! Embrace me.

Watson's getting married.

You've lost a few pounds, Holmes. Yes, and you've picked them up.

Noshing on Mary's muffins, no doubt.

Pour us a brandy. The stag party has g*n.

It is our last adventure, Watson.

I intend to make the most of it.

I see you've made good use of my old office.

Do you like my spider's web? Is that what you call it?

Follow that strand.

Question: What do a scandal involving an Indian cotton tycoon... the overdose of a Chinese opium trader... b*mb in Strasbourg and Vienna... and the death of a steel magnate in America all have in common?

Well, according to your diorama, Professor James Moriarty.

Indeed.

Mathematical genius. Celebrated author and lecturer.

Boxing champion at Cambridge... where he made friends with our current prime minister.


Do you have any evidence to substantiate your claim?

This. Now do you see?

Dr. Hoffmanstahl's death? Yes.

I've heard you speak of him, extolling his virtues.

Hoffmanstahl was at the forefront of medical innovations, a true pioneer.

Just the other day, I averted an expl*si*n that was intended for him.

Says here he d*ed of a heart att*ck.

Has all my instruction been for naught? You still read the official statement and believe it.

It's a game, dear man, a shadowy game.

We're playing oat and mouse, the professor and I. Cloak and dagger.

I thought it was spider and fly?

I'm not a fly, I'm a cat.

Not a mouse, but a dagger.

You're drinking embalming fluid.

Oh. Yes. Care for a drop?

You do seem--

Excited? Manic.

I am. Verging on--

Ecstatic? Psychotic.

Should've brought a sedative. I'll give my life to see his demise.

He must be stopped before his evil machinations come to a crescendo.

And how will he do all this?

Don't be a dingy bird. Bad people do bad things because they can.

No one, not the victims, the police, the governments, not anyone--

Except the great Sherlock Holmes... Correct. on this diet, will work it all out. Right.

Or thereabouts. Thereabouts, not quite there.

Here's to your good health.

Dingy bird.

What have you done to Gladstone now?

Ricinus communis. The fruit is highly toxic.

He's barely breathing.

What an excellent opportunity.

This may be just the thing.

Sorry, do you mind terribly if I try my adrenal extract?

How many times are you going to k*ll my dog, Holmes?

Took off like a monkey from a box.

Hmm. I may need one of those in a few hours.

Consider it a wedding gift.

Watson, might we use an alternative exit?

Is there something different about you?

I'm under observation.

As you should be.

You drive.

Will your beard be with us all night?

I'll remove it once we're south of Trafalgar Square.

If you believe Moriarty has you under observation... isn't this a bit conspicuous?

It's so overt, it's covert.

Trafalgar Square. You must be safe by now.

Why are you looking at me with such concern?

I'm so very worried. Your vitality's been drained from you.

Marriage is the end, I tell you. I think of it as the beginning.

Armageddon. Rebirth.

Restriction. Structure.

Answering to a woman. Being in a relationship.

A life in matrimony, the possibility of a family.

Who wants to die alone?

We'll have a good old-fashioned romp tonight... you'll settle down, have a family, and I'll die alone.

Yes, that's about it.

Perhaps it's better for one to die alone than to live life in eternal purgatory.

Anyway...

Not bad, that.

So where are we going?

In the future, there'll be one of those machines in every town in Europe.

Loitering in the woodshed again, are we, Myccie?

Good evening, Sherly. Well.

I see your bootmaker is ill, dear brother.

As I detect that you've recently changed the brand of soap with which you shave.

The chimney in the front room at Baker Street... still needs a damn good sweeping up.


Were you aware that the hackney carriage by which you arrived had a damaged wheel?

Yes, the left. And it's plain to the meanest intelligence... that you have recently acquired a new bow for your violin.

Same bow, new strings.

And may I deduce, Mycroft--? Good evening, by the way.

No.

He doesn't. May I deduce that you... who rarely strays from the path that runs from your home to the Diogenes Club... and never on a Monday when they serve your favorite potted shrimps... must be here for some far more important reason than my stag party?

You know, he's nothing like as slow-witted as you'd been leading me to believe, Sherly.
No, you're quite right, Dr. Watson... but with all the conflict in Europe at the moment, the whole situation could--

Excuse me... suddenly erupt.

I am here to avoid a dire catastrophe.

If the concerns of two nations... which shall remain nameless... but I can tell you they speak French and German... are not dealt with tonight, I shall be forced to go to Switzerland... to attend the ghastly peace summit in Reichenbach.

The worst thing about Switzerland is the altitude.

It gives me nosebleeds, exacerbates my asthma--

I'm so glad you invited your brother.

This looks promising.

And your poison of choice, gentlemen?

We'll start with the champagne. We may need several more chairs.

Perhaps a good cigar.

And don't bother with the chairs.

What is it your brother does exactly?

He's the keeper of the broom cupboard of state.

No ambition, no energy... yet I'm repeatedly told that he's indispensable to the British government... particularly the Foreign Office.

I would like to propose a toast. Really?

To my dear friend, Dr. John-- um, Hamish Watson...

I'm right here. on the eve of his wedding. He--

has been the best companion.

Shouldn't we be waiting for the boys from my rugby club?

He has always kept us-- They couldn't attend. flat-footed on the ground.

All of them? Hmm. The chaps from my medical school?

They declined. The lads from the regiment?

No man's better worth having at your side-- Who is it you're looking for?

Because I don't know a single damn person here, do I?

There's no need for hysterics. You know me and Mycroft.

Don't be a ponce, Watson. Ponce?

You completely forgot about my stag party, didn't you?

Why are we here? Your very good health, doctor.

Shame none of your friends could make it.

I'm going to the gaming tables. I refuse for this night to be a total loss.

Give me my money. Happily. Give me the wedding ring.

So now you're interested in being the best man.

You're supposed to keep the ring anyway.

Just as you're supposed to organize my stag party.

Don't want to lose it on a bet. And invite my friends... of which, by the way, there are many. You're the one with no friends...

Sherly No Mates.

He's all "me, me, me," isn't he?

I win!

Please, sit.

Put your money on the table and we will begin.

Welcome. I am Madam Simza.

Cards can illuminate your past... clarify your present, and show you the future.

If you have a specific question, hold it in your mind.

I'm holding.

Let me know when you're ready.

Actually, I'd prefer to read... your fortune.

Temperance inverted.

Indicative of volatility.

A woman who has recently taken her comfort in drink.

From what does she seek solace? What does she not wish to see?

A fool embarrassing himself? Hmm.

Hmm. Oh, yes. The Fool.

Someone has been led astray, involved in something without their knowledge.

Not bad, but you have to make me believe you.

I have to see it in your eyes.

Right. I can do better. Uh-huh.

The Two of Cups, a powerful bond.

But between whom? A brother and sister perhaps?

And I see a name. Yes, it's...

Rene.

What do you want?

The Devil.

Why are we playing this game?

Where did you get this?

I stole it from a woman in an auction room, but I believe it was intended for you.

"Found my purpose in life."

So the question I've been holding is, what purpose is Rene fulfilling?

Time is up.

I have other clients.

Though you may not have detected the wisp of astrakhan fur... snagged on a nail over my left shoulder... you couldn't have failed to notice the overpowering aroma... of herring pickled in vodka... in tandem with a truly unfortunate body odor.

There's a man concealed in the rafters above us.

A Cossack, renowned for their infeasible acrobatic abilities... and are notorious for moonlighting as assassins.

So it's safe to presume that your next client is here to k*ll you.

Anything else? No?

First, pillage the nest.

Clip wings.

Now blunt his beak.

cr*ck eggs.

Scramble. Pinch of salt.

Touch of pepper.

Flip the omelet.

Additional seasoning required.

Breakfast is served.

Come with me. I need you alive. Now.

Oh!

Didn't see that in the cards, did you?

Oh...

Coming down, folks, coming down.

Looks like we've got ourselves our next cockfight.

Five, four, three, two, one... let him go!

Get up there!

All mine?

Now, wait a minute.

You're right. He did stink.

Hey, you can run--

Where's you?

Just had a fight.

Just had a fight. Yes.

Where were you? I'm glad to see... you're taking your best-man duties so seriously.

I was on my own! Not gonna get my monies!

She was biting my leg.

I'll have Carruthers put some fuel into that motor carriage of yours.

You do have a wedding to attend.

Oh, I'll drive.

Hmm.

Ho-honk.

Let's have another drink. No, no, I think you've had quite enough.

Present arms!

I've been to a wedding here before.

Funeral too.

The professor wants to meet.

I'd expected to hear from him sooner, in light of recent events.

He was wondering if it'd be convenient for you to come by the college this afternoon.

His lecture concludes at 4.

Looking forward.

One side, chummy.

"Fischerweise," Schubert, 1826.

"Give up your foolish trickery." "This fish you cannot cheat."

I hope I'm not intruding.

Excuse me. Matthew, take these up to Mr. Williams.

And make sure he packs my white tie and tails.

I'll take care of it, professor. Thank you. I do apologize.

I'm off on a blasted lecture tour. Would you care for some tea or coffee?

Neither. Something stronger, perhaps?

No, but might I trouble you for an inscription?

I read that the good doctor was to be married today.

How was the service?

Definitive.

He'll no longer be party to my investigations. He's out of the equation.

I trust you'll take this into consideration.

And what considerations will you grant me?

Have you actually read the book?

I found it compelling... though I'm primarily interested in your more recent endeavors.

I take that as a compliment.

I have the utmost regard for your talents.

It's a pleasure to finally meet you... officially.

Are you familiar with the study of graphology?

I've never given it any serious thought, no.

The psychological analysis of handwriting.

The upward strokes on the P, the J, and the M indicate a genius-level intellect.

While the flourishes on the lower zone... denote a highly creative yet meticulous nature.

But if one observes the overall slant and the pressure of the writing... there's a suggestion of acute narcissism, a complete lack of empathy... and a pronounced inclination toward-- No. moral insanity.

In answer to your previous request regarding Dr. Watson not being involved... the answer is no.

The laws of celestial mechanics dictate that when two objects collide... there is always damage of a collateral nature.

Exempli gratia.

Two gentlemen find themselves at cross-purposes.

A young woman torn between them.

The strain proves too much for her, and she suddenly falls ill... with tragic consequences.

A rare form of tuberculosis.

She succumbed in a matter of seconds.

Now... are you sure you want to play this game?

I'm afraid you'd lose.

Rest assured, if you attempt to bring destruction down upon me...

I shall do the same to you.

My respect for you, Mr. Holmes, is the only reason you're still alive.

You've paid me several compliments.

Let me pay you one in return when I say that if I were assured of the former eventuality...

I would cheerfully accept the latter.

I'll be sure to send my regards to the happy couple.

Another time, then.

All aboard for Brighton! All aboard!

Which coach are we?

We should be just here.

First class.

All aboard for Brighton! All aboard!

Hurry up, Dr. Watson, your wife needs you.

Coming, Mrs. Watson.

Oh. First class, champagne.

You do know how to spoil a girl, Mr. Watson.

You're not just any girl.

I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the lavatory while the train's in the station.

You're Mrs. Watson.

Give me that bottle.

John, there is nowhere else in the world I would rather be.

There's no one I'd rather be with.

Why do you have a g*n stuffed down the back of your trousers?

Old habits.

Come in.

Oh, yes, please. We didn't order that.

With our compliments, sir.

Thank you. Put it there.

Open the door, John.

I think it's time for you to leave.

Sit down.

Shh.

I agree it's not my best disguise, but I had to make do.

My God. They'll be back.

John, shut the door. They'll only sh**t through it.

He's right, you know. Oh, my God.

I understand. Do you?

Terribly inconvenient.

We don't have much time.

How many are we expecting? Half a dozen.

Who are they? A wedding present from Moriarty.

Lovely ceremony, by the way. Many a tear shed in joy.

Oh, John?

Yeah, just a minute, darling.

Do you trust me? No.

Well, then I shall have to do something about that.

Who's up to bat next, you bastards?

Send out the fast bowler!

John, do shut the door.

It had to be done.

She's safe now.

In my own defense, I timed it perfectly.

Did you k*ll my wife?!

Did you just k*ll my new wife?!

Of course not!

What do you mean? How do you know that when you just threw her off a train?

I told you, I timed it perfectly.

What does that mean?!

Calm down. Explain!

By the time I've explained, we'd both be d*ad!

I'm sorry, madam. You can't use the lavatory while the train's in the station.

That was no accident.

It was by design.

Now, do you need me to elaborate... or can we just cr*ck on?

Come on!

Don't worry, old boy, she's as safe as houses.

She's with my brother.

I'm on my honeymoon!

Why did you lead them here?! Why did you involve us?!

They aren't here for me! They're here for you!

Fortunately...

so am I.

Now mind the door.

Good evening.

I think you'll find that second class is more comfortable.

The coast is clear.

To the south, quick march.

Lie down with me, Watson.

Why? I insist.

What are we doing down here?

We are waiting. I am smoking.

Patiently waiting. For what?

Your window of opportunity.

Make it count.

I said make it count. How many windows must I provide?

Who'd have known that honeymooning in Brighton was such a dangerous notion?

Is that what this is about?

By your own admission, you've never enjoyed it there.

I've never been to Brighton.

Or you're just too fragile to remember at present.

Oh, shut up.

Tell me my wife's safe.

I can't do both.

I promise. As I said, I timed it perfectly.

Over here, madam!

I believe congratulations are in order, Mrs. Watson.

I'm the other Holmes.

You mean there's two of you?

How marvelous. Could this evening get any better?

Why were Mary and I targeted at all?

Excellent question. The answer is twofold.

He's after us because of you.

I'm afraid you must bear half the responsibility.

Here it comes. So predictable. Had you and Mary... not been hell-bent on wedding, we could've solved this case.

Oh, it's my fault now. The argument could be made...

No, it couldn't. that your nuptials were poorly timed.

Thus, our relationship--

Relationship?

Very well, partnership. has not yet run its course.

My dear fellow, if you could be bothered to see this through to the end...

I shall never again ask you to assist me.

Once more unto the breach.

That's the spirit. Now, to the question.

This is so deliciously complicated. You may be asking yourself... what does a criminal mastermind want with a simple gypsy fortune teller?

It's her brother, I tell you. When we find him, and we must--

After you find my luggage.

Go on.

Wait.

Where is it we're going?

Paris, the most sensible honeymoon destination of all.

So why Paris? Peaches.

Outside the city at Montreuil... there's a Gypsy camp famous for its dried fruit, especially peaches.

And there we shall find our fortune teller... and return her bag.

And my ticket?

Unfortunately, you won't be needing yours.

That's a shame, professor. I was looking forward to Don Giovanni.

Follow Meinhard.

Wake up, we're here.

Brace yourself. We're about to be violated.

Don't be so cynical.

They're taking my luggage. Laugh them away, Watson. I have her bag.

You had her bag.

Now they have my coat.

Where is Madam Simza?

This is Simza.

Sim is a goose.

I am Sim.

Nice scarf. I like.

You hungry? Famished.

Madam, this is a glorious hedgehog goulash.

I can't remember ever having had better.

Do tell me, when was the last time you had a hedgehog goulash?

I told you, Watson, I can't remember.

Perhaps you've repressed it.

That's where we differ. Unlike you, I repress nothing.

Perfectly normal.

How dare you be rude to this woman who has invited us into her tent... offered us her hedgehog?

Says the man who throws women from trains.

Who are you two?

Concerned citizens.

Why did someone try to k*ll me?

Your brother has become involved with a very dangerous man... who clearly believes that Rene has told you something you shouldn't know.

I don't know anything.

I've been looking for him for over a year.

That was why I was in London.

It's the last place anyone saw him. It's clear that your brother loves you.

He'd never send you a message that would put you in harm's way.

Any information, therefore, would be, by default, unintentional.

Has he sent you anything else?

Just a few drawings.

Let's just see what they have to tell us.

Unusual choice of paper. Thicker gauge, designed for a printing press.

And it's the same stock as the letter. Mm.

They smell musty.

Must have been stored somewhere cold and damp.

What's that? Blood?

Wine. So a wine cellar located near a printing press.

That should narrow it down.

There's a wine cellar used by the anarchist group Lapin Vert.

Rene was close to their leader.

Claude Ravache.

A b*mb maker. I sampled some of his work last week.

I was a part of the movement. So was Rene.

Until it became too extreme for us.

Ravache knows me.

If my brother's back there, he will see us.

We will send a message.

Whatever you do, don't let these gypsies make you drink.

Of course.

You dance?

For God's sake, don't dance. It'll be the death of you.

You know what happens when you dance.

Oh, good morning, Mrs. Watson.

Have you had breakfast? I--

Stanley here does a wonderful deviled kidney.

Carruthers? Morning, sir.

Telegram for Mrs. Watson.

Uh....

It just doesn't make any sense.

Allow me.

Oh, yes.

"My most loathed Mary, I do not love you. I never wish to see you again.

Every moment I count away from you is a blessing."

Fret not. It's a double encryption, my dear... that Sherly and I have used since we were boys.

If the first letter of the message is a consonant... then what follows is the mirrored truth.

I see. Hmm.

Stanley!

You know, although our time together has been but a brief interlude...

I'm beginning to understand how a man of particular disposition... under certain circumstances, extreme ones perhaps... might grow to enjoy the company of... a person of your gender. Hmm. Hmm.

Thank you so much.

Most charming.

May--? Terribly sorry. Thank you.

Where are you going, Stanley?

Whoa, whoa.

Still hiding in basements?

I'm not here to see you.

Yeah.

...with your English friends.

1789, a seminal vintage.

The year of our glorious revolution.

Is he here? When freedom triumphed over tyranny.

Is my brother here?

I haven't seen him for a long time.

You're lying.

Sit, please.

A letter was received from Rene using this same paper.

Of course. He took it with him wherever he went.

He's telling the truth. Rene isn't here.

He was given another assignment by an-- An anonymous benefactor.

Another Englishman... with money, power, who supported our cause.

And now... he dictates our every move...

demanding I take responsibility for his acts of terror.

I made a deal with the devil.

But after tonight... it will be over.

My job is almost done.

He's had you plant another b*mb, hasn't he?

Claude, please.

These men can help you.

I wish they could.

You see, gentlemen... he has my wife and children.

If you tell us where the b*mb is...

I'll find a way to help your family. That's already taken care of.

We have a deal.

He and I.

No loose ends.

There's only one thing I can do to keep my family safe.

You have less than 10 minutes. Don't!

He has no further need of that p*stol. Why don't you take it and cover the stairs?

There's only one way out of this place.

Right you are.

Ah. Ingenious.

That's the one. Quickly as we can.

You know what to do with that sandbag, Watson.

Quick now.

Doctor, could you secure that lever?

You could have told me.

Ravache was strong. He lived for liberty. He would never take his own life.

Calm yourself.

My brother, he's weak.

Sim, I need you to take a deep breath... and follow us.

To the opera.

I was mistaken.

What? I made a mistake.

He took the sh*t from here.

Using a tripod and a sh**ting stick.

And realized there was a better position.

There's a faint scrape where he dragged his tripod and set it up here.

Six hundred yards? Or 650?

Not to mention a seven- or eight-mile-an-hour wind.

He would've needed a wind gauge.

Which he placed here.

And put a cigarette down here.

Can anyone sh**t that far?

Not more than half a dozen men in all of Europe.

How many of those men served in Afghanistan?

Why? Hirschsprung with a touch of Tekel.

Must have fallen out when he was rolling up.

Wasn't that the blend you all smoked?

Didn't I read something about a colonel? Sebastian Moran.

Best marksman in the British army.

Dishonorable discharge.

He's likely now a g*n for hire. This is the second victim of his that I've encountered.

What better way to conceal a k*lling?

No one looks for a b*llet hole in a b*mb blast.

He's 20 minutes late. He must come soon.

I don't have any papers.

And I am a foreigner.

This climate is exactly what Moriarty wants.

The omelet fines herbes was divine... but they spared every expense on the tea.

Now shall we compare moods, or consider what we know?

Last night's b*mb was clearly meant... to look like Germany's retaliation for Strasbourg.

However, the b*mb was also meant to conceal the m*rder of just one man.



The man k*lled by the g*n was none other than Alfred Meinhard.

He makes g*n. Big g*n.

Only days ago, a large share of his company was bought by an unknown investor.

Moriarty.

The clues point in one direction, but to avoid repeating last night's debacle...

I was obliged to collect more sufficient data, hence my tardiness.

Train departs in 40 minutes, sir.

Whoa!

Just the bags. But....

We have enough time for me to indulge my little habit.

Yes.


His habit of feeding that urban species, the feral pigeon.

So there are seven mainline railway stations in Paris.

But taking 10 minutes to get to the Jardin des Tuileries... where the largest concentration of the winged vermin may be found... reduces there to one, the Gare du Nord... where he will be just in time to catch the 11:04 train to Berlin.

It makes several stops along the way, one of which is--

Heilbronn.

Exactly where we must go.

Where Meinhard's factory is.

It's Moriarty's factory now.

Unfortunately, due to the b*mb... the crossing between France and Germany is to be closed.

I'm afraid our pursuit is over unless we can happen upon a comrade... who knows their way around borders.

Too English.

However, you do make a fantastic gypsy.

Certainly smell like a fantastic gypsy.

Now, now, no need to be demeaning.

It is a nice scarf.

No, no, too English. It'll suit you more.

Black one is yours. Gray one is mine.

And this is for you. Um... Hmm.

Right.

Where are the wagons? The wagon is too slow.

Can't you ride?

It's not that he can't ride.

How is it you put it, Holmes?

They're dangerous at both ends and crafty in the middle.

Why would I want anything with a mind of its own bobbing about between my legs?

Then I shall require a bicycle, thank you very much.

It's 1891. Could've chartered a balloon.

How can we make this more manageable?

Where's the f*re?

It's not as if Germany is going somewhere.

We know another way.

Slow and steady wins the race.

Come on!

We slip in through the loading bay, find out what he's doing... and we get out.

Getting out might be tricky.

We will get you out.

If my brother's in there, get him out alive.

Are you happy?

What? At this moment... are you as happy as you would be on your honeymoon in Brighton?

I'm not going to grace that question with an answer.

Are you happy? I think we're here for another reason.

Okay. Shall we get on--?

Simple question. Will we do something?

Or wait for them to come back round? What time is it?

Three-fifteen. Over there... in the residential part of the complex should be a telegraph office.

Send this to Mycroft. Be back here on the hour.

That's what you get, Mr. Holmes, when industry marries arms.

Now put your g*n down.

It's a bit old-fashioned.

What you need is one of these.

Go on.

Pick one.

Machine p*stol, self-repeating.

Takes 7.63 caliber rounds... in one of these.

A 10-sh*t box magazine.

Easy enough to load. Hmm.

I'd imagine one would have to retract the bolt to engage the first round.

Easier done than said.

Take him to the surgery.

I'll find the doctor.

"Come at once if convenient.

If inconvenient, come all the same."

This is schnapps.

A telegram was sent from here.

This isn't schnapps, it's aquavit, distilled from potato mash.

A common misconception. Thank you, by the way.

Who was it sent to?

My horror at your crimes is matched only... by my admiration at the skill it took to achieve them.

Who was it sent to?

You used the anarchists and their b*mb to create a crisis in Europe... nation against nation.

Under various pseudonyms, you bought, schemed, or m*rder your way... into numerous industries, assuring that none of it could be traced to you.

Cotton, opium, steel, now arms and chemical w*apon.

All to be shipped across Europe in less than a week.

Everything from b*ll*ts to bandages.

Now that you own the supply, you intend to create the demand.

A world w*r.

You are familiar with Schubert's work.

The Trout is perhaps my favorite.

A fisherman grows weary of trying to catch an elusive fish.

Out the way, out the way.

So he muddies the water.

I'm warning you.

Confuses the fish.

You were warned.

It doesn't realize until too late that it has swum into a trap.

Let's try this again, shall we?

To whom did you send the telegram?

To my....

To my brother Mycroft.

What are you playing at?

That's not fair.

I've just got one more question for you.

Which one of us is the fisherman... and which the trout?

Holmes?

Holmes?

Take your time. Take your time.

Uh....

Always good to see you, Watson.

What were you thinking? Wait.

Wait?

Well, if you must know, I was thinking I had him right where I wanted him.

Right. cr*ck on, then.

Professor.

I'm all right, I'm all right.

Don't waste time attending to me.

I'll find them. I'll find them.

Turn in three, two, one.

Come on, hurry up!

Go!

Did you see my brother? No, but I'm certain he's been here.

Where are we going? Over that wall.

How did you know I'd find you? You didn't find me.

You collapsed a building on me.

Where are the horses? They're behind.

We need them. You wanna go back?

What's our way out?

That's our way out.

Go! Go!

Come on!

Marko! Marko!

He's not breathing.

Cradle his head.

Raise his legs.

Bloody well not gonna die on me.

I'm not gonna make this easy on you.

Come on. Come on.

Come on.

Come on.

I know you can hear me, you selfish bastard.

Come on!

I know you can hear me, you bastard.

His wedding gift.

Terrible dream.

You, Mary, Gladstone and I were in a restaurant.

That satanic pony was there as well, a massive fork in his hoof... and he turned on me!

What have you administered?

Your wedding present.

Who's been dancing on my chest?!

Me.

Why is my ankle so itchy?

You have a large piece of wood sticking out of it.

Good Lord. You, Tamas.

I have an important job to discuss with you. Remind me of it later.

Sit down. Drink this.

I need to get that out before it turns septic.

Did you call me "selfish bastard"? Probably.

Just leave it in. Leave it--!

You are a--

Oh, you are some sort of-- Be nice.

I'm sorry you didn't get to Brighton.

Me too.

I think we should go home. I concur.

We're going home.

Via Switzerland.

What better place to start a w*r than a peace summit?

We'll drop in and see my brother. I'm sure he's missed you. Hm?

I don't understand why you don't cancel the summit.

Fact is it's gonna happen whether we like it or not.

Everyone has already arrived.

Although these gentlemen may be talking peace... believe me, they're readying their armies at home.

To cancel the summit now would be tantamount to w*r.

The telegram, wasn't it clear? We have doubled the security, sir.

Oh, doubled security. That's comforting.

You don't understand the delicacy of the situation.

I passed the telegram on to my superiors.

But they brought Moriarty in to advise on the peace process in the first place.

He has positioned himself brilliantly.

He's one of our foremost intellectuals, he's a personal friend--

Of the prime minister. Yes, we all know that.

I believe you, but where's your evidence?

He's too good to leave evidence.

He doesn't leave loose ends.

Oh, he's alive.

Sherly, put that down.

What is this contraption? May I have it? The effect is most invigorating.

That's my private and personal supply of oxygen, and you're not to touch it.

This argument is getting us nowhere.

I've arranged for documents to be prepared which allow you into the ball. Carruthers.

Stanley, Stanley.

You haven't aged a day. Is that my favorite chutney?

Fact is, we don't really know what he's planning.

It won't be another b*mb. No, it wouldn't be.

It doesn't make sense.

Why would he att*ck all the nations only to unite them?

It'll be an assassination.

By a lone g*n at close range.

Rene.

Unfortunately, yes.

You knew. I had my suspicions.

But having seen who would be attending, I'm now certain.

Well, at least we know who to look out for.

Rene will be the evidence.

If we can find him and stop him, we will perhaps not only save his life... but prevent the collapse of Western civilization.

No pressure.

Welcome, ambassador.

Professor James Moriarty.

Now we're all present...

I can tell you that the targets are the German chancellor and his ambassador... the French prime minister and his man.

And the other nations are really working out which side to take should hostilities erupt.

Prince Michael, a cousin of the czar, and the Russian ambassador.

The Archduke Karl Ludwig and the Austro-Hungarian ambassador.

The Romanian Prime Minister and his ambassador.

And of course our prime minister and the British ambassador.

He'll choose a moment when the dignitaries are assembled, preferably standing still.

Is there to be an official photograph?

Indeed, yes. In 38 minutes.

In which case, we might as well dance.

I've never done this before.

Just follow my lead.

What do you see? Everything.

That is my curse.

But you don't see what you're looking for.

I thought you'd never ask.

Over my shoulder.

Young man, German uniform, ceremonial sword.

Got him.

Professional opinion?

Trauma.

Major injury.

But excellent repair work.

Dr. Hoffmanstahl.

You did say he was at the forefront of a medical innovation.

We've already seen an example of his skills.

Those twins weren't twins.

My suspicions were aroused in Heilbronn... when one failed to go to the aid of the other.

I also noticed the discreet but unmistakable puckering behind the ear... where his skin had been drawn back. I should've realized then... that they were a surgical experiment.

To see if it is possible to make one man look like another.

His face is no longer his own.

What better way to guarantee his world w*r than to make the assassin--

One of the ambassadors.

That narrows down the possibility to one of six.

You and Sim shall find her brother.

Of this I have no doubt. Holmes.

You know my methods.

And I know where you'll be.

No possible solution could be more congenial to me than this.

By the way, who taught you how to dance?

You did.

Well, I've done a fine job.

Be careful.

Shall we go to work?

Ladies and gentlemen, please, gather for the portrait.

I'm sorry.

Is this a bad time?

Never better.

Would you bring that clock?

We get to play that game after all.

Here we are.

Don't want you to catch a cold.

A five-minute game?

If you think you can manage it.

We both have two bishops.

I may be absent from the room, but my methods are not.

You can't mean Dr. Watson, surely.

That doesn't seem fair.

Right. The surgery will have left scars.

Only four of them have the hairline to hide them.

The ambassador that you replaced with Rene, is he still alive?

Would you like me to recommend your next move?

They're all my brother's height, right build... but their eyes.

Their eyes are wrong. Rene has blue eyes.

He could be wearing glass lenses to change the color.

In which case, his eyes will be hurting.

Rene is left-handed.

Perhaps the assassin will take measures... to ensure he doesn't give himself away.

Like a gambler concealing a tell.

I think it might be him.

You think?

Your clock is ticking.

You have to be sure.

May I remind you, this is blitz chess.

A single miscalculation will cost you the game.

If I tackle the wrong man to the ground, I could start a w*r.

Maybe it's less obvious.

A nervous tic. A flutter of anxiety.

I expect everyone has a reason to be nervous tonight.

I don't know.

So perhaps it's the opposite:

A failure to behave naturally.

An actor so consumed with his performance... that the one characteristic he cannot accommodate... is spontaneous reaction.

Carruthers, protect the prime minister.

Germany will pay! Mark my words!

That doesn't bode well, does it?

Seems your bishop was of some benefit after all.

The game is still young.

Actually, it's in its adolescence.

There are more of us!

Germany will pay!

No loose ends.

What happened to him? I'm a doctor. A doctor!

What happened?

Curare. What's wrong with him?

It's poison.

Do something!

Doctor, do something!

No.

I think you've just lost your most valuable piece.

But a winning strategy sometimes necessitates sacrifice.

A w*r has been averted.

Mm. Oh, I disagree.

How so?

Didn't you find it strange that the telegram you sent... didn't inspire any action to stop me?

You see, hidden within the unconscious... is an insatiable desire for conflict.

So you're not fighting me so much as you are the human condition.

All I want to do is own the b*ll*ts and the bandages.

w*r on an industrial scale is inevitable.

They'll do it themselves within a few years.

All I have to do is wait.

I like Switzerland.

They respect a man's privacy here.

Particularly if he has a fortune.

Bishop takes knight. Check.

The game is over.

You should get that shoulder looked at.

About that fortune of yours.

I believe it's just been substantially reduced.

King to rook two.

I attended several of your lectures.

The equations of motion, which you will find in my book.

The energy that is required to release these explosions is--

It was in Oslo when I first caught a glimpse of your little notebook... red leather-bound from Smythson of Bond Street.

Rook to king's rook three. Check.

Bishop to rook three.

Its importance was not fully apparent to me... until I observed your penchant for feeding pigeons.

Then it occurred that with an empire so enormous... even you must keep a record of it somewhere.

Bishop takes bishop.

Rook to bishop four.

I then only required the notebook itself.

You didn't make it easy.

Just the bags.

I would need to endure a considerable amount of pain.

Mycroft... care of Her Majesty's Secret Service.

But the notebook would undoubtedly be encoded, so how then to break the code?

Rook takes rook. Pawn takes rook.

Bishop to bishop seven.

Queen takes knight pawn.

Does The Art of Domestic Horticulture mean anything to you?

How could a man as meticulous as you own such a book... yet completely neglect the flowers in his own window box? Irony abounds.

Never mind, it's safe, in London... where my colleagues are making good use of it.

The most formidable criminal mind in Europe has just had all his money stolen... by perhaps the most inept inspector in the history of Scotland Yard.

Any chance of a cup of tea?

Box 0403.

Tick. Box 0801.

How much more is there?

That's the end of page two.

Page three.

He'll be making an anonymous donation to the Widows and Orphans of w*r Fund.

Bishop to bishop eight. Discover check.

And, incidentally, mate.

I seem to have injured my shoulder. Would you mind?

Be my pleasure.

Once we've concluded our business here... it's important you know...

I shall endeavor to find the most creative of endings for the doctor.

And his wife.

His advantage, my injury.

My advantage, his rage.

Incoming as*ault feral, but experienced.

Use his momentum to counter.

Come now.

You really think you're the only one who can play this game.

Trap arm. Target weakness.

Follow with haymaker.

Ah. There we find the boxing champion of Cambridge.

Competent, but predictable.

Now allow me to reply.

Arsenal running dry. Adjust strategy.

Wound taking its toll.

As I feared. Injury makes defense untenable.

Prognosis increasingly negative.

Let's not waste any more of one another's time.

We both know how this ends.

Conclusion, inevitable.

Unless...

A few words may suffice to tell the little that remains.

Any attempt at finding the bodies was absolutely hopeless.

And so there... deep down in that dreadful caldron of swirling water and seething foam...

will lie for all time...

the most dangerous criminal...

and the foremost champion of the law of their generation.

I shall ever regard him as the best...

and the wisest man whom I have ever known.

John?

John. Mm-hm.

You should probably pack.

It's half past 2... and the carriage is coming at 4. Mm.

It's gonna be a beautiful week in Brighton.

Yes, it'll be fun.

I'm looking forward to it.

You know I miss him too... in my own way.

He would have wanted us to go.

He would have wanted to come with us.

When's Mrs. Hudson coming for Gladstone?

Oh, soon.

Three o'clock.

Mary?

Who delivered this parcel?

The postman.

The usual chap or-- did he look peculiar?

                         Ashley Miller & Zack Stentz



 
          FADE IN:

          On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn
          with a billion stars.
          Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING
          BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling
          breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.

          1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1

          A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set
          amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves
          down the street and heads out of town.

          2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2

          The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels
          of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a
          variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point
          at the sky.
          JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She
          positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the
          constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from
          spare parts of other devices.

                         JANE
          Hurry!
          We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
          Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as
          well, rubbing his head.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Oh-- watch your head.

                         SELVIG
          Thanks. So what's this "anomaly"�
          of yours supposed to look like?

                         JANE
          It's a little different each time.
          Once it looked like, I don't know,
          melted stars, pooling in a corner
          of the sky. But last week it was a
          rolling rainbow ribbon--

                         SELVIG

                         (GENTLY TEASING)
          "Racing "�round Orion?"� I've always
          said you should have been a poet.
          Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 1A.

                         JANE
          Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and
          my gloves, will you?
          Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and
          a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to
          Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large
          and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the
          foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Not until you see it!

                         SELVIG
          (re: the gloves)
          I recognize those. Think how proud
          he'd be to see you now.
          Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.

                         JANE
          Thank you.

                         SELVIG
          For what?

                         JANE
          The benefit of the doubt.
          The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while
          they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          It's never taken this long before.
          Darcy calls up from the front seat.

          DARCY (O.S.)
          Can I turn on the radio?

                         JANE
          (an edge to her voice)
          Sure, if you like rocking out to
          KFRM, "All agriculture, all the
          time."�
          Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.

          3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3

          The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring
          equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held
          together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of
          handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the
          frustrated Jane with sympathy.

                         JANE
          The anomalies are always
          precipitated by geomagnetic storms.
          She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,
          tracking occurrences and patterns.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          The last seventeen occurrences have
          been predictable to the minute... I
          just don't understand.
          Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
          She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in
          the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.

                         DARCY
          Jane?
          Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of
          champagne begins to vibrate.

                         JANE
          There's got to be some new
          variable... Or an equipment
          malfunction...
          The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
          them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A.

                         DARCY
          I don't think there's anything
          wrong with your equipment...
          The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it
          shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3.
          They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when
          the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing
          everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.

          DARCY (CONT'D)
          Jane?

                         JANE
          What?!

                         DARCY
          I think you want to see this.
          Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over
          the desert --

          MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT
          Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.

                         JANE
          Holy. Shatner.

                         SELVIG
          That's your "subtle"� aurora?!

                         JANE
          No-- yes! Let's go!

          4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4

          The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange
          event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body
          out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.
          The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs
          her, yanks her back in.

          5 INT. SUV 5

          Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.

                         JANE
          Isn't this great?!
          A thought strikes her.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          You're seeing it too, right? I'm
          not crazy?

                         SELVIG
          That's debateable. Put your seat
          belt on!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A.
          The SUV lurches.

          6 EXT. DESERT 6

          Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from
          out of the clouds comes --

          AN ENORMOUS TORNADO
          Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a
          thousand freight trains as it touches down.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4.

          7 INT. SUV 7

          Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the
          enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers
          into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the
          window, TAPING the storm.

                         JANE
          You've gotta get us closer so I can
          take a magnetic reading.
          Darcy laughs.

                         DARCY
          Yeah, right! Good one!
          (then, realizing)
          Oh God, you're serious...

                         JANE
          You want those college credits or
          not?

          8 EXT. SUV 8

          The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane
          leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs
          two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds
          take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING
          strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before
          them with a terrifying intensity.

          9 INT. SUV 9

          The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns
          the wheel, starts to head away.

                         DARCY
          Keep the credits. I'll intern at
          Burger King.

                         JANE
          What are you doing?!

                         DARCY
          Saving our lives!
          Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They
          struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --

                         A MAN

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.
          Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy
          slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.
          The SUV swerves -- but too late.

          10 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10

          The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending
          him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.

          11 INT. SUV 11

          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.
          They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.
          A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.

          12 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12

          The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the
          man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,
          charred and blackened.

                         DARCY
          I think that was legally your
          fault.

                         JANE
          Get the first aid kit.
          Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels
          next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.
          She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him
          clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,
          long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted
          features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing
          the life back into him.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
          and don't be dead, okay? Open your
          eyes and look at me.
          Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as
          his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,
          azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto
          them.
          For a moment, they each forget to breathe.
          The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She
          freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A.

                         DARCY
          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
          know CPR.
          A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.
          She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.

                         JANE

                         HIS EYES--

                         DARCY

                         (DREAMILY)
          --are beautiful.

                         JANE
          --are dilating. That's a good
          sign.

                         SELVIG
          We still have to get him to a
          hospital.

                         JANE

                         (HOPEFULLY)
          After we get a reading on the
          storm?

                         SELVIG
          Immediately, Jane.
          Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE
          above their heads. A thought strikes her.

                         JANE
          Where did he come from?
          They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
          glowing remnants of the storm, and into:

          13 EXT. SPACE 13

          EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and
          resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.)
          Questions, they've always asked
          questions -- this race called man,
          on this planet they call earth.
          Passionately longing to know how
          they are connected to the heavens.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6.
          We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,
          cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our
          galaxy.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          In ages past, they looked to us as
          gods, for indeed so many times we
          saved them from calamity. We tried
          to show them how their world was
          but one of the Nine Realms of the
          Cosmos, linked to all others by the
          branches of Yggdrasil...
          We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,
          sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague
          shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching
          out into the black void of space.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in
          a universe of wonder, beauty, and
          terror that they barely
          comprehended.
          We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like
          a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But for all their thirst for
          knowledge, they let our lessons
          fall into myth and dreams.
          Where did he come from? He came
          from us, the proudest race of
          warriors the Worlds have ever seen.
          He came from this -- the greatest
          Realm the universe has ever known.
          We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then
          over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal
          what's on the other side:

          HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          He came... from Asgard!

          14 EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14

          Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent
          landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city,
          modern yet timeless.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A.

          15 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15

          The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an
          other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled
          out before it.
          We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE

                         STANDS --

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony,
          land at his side.

          16 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16

          Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a
          vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.

                         ODIN
          Do you think he's ready?

                         FRIGGA
          He thinks he is. He has his
          father's confidence.

                         ODIN
          He'll need his father's wisdom.

                         FRIGGA
          And his humility?
          Odin reacts.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Thor won't be alone. Loki will be
          at his side to give him counsel.
          Have faith in your sons.

                         ODIN
          Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He
          could be a great King...
          Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of
          synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail
          as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,
          trying to stop the strange event through the force of his
          sheer will.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8.
          Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.
          A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (QUIETLY)
          ...if we only had more time.

                         FRIGGA
          For once, our son needs something
          we cannot provide.

                         ODIN
          I can fight it a little longer...

                         FRIGGA
          No. You've put it off too long! I
          worry for you.
          He touches her cheek.

                         ODIN
          I've destroyed demons and monsters,
          devastated whole worlds, laid waste
          to mighty kingdoms, and still you
          worry for me?

                         FRIGGA
          Always.

                         ODIN
          Not today. Now come kiss your
          king... while I'm still king.
          He pulls her close, and they kiss.

          17 INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17

          Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners
          hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the
          fire lit room.
          Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted
          against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we
          recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.
          Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.
          An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.
          He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly
          below.

                         THOR
          Another!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A.
          The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow
          intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full
          length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.
          He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of
          the Hall.
          We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively
          shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great
          horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,
          from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his
          horned headpiece.
          Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by
          a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded
          throne room.

                         LOKI

                         (TO THOR)
          Nervous, brother?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9.

                         THOR
          Have you ever known me to be
          nervous?

                         LOKI
          There was the time in Nornheim...

                         THOR
          That wasn't nerves, brother. It
          was the rage of battle. How else
          could I have fought my way through
          a hundred warriors and pulled us
          out alive?
          The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
          Thor.

                         LOKI
          As I recall, I was the one who
          veiled us in smoke to ease our
          escape.

                         THOR
          Some do battle, others just do
          tricks.
          The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like
          it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.
          EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and
          across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the
          goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Loki...
          Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn
          back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Now that was just a waste of good
          wine.

                         LOKI
          Just a bit of fun.
          (to the Attendant)
          Right, my friend?
          The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED

          HELMET.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          (re: Thor's helmet)
          Nice feathers.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A.

                         THOR
          You don't really want to start this
          again, do you, Cow?

                         LOKI
          I was being sincere!

                         THOR
          You're incapable of sincerity.

                         LOKI
          Am I?
          He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          I've looked forward to this day as
          long as you have. You're my
          brother and my friend. Sometimes
          I'm envious, but never doubt that I
          love you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10.
          Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
          He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good
          liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his
          brother's shoulder.

                         THOR
          Thank you.
          The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:

                         LOKI
          Give us a kiss.

                         THOR
          Stop.
          Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          How do I look?

                         LOKI
          Like a king.
          They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          It's time.

                         THOR
          You go ahead.
          Loki casts him a wary look.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'll be along. Go on.
          Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.

          17A INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A

          VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big
          event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE
          stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then
          eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.
          FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his
          moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN
          holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on
          dreamily.

                         FANDRAL
          Thank you, love.
          (to the Maidens)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A.

                         FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Now who'd like to polish my sword
          for me?
          The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.
          HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front
          of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and
          the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL
          ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.
          Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the
          Attendant quickly backs away.
          From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her
          SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several
          HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We
          reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons
          on the table.

                         SIF
          (to the weapons)
          I'll miss you.

          18 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18

          Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the
          room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across
          Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement.
          Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at
          the front of the hall. They are:

          THE WARRIORS THREE
          VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with
          oversized passions to match. FANDRAL, the consummate
          swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed.
          HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his
          side.
          With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor,
          a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled
          with.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 11.

                         VOLSTAGG
          I hope this goes quickly. I'm
          famished.

                         FANDRAL

                         (FEIGNED DISBELIEF)
          Noooo!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Are you attached to that pretty
          face of yours? Because one more
          word, and you won't be.

                         FANDRAL
          (to the others)
          My, we are hungry, aren't we?
          The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do
          it. Even you, Hogun the Grim.
          Just one smile.
          Hogun stares at him grimly.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          All right, half a smile. Look,
          forget the smile, just show some
          teeth.

                         SIF
          Fandral, is it true the famous
          Warriors Three are ready to meet
          any challenge?

                         FANDRAL
          Name it, Lady Sif.

                         SIF
          Keep your mouth shut.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12.

          19 INT. VAULT - DAY 19

          Imposing EINHERJAR GUARDS clad in armor, swords at the ready,
          stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath
          the palace.
          A cold BREEZE blows past them.

          19A INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 19A

          Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his
          hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.

                         FRIGGA
          It's all right to be nervous.

                         THOR
          Why does everyone keep saying that?
          I'm not nervous!

                         FRIGGA
          You may be able to fool the rest of

                         ASGARD --

                         THOR
          ...but never you. I know.

                         FRIGGA
          Thor, just remember that you have
          something even the great Allfather
          never had.

                         THOR
          And what is that?

                         FRIGGA
          Me for a mother.
          She smiles.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Now don't keep your father waiting.
          Frigga leaves.

          20 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 20

          Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki
          and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the
          hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn,
          the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into
          formation. They part to reveal --

                         ODIN

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A.
          Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He
          holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in
          him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a
          Ruler of Asgard.
          Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,
          casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be
          seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.
          A murmur spreads through the crowd.

                         VOLSTAGG
          (sotto, to Loki)
          Where is he?

                         LOKI
          He said he'd be along.
          Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What?

                         SIF
          He wants to make an entrance.

                         FANDRAL
          Well, if he doesn't show up soon,
          he shouldn't bother. Odin looks
          like he's ready to feed him to his
          ravens.

                         LOKI
          I wouldn't worry. Father will
          forgive him. He always does.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13.
          Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the
          lower level --

                         MJOLNIR
          Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall
          behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in
          CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up
          before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the
          adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.

                         SIF
          Oh, please.
          Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.

          21 INT. VAULT - DAY 21

          As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold
          breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to
          warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing
          something's not right.
          They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's
          hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a
          pedestal.
          LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and
          SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.

          22 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22

          Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front
          of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.
          Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at
          her. She can't help but smile.
          Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.
          The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless
          authority.
          He raises Gungnir before him.

                         ODIN
          Gungnir. Its aim is true, its
          power strong. With it I have
          defended Asgard and the lives of
          the innocent across the Nine Realms
          since the time of the Great
          Beginning. And though the day has
          come for a new King to wield his
          own weapon -- that duty remains the
          same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my
          first-born.

          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13A.

                         ODIN (CONT'D)
          So long entrusted with this mighty
          hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the
          heart of a dying star, from the
          sacred metal of Uru. Only one may
          lift it. Only one is worthy. Who
          wields this hammer commands the
          lightning and the storm. Its power
          has no equal -- as a weapon, to
          destroy, or as a tool, to build.
          It is a fit companion for a King.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 14.

          23 INT. VAULT - DAY 23

          The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now
          strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just
          catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large
          and BLUE-SKINNED.
          One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns
          to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the
          Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something
          standing in the shadows behind it.
          As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.
          They turn back around.
          Now it's their turn to SCREAM.

          24 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24

          The Ceremony continues.

                         ODIN
          Today I entrust you with the
          greatest honor in all the Nine
          Realms. The sacred throne of
          Asgard. I have sacrificed much to
          achieve peace. So, too, must a new
          generation sacrifice to maintain
          that peace. Responsibility, duty,
          honor. These are not merely
          virtues to which we must aspire.
          They are essential to every soldier
          and to every King.
          The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub
          their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the
          hall.
          Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son
          with pride.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 15.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard
          the Nine Realms?

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Do you swear to preserve the peace?

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Do you swear to cast aside all
          selfish ambition and pledge
          yourself only to the good of all
          the Realms?
          Beat.

                         THOR
          I swear.

                         ODIN
          Then on this day, I, Odin
          Allfather, proclaim you--
          Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE
          creeps across the surface of the large banners around the
          hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades,
          and the crowd see it too.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (REALIZING)
          Frost giants...
          The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the
          palace below. Sif and the Warriors Three reach for their
          weapons, as Thor races from the hall.

          25B INT. VAULT - DAY 25B

          Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him.
          Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and
          stop short.
          Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor.
          We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants
          clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering
          remains on the floor.
          They've just lost a savage battle. Badly.
          Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal
          creature, a fiery glow coming from within it.
          It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.

                         SIF
          The Destroyer.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (AWED)
          I thought it was but a legend.
          Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets
          the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post,
          the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it.
          Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.

                         FANDRAL
          I've never been inside the Vault
          before. It's said the Tesseract
          was once held here.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (AWED)
          The Tesseract? I thought that was
          but a legend too!

                         SIF
          Shush!
          Odin surveys the destruction.

                         THOR
          The Jotuns must pay for what
          they've done!

                         ODIN
          They have paid with their lives.
          The Destroyer did its job, and the
          Casket is safe. All is well.

                         THOR
          "All is well?!"� They broke into
          the Weapons Vault! If the Frost
          Giants had stolen even one of these

                         RELICS--

                         ODIN
          But they didn't.

                         THOR
          I want to know why they--

                         ODIN

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          The Casket of Ancient Winters
          belonged to the Jotuns. They
          believe it's their birthright.

                         THOR
          And if you hadn't taken it from
          them they would have laid waste to
          all the Nine Realms!

                         ODIN
          I have a truce with Laufey, the
          Jotun King.

                         THOR
          He just broke your truce! We must
          act!
          Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.

                         ODIN
          Leave us.
          Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          And what action would you take?

                         THOR
          March into Jotunheim as you once
          did, teach them a lesson, break
          their spirits so they'll never dare
          try to cross our borders again!

                         ODIN
          You're thinking only as a warrior!

                         THOR
          This was an act of war!

                         ODIN
          It was the act of but a few, doomed
          to fail.

                         THOR
          They got this far!

                         ODIN
          We will find the breach in our
          defenses. It will be found, and it
          will be sealed.

                         THOR
          As King of Asgard, I would--

                         ODIN
          You are not King. Not yet.
          Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far
          as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the
          doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin
          watches him go.

          26 INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 26

          Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the
          festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger
          and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the
          massive tables.
          From across the room, Loki watches him.

          AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE
          Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in
          search of his dinner.

                         SIF
          Redecorating, are we?
          Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What's this -- ?!

                         HOGUN
          I told you they'd cancel it.

                         FANDRAL
          We thought that was just you being
          your normal cheery self.
          Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.

                         VOLSTAGG
          All this food -- so innocent, cast
          to the ground. It breaks the
          heart!
          Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki
          calmly moves towards him.

                         THOR
          It's unwise to be in my company
          right now, brother.

                         LOKI
          Who said I was wise?

                         THOR
          (re: the empty hall)
          This was to be my day of triumph.

                         LOKI
          It will come. In time.

                         (ADMITS)
          If it's any consolation, I think
          you're right. About the Frost
          Giants, about Laufey, everything.
          If a few of them could penetrate
          the defenses of Asgard once, who's
          to say they won't try again. Next
          time with an army?

                         THOR
          Yes, exactly!

                         LOKI
          But there's nothing we can do
          without defying Father.
          Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye.
          Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          No... stop there! I know that
          look!

                         THOR
          It's the only way to ensure the
          safety of our borders.

                         LOKI
          It's madness!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Madness? What sort of madness?

                         LOKI
          Nothing! Thor was making a jest!

                         THOR
          The safety of our Realm is no jest.
          We're going to Jotunheim.

          What?!

                          SIF
          Thor, of all the laws of Asgard,
          this is one you must not break.
          Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.

                         FANDRAL
          This isn't like a journey to Earth,
          where you summon a little lightning
          and thunder and the mortals worship
          you as a god. This is Jotunheim.

                         VOLSTAGG
          And if the Frost Giants don't kill
          you, your Father will!

                         THOR
          My father fought his way into
          Jotunheim, defeated their armies,
          and took their Casket! We'd just
          be looking for answers.

                         SIF
          It is forbidden!
          Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his
          case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction.

                         THOR
          My friends, have you forgotten all
          that we've done together?
          He turns to Fandral.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Who brought you into the sweet
          embrace of the most exotic maidens
          in all of Yggdrasil?

                         FANDRAL
          You did.

                         THOR

                         (TO HOGUN)
          Who led you into the most glorious
          of battles...

                         (TO VOLSTAGG)
          ...and to delicacies so succulent,
          you thought you'd died and gone to
          Valhalla?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A.

                         VOLSTAGG/HOGUN
          You did. / You did.
          He turns to Sif.

                         THOR
          And who proved wrong all who
          scoffed at the idea that a young
          maiden could be one of the fiercest
          warriors this Realm has ever known?

                         SIF
          I did.

                         THOR

                         (QUICKLY)
          True. But I supported you...
          (then, to the others)
          My friends, trust me now. We must
          do this.
          The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no
          convincing him.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Come on. You're not going to let
          my brother and me take all the
          glory, are you?
          Loki looks startled.

                         LOKI
          What?

                         THOR
          You are coming with me...

                         LOKI
          Yes, of course! I won't let my
          brother march into Jotunheim alone.
          I will be at his side.

                         VOLSTAGG
          And I.

                         FANDRAL
          And I.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20.

                         HOGUN
          And I. The Warriors Three fight
          together.

                         SIF
          I fear we'll live to regret this.

                         VOLSTAGG
          If we're lucky.

          27 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 27

          Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the Palace,
          across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS who
          ready their battle gear for their journey.
          Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD.
          Hogun notices.

                         THOR
          We must first find a way to get
          past Heimdall.

                         VOLSTAGG
          That will be no easy task. It's
          said the Gatekeeper can see a
          single dew drop fall from a blade
          of grass a thousand worlds away.

                         FANDRAL
          And he can hear a cricket passing
          gas in Niffelheim.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Jest not! He heareth all!

                         FANDRAL
          Please. Getting past him should be
          simple enough now, since he seems
          to be letting Frost Giants sneak by
          under his nose.
          Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Forgive him! He meaneth no
          offense!
          Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20A.

          28 EXT. GATE OF ASGARD - DAY 28

          Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through
          the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the
          most astounding path in this Realm or any other --

          THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 21.
          Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the
          mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far
          ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's
          Observatory.

          29 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29

          The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself,
          Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before
          them, blocking their way, staring them down.
          There is something other-worldly about him, even for this
          Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern,
          intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something
          glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.

                         LOKI
          Keep your weapons sheathed and your
          mouths closed. This is going to
          take subtlety and sincerity, not
          brute strength. Leave it to me.
          Loki dismounts and steps forward.

          LOKI (CONT'D)

                         GOOD HEIMDALL--

                         HEIMDALL
          You're not dressed warmly enough.
          Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.

                         LOKI
          I'm sorry?

                         HEIMDALL
          The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It
          will kill you all in time, even
          Thor.

                         (THEN)
          You think you can deceive me? I,
          who watch all? I, who can sense
          the flapping of a butterfly's wings
          a thousand worlds away?
          He fixes his eyes pointedly at Fandral.

          HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
          Or can hear a cricket passing gas
          in Niffelheim?
          Fandral looks gob-smacked.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 22.

                         FANDRAL
          That was just a bit of a jest,
          really...
          Loki goes into damage control.

                         LOKI
          You must be mistaken. We're not--

                         THOR

                         (STEPPING FORWARD)
          Enough.

                         (TO HEIMDALL)
          Heimdall, may we pass?
          Heimdall stares him down.

                         HEIMDALL
          For ages have I guarded Asgard and
          kept it safe from those who would
          do it harm. In all that time,
          never has an enemy slipped by my
          watch -- until this day. I wish to
          know how that happened.

                         THOR
          Then tell no one where we've gone
          until we've returned.
          Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group
          pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles
          him.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What happened? Your silver tongue
          turn to lead?

                         LOKI
          Get me off this bridge before it
          cracks under your girth.
          Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.

          30 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 30

          Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a
          platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus
          at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23.

                         HEIMDALL
          Be warned. I will honor my sworn
          oath to protect this Realm as its
          Gatekeeper. If your return
          threatens the safety of Asgard,
          Bifrost will remain closed to you.
          You'll be left to die in the cold
          wastes of Jotunheim.

                         THOR
          I have no plans to die today.

                         HEIMDALL
          None do.
          Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the
          apparatus of the Observatory starts up.

          31 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 31

          The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into
          the Observatory.

          32 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32

          Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The
          Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a
          section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his
          sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,
          the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.
          The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor
          and his five comrades stand.

                         HEIMDALL
          All is ready. You may pass.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Couldn't you just leave the bridge
          open for us?

                         HEIMDALL
          To keep this bridge open would
          unleash the full power of the
          Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with
          you upon it.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Ah. Never mind, then.
          Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others,
          grins.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A.

                         THOR
          Come on. Don't be bashful.
          The others join him at his side, then step towards the
          Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,
          changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being
          elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked
          off the platform and inside the vortex.

          33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33

          A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting
          out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor
          and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are
          imprinted on the ice around them.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24.
          Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly
          grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling
          precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's
          inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.

                         THOR
          Come on, big fella. Up...!
          With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the
          ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:

                         VOLSTAGG
          This belt! This belt is now my
          lucky belt! I will never remove
          it! Even when bathing!

                         FANDRAL
          You bathe?
          Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
          at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet
          is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking
          apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges
          and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks
          and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun
          city lies in the distance.

                         HOGUN
          We shouldn't be here.

                         THOR
          Too late now.

                         FANDRAL
          Actually, it's not. We could turn
          right around, hop back to Asgard,
          share a mug by the fire. Could be
          nice.
          Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.

                         LOKI
          Perhaps we should wait.
          Thor turns back to his brother.

                         THOR
          For what?

                         LOKI
          To survey the enemy. To gauge
          their strengths and weaknesses from
          a distance.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25.

                         VOLSTAGG
          I'm liking that. Gauging,
          surveying. Particularly the
          distance part.

                         THOR
          We know all we must. It's time to
          act.
          Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.

                         SIF
          He's just got to swing his
          hammer...

          34 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34

          The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland,
          shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki
          looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers.
          Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.

                         THOR
          It feels good, doesn't it? To be
          together again, adventuring on
          another world?

                         FANDRAL
          Adventuring? Is that what we're
          doing?

                         THOR
          What would you call it?

                         FANDRAL
          Freezing.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Starving.

                         SIF
          Whining.

                         THOR
          How about a song to lift our
          spirits?
          The others groan.

                         HOGUN
          No, not that!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A.

                         SIF
          Please don't make us sing again!

                         FANDRAL
          If I have to listen to Volstagg's
          singing voice one more time, I'll
          fall on my own sword!

                         SIF
          Well, now I'm on board.
          She and Thor share a grin.
          The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient
          structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by
          warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a
          central plaza.

          SIF (CONT'D)
          Where are they?

                         THOR
          Hiding. As cowards always do.
          Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza.
          Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY
          FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.

          35 EXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35

          The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in
          the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides.
          The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons.
          A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.

                         JOTUN SENTRY
          What is your business here,
          Asgardian?
          The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 26.

                         THOR
          I speak only to your King. Not to
          his foot soldiers.

          JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)
          Then speak.
          Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple,
          where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading
          waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too
          proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and
          his people have endured.

                         LAUFEY
          I am Laufey, King of this Realm.

                         THOR
          And I am--

                         LAUFEY
          We know who you are, Odinson. Why
          have you brought the stench of your
          blood into my world?

                         THOR
          I demand answers.
          Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.

                         LAUFEY
          You "demand?"�

                         THOR
          How did your people get into
          Asgard?

                         LAUFEY
          The house of Odin is full of
          traitors.
          Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed
          by the Jotun King's words.

                         THOR
          Do not dishonor my father's name
          with your lies.

                         LAUFEY
          Your father is a murderer and a
          thief. He stole what was ours, and
          left our world in ruins. We have
          the right to reclaim the Casket.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 27.

                         THOR
          Not when you'd use it to make war
          against other Realms.
          Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.

                         LAUFEY
          And why have you come here? To
          make peace? You long for battle.
          You crave it. I see you for what
          you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but
          a boy, trying to prove himself a
          man.

                         THOR
          This boy has grown tired of your
          mockery.
          Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in
          front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost
          Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet
          tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores
          him.

                         LOKI
          Thor, stop and think. Look around
          you. We are outnumbered.

                         THOR
          Know your place, brother...

                         LAUFEY
          You should listen to his counsel.
          You know not what your actions
          would unleash.
          Laufey steps out of the shadows.

          LAUFEY (CONT'D)
          But I do. Go now, while I still
          allow it.
          Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.

                         LOKI
          We will accept your most gracious
          offer.
          The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down
          a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades
          breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant
          nearby mutters under his breath.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28.

                         JOTUN
          Run back home, little princess.
          Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's
          coming.

                         LOKI
          Damn.
          In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS
          the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly
          draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.
          Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Silly hammer! Has a mind of its
          own!
          ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR
          around them, extending off the ends of their arms like
          SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.

                         FANDRAL
          I'm hoping that's just decorative.
          Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost
          Giant. His comrades form another circle around him,
          separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer
          around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying
          this.

                         THOR
          Next!
          Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.

                         FANDRAL
          Well? What move, do you think?

                         VOLSTAGG
          I say we use "The Norn's Revenge."�

                         FANDRAL
          At this close range? I think "The
          Alfheim Lunge"� is a better move.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (DISGUSTED)
          Maybe if they were three feet tall!
          No! How about "The Randy
          Valkyrie"�?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28A.

                         HOGUN
          Shut up!
          Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks
          loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.
          A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant
          hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his
          mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and
          hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over
          him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins
          back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun
          with his mace.
          Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her
          double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.

                         SIF
          If you don't treat me like a lady,
          I won't act like a lady!
          She takes out the Jotun.
          Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at
          the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,
          swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.
          The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes
          out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the
          crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.

                         LOKI
          (to the falling Giant)
          Pathetic.
          He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from
          either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at
          once.
          Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
          The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then
          punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a
          long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in
          front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.
          Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.

                         THOR
          Come on! At least make it a
          challenge for me!
          He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a
          tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor
          rises, grins.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Now that's more like it!
          He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute
          head over heels.
          Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies
          back to his grasp.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          (re: the fallen Brute)
          Ugly and stupid.
          Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the
          ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.
          Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his
          sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in
          the chest. The Jotun falls dead.

                         SIF
          (to Hogun, re: knife)
          I'm so glad I taught him how to do
          that!
          Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good
          hits in.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You may want to put some ice on
          that!
          The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in
          a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.
          Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          You may be taller, but I'm wider!
          Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him
          flying.
          Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and
          sending him crashing to the ground.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          It's not too late for you to
          surrender.
          Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's
          bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the
          Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing
          Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C.
          Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's
          ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.
          Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies
          to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he
          opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes
          out a small FLASK.
          Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells
          to his comrades.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Don't let them grab hold of you!
          He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the
          battle.
          Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword
          stops mid ice layer.
          The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,
          and the warrior drops to one knee.
          Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one
          quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using
          her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's
          chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          (on his belly)
          Thank you, my lady. But I nearly
          had him!

                         SIF
          Of course you did.
          Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling
          them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the
          bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into
          the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them
          out.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29.
          A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH-
          FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.
          Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he
          goes.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Hang on!
          Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around
          Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly
          worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously
          close to hacking into Hogun's legs.

                         HOGUN
          Watch the legs!

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (REALIZING)
          Right. Sorry.
          Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally
          freeing Hogun's feet.
          Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.

                         FANDRAL
          You really think your icicles are a
          match for Asgardian steel?
          Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade
          away.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Fair enough.
          Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's
          sword and snaps it in half.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Could we stop just a moment while I
          get another sword?
          Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun
          then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of
          the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant
          through with his own weapon.
          The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a
          pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,
          forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,
          rendering him helpless.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A.
          Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and
          felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly-
          unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights
          them off.
          Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.

                         VOLSTAGG
          That's unfortunate.
          He hurries to his wounded comrade.

                         FANDRAL
          I may need a bit of help. Not a
          good look, is it?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Just try not to bleed.

                         FANDRAL
          How's the face?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Flawless.
          Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice
          stalagmite.
          Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost
          Giants.
          The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his
          hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's
          grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees
          his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.
          Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead
          of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE
          -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads
          painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.
          The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the
          unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the
          distraction, KICKS the Giant.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30.
          Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts
          the Jotuns around him.

                         THOR
          Come on!
          But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost
          Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor
          from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.
          Mjolnir falls to the ground.
          A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the
          ground, to no avail.
          Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg
          slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to
          leave.
          From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides
          it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the
          palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the
          wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.
          The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their
          feet.

                         LOKI
          That can't be good.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Yes, it could! Might be an early
          spring!
          They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see
          shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS
          awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.
          Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.

                         LOKI
          Thor, we must go!
          Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes
          mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the
          look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat
          of battle.

                         THOR
          Then go!

                         SIF
          There are too many of them!

                         THOR
          I can stop them!
          The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all
          around them.

                         SIF
          Thor!
          But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Run!
          Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of
          the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give
          chase.
          Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.
          The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he
          disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a

                         MOMENT --

          THOR'S FIST
          Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns.
          He opens his hand, beckoning.
          One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind
          him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in
          the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor
          raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground
          with all his might.
          KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer
          channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the
          Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive
          shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32.
          But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the
          shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to
          where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground
          beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          What's Thor done?

                         LOKI
          Likely killed us all!
          As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their
          mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists
          quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
          The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes
          a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not
          move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
          Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He
          raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off
          the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his
          comrades.

          35A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A

          Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.

                         THOR
          Loki, we have to see.
          Loki raises his arms, concentrates, the mists dissipating.
          But as they do, the Asgardians see before them the faces of
          the Frost Giants. And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too
          many, even for a Thunder God.

                         VOLSTAGG

                         (TO LOKI)
          Actually, could you bring the mists
          back, please?
          Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.
          The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening
          ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts
          down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom
          comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of
          all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad
          in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A.
          The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks,
          stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.
          Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath
          his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to
          react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-
          to-face with Odin.
          Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's
          about to happen.
          Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the
          Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's
          not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of
          earshot of the others.

                         ODIN
          Laufey. End this.

                         LAUFEY
          Your boy sought this out.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33.

                         ODIN
          You're right. These are the
          actions of a boy. Treat them as
          such. You and I can stop this
          before there's further bloodshed.
          Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice
          blade at the end of his arm.

                         LAUFEY
          We are beyond diplomacy now,
          Allfather. He'll get what he came
          for -- war and death.
          Odin looks grim, determined.

                         ODIN
          So be it.
          Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but
          Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon
          the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards
          in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.
          The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the
          fleeing Jotuns with delight.

                         THOR
          Now! We'll finish them together!

                         ODIN
          Silence!
          Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the
          Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops
          the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the
          hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent.
          Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.

          36 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 36

          Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls. Odin pulls
          Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to him.
          Heimdall backs away.

                         THOR
          Why did you bring us back?

                         ODIN
          Do you realize what you've done?
          What you've started?

          You cannot protect your friends.
          How can you hope to protect a
          kingdom?
          Odin turns to the others.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (RE: FANDRAL)
          Get him to the healing room!
          Sif, Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help Fandral out of the
          room.

                         THOR
          There won't be a kingdom to protect
          if you're afraid to act!
          Odin stares at him.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Whatever the cost, the world must
          know that the new King of Asgard
          will not be held in contempt.

                         ODIN
          That's pride and vanity that talks!
          Not leadership! Have you forgotten
          everything I've taught you? What
          of a warrior's patience, cunning?

                         THOR
          While you wait and be patient, the
          Nine Realms laugh at us! The old
          ways are done. You'd stand giving
          speeches while Asgard falls!

                         ODIN
          You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

                         THOR
          And you are an old man and a fool!
          The whole world seems to stop at Thor's words. Odin falls
          quiet. When he speaks again, there's something terrifying
          beneath the calmness of his words.

                         ODIN
          A fool, yes! I was a fool to think
          you were ready.
          Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.

                         FATHER--
          Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his
          tracks.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35.

                         ODIN
          Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed
          the express command of your King.
          Through your arrogance and
          stupidity, you have opened these
          peaceful Realms and innocent lives
          to the horrors of war.
          The Allfather plunges Gungnir into Observatory's control
          panel. The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along
          with Odin's rage. It FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the end
          of the platform, creating a portal behind Thor.
          Odin turns angrily to his son.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          You are unworthy of this Realm...
          Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...unworthy of your title...
          He rips away Thor's cloak.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...unworthy of the loved ones
          you've betrayed. I hereby take
          from you your powers.
          Odin extends his hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes flying
          from Thor's grasp into Odin's hand.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          In the name of my father...
          A FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the hammer and hits Thor,
          disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the
          chest piece.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          ...and of his father before...
          Another strike disintegrates the remainder of Thor's armor,
          including the cape and torn-away disc on the floor.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          I cast you out!
          Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF
          THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost and
          disappears in the vortex.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 35A.
          Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He
          closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something
          quietly.

          ODIN (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERING)
          Whosoever holds this hammer, if he
          be worthy, shall possess the power
          of Thor.
          RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into its
          smooth surface. The runes linger for but a moment, then
          disappear. Suddenly, Odin turns and hurls the hammer into
          the Bifrost.

          CUT TO BLACK.

          37 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 37

          Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's
          blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. It
          swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS
          into him, as we:

          After a beat, we hear familiar voices.

          DARCY (V.O.)
          I think that was legally your
          fault.

          JANE (V.O.)
          Get the first aid kit.

                         (THEN)
          Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
          and don't be dead, okay? Open your
          eyes and look at me.

          THOR'S POV
          Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him,
          concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful.

          DARCY (O.S.)
          Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
          know CPR.

          END THOR'S POV

          TIME CUT TO:
          Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their
          heads. A thought strikes her.

                         JANE

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Where did he come from?
          They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits
          up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise.
          Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers
          Jane a hand up. She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls
          her up. She can't help but marvel at his strength.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Uh, thanks. Are you okay?
          Thor searches the ground.

                         THOR
          Hammer...

                         DARCY
          Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
          That's pretty obvious.
          Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines
          her flashlight down at the sand.

          Erik... look at this.
          He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible
          pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look.
          Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and
          snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them
          away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          We've got to move fast before

          She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some
          readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at
          Thor, who stares up at the sky.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, we need get him to a
          hospital.
          Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the
          cannister.

                         JANE
          Not right now. It'll take too
          long. County's an hour away.
          We'll drop him off after we're done
          here.
          Selvig looks uncertain.

          JANE (CONT'D)

                         (RE: THOR)
          Look at him, he's fine.
          Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily.

                         THOR
          Father! Heimdall! I know you can
          hear me! Open the bridge!

                         JANE
          (off Selvig's look)
          Okay, you and Darcy take him to the
          hospital, I'll stay here.

                         SELVIG
          You expect me to leave you alone in
          the middle of the desert?
          Thor turns to the others, frustrated.

                         THOR
          You! What world is this?
          The group is intimidated by his fervor.

                         SELVIG
          It's all right, my friend. We're
          going to get you some help.
          Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows
          agitated, belligerent.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37A.

                         THOR
          Where am I?! Answer me!
          Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it.
          Jane looks on, concerned.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 38.

                         JANE
          Erik, just back away...

                         SELVIG
          (to Thor, calming)
          You're in the desert outside the
          town of Puente Antiguo.

                         THOR
          What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?

                         DARCY
          Uh... New Mexico?
          Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon,
          unsure what to make of it.

                         THOR
          You dare threaten Thor with so puny

                         A--
          Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser,
          ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the
          ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked.

                         DARCY
          What? He was freaking me out.

          38 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - MOMENTS LATER 38

          As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle
          to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO DARCY)
          Next time you decide to taser
          someone, do me a favor and make
          sure they're already inside the
          truck.

                         (TO JANE)
          Jane, come on...
          Reluctantly, Jane joins the others inside the SUV.

          39 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 39

          The SUV heads off into the distance. Behind it, high
          overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky. A last blast of Bifrost
          energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing
          into our world. It BURNS across the desert sky like a
          meteor.

                         40 OMITTED 40

          41 EXT. COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT 41

          The SUV sits parked before the emergency room entrance.

          42 INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 42

          Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two
          ORDERLIES set the Asgardian onto a gurney. Jane and Darcy
          stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          Name?

                         JANE
          He said it was "Thor."�
          The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key
          at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (SPELLING)
          T-H-O-R. And your relationship to
          him?

                         JANE
          I've never met him before.

                         DARCY
          Until she hit him with the car.

                         JANE
          Grazed him, actually.

                         (THEN)
          Oh, and we tasered him, too.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          Must have been quite the spat.

                         JANE
          I told you, I don't know him. I
          just want to make sure he's okay.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I'm going to need a name and
          contact number.

                         JANE
          Jane Foster.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE

                         SELVIG
          Oh, for God's sake...
          He reaches over Jane's shoulder and hands the Nurse his
          business card.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          Here. Let's go.
          Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.

          43 INT. HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 43

          Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens on
          a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in his
          arm.

                         NURSE
          Hi. Just taking a little blood.
          Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.

                         THOR
          How dare you attack the son of
          Odin!

                         NURSE
          I need some help!
          Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.

          NURSE (CONT'D)
          We're trying to help you!

                         THOR
          Then bring me a healing stone, you
          savages!
          He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a
          couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all
          struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying,
          furniture overturned.

                         ORDERLY
          What the hell is this guy on?
          Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor
          looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered
          by this small group. The NURSE injects him with a sedative.

                         THOR
          You're no match for the Mighty--
          Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.

          44 EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAWN 44

          Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls
          his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge. He climbs out,
          peers down below, his curiosity piqued by what he sees.

                         TOWNIE
          Huh.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A.
          The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater.
          We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an
          otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object,
          tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts,
          strains with all his might, with no luck.
          He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious
          object.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41.

           TOWNIE (CONT'D)
           Huh.

          45 EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45

          The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light.
          Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast
          desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at
          her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment.
          A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the
          Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall.
          Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed.
          He notices a monitor which displays a complex program
          entitled "J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS"�. He looks proud.
          The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine
          and excitement.

                         JANE
          Darcy, when you're done, take the
          soil samples to Professor Meyers in
          geology. Remind him, he owes me.

                         SELVIG
          We might want to perform a spectral
          analysis.

                         JANE
          "We?"�

                         SELVIG
          I flew all the way out here --
          might as well make myself useful.
          This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up,
          inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a
          rack-mounted server.

                         JANE
          You know what would be really
          useful? Do you still have that
          friend at LIGO?

                         SELVIG
          She was more than a friend.

                         JANE
          Could you call in a favor?

                         SELVIG
          You don't think this was just a
          magnetic storm?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A.

                         JANE
          If I'm right, their observatory
          must have picked up gravitational
          waves during last night's event.

                         SELVIG
          Meaning?
          Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.

                         JANE
          Meaning these anomalies might
          signify something bigger.

                         SELVIG
          How "big"� are we talking about?
          Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of
          the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there
          appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and
          covered with stars.

                         JANE
          I think the lensing around the
          edges is characteristic of an
          Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

                         DARCY
          A what?

                         SELVIG
          I thought you were a science major.

                         DARCY
          Political Science.
          Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.

                         JANE
          She was the only applicant.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO DARCY)
          An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a
          "theoretical"� connection between
          two different points of space-time.
          Darcy stares blankly.

                         JANE

                         (TO DARCY)
          A wormhole.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B.
          Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the
          monitor.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Erik, look...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42.
          Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen
          through the "bubble"� in the clouds.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          What do you see here?

                         SELVIG
          Stars.

                         JANE
          Yes. But not our stars.
          She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her
          excitement.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          This is the star alignment for our
          quadrant, this time of year. So
          unless Ursa Minor decided to take
          the day off... those are someone
          else's constellations.
          Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
          Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from
          the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the
          image catches her eye.

                         DARCY
          Hey, check it out.
          Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.

                         SELVIG
          Is that...?

                         JANE
          I think I left something at the
          hospital.
          As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost
          funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape
          of a MAN.

          45A EXT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 45A

          At the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the
          balcony. As we move closer, we see it is a burdened Odin,
          looking out over Asgard.

          46 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 46

          Frigga enters to find Odin standing lost in thought.

                         FRIGGA
          How could you have done this?

                         ODIN
          Do you understand what he set in
          motion? He's taken us to the brink
          of war!

                         FRIGGA
          But banishment? You would lose him
          forever? He's your son!

                         ODIN
          What would you have done?

          I would not have exiled him to a
          world of mortals, stripped of his
          powers, to suffer alone. I would
          not have had the heart for such
          cruelty!

                         ODIN
          That is why I'm King.

                         (THEN)
          I, too, grieve the loss of our son.
          But there are some things that even
          I cannot undo.

                         FRIGGA
          You can bring him back.

                         ODIN
          No. His fate is in his own hands
          now.

          47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 47

          Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his
          wrists now. He pulls at them, tries to free himself, to no
          avail.

                         THOR
          It's not possible.
          He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands
          slips free from its restraint.

          47A INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - DAY 47A

          Jane again faces the Admissions Nurse, with Selvig and Darcy
          nearby.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I'm sorry, only relatives can visit
          patients.

                         JANE

                         (THINKING FAST)
          But... I'm his wife.
          Darcy stifles a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse looks doubtful.

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          I thought you said you didn't know
          him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43A.

                         JANE
          I meant I barely know him anymore.
          The man he's become. He's changed.
          I mean, what woman really knows her
          husband, anyway?

                         ADMISSIONS NURSE
          None of us, dear. He's in Room

          102.

          48 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 48

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head down the corridor, passing the
          destruction of the ER Thor wrecked the previous night.

          They enter Thor's room.

          49 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 49

          They step inside to find Thor's bed empty.

          50 EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 50

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy quickly climb into Jane's SUV.

          51 INT. JANE'S SUV 51

          Jane starts the car, frustrated.

                         JANE
          Typical. I just lost my most
          important piece of evidence.

                         DARCY
          So now what?

                         JANE
          We find him.

                         SELVIG
          Did you see what he did in there?
          I don't know if finding him is the
          best idea.

                         JANE
          I want to know what that thing was,
          and he may have the answers. We
          don't have a choice.

                         DARCY
          Oo-kay.
          She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.

                         SELVIG
          So we're just going to spend the
          rest of the day looking for him?

                         JANE
          However long it takes.
          Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --

          BAM!
          She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital
          scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44A.

          52 EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY 52

          Jane and Selvig emerge from the SUV, help Thor to his feet.

                         JANE
          I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not
          doing that on purpose.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45.
          Thor looks up at the sky.

                         THOR
          Blue sky... one sun... This is
          Earth, isn't it?

                         DARCY
          I think you may have hit him with
          the car one time too many.

                         JANE

                         (TO THOR)
          Let's get you some clothes.

          53 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 53

          Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell-
          shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a
          ROARING central fire.
          Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING
          STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he
          carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades,
          the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His
          comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.
          Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.
          Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still
          blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.
          Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the
          Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to
          its normal color.

                         VOLSTAGG
          We should never have let him go.

                         SIF
          There was no stopping him.

                         FANDRAL
          At least he's only banished, not
          dead. Which is what we'd all be if
          that guard hadn't told Odin where
          we'd gone.

                         VOLSTAGG
          How did the guard even know?
          Loki stares at his arm.

                         LOKI
          I told him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A.

                          FANDRAL
          What?

                         LOKI
          I told him to go to Odin after we'd
          left. Though he should be flogged
          for taking so long.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You told the guard?

                         LOKI
          I saved our lives! And Thor's. I
          had no idea Father would banish him
          for what he did.

                         SIF
          Loki, you're the only one who can
          help Thor now. You must go to the
          Allfather and convince him to
          change his mind!

                         LOKI
          And if I do, then what? I love
          Thor more dearly than any of you,
          but you know what he is. He's
          arrogant. He's reckless. He's
          dangerous. You saw how he was
          today. Is that what Asgard needs
          from its King?
          The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He
          leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.

                         SIF
          He may speak about the good of
          Asgard, but he's always been
          jealous of Thor.

                         VOLSTAGG
          True, but we should be grateful to
          him. He did save our lives.

                         HOGUN
          Laufey said there were traitors in
          the House of Odin.
          The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.

                         FANDRAL
          Why is it every time you choose to
          speak, it has to be something dark
          and ominous?

                         HOGUN
          A master of magic could easily
          bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
          The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.

                         VOLSTAGG
          No! Surely not!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46A.

                         FANDRAL
          Loki's always been one for
          mischief, but you're talking about
          something else entirely.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 47.

                         SIF
          Who else could elude Heimdall's
          gaze with tricks of light and
          shadow?

                         VOLSTAGG
          The ceremony was interrupted just
          before Thor was named King.

                         SIF
          We should go to the Allfather.

                         FANDRAL
          And tell him what? "Oh, by the
          way, we think your son just
          betrayed the throne. And do us a
          favor. Bring back Thor. There's a
          good fellow!"�

                         SIF
          It's our duty. If any of our
          suspicions are right, then all of
          Asgard is in danger.

          54 INT. VAULT - DAY 54

          Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters
          sitting on its stand.
          He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it
          between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a
          blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.
          The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the
          Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black
          metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it --
          the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48.

           ODIN (O.S.)
          Stop!
          Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer
          goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it.
          Odin eyes Loki with dismay.

                         LOKI
          Am I cursed?

                         ODIN
          No. Put the Casket down.
          Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly
          returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his
          father.

                         LOKI
          What am I?

                         ODIN
          You're my son.

                         LOKI
          What more than that?
          Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened.
          Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          The Casket wasn't the only thing
          you took from Jotunheim that day,
          was it?
          Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.

                         ODIN
          No.

                         (BEAT)
          In the aftermath of the battle, I
          went into the Temple, and I found a
          baby. Small for a giant's
          offspring -- abandoned, suffering,
          left to die. Laufey's son.
          Loki is sent reeling by the revelation.

                         LOKI
          Laufey's son...
          He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48A.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun
          blood. Why would you take me?

                         ODIN
          You were an innocent child.

                         LOKI
          You took me for a purpose, what was
          it?
          Odin doesn't answer.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Tell me!

                         ODIN
          I thought we could unite our
          kingdoms one day, bring about an
          alliance, bring about a permanent
          peace... through you. But those
          plans no longer matter.

                         LOKI
          So I am no more than another stolen
          relic, locked up here until you
          might have use of me.

                         ODIN
          Why do you twist my words?

                         LOKI
          You could have told me what I was
          from the beginning. Why didn't
          you?

                         ODIN
          You are my son. My blood. I
          wanted only to protect you from the
          truth.

                         LOKI
          Because I am the monster parents
          tell their children about at night?

                         ODIN
          Don't...

                         LOKI
          It all makes sense now. Why you
          favored Thor all these years.

                         ODIN
          Listen...

                         LOKI
          Because no matter how much you
          claim to "love"� me, you could never
          have a Frost Giant sitting on the
          Throne of Asgard!
          Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to
          move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of
          the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries
          to fight it off.

                         ODIN
          Listen to me!
          Loki strides away towards the exit.

          ODIN (CONT'D)
          Loki!
          Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional,
          and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll.
          The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body
          now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving
          trails behind him as he staggers backwards.
          Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a
          scream. He collapses to the stone floor.
          Loki, shocked, hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms,
          calls out.

                         LOKI

          58 EXT. OUTSIDE OF CRATER - DAY 58

          Cars, pick-ups, and SUVs are parked around the crater, the
          sound of a BOISTEROUS PARTY coming from within.

          59 EXT. INSIDE OF CRATER 59

          It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on
          lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They
          watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a
          line to take a turn with the mysterious object.
          One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up,
          the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the
          effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their
          cell phones.
          They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large
          PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge. An EAGER
          TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain
          from the back of the truck.
          He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes
          the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.

                         EAGER TOWNIE
          This'll do it.
          He yells to the driver.

          EAGER TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          Okay, let 'er rip!
          The townsfolk watch as the pick-up's engine ROARS, then
          STRAINS, its wheels spinning futilely, until finally the rear
          of the truck, along with the back wheels and axles, break off
          and go flying.
          People dive out of the way.
          The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN "THE MAN"�
          LEE. He looks back, shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party
          continuing. They don't notice as --

          ON THE CRATER'S EDGE ABOVE THEM
          An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in
          a suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering
          below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the
          crater.
          He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object
          which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- MJOLNIR. He
          pulls out a phone.

                         COULSON

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Sir -- we've found it.

          60 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 60

          In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks
          around for a t-shirt.
          Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can't help but notice
          his reflection in the mirror. Darcy eyes his powerful build,
          rippling biceps.

                         DARCY
          You know, for a crazy homeless guy,
          he's pretty cut.
          Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a
          t-shirt.

          DARCY (CONT'D)
          Hey, sorry I tased you!
          Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the
          equipment there with interest. Jane hurries over to put a
          stop to it.

                         JANE
          Excuse me... excuse me!
          She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the
          t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads:
          "HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE"�. Thor looks at it,
          puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 52.

           JANE (CONT'D)
          My ex.
          Thor stares at her a beat.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          They're the only clothes I had
          that'll fit you. Sorry.

                         THOR
          They will suffice.
          Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on
          the wall.

                         JANE
          You're welcome. Now tell me...
          Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to
          his form in the Bifrost photo.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          What were you doing, in that?
          He glances at it, dismissive.

                         THOR
          What does anyone do in the Bifrost?
          Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word.
          Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor
          moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within
          the book, curious.

                         SELVIG
          (amused, skeptical)
          The Bifrost...
          Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close
          to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the
          book.

                         JANE
          What exactly is the Bifrost?

                         THOR

                         (IGNORING HER)
          This mortal form has grown weak.

                         JANE

                         BUT--

          Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.

          61 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61

          Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin
          lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the
          space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The
          walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting
          him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight.
          Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks
          softly to him.

                         FRIGGA
          I asked him to be honest with you
          from the beginning. There should
          be no secrets in a family.

                         LOKI
          So why did he lie?

                         FRIGGA
          He kept the truth from you so that
          you would never feel different.
          You are in every way our son, Loki,
          and we your family. You must know
          that.
          Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)

                         (RE: ODIN)
          You can speak to him. He can see
          and hear us, even now.

                         LOKI
          How long will it last?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53.

                         FRIGGA
          I don't know. This time is
          different. We were unprepared.

                         LOKI
          I never get used to seeing him like
          this. The most powerful being in
          the Nine Realms lying helpless
          until his body is restored.

                         FRIGGA
          But he's put it off for so long
          now, I fear...
          Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her
          eyes.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          You're a good son.
          Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he
          really feels.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          We mustn't lose hope that your
          father will return to us. And your
          brother.
          Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.

                         LOKI
          What hope is there for Thor?

                         FRIGGA
          There's always a purpose to
          everything your father does. Thor
          may yet find a way home.
          Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for
          the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS
          hurriedly approaching.

          THE EINHERJAR GUARD
          Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for
          the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is
          baffled.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Thor is banished. The line of
          succession falls to you. Until he
          awakens, Asgard is yours.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53A.
          The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another
          EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels
          before Loki, offers the spear to him.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          Make your father proud.
          Loki reaches out tentatively, then takes it. He likes the
          feel of it in his hand.

          62 INT. ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 62

          Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local
          diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a
          huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates --
          pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him.
          Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.

                         JANE
          Now tell us exactly what happened
          to you last night.
          Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets
          flustered, looks away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Maybe start with how you got inside
          that cloud.

                         DARCY
          And how you could eat an entire box
          of Pop-Tarts and still be this
          hungry.
          Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of
          coffee.

                         THOR
          (re: coffee mug)
          This drink. I like it.

                         DARCY
          (to Thor, re: coffee)
          Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
          Isabela makes the best coffee in
          town.
          Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.

                         THOR

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Another!
          ISABELA ALVAREZ (60), the diner's proprietor, glares at Thor
          from behind the counter.

                         JANE
          Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

                         (IN SPANISH)
          Yo voy a pagar la taza.
          Isabela turns to a WAITRESS and starts venting quickly in
          Spanish.

                         ISABELA

                         (IN SPANISH)
          Did you see that? The first time
          she brings a man in here, and he's
          a lunatic!

                         JANE
          (to Thor, re: mug)
          What was that?
          He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.

                         THOR
          It was delicious. I want another.

                         JANE
          Then you should just say so!

                         THOR
          I just did.

                         JANE
          I mean ask for it. Nicely.

                         THOR
          I meant no disrespect.

                         JANE
          All right, then no more smashing,
          deal?

                         THOR
          You have my word.

                         JANE
          Good.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55.
          A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at
          the counter. We recognize them from the crater. (Among them
          is the Drunk Townie Jake, who is not presently drunk.)

                         ISABELA
          Morning, Pete. Jake.

                         TOWNIE PETE
          The usual, please, Izzy.
          Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          You missed all the excitement out
          at the crater.

                         ISABELA
          What crater?
          Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the
          Townies with interest.

                         TOWNIE PETE
          They're saying some kind of
          satellite crashed in the desert.

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          We were having a good time with it
          till the Feds showed up, chased us
          out.

                         JANE
          (to the Townies)
          Excuse me, did you say there was a
          satellite crash?

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          Yep. They said it was radioactive.
          And I had my hands all over it.

                         (REALIZING)
          I'm probably sterile now.
          Thor, unconcerned, prepares to dig into the giant pile of
          pancakes. Darcy is amazed by the sight.

                         DARCY
          Oh my God, this is going on
          Facebook.
          Darcy whips out her cellphone.

          DARCY (CONT'D)

                         (TO THOR)
          Smile!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55A.
          Thor looks puzzled as she SNAPS a photo of him and his
          massive stack of food.

                         SELVIG
          (to the Townies)
          What did the satellite look like?

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          I don't know nothing about
          satellites. But it was heavy.
          Real heavy. Nobody could lift it.
          This gets Thor's attention.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 56.
          Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake,
          and pulls the Townie around to face him.

                         THOR
          Where?!

          DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
          About twelve miles east of here.
          Thor grins, his spirits soaring, as he quickly strides out of
          the diner.

                         PETE
          I wouldn't bother! Looked like the
          whole Army was coming in when we
          left!

          63 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 63

          Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings.
          Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.

                         JANE
          Where are you going?

                         THOR
          Twelve miles east of here.
          He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks
          with him.

                         JANE
          Why?

                         THOR
          To get what belongs to me.

                         JANE
          So now you own a satellite?

                         THOR
          It's not what they say it is.

                         JANE
          Whatever it is, the government
          seems to think it's theirs. You
          intend to just walk in there and
          take it?

                         THOR
          Yes.
          He stops walking.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 57.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          If you take me there now, I'll tell
          you everything you wish to know.

                         JANE
          Everything?

                         THOR
          All the answers you seek will be
          yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir.
          Darcy looks to the others.

                         DARCY
          "Myeu-muh?"� What's "Myeu-muh?"�
          Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,

                         WHEN:

                         SELVIG
          Jane.
          He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much
          care for him.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)

                         (TO JANE)
          Please don't do this.

                         JANE
          You know what we saw last night.
          This can't be a coincidence. I
          want to know what's in that crater.

                         SELVIG
          I'm not talking about the crater.
          I'm talking about him.

                         JANE
          He's promised us answers.

                         SELVIG
          He's delusional! Listen to what
          he's saying! "Thor."� "Bifrost."�
          "Mjolnir."� These are the stories I
          grew up with as a child!

                         JANE
          I'd just be driving him out there,
          that's all.

                         SELVIG
          It's dangerous. He's dangerous.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58.
          After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and
          Darcy.

                         JANE
          I'm sorry. I can't take you.

                         THOR
          I understand. Then this is where
          we say goodbye.
          He takes her hand and kisses it.

                         JANE
          That's... thank you.
          Thor bows slightly to each of them.

                         THOR
          Jane Foster... Erik Selvig...
          Darcy. Farewell.
          He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.

                         SELVIG
          Now... let's get back to the lab.
          We have work to do.
          Selvig and Darcy turn and start to go. Jane looks after Thor
          as he walks away down the street.

          64 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 64

          Sif joins the Warriors Three as they hurry towards the Throne
          Room.

          65 INT. THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 65

          Two EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors
          Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 59.

                         SIF
          Allfather, we must speak with you

                         URGENTLY--
          But as they raise their heads, they stop short to see --

                         LOKI
          Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his
          horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand.
          Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          What is this?

                         LOKI
          My friends... you haven't heard? I
          am now Ruler of Asgard.

                         FANDRAL
          Where is Odin?

                         LOKI
          Father's fallen into the Odinsleep.
          My mother fears he may never awaken
          again.

                         SIF
          We would speak with her.
          Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a look. Loki notices.

                         LOKI
          She has refused to leave my
          father's bedside. You can bring
          your "urgent"� matter to me, your
          King.
          Sif covers quickly.

                         SIF
          We would ask you to end Thor's
          banishment.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60.

                         LOKI
          My first command can not be to undo
          the Allfather's last. We're on the
          brink of war with Jotunheim. Our
          people must have a sense of
          continuity in order to feel safe in
          these difficult times.
          Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of
          this.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          All of us must stand together, for
          the good of Asgard.

                         FANDRAL
          Of course.
          Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki
          stares after them.

          66 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - MAIN STREET - DAY 66

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by
          Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped
          by traffic. In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices,
          partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis machine
          from her lab.

                         JANE
          Hey! That's my stuff!

          66A EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 66A

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy reach the lab, where government
          vehicles are parked. SHIELD AGENTS haul equipment out of the
          lab and load it into waiting vans. Other Agents strip all
          the equipment from inside the Pinzgauer and cart it away.
          Still others emerge from her trailer, arms loaded with
          scientific instruments and documents.

                         JANE
          What the hell is going on here?!
          The Agents ignore her as Agent Coulson approaches.

                         COULSON
          Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with

          SHIELD.
          Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows wary.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60A.

                         JANE
          I don't care who you work for, you
          can't do this!

                         SELVIG
          Jane. This is more serious than
          you realize. Let it go.

                         JANE
          Let it go?! This is my life!

                         COULSON
          We're here investigating a security
          threat. We need to appropriate
          your equipment and all your
          atmospheric data.

                         JANE
          By "appropriate"� you mean "steal?"�
          Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.

                         COULSON
          This should more than compensate
          you for your trouble.
          She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.

                         JANE
          I can't just pick up replacements
          from RadioShack! I made most of
          that equipment myself!

                         COULSON
          Then I'm sure you can do it again.

                         JANE
          And I'm sure I can sue you for
          violating my constitutional rights!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 61.

                         COULSON
          We're the good guys, Ms. Foster.
          He tries to walk away, but Jane blocks his path. She is
          fully herself, fueled by outrage.

                         JANE
          So are we! We're on the verge of

                         UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING
          extraordinary.
          Jane holds up her notebook.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Everything I know about this
          phenomenon is in this lab and in
          this book, and no one has the right
          to take it from me.
          Coulson gestures to a nearby AGENT, who promptly plucks the
          notebook out of Jane's hands and adds it to the pile he's
          carrying. Jane is stunned.

                         COULSON
          Thank you for your cooperation.
          He gets into a car. The cars and trucks pull away.

          67 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 67

          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy enter, staring in shock at the now-
          empty space.

                         JANE
          Years of research, gone.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62.

                         DARCY
          They even took my iPod.

                         SELVIG
          And your back-ups?

                         JANE
          Look around! They took our back-
          ups. They took the back-ups of our
          back-ups.

                         DARCY
          I just downloaded, like, thirty
          songs on there.

                         JANE

                         (TO DARCY)
          Will you please stop talking about
          your iPod?!

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Who are these people?

                         SELVIG
          No one knows much about them. But
          I knew a scientist -- a pioneer in
          gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up,
          and he was never heard from again.

                         JANE
          I'm not going to let them do this.
          I'm getting everything back.

                         SELVIG
          Please, let me contact one of my
          colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some
          dealings with these people. I'll e-
          mail him and see if he can help.

                         DARCY
          They took your laptop, too.
          Annoyed, Selvig thinks.

          67A EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 67A

          Selvig and Jane in the Pinzgauer drive up in front of the
          town's rinky-dink library. A sign in the window reads, "FREE

          INTERNET."�

                         SELVIG
          I'll just be a minute.
          He climbs out and heads inside. Jane looks down the street
          and sees something that intrigues her.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62A.

          68 INT. PET STORE - DAY 68

          Thor enters the store and approaches a PET STORE CLERK.

                         THOR
          I need a horse.

          PET STORE CLERK
          Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just
          dogs, cats, birds.

                         THOR
          Then give me one of those, large
          enough to ride.
          The Pet Store Clerk looks confused.
          Just then, Thor hears a CAR HORN. He turns to the open door.
          Across the street, Jane calls to him from the Pinzgauer.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63.

                         JANE
          You still want a lift?

          68A INT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 68A

          It's story time in the library, as a LIBRARIAN reads a book --
          "THE SECRET HISTORY OF GIANTS"� -- to a group of kids.

                         LIBRARIAN

                         (READING)
          "And though they're large, giants
          can be quiet. You have to listen
          carefully for the sound of their
          footsteps -- because they may be
          closer than you think."�
          Nearby, Selvig sits at a computer terminal, finishing up his
          e-mail. Beside him, a KID flips through a book with
          interest. The Librarian stops mid-story and calls to the Kid
          pleasantly.

          LIBRARIAN (CONT'D)
          Joshua, come sit down. It's story
          time.
          The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks
          over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --

          "MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD."�
          He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on
          Scandinavian Mythology.
          It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to
          earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and
          THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the ground below them, a group
          of VIKINGS kneel reverently.
          He eyes the illustration, pondering.

                         69 OMITTED 69

          70 EXT. DESERT - DUSK 70

          Jane's Pinzgauer cuts off the road, heads over the rugged
          terrain. Storm clouds roll in over the desert sky.

          71 INT. PINZGAUER - DUSK 71

          Jane drives, pumped with adrenaline, nervous and excited, as
          Thor sits beside her, upbeat and eager for battle.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63A.

                         JANE
          I've never done anything like this
          before! Have you ever done
          anything like this before?
          Thor looks amused by her excitement.

                         THOR
          Many times. You're brave to do it.

                         JANE
          They just stole my entire life's
          work. I really don't have anything
          left to lose.

                         THOR
          But you're clever. Far more clever
          than anyone else in this Realm.

                         JANE
          "This Realm?"� Why do you talk like
          that?

                         THOR
          You think me strange?
          Jane laughs, catches herself.

                         JANE
          Yeah. Just a little.

                         THOR
          Good strange or bad strange?

                         JANE
          I'm not quite sure yet.
          She looks at him, sees him staring at her. She's lost in his
          gaze, distracted, when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She quickly
          turns her eyes forward, regains control of the car.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Who are you? Really?

                         THOR
          You'll see soon enough.

                         JANE
          You promised me answers.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63B.
          Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.

                         THOR
          What you seek -- it's a bridge.

                         JANE
          A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen
          Bridge?

                         THOR
          More like a rainbow bridge.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64.
          A beat.

                          JANE
          God, I hope you're not crazy.

          71A EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71A

          As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside,
          revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move
          closer, we see the glow comes from --

          A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE
          Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers,
          barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence
          that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the
          complex.
          Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a
          translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the
          crater.
          Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see
          Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work.
          Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS
          work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the
          center of it all -- Mjolnir.

          72 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 72

          Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through
          binoculars, see the impressive SHIELD base.

                         JANE
          That isn't a satellite crash. They
          would have hauled the wreckage
          away, not built a city around it.
          Thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her.

                         THOR
          You're going to need this.

                         JANE
          Why?--
          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and
          takes his jacket.

                         THOR
          Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I
          will return what they stole from
          you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64A.
          He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his
          request.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Deal?

                         JANE
          No! Look what's down there! You
          can't just walk in, grab our stuff,
          and walk out!

                         THOR
          No.
          Jane looks relieved.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'm going to fly out.
          Before she can react, he starts heading towards the crater.
          The first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65.

                         JANE
          Wait...
          But Thor is already headed towards the crater.

          72A EXT. SHIELD BASE / INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE STRUCTURE 72A

          A NEEDLE spikes on a handheld SENSOR DEVICE. The TECHNICIAN
          holding it looks over at the hammer. Mjolnir begins to give
          off a subtle glow. A bolt of lightning CRACKS across the sky
          above.

                         CUT TO:

          73 AN AERIAL INFRARED VIDEO IMAGE OF THE AREA 73
          It's fuzzy, doesn't show much. We widen to see we are:

          74 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM 74

          A younger SHIELD agent, a TECHIE in a headset, monitors
          security. AGENT SITWELL, humorless, just this side of
          junior, looks on, none-too-pleased.

                         TECHIE
          Feed from the keyhole. Can barely
          penetrate the cloud cover.
          The Techie hikes a thumb at another monitor, SQUELCHING with
          static. It shows an SAR shot of the area, laid over a
          terrain map.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Tech's barely working as it is,
          with all the interference that
          thing's giving off.
          He gestures towards the hammer. He checks a computer.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Hey, we've got a commercial
          aircraft coming in right over us,
          Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.

                         SITWELL
          Reroute it, like all the others.

                         TECHIE
          Right. Can I get the passengers
          some free drinks for the trouble?
          Sitwell glares at him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65A.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)

                         (SHRUGS)
          It'd be a nice gesture.
          The Techie types into the computer, when he notices something
          on another screen, holds up a hand.

          TECHIE (CONT'D)
          Hold a sec... we got something
          outside the fence, west side...
          He points at the screen. Through the haze, it shows a
          THERMAL IMAGE huddled beside the fence.

                         SITWELL
          (into a radio)
          DeLancey, Jackson -- check it out.

          74A EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 74A

          A pair of SHIELD AGENTS (DELANCEY and JACKSON) take off in a
          jeep to investigate.

          74B EXT. SHIELD SECURITY ROOM 74B

          Sitwell looks out the window, something strange catching his
          attention. We see in the window's reflection that a glow is
          coming from the hammer containment area.

          75 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - FENCE - MOMENTS LATER 75

          The jeep pulls up as the Agents scan the fence with a
          flashlight, see nothing unusual.

                         AGENT JACKSON

                         (INTO RADIO)
          Looks like we're good here. Must
          have been another coyote.
          Just then, the Agents notice a section of the fence has been
          bent up from the ground, leaving a gap.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66.
          Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING
          illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a
          large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of
          the jeep. DeLancey looks over, notices.

                         AGENT DELANCEY
          Jackson?
          The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver
          across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson
          slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise a
          shotgun at Thor.
          Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of DeLancey's hands and
          thrusts the hilt back, smashing the Agent's jaw.
          Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker.

          75A INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY 75A

          Sitwell talks into his radio, starting to look worried.

                         SITWELL

                         (INTO RADIO)
          DeLancey, Jackson -- report.

          76 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - MOMENTS LATER 76

          Thor, now wearing a SHIELD rain slicker, makes his way across
          the base.
          Another SHIELD AGENT approaches the jeep, spots the
          unconscious DeLancey and Jackson. He quickly calls into his
          radio.

                         SHIELD AGENT
          Agents down! We've got a perimeter
          breach!

          77 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY 77

          The security monitors SQUELCH with static and interference.
          Sitwell holds his PDA -- even it's on the fritz. Sitwell and
          the Techie watch the monitors warily.
          On the monitor showing the hammer containment area, Mjolnir
          starts to crackle with energy.

                         SITWELL
          (to the Techie)
          Get Coulson.
          Sitwell punches an alarm.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66A.

          78 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 78

          As Thor makes his way towards the crater, an alarm sounds and
          SECURITY LIGHTS explode to life.

          78A EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 78A

          A spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the
          ridge towards Jane. She ducks down, out of sight.
          She pulls out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's
          recorded message.

          SELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE)
          You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
          Please leave me a message.
          His voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, urgently.

                         JANE
          Erik, okay, first of all, don't
          worry. I'm perfectly fine, really.
          More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          But if you don't hear from me
          again, you might want to come out
          to the crater site and look for me.
          I kind of did what you said I
          shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye.
          She hangs up.

          79 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - COMMAND TRAILER 79

          Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches
          across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the
          lit up site uneasily.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67.

          80 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 80

          A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From
          the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him.
          As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly
          rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the
          ground.
          Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the
          fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As
          more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes
          cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by.
          Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main
          entrance tube to the center of the site.
          A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to
          see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight
          right on him.
          Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver
          raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.
          He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and
          catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then
          hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing
          the ATV's spotlight.
          Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off
          the wheel to protect himself.
          The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube
          entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it.
          Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning
          the site entrance.

          80A EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 80A

          The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches
          the crater lip.
          The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads
          straight for one of the plastic tunnels. The Technicians
          inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the
          tunnel, sending sparks everywhere.
          The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around
          it and the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help.

          81 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 81

           Jane peers over the ridge, stares down at the frenzied
           aftermath of the ATV crash, at the base on high alert.
           Lightning CRACKS in the sky behind her.

                         82 OMITTED 82

          82A OMITTED 82A

          82B EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 82B

          Coulson climbs to the lip of the crater as a light rain
          begins to fall. He eyes the damage of the ATV crash.
          He's not pleased. The light rain becomes a downpour.

          82C EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE TUBE 82C

          As SHIELD Agents pull the ATV driver from the wreckage, Thor
          races towards the unguarded entrance to the tunnels and heads
          inside.

          82D INT. ENTRANCE TUBE 82D

          Thor races up the entrance ramp. Before him, two GUARDS
          round the corner.
          Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second. He
          hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder
          ahead. Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling
          backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him.
          Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase.
          Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through
          the translucent walls of the tunnels. He hurries through to
          tunnels to find a way towards it.

          82E EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 82E

          Coulson stands on the crater lip, barking out orders, as the
          Guards in the tunnel rush to cut off Thor.
          Coulson activates his radio.

                         COULSON
          I want eyes up high. With a gun.
          Now!

          A SNIPER, dressed in black tactical gear and high-tech
          NIGHTVISION EQUIPMENT, picks up a rifle, slings it over his
          shoulder and heads out.
          His name is BARTON.

          Lightning CRACKLES around the camp.

          Barton approaches a CRANE BUCKET. He leaps in, and the
          bucket lifts into the air.

          82F EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - TUNNEL 82F

          Through the translucent plastic, we see Thor racing through
          the tubing.

          82G INT. TUNNEL 82G

          As Thor races through the tunnel, a GUARD runs right at him,
          on a collision course. Thor takes him out with a punch to
          the gut, then turns to see more AGENTS coming towards him.
          Thor picks up the fallen Guard he punched, then throws him
          into the approaching Agents, scattering them.
          Thor turns around, runs back the way he came. The Agents
          give chase.

          82H EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 82H

           Jane looks down at the crater through binoculars, frustrated
           that she can't clearly see what's happening.

          82I EXT. CRATER 82I

           Coulson watches the commotion in the tunnel complex. He
           heads off for the command trailer to enter the tunnels.

          The crane basket ascends into the high winds as Barton
          readies his sniper rifle.

          82L EXT. TUNNEL COMPLEX 82L

          We see the figure of Thor inside the complex, heading down a
          ladder from a junction box, with other figures converging on
          him.
          82L.a INT. COMMAND TRAILER TUNNEL ENTRANCE 82L.a
          Coulson enters the tunnels through the command trailer. He
          calls on his radio.

                         COULSON
          Barton. Talk to me.

          83 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - CRANE SITE 83

          The crane holding Barton arcs out over the structure. Barton
          takes aim.

                         BARTON

                         (INTO RADIO)
          One shot, one kill, sir. Just give
          the word.

          BARTON'S NIGHTVISION POV
          Overlooking the complex. It's a clear field of vision,
          nowhere to hide. A digital read-out gives information on the
          distance to the target. He locks in on Thor, who's inside
          the plastic tubing, emerging from the junction box and
          heading towards the cube structure.

          BARTON (CONT'D)
          Hello, handsome.

          83A INT. TUNNEL 83A

          Thor races through the tunnel, comes across a wall of AGENTS.
          Thor ROARS and barrels through them -- elbowing, punching --
          whatever it takes to keep moving.
          As he takes down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction
          box and the entrance to the cube structure up ahead.
          He races towards it. He can actually see Mjolnir within the
          middle of the structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a
          fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw, sending him
          reeling. Dazed, Thor looks up to see --

          A HUGE SHIELD AGENT
          The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer
          in the cube structure beyond. Thor sizes him up.

                         THOR
           You're big.
          Thor grins.

           THOR (CONT'D)
           Fought bigger.

          83B EXT. JUNCTION BOX 83B

          Thor and the Huge Agent explode through the wall of the
          junction box, then crash into the mud, sending them sliding.

          83C EXT. CRANE BUCKET 83C

          Barton has Thor in his sites. The sniper stands still as a
          statue.

          83D INT. TUNNEL 83D

          Coulson hurries through the tunnel, ready to give the word to
          Barton, when he stops short. He sees what looks like an
          electrical storm erupting inside the structure ahead,
          directly above the crater... and the hammer.

          83E EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER 83E

          Jane sees SHIELD Agents and Guards swarming into the cube
          containment structure.

                         JANE
          No...

          84 EXT. CRATER 84

          Thor and the Huge Agent struggle to stand in the mud.
          Through the translucent walls of the cube structure, Thor
          sees Mjolnir. The Huge Agent rises up before him, blocking
          his view.
          Rain and blood run down Thor's face. He lunges forward,
          whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing
          the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down hard as
          Thor's momentum carries him past.
          Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge
          Guard grabs his ankle in a last effort. Thor looks back down
          at his foe, then drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into
          the fallen Agent's chest. The Huge Agent grimaces in pain,
          defeated.
          Thor races back towards the structure.

          84H INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84H

          From outside, Thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of the
          structure.
          He stands there -- soaking, bleeding, caked with wet earth.
          His hammer rests just a few yards before him, energy surging
          around it.
          Coulson steps into the structure through an access tunnel,
          one story up.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 68B.
          As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow
          brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface. The
          crackling energy seems to reach out to him. Coulson notices,
          his interest piqued.
          Above the open ceiling of the structure, Barton's crane
          bucket comes into view.

          84I EXT. CRANE BUCKET 84I

          Wind and rain whip around Barton as he stares into his rifle
          site, locked on the back of Thor's head -- his finger on the
          trigger.

          84J INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84J

          Thor stands next to the hammer, feels its power. He reaches
          out to it confidently.
          Coulson watches from above. Armed AGENTS approach behind
          him. He motions for them to hold their positions, then
          radios Barton.

                         COULSON
          Barton...

          84K EXT. CRANE BUCKET 84K

          Barton stands ready to take Thor down. His finger starts to
          squeeze the trigger.

          COULSON (V.O., ON RADIO)
          ...hold your fire.
          Barton releases the trigger, pulls up.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 69.

          84L INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84L

          Coulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand
          around the hammer. He smiles, triumphant, lifts... but the
          hammer doesn't move.
          Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail
          -- anger and frustration overtaking him. He strains with all
          his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm
          and lightning above him.
          Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing
          RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them.
          But, still, the hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his
          knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing
          runes fade away. He's failed. Unworthy.
          Coulson looks on, disappointed.
          SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him.
          Coulson activates his radio.

                         COULSON
          Ground units, move in. Show's
          over.
          As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or
          care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the
          rain -- a man broken, lost.
          From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment
          room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue
          to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive
          damage Thor's done to it during the melee.

          86 EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 86

          Jane lowers her binoculars, sensing things have gone from bad
          to worse.
          She steels herself, then starts over the ridge to help him.
          Almost immediately, a SPOTLIGHT sweeps past her. She hears
          the sound of DOGS and SHIELD AGENTS approaching, sees the
          glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her.
          With no other choice, she makes a quick retreat.

          88 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 88

          Jane stands with Selvig and Darcy in the empty lab.
          Darcy picks up the book Selvig checked out of the library,
          looks through it.

                         JANE
          I can't just leave him there.

                          JANE
          You didn't see what happened.
          Darcy points at an illustration of Thor's hammer in the book.

                         DARCY
          Hey! Myeu-muh!
          Jane looks at the illustration in the book, turns to Selvig
          knowingly.

                         JANE

                         (RE: BOOK)
          Where did you find this?
          Selvig grabs the book from them, quickly closes it.

                         SELVIG
          In the children's section. I
          wanted to show you how ridiculous
          his story was.
          Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe.

                         JANE
          Aren't you the one who's always
          told me to chase down all leads,
          all possibilities?

                         SELVIG
          I was talking about science, not
          magic!

                         JANE
          Magic's just science we don't
          understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.

                         SELVIG
          Who wrote science fiction.

                         JANE
          The precursor of science fact.

                         SELVIG
          In some cases.

                         JANE
          If that's really an Einstein-Rosen
          Bridge out there, then there's
          something on the other side.

          A primitive culture like the
          Vikings might have worshipped them
          as deities.
          They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly
          insightful input. Darcy shrugs. Jane points at her,
          grateful for the support.

                         JANE
          Yes! Exactly! Thank you!
          Darcy beams.

          yourself in a situation that I
          won't be able to get you out of
          this time.

                         DARCY
          I'll help you.
          Jane looks grateful. Selvig looks at her, sees there's no
          stopping her. He sighs.

          89 INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 89

          Thor sits in a chair, staring forward blankly, hands cuffed
          behind him. Coulson stands across from him.

                         COULSON
          It's not easy to do what you did.
          You made us all look like a bunch
          of mall cops. That's hurtful.

                         (THEN)
          The men you so easily subdued are
          highly-trained professionals, and
          in my experience, it takes someone
          who's received similar training to
          do what you did to them. Would you
          like to tell me where you received
          your training?
          Thor sits silently.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?
          Then again, you strike me more as
          the soldier of fortune type. What
          was it, South Africa?
          Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Certain groups pay well for a good
          mercenary. Especially HYDRA.
          Coulson waits for a response, but gets none.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Who are you?

                         COULSON
          One way or another, we find out
          what we want to know. We're good
          at that.
          Coulson leaves the room. Thor lowers his head.

          LOKI (O.S.)
          I thought he'd never leave.
          Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed
          in 21st century attire.

                         THOR
          Loki? What are you doing here?

                         LOKI
          I had to see you.

                         THOR
          What's happened? Tell me! Is it
          Jotunheim? Let me explain to

                         FATHER--

                         LOKI
          Father is dead.
          Thor stares at him, stunned.

                         THOR
          What?

                         LOKI
          Your banishment, the threat of a
          new war, it was too much for him to
          bear.
          The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's
          responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him,
          looks in his eyes, consolingly.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          You mustn't blame yourself. I know
          that you loved him. I tried to
          tell him so, but he wouldn't
          listen.

          It was cruel to put the hammer
          within your reach, knowing you
          could never lift it.
          Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          The burden of the throne has fallen
          to me now.

                         THOR
          Can I come home?

                         LOKI
          The truce with Jotunheim is
          conditional upon your exile.

                         THOR
          But couldn't we find a way to--

                         LOKI
          Mother has forbidden your return.
          Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          This is goodbye, brother. I'm so
          sorry.

                         THOR
          No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you
          for coming here.

                         LOKI
          Nothing could have stopped me.
          Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Fare well, brother.

                         THOR
          Good-bye.

                         COULSON
          Good-bye? I just got back.
          Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Now. Where did we leave off?

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 73A.

          90 EXT. CRATER - NIGHT 90

          Agents and Scientists work to repair the damaged area around
          Mjolnir. They take no notice of Loki as he steps up beside
          the hammer. He stares at it -- intrigued, wondering. Can he
          do it?
          He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't. He lets it
          go, eyes it with contempt, then steps away.
          He gestures with his arms. An odd GREEN AND GOLD LIGHT rises
          from the ground, enveloping him, then he disappears.

          91 INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 91

          Sitwell enters and speaks sotto to Coulson.

                         SITWELL

                         (RE: THOR)
          Sir... he's got a visitor.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74.

          92 INT. SECURITY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 92

          Coulson and several other SHIELD AGENTS stand across from
          Erik Selvig.

                         COULSON
          "Donald Blake?"�

                         SELVIG
          Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of
          our team.

                         COULSON
          You have dangerous coworkers, Dr.
          Selvig.

                         SELVIG
          Troubled, not dangerous. He was
          distraught when he found out that
          you'd taken all of our research.
          It was years of his life, gone! He
          got depressed, started drinking,
          and... well, you know the rest.

                         COULSON
          Uh-huh. You mind if we take a
          moment to verify his identity?

                         SELVIG
          Certainly.
          The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          You can understand how a man could
          go off like that. I mean, a big,
          faceless organization like yours,
          coming in with their jack-booted
          thugs and stealing private
          property...

                         (THEN)
          ...is how he described it.

                         COULSON
          That doesn't explain how he managed
          to tear through our security.
          Selvig shrugs.

                         SELVIG
          Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness
          nut.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A.
          On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New
          York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE"�. The license photo
          is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her
          cellphone.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75.
          The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD
          SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS."� Coulson eyes the screen.
          After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.

                         COULSON
          It says here he's an M.D.

                         SELVIG
          He is. That is, he was. He
          switched careers and became a
          physicist. He's quite brilliant,
          really.

                         (THEN)
          If you would just release him to
          me, I promise to keep an eye on
          him.
          Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to
          an AGENT nearby.

                         COULSON
          Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig
          here.
          The Techie looks to him, surprised.

          COULSON (CONT'D)

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Make sure he stays in town for the
          next few days in case we need to
          talk to him again.
          Selvig shakes his hand.

                         SELVIG
          Thank you.

          92A INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 92A

          Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a
          seated Thor.

                         SELVIG
          Donny, Donny, Donny! There you
          are!
          Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig
          pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)
          It's going to be all right, my
          friend. Come on, I'm taking you
          home.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75A.
          He leads the bewildered Thor out the door.

          92B EXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 92B

          As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security
          Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the
          Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand-
          written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes
          it from the pile and pockets it.

          92C INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 92C

          Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV
          record. A security warning over the image clearly reads
          "SECURITY ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA."� He knows it's been a ruse
          all along.
          He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security
          Room, then follows them outside.

          93 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 93

          Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with Thor
          away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig.

                         COULSON
          Just keep him away from the bars.

                         SELVIG
          I will!

                         THOR

                         (TO SELVIG)
          Where are we going?
          Selvig drops his cool demeanor.

                         SELVIG
          To get a drink.
          Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV.
          As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents --
          GARRETT and CALE.

                         COULSON
          Follow them.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76.

          94 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 94

          Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy
          surface of the planet.

          95 INT. LAUFEY'S TEMPLE - DAY 95

          Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of
          light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling.
          Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides.
          Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.

                         LAUFEY
          Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

                         LOKI
          I've come alone and unarmed.

                         LAUFEY
          To what end?

                         LOKI
          To make you another proposition.

                         LAUFEY

                         (REALIZING)
          So you're the one who let us into
          Asgard.

                         LOKI
          You're welcome.

                         LAUFEY
          My men are dead, and I have no
          Casket. You are a deceiver.
          Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki
          calmly stands his ground.

                         LOKI
          You have no idea what I am.
          The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the
          guards stare in shock. Loki grins.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Hello, Father.
          Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal.
          Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76A.

                         LAUFEY
          Ah, the bastard son. I thought
          Odin had killed you. That's what I
          would have done. He's as weak as
          you are.

                         LOKI
          No longer weak. I now rule Asgard,
          until Odin awakens. Perhaps you
          should not have so carelessly
          abandoned me.
          This gives Laufey pause.

                         LAUFEY
          Or perhaps it was the wisest choice
          I've ever made. I will hear you.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 77.

                         LOKI
          I will conceal you and a handful of
          your soldiers, lead you into his
          chambers, and let you slay him
          where he lies. I'll keep the
          throne, and you will have the
          Casket.
          Laufey studies Loki's face.

                         LAUFEY
          Why would you do this?

                         LOKI
          When all is done, we will have a
          permanent peace between our two
          worlds. Then I, the bastard son,
          will have accomplished what Odin
          and Thor never could.

                         LAUFEY
          This is a great day for Jotunheim.
          Asgard is finally ours.

                         LOKI
          No. Asgard is mine. The rest of
          the Nine Realms will be yours, if
          you do as you're told.
          Laufey considers the proposition.

                         LAUFEY
          I accept.
          Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a
          smile crosses his face.

          96 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 96

          Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from
          his controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.

                         LOKI
          What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78.

                         HEIMDALL
          I turned my gaze upon you in
          Jotunheim, but could neither see
          nor hear you. You were shrouded
          from me, like the Frost Giants who
          entered this Realm.

                         LOKI
          Perhaps your senses have weakened
          after your many years of service.

                         HEIMDALL
          Or perhaps someone has found a way
          to hide that which he does not wish
          me to see.
          Loki sizes him up, smiles.

                         LOKI
          You have great power, Heimdall.
          Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?

                         HEIMDALL
          No.

                         LOKI
          And why is that?

                         HEIMDALL
          Because he is my King, and I am
          sworn to obey him.

                         LOKI
          Exactly. Just as you're sworn to
          obey me now. Yes?
          A beat.

                         HEIMDALL
          Yes.

                         LOKI
          Good. Then you will open the
          Bifrost to no one until I have
          undone what my brother has started.
          Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after
          him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78A.

          97 INT. BAR - NIGHT 97

          Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive.
          The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots
          of whiskey. Selvig pours the shot into his mug and downs it.
          Thor follows his example.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 79.

                         SELVIG
          Seems Darcy's a terrible intern,
          but a talented hacker.

                         THOR
          Thank you for what you've done.

                         SELVIG
          Don't thank me. I only did it for 
          Jane.

                         THOR
          Are you in love with her?

                         SELVIG
          Of course not! Jane's like a
          daughter to me. Her father and I
          taught at University together. A
          good man, but he never listened.
          This registers with Thor.

                         THOR
          Neither did I.
          Selvig eyes him with interest.

                         SELVIG
          I don't know if you're really 
          delusional, and I really don't care 
          at this point. I just care about 
          her. I've seen the way she looks
          at you.

                         THOR
          I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

                         SELVIG
          Good. If that's the case, then
          I'll buy you one more drink, and 
          you'll leave town tonight. 
          A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80.

                         THOR
          I had it all backwards. I had it
          all wrong.
          Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than
          he's seen before.

                         SELVIG
          It's not a bad thing, finding out
          that you don't have all the
          answers. That's when you start
          asking the right questions.
          Thor takes this in.

                         THOR
          For the first time in my life, I
          have no idea what I'm supposed to
          do. 

                         SELVIG
          Anyone who's ever going to find 
          their way in this world has to
          start by admitting they don't know
          where the hell they are.
          Thor nods.

          DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.)
          Hey, I know you, man... 
          An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor. He is one 
          of the Townies from Isabela's Diner who saw Thor earlier. He
          approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight. 

          DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          You were in the diner with that hot 
          girl.
          Thor doesn't like where this is going. 

          DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
          I wouldn't mind her doing a little
          research on me.
          He laughs. Thor is annoyed. 

                         THOR
          I have no quarrel with you. But 
          she's a lady. You should be more 
          respectful.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A.

                          DRUNK TOWNIE
           And you should shut the hell up, 
           princess.
           Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. 
           But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's 
          baiting. 

                          THOR 
           I will not fight him. 

                          DRUNK TOWNIE 
           Then it'll be easy to kick your 
           ass. 
           Selvig stands, steps between the two men.

                          SELVIG
           Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our 
           heads. 
          Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out.
          Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his
          glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81.

          SELVIG (CONT'D)

                         (TO THOR)
          Another drink?

          98 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98

          Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN
          FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance
          routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically
          in time with the song.

                         THOR/SELVIG

                         (SINGING)
          "The mood is good, our hearts are
          full, there's magic in the air. /
          It's all because we're here
          tonight, and haven't got a care. /
          So raise a glass, and toast to
          life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la-
          la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine
          indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a
          friend is fine indeed!"�
          Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap.
          Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a
          straight dead weight with a CLUNK.
          WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell,
          Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to
          walk up the street towards Jane's trailer.

          99 INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99

          The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn
          with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane
          lies on her bed, trying to read.
          She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to
          the door and opens it to find --

                         THOR
          Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his
          shoulder.

                         JANE
          Erik!

                         (TO THOR)
          Is he all right?

                         THOR
          He's fine. Not injured at all.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81A.
          As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway.
          Selvig GROANS.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Sorry, my friend.

                         JANE
          What happened?

                         THOR
          We drank. We fought. He made his
          ancestors proud.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82.

                         JANE
          Put him on the bed.
          Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a
          bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the
          way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig
          awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.

                         SELVIG
          I still don't believe you're the
          God of Thunder.

                         (THEN)
          But you ought to be.
          Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to
          sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him.
          Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by
          Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around.

                         THOR
          These are your chambers?
          Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up
          the mess around her.

                         JANE
          Well, it's more of a temporary
          living space, really. I don't
          usually have visitors in here.
          Actually, never...
          Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from
          him, puts it away.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          Can we go outside?

          100 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100

          Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He
          offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set
          up, a couple chairs, some blankets.

                         JANE
          I come up here sometimes when I
          can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to
          reconcile particle data. Or when
          Darcy's driving me crazy.

                         (THEN)
          I come up here a lot, now that I
          think about it.
          Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82A.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          I'm glad you're safe.

                         THOR
          You've been very kind. I've been
          far less grateful than you deserve.

                         JANE
          I also hit you with my car a couple
          times, so it kind of evens out.
          He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her

          NOTEBOOK.

          JANE (CONT'D)
          I don't believe it...
          She takes it from him, surprised and grateful.

                         THOR
          It was all I could get back. Not
          as much as I promised. I'm sorry.

                         JANE
          No, this is good. Thank you. This
          means I don't have to start from
          scratch...
          She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a
          harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.

                         THOR
          What's wrong?

                         JANE
          SHIELD, whatever they are. They're
          never going to let this research
          see the light of day.

                         THOR
          You must do this. You must finish
          what you've started.

                         JANE
          Why?

                         THOR
          Because you're right. It's taken
          so many generations for your people
          to get to this point. You're
          nearly there. You just need
          someone to show you how close you
          really are.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 83.
          Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page
          which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from
          the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one
          point to another in space.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Look -- your ancestors called it
          magic. You call it science. I
          come from a place where they're one
          and the same thing.
          We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil
          as she looks on, amazed and intrigued.

                         JANE
          What is it?

                         THOR
          This is how my father explained it
          to me...

                         (THEN)
          Your world is one of the Nine
          Realms of the Cosmos, linked to
          each other by the branches of
          Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now,
          you see it every day, without
          realizing. Images glimpsed through
          -- what did you call it?...
          (checks her notebook)
          ...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine
          Realms...
          They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is
          going to be a long night.

          101 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - LATER 101

          Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He
          stares up at the night sky.
          She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep. He
          looks down at her, beautiful in the moonlight, looks out at
          the town beyond her.

          102 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 102

          Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands
          nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously
          as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can
          stand it no more.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84.

                         FANDRAL
          Our dearest friend banished, Loki
          on the throne, Asgard on the brink
          of war, yet you manage to consume
          four wild boar, six pheasant, a
          side of beef, and two casks of ale.
          Shame on you! Don't you care?!
          Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg
          pulls his weapon, stopping him.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Do not mistake my appetite for
          apathy.

                         SIF
          Stop it, both of you! We all know
          what we have to do, we're just too
          damned afraid to do it!

                         HOGUN

                         (DECIDES)
          We must go. We must find Thor.
          Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the
          fire, carefully putting them into a POUCH at his side.

                         FANDRAL
          It's treason, Hogun.

                         VOLSTAGG
          To hell with treason, it's suicide.

                         (SUDDENLY NERVOUS)
          Now, shh! Heimdall may be
          watching! It's said he can hear--

                         FANDRAL
          Yes, yes, we know!

                         SIF
          Thor would do the same for us.
          An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.

                         EINHERJAR GUARD
          Heimdall demands your presence.
          Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale.

                         VOLSTAGG
          We're doomed.

          103 EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING 103

          Dawn breaks over the quiet town of Puente Antiguo.

          104 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - DAY 104

          Thor awakens, looks down to see Jane still sleeping, nuzzled
          against him. She opens her eyes, looks up at him and smiles.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 85.
          He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet.

          105 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 105

          Thor helps Jane down off a ladder. A groggy, hungover Selvig
          emerges from Jane's trailer. He sees Thor with Jane.
          Selvig eyes the two of them together, then:

                         SELVIG
          I need some coffee.
          The three head inside Smith Motors.

          FROM THE LIBRARY ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET
          SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a
          small audio surveillance device towards the lab.

          105A INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 105A

          Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee. Thor
          holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate. She
          scoops them out onto the plates. Thor takes them over to the
          table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy.

                         DARCY
          Thanks.

                         THOR
          You're very welcome.
          Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates.
          She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their
          breakfast, looking like a little family.

                         106 OMITTED 106

           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86.

          108 EXT. MAIN STREET 108

          On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents Garrett
          and Cale continue their surveillance, bored out of their
          wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab window
          with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-link,
          turns to Cale.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          They want an update.

                         AGENT CALE
          Tell them he's eating eggs.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          Scrambled or fried?
          Cale glares at him.

                         AGENT CALE

                         (INTO COMM-LINK)
          Target is eating eggs, sir.
          We'll keep you posted.

          108AA INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 108AA

          As the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in his
          hand, gets an idea.

                         THOR

                         (RE: MUG)
          May I have this?

                         DARCY
          Sure.

                         THOR
          Thank you. Excuse me a moment.
          Thor leaves.

          108A EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 108A

          In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day.
          (Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop
          tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch.
          She looks up to see Thor approaching. She eyes him
          suspiciously. He offers her a MUG.

                         THOR
          To replace the one I broke. Please
          forgive my behavior.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86A.
          She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.

                         ISABEL
          Okay. Thank you.

                         THOR
          If I may, I'd like to come back for
          more of your "coffee."�

                         ISABEL
          Any time.
          He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and
          shrugs.

          ISABEL (CONT'D)
          She could do worse.

          109 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 109

          Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the
          intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's
          controls. He glares at them accusingly.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Good Heimdall, less us explain--

                         HEIMDALL
          You would defy the commands of Loki
          our King, break every oath you have
          taken as warriors, and commit
          treason to bring Thor back?
          The four exchange nervous glances.

                         SIF
          Yes, but--

                         HEIMDALL
          Good.
          The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?

                         VOLSTAGG
          So you'll help us?

                         HEIMDALL
          I am bound by honor to our King. I
          cannot open the Bifrost to you.
          With that, Heimdall leaves them alone in the Observatory.
          The others exchange puzzled looks.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 86B.

                         FANDRAL
          Complicated fellow, isn't he?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Now what do we do?
          Sif glances at the control panel, notices something.

                         SIF
          Look!
          The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the
          control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally.
          Sif hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.

          110 INT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - SECURITY ROOM - DAY 110

          Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite
          footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor.

                         COULSON
          What the hell was that?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 87.

                         TECHIE
          I don't know, sir. We got massive
          energy readings out of nowhere,
          then they just disappeared.
          Fifteen miles due northwest.

                         COULSON
          Let's go take a look.

          111 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111

          Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and
          Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They
          clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the
          hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes
          cover the desert sand around them.

                         VOLSTAGG
          He must have landed nearby. It's
          time to put our tracking skills to
          work. Spread out. Check the sand
          for indentations of his boot
          prints.

                         FANDRAL
          The winds would have blown them
          away by now. We should look for
          signs of a campfire.

                         SIF
          Or we could just start there.
          She points behind them to the town of Puente Antiguo in the
          distance -- the only visible sign of civilization -- and to
          Hogun, who has already started walking towards it. Volstagg
          and Fandral trade looks, their egos bruised.

                         FANDRAL
          It's worth a look, I suppose.
          The party tromps towards the town.

          112 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 112

           Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as
           they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor.

          113 EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY 113

           A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He
           runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side 
           of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth 
           dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car 
           up with one hand. 

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 88.
           Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He 
           hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair. 

                          VOLSTAGG 
           There you go, lad!
           The boy just stares, standing frozen. The Asgardians head 
          off.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Is it just me, or does Earth look a
          little different to you?

                         SIF
          It has been a thousand years...

                         VOLSTAGG
          Things change so fast here. You
          leave for a millennium, and it's
          like the whole neighborhood's gone.
          Volstagg sniffs, smells something.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Perhaps we should split up.

          114 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO - ROOFTOP - DAY 114


                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 89.
          Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking
          down the street.

                         AGENT GARRETT
          Is there a Renaissance Faire in
          town?

                         AGENT CALE
          Call it in.
          But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes
          their heads together. They're out.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Never cared for spies.
          He starts to go, then sees their bag of fast food on the
          ground. Intrigued, he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a
          bite. He likes what he tastes.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Exquisite.

          115 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 115

          Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an
          Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath.

                         EINHERJAR GUARD
          My liege, the Warriors Three and
          the Lady Sif have gone missing.
          Loki reacts. He knows who's responsible.

          116 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 116

          Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.

                         HEIMDALL
          Tell me, Loki, how did you get the
          Jotuns into Asgard?

                         LOKI
          You think the Bifrost is the only
          way in and out of the Realm? There
          are secret paths between worlds to
          which even you with all your gifts
          are blind. But I have need of them
          no longer, now that I am King.

                         (THEN)
          And I say, for your act of treason,
          you are relieved of your duties as
          Gatekeeper. And you are no longer
          a citizen of Asgard.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90.

                         HEIMDALL
          Then I need no longer obey you.
          Heimdall raises his massive sword, strides towards Loki.
          Loki reaches out and, with both hands, takes hold of
          something invisible, hovering in mid-air before him. As it
          quickly fades into view, we realize what it is --

          THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS.
          The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki
          opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching.
          From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of
          the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but
          SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight
          towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but
          still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried.
          Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his
          massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen,
          just inches from Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of
          relief and steps past him.

          117 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 117

          Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel and
          opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER
          appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns
          its head toward its King.

                         LOKI
          Ensure my brother does not return.

          118 INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 118

           Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying
           up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates and
          utensils away.
          The door opens.

           VOLSTAGG (O.S.)
           Found you!
          Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --

          SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE
          Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying
          dishes in mortal clothing.
          Jane drops a plate. It goes SHATTERING on the floor.

                         THOR
          My friends!
          Thor happily races over and greets his comrades.
          Jane, Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the
          room. Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with
          wonder.

                         SELVIG
          I don't believe it...

                         DARCY
          Who are they?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.
          Surely you've heard tales of Hogun
          the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and
          I, Volstagg the Svelte?
          Selvig looks pointedly at Volstagg's massive gut.

          VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
          Well, perhaps I've put on a little
          more muscle since I was here last.

                         JANE 
          That would have been a thousand 
          years ago? Northern Europe? 

                         VOLSTAGG 
          Exactly! Those lovely herring 
          people. They worshipped us! 
          Thor grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's shoulder.

                         THOR
          My friends, I've never been happier 
          to see anyone. But you should not
          have come.

                         FANDRAL
          We're here to take you home.
          Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving.

                         THOR
          You know I can't. My father is 
          dead because of me. I must remain
          in exile.
          The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.

                         SIF
          Thor... your father still lives.
          Thor reacts to the revelation.

          119 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 119

          A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few
          SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings.
          Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an
          Agent.

          Get somebody from Linguistics out
          here.
          Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost
          storm ROARS in the sky above.
          Coulson and the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, their
          vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as the Bifrost storm grows in
          strength. Finally, the hole in the sky overhead opens, and
          the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of it, touching down onto the
          desert floor.
          Coulson and the Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.

          120 OMITTED MERGED WITH SCENE 119 120

          121 INT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 121

          Thor and the others see the Bifrost storm forming in the
          distance.

                         DARCY
          Was somebody else coming?
          Just then, the Bifrost funnel EXPLODES down to the ground.

          122 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 122

          From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at
          the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it
          moves towards them.

                         SHIELD AGENT

                         (RE: DESTROYER)
          Is that one of Stark's?

                         COULSON
          I don't think so. But the guy
          doesn't tell me anything.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 93.
          Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the
          Destroyer.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Hello! You're using unregistered
          weapons technology. Please
          identify yourself.
          We hear the HUM of the Destroyer's fiery energy power up
          inside.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          Incoming!
          As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy
          from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return
          fire.

          123 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 123

          Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in
          the distance. Thor and the Asgardians prepare for battle, as
          Thor turns to Jane.

                         THOR
          Leave this town now. Get yourself
          and your friends to safety.

                         JANE
          What about you?

                         THOR
          I must stay and fight.
          The Asgardians look to Thor.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          I'm still a warrior, and I will
          fight by your side.

                         VOLSTAGG
          You're but a mortal now. You'll
          get yourself killed!

          you.

                         SIF
          The best thing you can do is get
          the mortals to safety and leave the
          battle to us.
          Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to the
          oncoming threat.

                         THOR

                         (TO SIF)
          You're right.
          Sif looks surprised. Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Help me clear the streets. I'll
          let none of these people die this
          day.
          Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of
          Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif head
          across town, towards the Destroyer.

          125 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 125

          Laufey and two Frost Giants appear out of the Bifrost and
          step onto the platform. Loki is waiting for them. He pulls
          Gungnir from the Observatory's control panel. The giant
          apparatus slows to a stop.

                         LOKI
          Father. Welcome to Asgard.

          125A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 125A

          The site looks like the aftermath of a war zone. The
          smoldering wreckage of SHIELD vehicles lies strewn about.

          126 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 126

          Thor, Jane, and Selvig clear the streets, loading confused
          TOWNSFOLK into cars, moving others indoors.

          127 EXT. MAIN STREET - EDGE OF TOWN - DAY 127

          A dog makes it way down the street, barking at something in
          front of it. Then we see it --

                         THE DESTROYER
          Strides down the street, a red, fiery energy glowing from
          within it.
          It unleashes BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting
          storefronts aflame.

                         128 OMITTED 128

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96.

          129 EXT. STREET 129

          Sif and the Warriors Three head down the street towards the
          Destroyer.

                         SIF
          Keep him distracted.
          She hurries off. The Warriors Three continue towards the
          behemoth.

                         FANDRAL
          What do you think? "The
          Svartalfheim Twist?"� "Kiss of the
          Hag?"� "Face Full of Boot?"�
          Volstagg grins eagerly.

                         VOLSTAGG
          "The Flying Mountain."�
          Hogun and Fandral groan.

                         FANDRAL
          Not "The Flying Mountain!"� It
          threw out my back for a year last
          time!

                         VOLSTAGG
          Trust me, it'll work.

          130 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 130

          Thor looks anxiously back down the street, where the Warriors
          Three get into position before the Destroyer.

                         THOR

                         (TO JANE)
          My friends fight bravely, but they
          won't be able to hold it back much
          longer.
          Darcy hurries out of the burning pet store carrying as many
          animals in cages as she can, then loads them into a truck.

          DOWN THE STREET
          Hogun and Fandral take off running towards the Destroyer, as
          Volstagg stands limbering up.

                         FANDRAL

                         (TO VOLSTAGG)
          Come on!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96A.
          Volstagg takes off running at full speed.
          As he catches up to his comrades, Hogun and Fandral grab him
          on either side, and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the
          voluminous warrior into the air at the black metal behemoth.

                         VOLSTAGG
          For Asgaaaaard!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 97.
          The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg
          SMASHES into the creature. It looks like it might actually
          work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It
          lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs
          apologetically.
          The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun and Fandral,
          smashing into them, when --

                         SIF
          Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two-headed spear and
          plunges it deep into the back of the creature.
          The creature stands there motionless, the fire dimming in its
          faceplate, Sif standing atop its back. The Asgardians have a
          brief moment of hope.
          But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once
          again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation.
          Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180
          degrees to face its attackers.
          The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off
          of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer
          rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's
          staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.
          Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer
          unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying
          in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks
          free, landing in the middle of the street.

          131 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 131

          Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no
          time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction.
          A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane,
          and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when
          they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris,
          impaled by a twisted piece of iron.

                         JANE
          Erik!
          She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going
          into shock.

                         SELVIG

                         (TO JANE)
          Go! Leave me!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98.
          Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing
          stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break
          for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the
          pouch and races back.
          He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and
          useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.

                         THOR
          Come on... give me one!
          Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still
          intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over
          the end of the iron rod.

                         JANE
          What are you doing? What is that?
          As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it.
          Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the
          piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it
          reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound
          completely.
          Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still
          lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He
          reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed
          flesh.

                         SELVIG
          (to Jane, re: Thor)
          I'm really starting to like him.
          Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.

          132 EXT. DOWN THE STREET 132

          Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on
          the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.

                         THOR
          Go, while you can!

                         SIF
          But the others...

                         THOR
          You can't help them now. Your job
          is to survive.
          She struggles to sit up.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98A.

                         SIF
          No! I will die a warrior's death.
          Stories will be told of this day--
          He gently takes her shield from her.

                         THOR
          Live and tell those stories
          yourself.
          At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious,
          with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way
          towards them.
          Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to
          safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun
          and Fandral.

          THOR (CONT'D)

                         (RE: VOLSTAGG)
          Get him out of here!

                         FANDRAL
          No. We can still fight!

                         THOR
          But not win. Move Volstagg, or
          he'll die!
          Thor looks at them, grins.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Don't worry, my friends. I have a
          plan.
          The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and
          drag him away from the battlefield.
          After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then
          tosses Sif's shield aside.
          He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely
          defenseless.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Brother... for whatever I have done
          to wrong you, whatever I have done
          to lead you to do this, I am sorry.
          But these people have done nothing
          to you. They are innocents.
          He continues towards the Destroyer.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98B.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          Take my life, and know I will never
          return to Asgard.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 99.
          Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms.
          The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then
          swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK
          of breaking bones as Thor goes flying.
          Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith
          Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
          The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street,
          a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to
          Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.

                         SELVIG
          Jane, no!
          He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead,
          watching the scene --

          133 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME 133

          Odin lies in the Odinsleep.
          A single tear rolls down the Allfather's cheek.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 100.

          134 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 134

          Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The
          Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards
          him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to
          unleash its fiery blast.

          135 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 135

          Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear,
          burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the
          hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it
          vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up.
          Clouds form in the sky above.
          Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies
          straight up into the air like a rocket.

          136 EXT. MAIN STREET 136

          The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --

          KRAKAKABOOM!
          A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above,
          colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is
          massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust
          enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --

                         JANE
          Oh. My. God.

          THE MIGHTY THOR
          Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand --
          the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir
          down onto the ground.

          KRAKABOOM!
          Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings
          Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the
          Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder
          God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale
          force winds.
          Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The
          Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101.
          It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate,
          locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards
          straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.
          Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast,
          overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the
          Destroyer.
          Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.
          The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES
          within him, firing out of all his openings.
          Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous
          heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.
          Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its
          lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris
          pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the
          skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.
          Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him.
          A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.

                         COULSON
          Donald... I don't think you've been
          completely honest with me.

          137 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 137

          Thor, Jane, Darcy, Selvig and the other Asgardians stand in
          the desert with Thor, Coulson, and several SHIELD AGENTS.
          Darcy turns to Volstagg.

                         DARCY
          So, how can you speak our language?

                         VOLSTAGG
          Your language? Ha! Silly girl,
          you're speaking ours.
          Thor calls up to the sky.

                         THOR
          Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!

          138 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 138

          Heimdall stands frozen.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102.

          139 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 139

          Thor looks to the others with concern.

                         THOR
          He would open it if he could. I
          fear the worst.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Then we're trapped here forever.

                         FANDRAL
          Then I suppose we'd best start
          settling into our new lives.
          He looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.

          FANDRAL (CONT'D)
          Are all earth maidens as fair as
          you?
          Darcy enjoys the attention.

                         DARCY
          No.
          Thor shouts back up to the sky.

                         THOR
          Heimdall!

          140 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 140

          From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him.
          Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters
          all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With
          a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice.
          Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the
          Observatory.

          141 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 141

          The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD
          Agent's machine gun.

                         VOLSTAGG
          Primitive. Good enough for hunting
          small game, I suppose.
          Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor
          grins. The mortals look on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 102A.

                         FANDRAL
          Sorry, my love. These things
          happen.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 103.
          He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to
          Coulson.

                         THOR
          Know this, son of Coul. You and I,
          we fight for the same cause -- the
          protection of this world. From
          this day forward, count me as your
          ally.

                         (THEN)
          If you return the items you have
          stolen from Jane Foster.

                         COULSON
          Not stolen. Borrowed.
          Jane shoots him a look. Coulson quickly continues.

          COULSON (CONT'D)
          You'll get your equipment back.
          You're going to need it to continue
          your research... which, after
          today's events, SHIELD would like
          to fully sponsor. If that's all
          right with you.
          Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at
          him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see him
          again.

                         THOR
          Whatever fate lies before me, you
          are part of it.
          He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and
          the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.

          142 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 142

          The Asgardians emerge from the Bifrost to find Heimdall
          slumped over his controls.

                         THOR
          (to the others)
          Get him to the healing room! Leave
          my brother to me.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104.
          Thor bolts out the door.

          143 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 143

          Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears
          the SHOUTS of Guards outside, the sound of a battle. Frigga
          grabs a sword.
          A Frost Giant bursts in. She swings the sword around hard,
          cleaving into his shoulder. He swats her aside angrily.
          Laufey and the Brute Frost Giant enter.
          Laufey looks at Odin lying helpless on the bed.

          144 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 144

          Thor rides the winds over the Bridge, speeding towards the
          palace.

          145 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 145

          The Jotun king stands over the unconscious Odin, relishing
          the moment.
          He forms an ICE BLADE.

          146 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 146

          Thor races through the entrance to the palace.

          147 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 147

          Laufey stands before the sleeping Odin.

                         LAUFEY
          It's said you can still see and
          hear what transpires around you,
          even in this state. I hope it's
          true, so that you may know your
          death came by the hand of Laufey.
          He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --

          A BLAST OF ENERGY
          Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground,
          we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding
          Gungnir.

                         LOKI
          And your death came by the son of
          Odin.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104A.
          Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for
          Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall,
          taking him out.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 105.
          The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly,
          his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground,

                         REVEALING --

                         FRIGGA
          Standing behind him -- the sword stuck in his back. She
          looks to Loki, takes him in her arms.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          I swear to you, mother, they will
          pay for what they've done today. I
          will end the Jotun threat, now and
          forever!
          He looks to Odin.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          And I will make you proud.
          Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts
          in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey
          and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and
          respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.

                         FRIGGA
          Thor!
          She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed
          on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.

                         LOKI
          Found its way back to you, did it?

                         THOR
          No thanks to you.
          Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.

                         FRIGGA
          What?

                         THOR
          Why don't you tell her? How you
          sent the Destroyer to kill our
          friends? To kill me?
          Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.

                         LOKI
          It must have been enforcing
          Father's last command.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106.

                         THOR
          You're a talented liar, brother.
          Always have been.

                         LOKI

                         (SMILES)
          It's good to have you back.

                         (DEAD SERIOUS)
          Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to
          destroy Jotunheim.
          Loki suddenly raises Gungnir, FIRES it point-blank at Thor.
          Thor goes flying backwards, SMASHING through the chamber
          walls, into...

          148 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - CORRIDOR 148

          Thor flies from the blast through ANOTHER wall on the
          opposite side of the corridor, to...

          149 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 149

          Thor plummets from the palace and CRASHES into the reflecting
          pools below.

          150 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 150

          Loki speeds on horseback down the Rainbow Bridge, then
          quickly dismounts and enters the Observatory.

          151 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 151

          Loki operates the Observatory's controls. The massive turret
          spins, points.

          152 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 152

          Thor awakens to the sound of the Bifrost. He stands, sees
          the Observatory firing the Bifrost energy into space. He
          looks to where the Bifrost is aimed.

                         THOR
          Jotunheim...

          153 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 153

          Thor soars on the winds above the Rainbow Bridge, the Bifrost
          energy roaring through Bridge, feeding into the Observatory.
          He lands before the Observatory's huge doorway.

          154 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 154

          Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of the
          Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106A.
          He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in an
          enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it.

                         LOKI
          All these years, and no one's ever
          dared to use it as a weapon.
          Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through
          it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki
          fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor,
          blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the
          ice as Thor staggers to his feet.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          You can't stop it. The Bifrost
          will build until it rips Jotunheim
          apart.

                         THOR
          Why have you done this?

                         LOKI
          To do what Father never could. To
          destroy their kind forever. When
          he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of
          what I've done.

                         THOR
          He won't! You can't kill an entire
          race!

                         LOKI
          What is this newfound love for the
          Frost Giants? You, who would have
          killed them all with your bare
          hands.

                         THOR
          I've changed.

                         LOKI
          So have I.
          Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Fight me.
          He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his
          hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow,
          but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back
          towards the frozen controls.
          Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which
          immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended.

                         THOR
          Is the throne really worth what
          you've done? What you would
          become?

                         LOKI
          I never wanted the throne. I only
          wanted to be your equal. Now fight
          me!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108.
          With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground.
          Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.

                         THOR
          I will not fight you, brother.

                         LOKI
          I am not your brother. I never
          was.

                         THOR
          Loki, this is madness...
          Loki grins.

                         LOKI
          Is it?
          He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to
          his feet.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          What happened to you on earth that
          turned you so soft? Don't tell me
          it was a woman.
          Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          It was. Perhaps when we're
          finished here I'll pay her a little
          visit myself.
          That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and
          their weapons collide.
          The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and
          jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

          155 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 155

          It's mayhem. The growing Bifrost TEARS through the ice of
          the planet like a destructive wave, breaking it apart.
          JOTUNS go running in terror, others fall through the breaking
          ice.

          156 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 156

           Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the
           hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up around
          it.

                          SELVIG
          Jane?

          Something's wrong.

                         

                         

                         

                         
           4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 109.

          157 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 157

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending
          Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his
          hand.
          The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.
          Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it
          back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too
          powerful.
          Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides
          towards the Bifrost.

                         LOKI
          If you care so much for the Jotuns,
          then die with them.
          The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to
          drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he
          concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand
          towards the Bifrost.
          MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.
          The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another
          blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his
          brother.

          158 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 158

          Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and
          land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets
          to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.

                         LOKI
          Thor! Help me!
          Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking
          up at him desperately.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Please...
          Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his
          brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just
          then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls
          around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.
          Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls
          him across the bridge.

          Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind
          him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.
          It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next
          to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.
          Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,
          never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The
          Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.

                         LOKIS
          I was always more clever than you.

                         THOR
          Yet still not clever enough.
          With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,
          summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then
          channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the
          Lokis.
          All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real
          Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir
          knocked from his grasp.
          Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his
          back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps
          away.
          Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks
          confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop
          his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's
          pinned to the ground.
          Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing
          towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to
          do.
          Loki watches him smugly.

                         LOKI
          Look at you, the Mighty Thor.
          With all your strength, what good
          does it do you now?
          Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's
          happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,
          VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy
          feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.
          He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.
          Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The
          hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111.
          Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,
          thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he
          channels the power of the storm into it, then --
          He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is
          massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking
          the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears
          where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          Stop! What are you doing?!
          Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!
          The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream
          out from it. Loki thinks fast.

          LOKI (CONT'D)
          If you destroy the Bridge, you'll
          never see her again!
          Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor
          through the back.

                         THOR
          Forgive me.
          Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises
          Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all
          sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --
          KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING
          out of it.
          Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of
          the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the
          Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.
          The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.
          As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of
          Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall
          towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out
          from the broken Bridge.
          They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive
          force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized
          by the debris, when --

          A POWERFUL HAND
          Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir
          as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to

                         SEE --

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 112.

                         ODIN ALLFATHER
          Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the
          Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.
          Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of
          approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is
          disappointment and regret.
          Loki lets go.

          THOR (CONT'D)
          No!
          But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki
          falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries
          him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the
          Observatory, disappearing out of sight.
          Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back
          into his father's arms.

                         ODIN
          It is over.

          159 BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 159
          The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing
          in all directions.
          Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
          Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught. She knows the
          significance of what's just happened.

                         JANE
          It's gone.

          160 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 160

          A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three
          sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between
          Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting
          their battle with the Destroyer.

                         VOLSTAGG
          ...and then, with a mighty bellow,
          I flew at the great metal beast and
          laid it low...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113.

                         FANDRAL
          Is that another way of saying you
          fell on your huge a--

                         VOLSTAGG
          As a matter of fact, falling down
          was a tactic. Lulling the
          Destroyer into a false sense of
          security!

                         FANDRAL
          Well, I was the one who had to drag
          your enormous carcass off the
          battlefield. That makes me the
          real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?
          Hogun points to Volstagg.

                         HOGUN
          Big stomach.
          (points to Fandral)
          Big mouth.
          The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral
          look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a
          smile.

                         FANDRAL
          Well, how about that? A smile!
          I'd say that calls for another
          drink!
          They laugh and raise another round.
          Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the
          sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches
          Frigga, bows her head.

                         SIF
          My Queen. I am so sorry for your
          loss.
          Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.

                         FRIGGA
          Thank you, Sif.
          She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around
          him.

          FRIGGA (CONT'D)
          How is he?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.

                         SIF
          He mourns for his brother. And he
          misses her. The mortal.
          Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at
          Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.

                         FRIGGA
          He will need his friends now more
          than ever.

                         SIF
          I will always be at his side.
          Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.

          161 EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161

          Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin
          walks up behind him.

                         ODIN
          You'll be a wise King.

                         THOR
          There will never be a wiser king
          than you. Or a better father.

                         (THEN)
          I have much to learn. I know that
          now. But some day, perhaps, I will
          make you proud.

                         ODIN
          You've already made me proud.
          Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.

          162 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162

          Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost
          energy, drifting off into space.
          Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.
          Thor stares out at the stellar void.

                         THOR
          Can you see her?
          Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.

                         HEIMDALL
          Yes.

                         THOR
          How is she?

          163 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163

          Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged
          ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull
          away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly
          inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see
          that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research
          facility, abuzz with activity.
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-
          the-art equipment.
          Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the
          SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass
          windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the
          roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at
          hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE
          before her, which bears the "STARK INDUSTRIES"� logo.
          From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.

                         DARCY
          Here you go.

                         JANE
          Thanks.
          Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.

                         DARCY
          He would have come back if he
          could.

                         JANE
          I know. But if he can't get here
          on his own...
          Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D
          HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device,
          bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is --
          YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.

                         

                         

                         

                         
"

           JANE (CONT'D)
           ...maybe we can help him find his
           way back.
