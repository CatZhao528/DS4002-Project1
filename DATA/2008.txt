And a great mentor. A man who has
always been there for his friends
and his country. Ladies and

honored if I presented.
TONY
Okay, let’s do it.
Rhodey plops the ARES statue down on the felt.
TONY
That was quick. Thought there’d be
more of, you know, a ceremony.
Maybe a highlight reel -Tony shakes karma into the dice, rolls again. He craps out.

It belongs to my old man. They

She gives him a disarming smile. Tony waves at Security to

You’ve been described as a Da Vinci

CHRISTINE
I’m sorry, “Tony”, I was hoping for
a serious answer.
TONY
Here’s serious: my old man had a
philosophy: peace means having a
bigger stick than the other guy.
CHRISTINE
Good line, coming from the guy
selling the sticks.
TONY
My father helped defeat Hitler. He
was on the Manhattan Project. A
lot of people -- including your
professors at Brown -- might call
that being a hero.
CHRISTINE
Others might call it warprofiteering.
Tony has to smile, this gal is relentless.
TONY
Tell me: do you plan to report on
the millions we’ve saved by
advancing medical technology? Or
kept from starving with our intelicrops? All were breakthroughs
spawned from, that’s right,
military funding.

Tony’s suit is now comprised of a stabilizer belt, partiallychromed propulsion boots and the Mark II gauntlets.
Everything connected by tubing and wires -- he looks like a
crazy science experiment.
Tony fires up the boots, hovers. Then he fires the gloves to
stabilize. Weaving, tilting. He “surfs” mid-air, trying to
maintain balance, slowly getting the hang of it.
Then he ventures forward, moving along the expanse of the
lab. Dodging pieces of equipment, his car collection, a few
near misses -- but he maintains control. Debris and objects
are blown from tables from the propulsive force.
The joy of flight.
TONY
Nothing to it...
He cuts the propulsion and lands.

Yesterday. Good P.R. move, you

THE PHOTOS: victorious insurgents, the Ten Rings insignia on
their vehicles, clutch Stark machine guns, RPGs. Behind, a
town burns, bodies strewn.
A photo of civilians being marched in rows, pre-execution,

Is this like a tick for you?
Whenever you have a feeling, you
start going to all the people who
don’t trust you, who don’t protect
you. They’re going to put a spin
on everything you say.
TONY
Wait a minute. I got to ask you
something.
I’m dead serious about
this. I’m not kidding. Am I
losing my mind or is Pepper really
cute? Do you think she’s
attractive and interesting, or is
it just that her hair is down?
I’ve been out of the game for a
while.
OBADIAH
Are you out of your mind. You’re
messing with the “guys in the

I’m not worried about that right

TONY’S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

107

Tony, wearing a Mark III gauntlet, wired to his RT chestpiece, turns a screwdriver to adjust the power.
On the wall beside him -A flatscreen TV: live war footage, refugees huddled. The
bottom crawl reads, “BREAKING NEWS - TRAGEDY IN GULMIRA.”
TV REPORTER’S VOICE
-- the ten mile drive to the
outskirts of Gulmira can only be
described as a descent into Hell,
into a modern-day Heart of
Darkness. Simple farmers and
herders, from peaceful villages,
driven from their homes at the butt
of Western rifles and the turrets
of modern tanks. Displaced from
their lands by Warlords and
insurgent groups emboldened by
their newfound power -- a power
fueled by high-tech weapons easily
purchased with Poppy money on the
black market -- and further
destabilizing a fragile region
which for decades has been a
tinderbox of tribal feuding and
ethnic hatred -Tony aims the gauntlet at some light fixtures. Gives them an
RT blast. They spark and fall from the ceiling.
TV REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
The villagers have taken shelter in
whatever crude dwellings they can
find -- in the ruins of other razed
villages, in the cold barren
scrublands, or in the remnants of
an old Soviet smelting plant. Our
translator relayed to us one human
tragedy after another. A seven
year old boy, thin as a scarecrow,
clutching yellowed photographs and
holding them out to anyone who
would stop, with a child’s simple
question: where are my mother and
father? A woman, begging for news
of her husband, who’d been
kidnapped by insurgents -- either
forced to join their militia, or to
be shot without reason -(CONTINUED)

Blasts a window in the lab, shattering the glass and knocking
a painting off the wall.
TV REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
With no political will or
international pressure, there is
little hope for these newly-formed
refugees. Refugees who can only
wonder one thing: is the world
watching?
A final adjustment. Another RT blast -- this time Tony wipes
out the plasma TV screen.

statues as the pulse knocks out his power and electronics.
FROM UP HIGH: the EMP blast travels concentrically outwards,
rendering everything dark in its wake.
BACK TO:
The roof, as it sags down in the center.
Tony, dazed, looks at his heart-device.

It’s dead too.

The Dynamo, closest to the collapsed section of the roof,
topples over. Its dead fingers catch on a seam and it lies
precariously on the edge of the ‘slope’.
The Dynamo hatch opens, revealing Obadiah -OBADIAH’S POV: through the hole in the roof, the seething
plasma bubbling below.
Tony, using his own waning strength, tries to extend a dead
Iron Man hand to Obadiah.
TONY
Take my hand...

Now we see what Stane is attempting: to manually winch his
forearm rocket bay open so he can blast Tony.
But his movements unsettle the Dynamo suit and suddenly he
begins to slide.
OBADIAH
Goodbye, my boy...
TONY
This is just the beginning.
And now Obadiah shuts the hatch and tumbles away.

He --

Plunges down through the ARK’s silo -- splashes into the

Tony grabs an L.A. Times from the pile of papers in her arms,
glances at the headline: “WHO IS THE IRON MAN?” A grainy
newspaper photo of the iron battle at Stark Industries.

BURNING. Massive flames. A dark shape emerges- The BAT
SYMBOL. Growing. Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.
                                             CUT TO:
DAYLIGHT. Moving over the towers of downtown Gotham...
Closing in on an office building... On a large window...
Which SHATTERS to reveal-
INT. OFFICE, HIGH RISE -- DAY
A man in a CLOWN MASK holding a SMOKING SILENCED PISTOL
ejects a shell casing. This is DOPEY. He turns to a second
man, HAPPY, also in clown mask, who steps forward with a
CABLE LAUNCHER, aims at a lower roof across the street and
FIRES a cable across. Dopey secures the line to an I-beam
line- CLAMP on- sends a KIT BAG out then steps OUT the
window...
EXT. HIGH-RISE -- DAY
...into space. The men SLIDE across the DIZZYING DROP...
landing on the lower roof across the street.
EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- DAY
A MAN on the corner, back to us, holding a CLOWN MASK. An
SUV pulls up. The man gets in, puts on his mask. Inside the
car- two other men wearing CLOWN MASKS.
                      GRUMPY
            Three of a kind. Let's do this.
One of the Clowns looks up from loading his automatic weapon.
                         CHUCKLES
            That's it?     Three guys?
                      GRUMPY
            There's two on the roof. Every guy
            is an extra share. Five shares is
            plenty.
                      CHUCKLES
            Six shares. Don't forget the guy who
            planned the job.
                      GRUMPY
            Yeah? He thinks he can sit it out
            and still take a slice then I get why
            they call him the Joker.
Grumpy cocks his weapon. Bozo pulls the car over in front of
the GOTHAM FIRST NATIONAL BANK.
                                                            2.


EXT. ROOFTOP, BANK -- CONTINUOUS
Dopey PRIES open an access panel-
                    HAPPY
          Why do they call him the Joker?
                    DOPEY
          I heard he wears make-up.
                       HAPPY
          Make-up?
Dopey pulls out thick bundles of blue CAT 5 cables.
                      DOPEY
          Yeah.    To scare people.    War paint.
EXT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS
Grumpy, Chuckles and Bozo get out of the car and march into
the bank CARRYING ASSAULT RIFLES-
INT. BANK -- DAY
The Security Guard looks up- Grumpy FIRES into the ceiling.
Customers SCREAM. Chuckles CRACKS the Security Guard.
As Grumpy and Bozo round up the hostages, one of the TELLERS
presses a button mounted beneath her window- a SILENT ALARM.
EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY
Dopey watches the alarm PING his handheld.
                    DOPEY
          Here comes the silent alarm.
              (touches a button)
          And there it goes. That's funny.      It
          didn't dial out to 911- it was
          trying to reach a private number.
Behind him, Happy RAISES his silenced HANDGUN.
                    HAPPY
          Is it a problem?
                       DOPEY
          No, no.     I'm done here.
Happy SHOOTS. Dopey SLUMPS. Happy picks up his bag and
FORCES OPEN the roof access door...
INT. STAIRWELL, BANK -- DAY
...and speeds down the stairs, to the basement.      He SLAMS
open the door...
                                                         3.


INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY
...and comes face to face with a huge VAULT.
INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY
Bozo and Grumpy move down the line of hostages- Bozo hands
each Hostage OBJECTS from a bag. A GRENADE. Grumpy follows,
PULLING THE PINS.
                    GRUMPY
          Obviously, we don't want you doing
          anything with your hands other than
          holding on for dear life.
BLAM. Chuckles is BLOWN OFF HIS FEET- Grumpy and Bozo DIVE
for cover- the Bank Manager steps out of his office, SHOTGUN
in hand. Hostages SCRAMBLE, CLINGING their grenades...
INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY
Happy CLAMPS a DRILL to the vault- the bit SPINS- SLIDES into
the metal door- a BOLT of ELECTRICITY RIPS THROUGH THE DRILL,
THROWING HAPPY TO THE FLOOR-
INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY
Grumpy and Bozo cower as the Bank Manager FIRES again.
                    GRUMPY
          He's got three left?
Bozo raises TWO fingers. Grumpy squeezes off a SHOT. The
Bank Manager FIRES. FIRES again. Grumpy looks at Bozo, who
nods. Grumpy JUMPS UP.
The Bank Manager FIRES- Grumpy GRUNTS as buckshot CLIPS his
shoulder. FALLS. The Bank Manager moves in for the kill,
FUMBLING for new shells. Bozo STANDS- SHOOTS him.
Bozo picks up the shotgun. Grumpy checks his wound- it's
superficial. He struggles to his feet.
                    GRUMPY
          Where'd you learn to count?!
Bozo's mask stares him down. Grumpy heads for the stairs in
the back. Bozo starts loading fresh shells into the shotgun.
                    BANK MANAGER
          You have any idea who you're stealing
          from? You and your friends are dead.
Bozo looks down at him.   Says nothing.
                                                          4.


INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY
Happy at the vault door, barefoot, turning the tumblers with
hands stuffed into his SNEAKERS. Grumpy walks in.
                    HAPPY
          They wired this thing up with 5,000
          volts. What kind of bank does that?
                    GRUMPY
          A mob bank. Guess the Joker's as
          crazy as they say.
Happy shrugs.   Grips the WHEEL BOLT and SPINS it.
                    GRUMPY
          Where's the alarm guy?
                    HAPPY
          Boss told me when the guy was done I
          should take him out. One less share.
                     GRUMPY
          Funny, he told me something
          similar...
Happy FREEZES. The wheel SPINS to a STOP- the vault DOOR
CLUNKS OPEN- Happy GRABS for his weapon- SPINS to see Grumpy
SHOOT. Grumpy steps over Happy into the vault...
INT. VAULT, BANK -- DAY
...which is filled with an eight-foot MOUNTAIN OF CASH.
INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY
Grumpy walks into the lobby, straining under several DUFFELS
filled with cash. He DUMPS them. Looks at Bozo. LAUGHS.
                    GRUMPY
          C'mon, there's a lot to carry...
INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY
Bozo walks back into the lobby with two more DUFFELS.   Sets
them down on an ENORMOUS PILE. Grumpy looks at it.
                    GRUMPY
          If this guy was so smart he would
          have had us bring a bigger car.
Grumpy JABS his pistol in Bozo's back.   Takes his weapon.
                    GRUMPY
          I'm betting the Joker told you to
          kill me soon as we loaded the cash.
                                                            5.


                    BOZO
              (shakes head)
          No. I kill the bus driver.
                    GRUMPY
          Bus driver? What bus-
Bozo steps backwards. SMASH. Hostages SCREAM as the TAIL
END OF A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS ROCKETS through the front of the
bank, SLAMMING Grumpy into the teller's window.
Bozo picks up Grumpy's weapon. Another clown OPENS the rear
door of the bus. Bozo SHOOTS him. Then loads the bags onto
the bus. The wounded Bank Manager watches him. In the
distance: SIRENS.
                    BANK MANAGER
          Think you're smart, huh? Well, the
          guy who hired you's just do the same
          to you...
Bozo slowly shakes his head.
                    BANK MANAGER
          Sure he will. Criminals in this town
          used to believe in things...
Bozo turns back to the Bank Manager.   Crouches over him.
                    BANK MANAGER
          Honor. Respect. What do you
          believe, huh? What do you bel-
Joker slides a GRENADE into the man's mouth.   A PURPLE THREAD
is knotted around the pin.
                    THE JOKER
          I believe that what doesn't kill
          you...
Bozo PULLS off his MASK. The Bank Manager GASPS. In the
reflections of the glass DEBRIS behind the Bank Manager we
see GLIMPSES of a SCARRED MOUTH and CLOWN MAKEUP. THE JOKER.
                    THE JOKER
          ...simply makes you stranger.
The Bank Manager's eyes go wide. The Joker rises, strolls
towards the bus, the purple thread attached to the grenade
pin UNRAVELLING FROM THE PURPLE LINING of his jacket as he
walks. The Joker climbs into the bus, SHUTS the rear door,
TRAPPING THE PURPLE THREAD...
EXT. SCHOOL, GOTHAM -- DAY
Kids pour out, heading onto a long line of school buses.

INT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS
As the bus pulls out, the purple thread PULLS THE PIN-
hostages scream and scurry away from the Bank Manager, who
shakes with fear as, with a FIZZ, the grenade does not
explode, but SPEWS RED SMOKE.
EXT. BANK -- DAY
The School Bus pulls free of the Bank wall and pulls out onto
the street, SLIDING INTO THE LINE OF IDENTICAL BUSES HEADING
PAST THE BANK. The buses trundle past COP CARS racing up the
street... and we-

INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
DETECTIVE RAMIREZ, female, rookie detective, 30's, makes
coffee, watching a news show on the television.
ON SCREEN: The host, MIKE ENGEL, lays into the MAYOR.
                    ENGEL
          Mr Mayor, you were elected on a

          Yet, we hear rumors that instead of
          trying to arrest him the cops are
          using him to do their dirty work.
                    MAYOR
          I'm told our men in the Major Crimes
          Unit are close to an arrest.
                    RAMIREZ
          Hey, Wuertz- the Mayor says you're
          closing in on the Batman.
WUERTZ looks up, listless.      Crumples up a paper.
                    WUERTZ
          The investigation is ongoing.
He throws the paper at the trash. It rebounds off a board
headed 'BATMAN: SUSPECTS.' Lined with pictures: Abraham
Lincoln. Elvis. The Abominable Snowman.
EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT -- NIGHT
Ramirez comes out onto the roof. LIEUTENANT GORDON sits by a
SEARCHLIGHT. She hands Gordon a cup of coffee.
                    RAMIREZ
          Ever intending to see your wife
          again, Lieutenant?
                    GORDON
          I thought you had to go look after
          your mother, detective.
                    RAMIREZ
          They checked her back into hospital.
                       GORDON
          I'm sorry.
                    RAMIREZ
              (making light)
          Least there she's got someone round
          the clock. Unlike your wife.
              (looks at bat-signal)
          He hasn't shown?
Gordon gets up.   Looks into the sky at the bat-signal.
                    GORDON
          Often doesn't. But I like reminding
          everybody that he's out there.
                    RAMIREZ
          Why wouldn't he come?
                    GORDON
          Hopefully... Because he's busy.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- NIGHT
Two black SUV's pull onto the top floor. A large man emerges-
the CHECHEN. A BODYGUARD points at the sky. The Chechen
peers up at the BAT-SIGNAL. Shrugs.
                    CHECHEN
          That's why we bring dogs.
BODYGUARD 2 opens the back door- three enormous ROTWEILERS
emerge, GROWLING. The Chechen crouches, KISSING the dogs.
                    CHECHEN
          My little princes...
              (to bodyguards)
          The Batman's invisible to you
          fools... but my little princes...
          they can find human meat in complete
          darkness.
The Chechen moves to the second SUV, reaches in and DRAGS out
a skinny, wild-eyed JUNKIE by his hair.
                    JUNKIE
              (babbling)
          No! No get 'em off me!    Off me!
The Chechen drags the Junkie towards a battered white van.
The van's REAR DOORS OPEN... two armed THUGS emerge, carrying
BARRELS... a third hovers in the dark interior.
                     CHECHEN
          Look! Look what your drugs did to my
          customers!
                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Buyer beware...
The figure emerges: SCARECROW.   Wearing his mask.
                    SCARECROW
          I told your man my compound would
          take you places. I never said they'd
          be places you wanted to go.
                    CHECHEN
          My business is repeat customers.
                    SCARECROW
          If you don't like what I have to
          offer, buy from someone else.
          Assuming Batman left anyone else to
          buy from.
The Chechen frowns.   THE DOGS START BARKING.
                                                           9.


                     BODYGUARD
              (nervous)
          He's here.
A BURLY THUG at the periphery is suddenly SUCKED into the
darkness. In his place a shadow straightens, revealing
POINTED BAT-EARS against the glittering skyline.
                    CHECHEN
          Come on, sonofbitch- my dogs are
          hungry, pity there's only one of
          you...
A BODYGUARD to the side DISAPPEARS with a scream, and a
SECOND BAT-SHADOW appears.
The Chechen looks taken aback. Three more BAT-SHADOWS
appear... even the dogs stop growling.
BOOM! A hole appears in the SUV next to the Chechen. The
first bat-shadow steps into the light carrying a SHOTGUN.
CHAOS as men scatter and the rooftop erupts in GUNFIRE.    The
Chechen TURNS as he hears one of his men SCREAM.
                    CHECHEN (CONT’D)
          Loose the dogs!
A Bodyguard releases the DOGS- they RACE, SALIVATING, into
the darkness...
The Dogs RACE towards a Bat-Shadow- the first dog LEAPS, gets
its JAWS around the Bat-Shadow's throat...
Scarecrow ducks behind the van- holes PUNCHED in the side by
shotgun blasts right behind him. He starts to climb into the
driver's seat-
The muzzle of a shotgun is pressed to the back of his head- a
bat-shadow is behind him- he SPRAYS him with FEAR TOXIN- the
bat-shadow collapses to the ground, SCREAMING. The Cechnyan,
cowering from gunfire, looks down at him.
                    SCARECROW
          Not the real thing.
                    CHECHEN
          How you know?
                    SCARECROW
          We're old friends.
A HUGE BLACK SHAPE SLAMS down onto a row of parked cars.    The
BATMOBILE.
                    SCARECROW
          That's more like it.
                                                       10.


The Chechen's men BLAST away at the front of the car: the
bullets SPARK off its monstrous surface harmlessly...
INT. BATMOBILE -- CONTINUOUS
The cockpit is EMPTY. One of the screens reads "LOITER".
The shooting STOPS. The screen switches to "INTIMIDATE"
EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS
The men STARE at the Batmobile for a quiet moment... BOOM!
The Batmobile CANNONS blast cars all around the men-
A bat-shadow lines up his shotgun on a running bodyguard-
CLUNK- a BLACK GAUNTLET grasps the barrel and BENDS it
upwards with a HOWL of tortured steel- the bat-shadow looks
into the face of the Batman. The REAL BATMAN.
The Bat-shadow STUMBLES BACKWARDS in terror, leaving the bent
shotgun in Batman's hand. Batman OPENS his hand, revealing a
PNEUMATIC MANGLE hidden in his palm-
Batman bears down on the dogs mauling another bat-shadow-
DRAWS his GRAPPLING GUN and SHOOTS his grapple into the fake
Batman's leg and RIPS him from the dogs, one dog HANGING ON
as Batman pulls the unconscious man away... the Chechen RUNS
down the ramp towards the exit...
As Batman KICKS the dog off the fake Batman- the Chechen gets
into his SUV- another dog LOCKS ITS JAWS around Batman's
forearm, RIPPING, TEARING- Batman SWINGS THE DOG OVER HIS
HEAD- SMASHES it against the ground- its jaws OPEN...
Batman rises, an engine RACES behind him- he can't turn in
time- BLAM- he's SLAMMED sideways by the speeding van.
INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Scarecrow, driving, NODS at him and hits the gas... Batman
raises his hand, revealing his jointed mangle and pistons.
The mangle STRAIGHTENS and ROTATES from his palm to the knife
edge of his opened hand...
Batman CHOPS straight through the windshield- pulls his hand
out and CHOPS again- the mangle gets STUCK- Scarecrow steers
towards a column...
EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Batman can't free himself- he turns a dial on his forearm
piston- EXPLOSIVE BOLTS blow, freeing his gauntlet from the
mangle- he ROLLS free of the van as it SCRAPES the column and
barrels down the circular exit ramp.
Batman rises. A phony batman lying on the ground watches as
Batman climbs up to the edge of the ten-story corkscrew ramp
and stands there, waiting for something.
                                                          11.


After a moment he JUMPS... and falls... ten stories...
He's about to hit the exit ramp- the van appears- his cape
POPS OPEN- he SLAMS into the roof, CRUSHING the cab.
EXT. ROOFTOP, PARKING GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER
The Chechen's men are lined up against the wall, bound with
zip-ties. So are the fake batmen. Batman DUMPS Scarecrow
next to the three "Batmen", RIPS his mask off.
                    "BATMAN"
          We're trying to help you!
                    BATMAN
          I don't need help.
                    SCARECROW
          Not my diagnosis.
Batman silences Scarecrow with his boot.   Turns to "Batman"
                    BATMAN
          Don't let me find you out here again.
Batman moves towards the Batmobile.
                    "BATMAN"
          You need us! There's only one of you-
          it's war out here!
Batman gets into the Batmobile.
                    "BATMAN"
          What gives you the right?! What's
          the difference between you and me?!
As the Canopy hisses shut-
                    BATMAN
          I'm not wearing hockey pads.
The "Batman" looks down at his makeshift costume as the
Batmobile ROARS past.
EXT. BANK -- NIGHT
LIEUTENANT GORDON ducks the barrage of SHOUTED QUESTIONS from
press and picks his way into the lobby of the bank.
INT. LOBBY, BANK -- NIGHT
FORENSIC SPECIALISTS work the room. Ramirez hands Gordon
PRINTS- indicates the surveillance cameras.
                    RAMIREZ
          He can't resist showing us his face.
                                                          12.


Gordon looks at the grainy blow-up of THE JOKER'S FACE:
sweating clown makeup plastered thick around the mouth.
                    GORDON
          Put this out, by morning we can put a
          big top over central holding and
          sell tickets. What's he hiding under
          that makeup?
Gordon approaches a FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHER shooting Grumpy's
body. Gordon crouches to look at his clown mask. Batman
steps from the shadows. Gordon nods at Ramirez.
                    RAMIREZ
          Give us a minute, please, people!
The Forensic team and Ramirez leave.    Gordon hands Batman the
blow-up of the Joker.
                       BATMAN
          Him again.     Who are the others?
                    GORDON
          Another bunch of small timers.
Batman pulls a DEVICE from his belt- moves to the bundles of
cash scattered near the clown's body. The device PINGS.
Batman picks up a BUNDLE. Hands it to Gordon.
                    BATMAN
          Some of the marked bills I gave you.
                    GORDON
          My detectives have been making drug
          buys with them for weeks. This bank
          was another drop for the mob. That
          makes five banks- we've found the
          bulk of their dirty cash.
                    BATMAN
          Time to move in.
Gordon waves the photo.
                    GORDON
          What about this Joker guy?
                    BATMAN
          One man or the entire mob?    He can
          wait.
                    GORDON
          We'll have to hit all banks
          simultaneously. SWAT teams, backup.
Gordon holds up the bundle of banknotes.
                                                          13.


                    GORDON
          When the new DA gets wind of this,
          he'll want in.
                    BATMAN
          Do you trust him?
                    GORDON
          Be hard to keep him out.
Gordon bags the cash.
                    GORDON
          I hear he's as stubborn as you.
But Batman is already gone.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- MORNING
Alfred walks past soaring downtown views as he carries a
breakfast tray through the vast, empty penthouse. He stops,
looking at a still-made bed. Alfred sighs, turns.
EXT. RAIL YARDS -- MORNING
Alfred gets out of the Rolls carrying a thermos. He walks
towards a RAILWAY BRIDGE, stops at a FREIGHT CONTAINER
sitting, lopsided, on blocks. Alfred unlocks the RUSTY
PADLOCK AND CHAIN. Steps inside.
INT. FREIGHT CONTAINER -- CONTINUOUS
Alfred FUMBLES in the dark- bangs his elbow- A HISS as the
FLOOR LOWERS... Alfred sinks down into...
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- CONTINUOUS
The container floor lowers on a giant PISTON. Alfred steps
off into a large, LOW-CEILINGED CONCRETE CHAMBER. The
Batmobile sits in the middle. Machines- 3d printers, power
tools- dot the high-tech space. At one end, Wayne sits at a
bank of monitors watching CCTV footage of the bank robbery.
                    ALFRED
          Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt
          and you can swap not sleeping in a
          penthouse for not sleeping in a
          mansion.
Alfred places a cup of coffee in front of Wayne, who is
STITCHING up a cut on his arm.
                    ALFRED (CONT’D)
              (takes needle)
          When you stitch yourself up you make
          a bloody mess.
                                                       14.


                    WAYNE
          But I learn from my mistakes.
                    ALFRED
          You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
          by now, then.
                    WAYNE
          My armor... I'm carrying too much
          weight- I need to be faster.
                    ALFRED
          I'm sure Mr.Fox can oblige.
              (looks at wound)
          Did you get mauled by a tiger?
                    WAYNE
          A dog.
              (off look)
          A big dog. There were more copycats
          last night, Alfred. With guns.
                    ALFRED
          Perhaps you could hire some of them
          and take weekends off.
                    WAYNE
          This wasn't exactly what I had in
          mind when I said I wanted to inspire
          people.
                    ALFRED
          I know. But things are improving.
          Look at the new District Attorney...
Wayne indicates a monitor: a handsome MAN in a suit.
                    WAYNE
          I am. Closely. I need to know if he
          can be trusted.
Alfred looks at other images- the D.A. at a meeting.
Campaigning. Helping someone out of a cab: RACHEL.
                    ALFRED
          Are you interested in his
          character... or his social circle?
                    WAYNE
          Who Rachel spends her time with is
          her business.
                    ALFRED
          Well, I trust you're not following me
          on my day off.
                    WAYNE
          If you ever took one, I might.
                                                          15.


Alfred bites the thread. Examines his stitches.      Looks at
the SCARS criss-crossing Wayne's shoulders.
                    ALFRED
          Know your limits, Master Wayne.
                    WAYNE
          Batman has no limits.
                    ALFRED
          Well, you do, sir.
                    WAYNE
          I can't afford to know them.
                    ALFRED
          And what happens the day you find
          out?
                    WAYNE
          We all know how much you like to say
          'I told you so'.
                    ALFRED
          That day, Master Wayne, even I won't
          want to. Probably.
INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY
HARVEY DENT bursts into the courtroom.     Assistant D.A. RACHEL
DAWES, look up, ANNOYED.
                    DENT
          Sorry I'm late, folks.
Rachel leans in to Dent, speaking under her breath.
                    RACHEL
          Where were you?
                    DENT
          Worried you'd have to step up?
                    RACHEL
          I know the briefs backwards.
Dent pulls a large silver dollar out of his pocket.     Grins.
                    DENT
          Well, then, fair's fair: heads, I'll
          take it. Tails, he's all yours.
Dent FLIPS.   Shows it to Rachel- heads.
                    RACHEL
          You're flipping coins to see who
          leads?
                                                            16.


                    DENT
          My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
          it got me my first date with you.
                    RACHEL
          I'm serious, Harvey, you don't leave
          things like this to chance.
                    DENT
          I don't.
              (sincere)
          I make my own luck.
Dent looks across at the defendant- SAL MARONI.
                    MARONI
          I thought the DA just played golf
          with the Mayor, things like that.
                    DENT
          Tee-off's 1:30. More than enough
          time to put you away for life, Sally.
The BAILIFFS lead a THIN MAN into the witness box.    ROSSI.
INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY
Rossi takes a SIP of water.   Dent works the room.
                    DENT
          With Carmine Falcone in Arkham,
          someone must've stepped up to run the
          so-called family.
              (Rossi nods)
          Is this man in the courtroom today?
              (Rossi nods again)
          Could you identify him for us,
          please?
Dent turns to Maroni, who is poker-faced.    Dent smiles.
                    ROSSI
          You win, counselor.   It was me.
Dent's smile disappears.   He turns back to Rossi.
                    DENT
          I've got a sworn statement from you
          that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is
          the new head of the Falcone crime
          family.
                    ROSSI
          Maroni? He's a fall guy. I'm the
          brains of the organization.
LAUGHS from the gallery.   Dent turns to the JUDGE.
                                                          17.


                    DENT
          Permission to treat the witness as
          hostile?
                     ROSSI
          Hostile?   I'll show you hostile.
Rossi JUMPS UP, points a GUN at Dent's face. SCREAMS from
the gallery. Rossi PULLS the TRIGGER- the gun MISFIRES with
a POP. Dent steps forward, grabs the GUN- DECKS Rossi with a
RIGHT CROSS- unloads the GUN and sets it down in front of
Maroni.
                    DENT
          Ceramic 28 caliber. Made in China.
          If you want to kill a public servant,
          Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy
          American.
Everyone STARES, open-mouthed, as Dent adjusts his tie.    The
Bailiffs are wrestling Rossi from the box-
                    DENT (CONT’D)
          But, your honor, I'm not done...
INT. LOBBY, DENT'S OFFICE, DA'S -- DAY
Rachel, excited, leads Dent through the lobby.
                    RACHEL
          We'll never link the gun to Maroni,
          so we can't charge him, but I'll tell
          you one thing- the fact they tried to
          kill you means we're getting to them.
                    DENT
          Glad you're so pleased, Rachel.     I'm
          fine by the way.
Rachel turns to Dent.   Smooths his lapels.
                    RACHEL
          Harvey, you're Gotham's D.A.- if
          you're not getting shot at, you're
          not doing your job.
              (smiles)
          'Course if you said you were rattled
          we could take the rest of the day...
                    DENT
          Can't. I dragged the head of the
          Major Crimes Unit down here.
                    RACHEL
          Jim Gordon? He's a friend- try to be
          nice.

INT. DENT'S OFFICE -- DAY
Gordon stands as Dent enters.   The two men shake.
                    GORDON
          Word is you've got a hell of a right
          cross. Shame Sal's going to walk.
                    DENT
          Well, good thing about the mob is
          they keep giving you second chances.
Dent picks up a bundle of bills from the heist.
                    DENT
          Lightly irradiated bills. Fancy
          stuff for a city cop. Have help?
                    GORDON
          We liaise with various agencies-
                    DENT
          Save it, Gordon.   I want to meet him.
                    GORDON
          Official policy is to arrest the
          vigilante known as Batman on sight.
                    DENT
          And that flood light on top of
          M.C.U.?
                    GORDON
          If you have any concerns about...
          malfunctioning equipment... take them
          up with maintenance, counselor.
Dent tosses the bills back onto his desk.    Annoyed.
                    DENT
          I've put every known money launderer
          in Gotham behind bars. But the mob
          is still getting its money out. I
          think you and your "friend" have
          found the last game in town and
          you're trying to hit 'em where it
          hurts: their wallets. Bold. You
          gonna count me in?
                    GORDON
          In this town, the fewer people know
          something, the safer the operation.
                    DENT
          Gordon, I don't like that you've got
          your own special unit, and I don't
          like that it's full of cops I
          investigated at internal affairs.
                                                       19.


                    GORDON
          If I didn't work with cops you'd
          investigated while you were making
          your name at I.A.- I'd be working
          alone. I don't get political points
          for being an idealist- I have to do
          the best I can with what I have.
Dent looks at Gordon.   Considering how to proceed.
                    DENT
          You want me to back warrants for
          search and seizure on five banks
          without telling me who we're after?
                    GORDON
          I can give you the names of the
          banks.
                    DENT
          Well, that's a start. I'll get you
          your warrants. But I want your
          trust.
                    GORDON
              (rises)
          You don't have to sell me, Dent.   We
          all know you're Gotham's white
          knight.
                    DENT
              (grins)
          I hear they've got a different
          nickname for me down at M.C.U..
Gordon smiles.
INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY
LUCIUS FOX, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, and the board listen to
LAU, 40s, CEO of L.S.I. Holdings.
                    LAU
          In China L.S.I. Holdings stands for
          dynamic new growth. A joint Chinese
          venture with Wayne Enterprises will
          be a powerhouse.
                    FOX
          Well, Mr.Lau, I speak for the rest of
          the board, and Mr.Wayne, in
          expressing our own excitement...
The Chinese look to the head of the table: Wayne, ASLEEP.

INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY
Fox shows Lau to the elevator. He's joined by, REESE, 30s,
an ambitious M and A consultant lawyer.
                    LAU
          It's OK, Mr.Fox. Everyone knows who
          really runs Wayne Enterprises.
                    FOX
          We'll be in touch as soon as our
          people have wrapped up the diligence.
The elevator doors close.   Reese frowns.
                    REESE
          Sir, I know Mr.Wayne's curious how
          his trust fund gets replenished but
          frankly... it's embarrassing.
Fox heads for his office, Reese in tow.
                    FOX
          You worry about the diligence, Mr.
          Reese. I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.
                    REESE
          It's done- the numbers are solid.
                    FOX
              (smiles)
          Do it again. Wouldn't want the trust
          fund to run out, would we?
INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne is standing by the window.
                    FOX
          Another long night?
              (Wayne smiles)
          This joint venture was your idea, and
          the consultants love it, but I'm not
          convinced. L.S.I.'s grown 8 percent
          annually, like clockwork. They must
          have a revenue stream that's off the
          books. Maybe even illegal.
                     WAYNE
          OK.   Cancel the deal.
                    FOX
              (looks at Wayne)
          You already knew.
                    WAYNE
          I needed a closer look at their
          books.

Fox looks at Wayne.    Wry.
                    FOX
          Anything else you can trouble me for?
                    WAYNE
          I need a new suit.
                    FOX
              (looks him over)
          Three buttons is a little nineties.
                    WAYNE
          I'm not talking about fashion,
          Mr.Fox, so much as function.
Wayne pulls some diagrams.      Fox looks them over.
                    FOX
          You want to be able to turn your
          head?
                    WAYNE
          Sure make backing out of the driveway
          easier.
                    FOX
          I'll see what I can do.
INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
Rachel and Dent at a table.     Dent looks a little intimidated
by the surroundings.
                    DENT
          It took three weeks to get a
          reservation and I had to tell them I
          worked for the government.
                       RACHEL
          Really?
                    DENT
          This city health inspector's not
          afraid to pull strings.
Rachel smiles. Then, over Dent's shoulder, she sees Wayne
enter, accompanied by a beautiful woman.
                       DENT
          What?
                       WAYNE
          Rachel!     Fancy that.
                    RACHEL
          Yes, Bruce. Fancy that.
                                                  22.

          Rachel, Natascha.   Natascha, Rachel.
                    NATASCHA
              (Russian accent)
          Hello.
                    DENT
          The famous Bruce Wayne. Rachel's
          told me everything about you.
                    WAYNE
          I certainly hope not.
                    RACHEL
          Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.
                    WAYNE
          Let's put a couple tables together.
                    DENT
          I don't know if they'll let us-
                    WAYNE
          They should! I own the place.
                    RACHEL
          For how long? About three weeks?
                    WAYNE
          How'd you know?
                    RACHEL
          Natascha, aren't you...?
                    WAYNE
          Prima ballerina for the Moscow
          Ballet.
                    RACHEL
          Harvey's taking me next week.
                    WAYNE
          You're into ballet, Harvey?
                     RACHEL
          No.   He knows I am.
An extra table arrives.
INT. SAME -- LATER
They finish up dinner.
                    NATASCHA
          No, come on- how could you want to
          raise children in a city like this?
                                                  23.


                    WAYNE
          I was raised here.   I turned out OK.
                    DENT
          Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?
Rachel gives Dent a withering look.
                    WAYNE
          The Palisades? Sure. You know, as
          our new D.A. you might want to figure
          out where your jurisdiction ends.
                    NATASCHA
          I'm talking about the kind of city
          that idolizes a masked vigilante...
                    DENT
          Gotham's proud of an ordinary man
          standing up for what's right.
                    NATASCHA
          Gotham needs heroes like you- elected
          officials, not a man who thinks he's
          above the law.
                      WAYNE
          Exactly.    Who appointed the Batman?
                    DENT
          We did. All of us who stood by and
          let scum take control of our city.
Wayne watches Dent.   Sees his passion.
                    NATASCHA
          But this is a democracy, Harvey.
                    DENT
          When their enemies were at the gate,
          the Romans would suspend democracy
          and appoint one man to protect the
          city. It wasn't considered an honor.
          It was considered public service.
                    RACHEL
          And the last man they asked to
          protect the republic was named
          Caesar. He never gave up that power.
                    DENT
          Well, I guess you either die a hero
          or you live long enough to see
          yourself become the villain. Look,
          whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
          want to spend the rest of his life
          doing this. How could he?
                    (MORE)

                    DENT (cont'd)
          ~Batman's looking for someone to take
          up his mantle.
                    NATASCHA
          Someone like you, Mr.Dent?
                     DENT
          Maybe.   If I'm up to it.
Natascha reaches up and covers the top half of Dent's face.
                    NATASCHA
          But what if Harvey Dent is the caped
          crusader?
                    DENT
          If I were sneaking out every night
          someone would've noticed by now.
Dent takes Rachel's hand.    Rachel glances at Wayne.    Awkward.
                    WAYNE
          Well, you've sold me, Dent. I'm
          gonna throw you a fundraiser.
                    DENT
          That's nice of you, Bruce, but I'm
          not up for reelection for three
          years. That stuff won't start for-
                    WAYNE
          I don't think you understand. One
          fundraiser with my pals, you'll never
          need another cent.
EXT. BACK ALLEY, HOTEL, DOWNTOWN -- DAY
A line of high-end AUTOS dispenses well dressed GANGSTERS.
INT. KITCHEN, HOTEL -- DAY
The Chechen walks through a METAL DETECTOR manned by two
CHINESE. A lean, African-American man, 50's, is being
wanded. This is GAMBOL. He nods at the Chechen, wary.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS
Gotham's most notorious GANGSTERS. A door opens, and two
BURLY CHINESE enter, carrying a TV. They set it down on the

                    LAU (ON T.V.)
          Gentlemen, please. As you're all
          aware, one of our deposits was
          stolen. A relatively small amount:
          68 million.
                    CHECHEN
          Who's stupid enough steal from us?
                    LAU
          I'm told the man who arranged the
          heist calls himself Joker.
                    CHECHEN
          Who the hell is that?
                    MARONI
          Two-bit whack-job wears a cheap
          purple suit and make-up. He's not
          the problem- he's a nobody.
              (looks at Lau)
          The problem is our money being
          tracked by the cops.
Murmurs of surprise.
                    LAU
          Thanks to Mr.Maroni's well-placed
          sources we know that police have
          indeed identified our banks using
          marked bills and are planning to
          seize your funds today-

                    LAU
          With the investigation ongoing, none
          of you can risk hanging on to your
          own proceeds. And since the
          enthusiastic new D.A. has put all my
          competitors out of business, I'm your
          only option.

                    MARONI
          So what are you proposing?
                    LAU
          Moving all deposits to one secure
          location. Not a bank.
                    GAMBOL
          Where, then?
                    LAU
          Obviously, no one can know but me.
          If the police were to gain leverage
          over one of you everyone's money
          would be at stake.
                    CHECHEN
          What stops them getting to you?
                    LAU
          As the money is moved I go to Hong
          Kong. Far from Dent's jurisdiction.
          And the Chinese will not extradite
          one of their own.
From the back of the room comes LAUGHTER. It grows and
grows, until it fills the room. All eyes turn:
The Joker. Sweaty clown makeup obscuring the AWFUL SCARS
which widen his mouth into a PERMANENT, GHOULISH SMILE.
                    THE JOKER
          I thought I told bad jokes.
                    GAMBOL
          Give me one reason I shouldn't have
          my boy here pull your head off.
The Joker pulls out a freshly sharpened pencil.
                    THE JOKER
          How about a magic trick?
The Joker SLAMS the pencil into the table, leaving it
UPRIGHT.
                    THE JOKER (CONT’D)
          I'll make this pencil disappear.
Gambol nods. His BODYGUARD MOVES at the Joker- who SIDESTEPS-
GRIPS his head- SLAMS it, FACE DOWN, onto the table...
The Bodyguard goes LIMP and slides off of the table. The
PENCIL is gone. MAGIC. The Joker BOWS. Grins at Gambol.
                                                    27.


                      THE JOKER (CONT’D)
            And by the way, the suit wasn't
            cheap. You should know. You bought
            it.
Gambol STANDS, furious.    The Chechen stops him.
                       CHECHEN
            Sit.   I wanna hear proposition.
The Joker nods his thanks.      Rises.
                      THE JOKER
            A year ago these cops and lawyers
            wouldn't dare cross any of you. What
            happened? Did your balls drop off?
            See, a guy like me-
                       GAMBOL
            A freak.
Laughs.   Which the Joker tries to ignore.
                       THE JOKER
            A guy like me... I know why you're
            holding your little group therapy
            session in broad daylight. I know
            why you're afraid to go out at night.
            Batman. He's shown Gotham your true
            colors. And Dent's just the
            beginning.
                (indicates Lau)
            And as for his so-called plan- Batman
            has no jurisdiction. He'll find him
            and make him squeal.

            I can tell the squealers every time.

            What you propose?
                      THE JOKER
            It's simple. Kill the Batman.
Jeers.    Laughter.
                      MARONI
            If it's so easy why haven't you done
            it already?
                      THE JOKER
            Like my mother used to tell me- if
            you're good at something, never do it
            for free.
                      CHECHEN
            How much you want?

                      THE JOKER
            Half.
Laughter.   The Joker shrugs.     Rises.
                      THE JOKER (CONT’D)
            You don't deal with this now, soon
            Gambol won't even be able to get a
            nickel for his grandma-
                      GAMBOL
            Enough from the clown.
Gambol gets up, MOVING at the Joker, who casually opens his
coat, revealing EXPLOSIVES wired to his chest. Gambol stops.
                      THE JOKER
            Let's not blow this out of all
            proportion.
Gambol stares at the Joker.     Hard.
                      GAMBOL
            You think you can steal from us and
            just walk away? I'm putting the word
            out- 5 hundred grand for this clown
            dead. A million alive, so I get to
            teach him some manners, first.
The Joker shrugs.   Turns to the assembled.
                      THE JOKER
            Let me know when you change your
            minds.
The Joker strolls out.   Maroni turns to Lau.
                      MARONI
            How soon can you move the money?
EXT. VARIOUS BANKS DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon hurries up the steps to a bank.     SWAT teams rush the
various banks.

Gordon stands in an almost empty bank vault.     Furious.

INT. SOCIAL CLUB, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS
The shot of Lau on the TV widens...
                    LAU
          Rest assured, your money is safe.
He is already on his private jet.
IN THE SKY: THE BAT SIGNAL.
EXT. ROOF, POLICE STATION -- NIGHT
Batman emerges from the shadows.    The man next to the glowing
spotlight turns: DENT.
                    DENT
          You're a hard man to reach.
Gordon BURSTS onto the rooftop, weapon drawn.    Sees Dent.
                    DENT
          Lau's halfway to Hong Kong- if you'd
          asked, I could have taken his
          passport- I told you to keep me in
          the loop.
                    GORDON
          Yeah? All that was left in the
          vaults were the marked bills- they
          knew we were coming! As soon as your
          office got involved, there's a leak-
                    DENT
          My office?! You're sitting down here
          with scum like Wuertz and Ramirez...
              (off look)
          Oh, yeah, Gordon- I almost had your
          rookie cold on a racketeering beef.
                    GORDON
          Don't try to cloud the fact that
          clearly Maroni's got people in your
          office, Dent.
Dent turns to Batman.
                    DENT
          We need Lau back, but the Chinese
          won't extradite a national under any
          circumstances.
                                                          30.


                    BATMAN
          If I get him to you, can you get him
          to talk?
                    DENT
          I'll get him to sing.
                    GORDON
          We're going after the mob's life
          savings. Things will get ugly.
                    DENT
          I knew the risks when I took this
          job, lieutenant. Same as you.
              (turns to Batman)
          How will you get him back, anyway?
Batman is gone.    Dent looks around, startled.   Gordon smirks.
                    GORDON
          He does that.
INT. FOX'S OFFICE, WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- DAY
Fox gets up from behind his desk.
                    FOX
          Our Chinese friend left town before I
          could tell him the deal is off.
                    WAYNE
          I'm sure you've always wanted to go
          to Hong Kong.
Fox opens the door to a private elevator.
INT. PRIVATE ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS
Fox turns a key.
                    FOX
          What's wrong with a phone call?
                    WAYNE
          I think Mr.Lau deserves a more
          personal touch.
INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- CONTINUOUS
Fox leads Wayne off the elevator and into the vast space.
                    FOX
          For high altitude jumps, you need
          oxygen and stabilizers. I must say-
          compared to your usual requests,
          jumping out of an airplane is pretty
          straightforward.
                                                          31.


Lucius stops at a cabinet, pulls open a drawer and hauls out
an oxygen tank and ribbed rubber hosing.
                    WAYNE
          How about getting back into the
          plane?
                    FOX
          I can recommend a good travel agent.
                    WAYNE
          Without it landing.
                    FOX
          That's more like it, Mr.Wayne.
He shuts the drawer.    Moves off, thinking.
                      FOX
          I don't   think I have anything here.
          The CIA   had a program in the '60s for
          getting   their people out of hot
          spots.    Called Sky Hook. Now-
Fox opens a cabinet to reveal COMPONENTS OF A NEW BAT-SUIT.
ARMORED PLATING secured to mesh. Wayne lifts an arm.
                    FOX
          Hardened kevlar plates on a titanium-
          dipped fiber tri-weave for

Wayne examines DOUBLE BLADE SCALLOPS on the gauntlet...
                    FOX
          You'll be lighter, faster, more
          agile...
Wayne flinches as the BLADES FIRE, SPINNING LIKE THROWING
STARS, NARROWLY MISSING his ear, embedding themselves in a
filing cabinet. Fox looks at him.
                    FOX
          Perhaps you should read the
          instructions, first.
                       WAYNE
          Sorry.
Fox picks up the chest, demonstrating its flexibility.
                    FOX
          Now, there's a trade-off... the
          spread of the plates gives you weak
          spots. You'll be more vulnerable to
          gunfire and knives.

                    WAYNE
          We wouldn't want things getting too
          easy, would we?
              (picks up suit)
          How will it hold up against dogs?
Fox looks at him quizzically.
                    FOX
          You talking chihuahuas or rotweilers?
              (Wayne smiles)
          It should do fine against cats.
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY
Wayne examines a parachute harness. Alfred unfolds a diagram
of a NAVY CARGO PLANE with a giant "V" mounted on the front.
                    ALFRED
          I found one. In Arizona. Very nice
          man says it will take him a week to
          get it running. And he takes cash.
          What about a flight crew?
                    WAYNE
          South Korean smugglers. They run
          flights into Pyongyang, below radar
          the whole way. Did you think of an
          alibi?
Alfred looks quite pleased with himself.
                       ALFRED
          Oh, yes.
EXT. BALLET -- NIGHT
Rachel and Dent arrive to find the box office SHUTTERED. A
sign:'PERFORMANCE CANCELED.' A newspaper story is taped to
the glass. Over a picture of BRUCE WAYNE ON A YACHT:
LOVE BOAT- Billionaire absconds with entire Moscow ballet.
EXT. DECK, WAYNE'S YACHT, THE CARIBBEAN -- DAY
Alfred, picks his way over twelve SUNBATHING BALLERINAS.
Wayne looks up from a newspaper. Alfred points to a SEA-
PLANE gently touching down across the bay.
                    ALFRED
          I believe your plane is here.
                    WAYNE
          You look tired, Alfred.   Will you be
          all right without me?
A Ballerina rolls over- waves the suntan lotion at Alfred.
                                                       33.


                    ALFRED
          If you can tell me the Russian for
          'apply your own bloody suntan
          lotion.’
Wayne tosses a large, waterproof kit bag into the water and
JUMPS in after it. Begins swimming over to the sea-plane.
INT. POOL HALL -- NIGHT
Gambol racks up.   A bodyguard steps into the room.
                    BODYGUARD
          Somebody here for you.
Gambol looks to the back- three rough customers are waiting.
                    BODYGUARD
          They say they've killed the Joker.
          They've come for the reward.
                    GAMBOL
          They bring proof?
                    BODYGUARD
          They say they've brought the body.
The bodyguards FLOP a BODY wrapped in garbage bags onto the
table. The BOUNTY HUNTERS wait in the corner. Gambol pulls
back one of the garbage bags, revealing the Joker's bloodied
face. Gambol spits. Turns to face the bounty hunters.
                     GAMBOL
          So.   Dead you get five hundred-
Behind Gambol, the Joker SITS UP- THRUSTS knives into the
bodyguards' chests. Gambol spins to see a crazy grin on the
Joker's spit-dribbled face-
                    THE JOKER
          How about alive?
The Joker gets a switchblade in Gambol's mouth- SHARP METAL
PULLING THE CHEEK TAUT. The Bounty Hunters subdue the
remaining bodyguards.
                    THE JOKER
          Wanna know how I got these scars? My
          father was a drinker and a fiend.
          He'd beat mommy right in front of me.
          One night he goes off crazier than
          usual, mommy gets the kitchen knife
          to defend herself. He doesn't like
          that. Not. One. Bit.
The Joker TUGS Gambols cheek with the blade.
                                                         34.


                    THE JOKER
          So, me watching, he takes the knife
          to her, laughing while he does it.
          Turns to me and says 'why so
          serious?' Comes at me with the knife-
          'why so serious?' Sticks the blade
          in my mouth- 'Let's put a smile on
          that face' and...
The Joker looks up at the ASHEN FACES of the remaining Body
Guards. Smiles.
                    THE JOKER
          Why so serious?
The Joker FLICKS his wrist- the Body Guards flinch as Gambol
goes down. The Joker turns to them.
                    THE JOKER
          Now, our organization is small, but
          we've got a lot of potential for
          aggressive expansion... so which of
          you fine gentlemen would like to join
          our team?
The three bodyguards all nod.   The Joker SNAPS a pool cue.
                    THE JOKER
          Only one slot open right now- so
          we're going to have try-outs.
The Joker drops the broken cue in the middle of the men.
                    THE JOKER
          Make it fast.
The men stare at each other.    Then at the jagged pool cue.
EXT.PENINSULA HOTEL, HONG KONG -- DAY
A HELICOPTER touches down on one of the hotel's twin
helipads. Two L.S.I. VPs approach, heads ducked. Fox gets
out- they shake hands, shouting over the engine-
                    VP
          Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr.Fox! Mr.Lau
          regrets he is unable to meet you in
          person. But with his current legal
          difficulties...!

                    VP
          I'm afraid for security reasons I
          have to ask for your mobile phone.
Lucius hands his phone to a SECURITY GUARD, who puts the
phone in a box underneath his station.
INT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY
Fox and Lau eat lunch in a dining room overlooking the city.
                    LAU
          I must apologize for leaving Gotham
          in the middle of our negotiations.
          This misunderstanding with the Gotham
          police force... I couldn't let such
          a thing threaten my company. A
          businessman of your stature will
          understand. But with you here... we
          can continue.
                    FOX
          Well, it was good of you to bring me
          out here in such style, Mr.Lau. But
          I've actually come...
A CELL PHONE rings. Fox pulls out a second, identical,
phone. Fox presses the off switch and places the phone by
his plate.
                    LAU
          We do not allow cell phones in-
                    FOX
          Sorry. Forgot I had it. So, I've
          come to explain why we're going to
          have to put our deal on hold...
Lau stares at Fox.   Clearly furious.   Fox smiles.
                    FOX
          We can't afford to be seen to do
          business with... well, whatever it is
          you're accused of being. A
          businessman of your stature will
          understand.
Lau gets up.   Silent.   Fox retrieves his phone.   Stands.
                     LAU
              (cold)
          I think, Mr.Fox, that a simple phone
          call might have sufficed.

          we'd been deliberately wasting your
          time.
                    LAU
          Just accidentally wasting it.
                    FOX
              (laughs)
          That's very good- "accidentally".
          Very good. I'll be sure and tell
          Mr.Wayne that he was wrong about you
          not having a sense of humor.
INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY
Lucius walks back through security. Nods at the VP, who
bows, offering Lucius his cell phone. Lucius shakes his
head, holds up the IDENTICAL PHONE. The VP smiles, nods,
puts the phone back into the tray with several others.
INT. HOLD, C-130 CARGO HAULER -- DAWN
Two SMUGGLERS steal glances at Wayne, crouched at the rear in
balaclava and flight suit. The COPILOT signals Wayne, who
pulls on his oxygen mask and stands up. The rear of the
plane OPENS. Wayne steps to the edge, then JUMPS.
EXT. SKIES ABOVE HONG KONG -- DAWN
Moving across the water towards Hong Kong harbor...
A tiny figure DROPS into frame, PLUMMETING towards the water-
SPEEDING past the highest floors of skyscrapers, seconds from
impact. Wayne PULLS the chute- DROPS into the water...
EXT. BENEATH FREEWAY, HONG KONG HARBOR -- DAY
Wayne pulls himself out of the water, dragging up his pack.

          Mr.Wayne?
              (Wayne turns)
          Good luck.
EXT. HONG KONG -- NIGHT
Moving towards the tallest building in the glittering skyline
to find Wayne, crouched on the roof. The blades of his
gauntlets CLICK into place. He dons the helmet-like cowl.
His "cape" is in the form of a hard faceted PACK.
He stands- pulls two black boxes from his belt, CLICKS them
together and UNFOLDS them into a RIFLE-LIKE DEVICE. Batman
SCOPES a second, lower building. Adjust a setting and FIRES-
four times...
Four small STICKY BOMBS SLAP onto the glass of the lower
building. They have visible timers which are COUNTING DOWN.
INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lucius' cell phone GLOWS in the box under the Security
Guard's desk. CHARACTERS race across the screen.
Then the monitor FLICKERS off, the lights DIM and all of the
security doors in the front of the building OPEN at once.
                                                         38.


The Guard grabs his radio- CALLS FOR HELP...
EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING L.S.I.HOLDINGS
Batman LAUNCHES into the glittering night, DROPPING from the
tall tower... his pack BURSTS OPEN, becoming his BAT WINGS-he
GLIDES down to the lower building, STREAKING around it,
BANKING HARD to line up with a window in the rear...
INT. LAU'S OFFICE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lau is talking on the phone, staring at a profit projection
on a flat screen monitor. Suddenly the room goes dark.
EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- CONTINUOUS
As Batman HURTLES towards the glass he COLLAPSES his wings,
WRAPPING his cape around himself and CANNONBALLING THROUGH
THE GLASS-
INT. LAU'S OFFICE SUITE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
-ROLLING across the floor in a flurry of broken glass...
INT. LAU'S OFFICE, TOP FLOOR, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lau pulls out a HANDGUN.
INT. HALLWAY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lau steps into the hallway.    His BODYGUARDS are waiting for
him, carrying FLASHLIGHTS.
                    LAU
          Where the hell are the cops?
                    BODYGUARD
          Coming.
                    LAU
          What the hell am I paying them for?
They head for the stairwell.
EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
A small ARMY of Hong Kong police lead by a HONG KONG
DETECTIVE descends on the building.
INT. MEZZANINE LEVEL, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lau and his men make their way out onto the mezzanine.
Across the room, something makes a CRASHING SOUND. Lau's men
fan out, trying to cover the room with their flashlights.
Suddenly, one of the flashlights goes DARK.    Then another.
Someone SCREAMS.
                                                          39.


Lau FIRES. Then FIRES again.   The muzzle flash from his
weapon STROBES the room.
EXT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS, HONG KONG -- NIGHT
Cops SWARM into the building. A LOBBY SECURITY GUARD directs
the Hong Kong Detective where to go...
INT. OFFICE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT
Lau LOCKS the door. RELOADS.   The door is KICKED open.     Lau
FIRES. No one is there.
Lau stares, finger restless on the trigger.   From his right-
a NOISE. He turns and FIRES.
In the muzzle FLASH: Batman, bearing down on him like a
demon.
Lau FIRES, and FIRES again as Batman TACKLES him.    Batman
pulls out a SMALL PACK- STRAPS it onto Lau-
The COUNTER on the sticky bombs hits 0-
The Hong Kong Detective and the Cops BURST into the room- the
WALL AND CEILING BEHIND BATMAN AND LAU EXPLODES- revealing
the dawn sky above Hong Kong.
The Detective looks around as he hears a LOW RUMBLE...
Batman JERKS the RIPCORD on Lau's pack. Cops cower as a
WEATHER BALLOON EXPLODES out of the pack, unreeling high-test
nylon. The Cops cock their weapons.
Lau looks up. Bemused. The weather balloon is two hundred
feet up, swaying gently. The RUMBLE BUILDS...
Suddenly, a MASSIVE C-130 ROARS over. The large V on the
front of the plane SNAGS the line- Lau and BATMAN are YANKED
THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE CEILING-
Lau SCREAMS as he and Batman SOAR UP INTO THE DAWN SKY...
The Detective looks up.   Batman and Lau are gone.
INT. GORDON'S OFFICE, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Gordon is looking through case files.   Ramirez walks in.
                    RAMIREZ
          You're gonna want to see this.
EXT. MCU -- DAY
Gordon follows Ramirez through a CROWD of excited cops. On
the ground, trussed like a chicken- Lau. A sign taped to his
chest: 'Please deliver to Lieutenant Gordon.'

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Lau sits next to his sleazy lawyer, EVANS.    Rachel walks in.
                    RACHEL
          Give us the money and we'll deal.
                    LAU
          The money is the only reason I'm
          still alive.
Rachel leans forward, speaking softly.   Clearly.
                    RACHEL
          You mean when they hear that you've
          helped us they're going to kill you?
                    EVANS
          Are you threatening my client?
                    RACHEL
          No, I'm just assuming your client's
          cooperation with this investigation.
          As will everyone.
              (moves to the door)
          Enjoy your stay in County, Mr.Lau.
                    LAU
          Wait.
              (Rachel stops)
          I won't give you the money, but I'll
          give you my clients. All of them.
                    RACHEL
          You were a glorified accountant- what
          could you have on all of them that we
          could charge?
                    LAU
          I'm good with calculation- I handled
          all their investments. One big pot.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Dent hits a buzzer.   Turns to Gordon.
                    DENT
          I've got it. RICO. If their money
          was pooled we can charge all of them
          as one criminal conspiracy.
                    GORDON
          Charge them with what?
Rachel enters.
                                                       41.


                    DENT
          In a RICO case if we can charge any
          of the conspirators with a felony-
                    RACHEL
          We can charge all of them with it.
Dent nods at Rachel, excited.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Rachel comes back in.
                    RACHEL
          Mr.Lau, do you have details of this
          communal fund? Ledgers,
          notebooks...?
                    LAU
              (smiles)
          Immunity, protection and a chartered
          plane back to Hong Kong.
                    RACHEL
          Once you've testified in open court.
          So with your clients locked up, what
          happens to all that money?
                    LAU
          Like I said- I'm good with
          calculation.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS
Dent and Gordon watch Lau.
                    GORDON
          He can't go to County. I'll keep him
          here in the holding cells.
                    DENT
          What is this Gordon, your fortress?
                    GORDON
          You trust them over at County?
                    DENT
          I don't trust them here.
                       GORDON
          Lau stays.
                    DENT
          It's your call, Lieutenant.   Be
          right.
                    GORDON
          I am, counselor.
                                                       42.


EXT. CITY HALL -- DAY
Dent stands in front of a small crowd of reporters.
                    REPORTER
          The Chinese government claim their
          international rights have been
          broken.
                    DENT
          I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
          arrangements...
INT. RESTAURANT -- CONTINUOUS
Dent's press conference plays on a TV in the corner.
                    DENT
              (grins)
          ...but I'm sure glad he's back.
Maroni and the Chechen are watching the TV.
                    CHECHEN
          I put word out. We hire the clown.
              (off look)
          He was right. We have to fix real
          problem. Batman.
Maroni shakes his head. Spots Gordon walking over dangling a
pair of handcuffs. Nods at the TV.
                    GORDON
          Our boy looks good on the tube.
                    MARONI
          You sure you want to embarrass me in
          front of my friends, Lieutenant?
                    GORDON
          Don't worry, they're coming, too.
Gordon points out the window to a PRISON BUS.
EXT. VARIOUS DOWNTOWN AND OUTLYING LOCATIONS -- DAY
Prison buses in every neighborhood. COPS load them with
CRIMINALS. Stephens puts Crime Boss in a prison bus.
INT. COURTROOM A, GOTHAM MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY
JUDGE SURRILLO reads the list of charges.
                    JUDGE SURRILLO

          counts fraud, 87 counts conspiracy
          murder...

Judge Surrillo turns the page. A PLAYING CARD sits there.      A
Joker. He glances at it, curious, puts it to one side.
                    JUDGE SURRILLO
          ...how do the defendants plead?
An ARMY of DEFENSE LAWYERS jostle YELLING ALL AT ONCE.   The
STENOGRAPHER looks up, helpless.
INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE -- DAY
The MAYOR, COMMISSIONER LOEB, and Gordon look up as Dent
enters.
                     MAYOR
          DENT!   What was that circus?!
                    DENT
          I asked Gordon to make some arrests.
                    LOEB
              (looks at report)
          Five hundred and-
                    GORDON
          Forty-nine, sir.
Gordon nods at Dent, approving.   Dent grins back.
                    MAYOR
          549 criminals at once?! How did you
          convince Surrillo to hear this farce?
                    DENT
          She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
          After all, she is a judge.
                    MAYOR
          Even if you blow enough smoke to get
          convictions out of Surrillo, you'll
          set a new record at appeals for
          quickest kick in the ass.
                    DENT
          It won't matter. The head guys make
          bail, sure... but the mid-level guys,
          they can't, and they can't afford to
          be off the streets long enough for
          trial and appeal. They'll cut deals
          that include some jail time. Think
          of all you could do with 18 months of
          clean streets.
The Mayor waves Gordon and Loeb out.
                    MAYOR
          The public likes you, Dent. That's
          the only reason this might fly.

                     MAYOR (cont'd)
           But that means it's on you. They're
           all coming after you, now. Not just
           the mob... politicians, journalists,
           cops- anyone whose wallet's about to
           get lighter. Are you up to it?
               (Dent smiles)
           You better be. They get anything on
           you... those criminals will be back
           on the streets...
The Mayor turns to look out of the window.     Quiet.
                     MAYOR
           Followed swiftly by you and me-
BANG!   A DARK SHAPE CRACKS THE GLASS in front of the Mayor's
nose.   Dent rushes to the window, looks out...
EXT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS
PEDESTRIANS look up, someone SCREAMS, someone POINTS- five
stories up... SWINGING from a FLAGPOLE...
BATMAN. HANGING BY HIS NECK. DEAD.    His mouth roughly
painted in a DEMONIC CLOWN SMILE.
EXT. CITY HALL -- MOMENTS LATER
"Batman" is lowered from the flagpole.    The same fake Batman
we saw earlier. Pinned to his chest by    a KNIFE, a PLAYING
CARD. A Joker. Gordon moves closer to     the body. The card
has writing on it: WILL THE REAL BATMAN   PLEASE STAND UP?
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Wayne comes into the living room, excited.     Alfred is
supervising party arrangements.
                     WAYNE
           How's it going?
                     ALFRED
           I think your fundraiser will be a
           great success, sir.
                     WAYNE
           And why do you think I wanted to hold
           a party for Harvey Dent?
                     ALFRED
           I assumed it was your usual reason
           for socialising beyond myself and the
           scum of Gotham's underbelly: to try
           and impress Miss Dawes.
                     WAYNE
           Very droll. But very wrong.
           Actually it's Dent. You see-
                                                       45.


Wayne trails off as he spots something on the television: the
Batman HANGING as from a NEWS CAMERA, framed by a graphic
that reads 'BATMAN DEAD?'. Image cuts to Engel in the
studio.
                    ENGEL
          ...Police released video footage
          found concealed on the body.
          Sensitive viewers be aware: it is
          disturbing.
The image cuts to a BLINDFOLDED MAN, wearing a makeshift
Batman costume- face bruised and bloody. In some kind of
bright, fluorescent-lit room.
                    VOICE
          Tell them your name.
                     MAN
              (weak)
          Brian Douglas.
                    VOICE
          Are you the real Batman?
                    MAN
          No.
                    VOICE
          Why do you dress up like him?
                    MAN
          He's a symbol... that we don't have
          to be afraid of scum like you...
                    VOICE
          But you do, Brian. You really do.
          You think the Batman's helped Gotham?
Brian nods uncertainly...
                    VOICE
          Look at me.
              (Brian looks down)
LOOK AT ME!
Brian looks up- the camera swings into the face of the Joker,
in CHALK-WHITE makeup, RED SMEAR of lipstick on his SCARS.
                    THE JOKER
          This is how crazy Batman's made
          Gotham. You want order in Gotham?
          Batman has to go. So...
              (leans in)
          Batman must take off his mask, and
          turn himself in.

          Every day he doesn't... people will
          die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of
          my word.
The tape cuts to STATIC.
Wayne turns to Alfred.   Silent.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- EVENING
Dent and Rachel get off the lift.    Dent stands in awe of the
penthouse and its guests.
                    RACHEL
          Now I've seen it all: Harvey Dent,
          scourge of the underworld, scared
          stiff by the trust fund brigade.
Rachel spots someone and darts off-
                      DENT
          Rachel-
                    ALFRED
          A little liquid courage, Mr.Dent?
Dent turns to see Alfred with drinks on a silver tray.
                     DENT
          Thanks.   Alfred, right?
                      ALFRED
          Yes, sir.
                    DENT
          Rachel talks about you all the time.
          You've known her her whole life?
                    ALFRED
          Not yet, sir.
                    DENT
              (smiles, surveys crowd)
          Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should
          be aware of?
                    ALFRED
          Oh, you have no idea.
Alfred leaves Dent standing there, puzzled. The crowd REACTS
as a LOUD ROAR drowns conversation... Dent looks out-
EXT. HELIPAD, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne's CHOPPER touches down.   He spills out with a clutch of
SUPERMODELS...
                                                       47.


INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne and the supermodels come out of the helipad elevator-
                      WAYNE
            Sorry, I'm late- glad you started
            without me! Where's Rachel?!
Rachel cringes slightly.      Wayne spots her.
                      WAYNE
            Rachel Dawes- my oldest friend. When
            she told me she was dating Harvey
            Dent, I had one thing to say... the
            guy from those god-awful campaign
            commercials?
Laughter.   Dent shifts, embarrassed.
                      WAYNE
            'I Believe in Harvey Dent.' Nice
            slogan, Harvey. Certainly caught
            Rachel's attention. But then I
            started paying attention to Harvey,
            and all he's been doing as our new
            D.A., and you know what? I believe
            in Harvey Dent. On his watch, Gotham
            can feel a little safer. A little
            more optimistic. So get out your
            checkbooks and let's make sure that
            he stays right where all of Gotham
            wants him...
                (raises his glass)
            All except Gotham's criminals, of
            course. To the face of Gotham's
            bright future- Harvey Dent.
Dent smiles accepting the toast.
INT. CORRIDOR, MCU -- EVENING
Ramirez catches up to Gordon, holding paperwork.
                      RAMIREZ
            That Joker card pinned to the body?
            Forensics found three sets of D.N.A..
                      GORDON
            Any matches?
                         RAMIREZ
            All three.
Gordon STOPS.   Turns to face her.
                      RAMIREZ
            The D.N.A. belongs to Judge Surrillo,
            Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.
                                                           48.


                    GORDON
          The Joker's telling us who he's
          targeting- get a unit to Surrillo's
          house, tell Wuertz to find Dent- get
          them both into protective custody.
          Where's the Commissioner?
                       RAMIREZ
          City hall.
                    GORDON
          Seal the building.     No one in or out
          till I get there.
EXT. DECK, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- EVENING
Wayne walks out to the edge of the balcony and looks over
Gotham. Hears someone behind him- Rachel.
                    RACHEL
          Harvey may not know you well enough
          to understand when you're making fun
          of him. But I do.
                    WAYNE
              (shakes his head)
          I meant every word.
Wayne moves closer to Rachel.    Takes her arm.
                    WAYNE
          The day you once told me about, the
          day when Gotham no longer needs
          Batman. It's coming.
Rachel looks at Wayne.    Conflicted.   He moves closer.
                    RACHEL
          You can't ask me to wait for that.
Wayne takes Rachel's arms, looking at her, excited.
                    WAYNE
          It's happening now- Harvey is that
          hero. He locked up half the city's
          criminals, and he did it without
          wearing a mask. Gotham needs a hero
          with a face.
                    DENT
          You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll
          give you that. Thanks again. Mind
          if I borrow Rachel?
Rachel glances back at Wayne as she moves to Dent.    Wayne
watches them head inside.
                                                        49.


EXT. STREET, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- EVENING
Two MEN in suits knock at a Brownstone. The door is opened
by Judge Surrillo. The two Men hold up BADGES.
EXT. CITY HALL -- EVENING
Gordon enters through a tight police presence at the doors.
INT. POLICE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE -- EVENING
Gordon enters to find Loeb, flanked by armed cops.
                    COMMISSIONER LOEB
          Gordon, what are you playing at?
Gordon checks the window.   Turns to his men.
                    GORDON
          We're secure. I want a floor-by-
          floor search of the entire building.
              (turns to Loeb)
          I'm sorry, sir. We believe the Joker
          has made a threat against your life.
                    LOEB
          Gordon, you're unlikely to discover
          this for yourself, so take my word-
          the Police Commissioner earns a lot
          of threats...
Loeb pulls a bottle of whisky and a tumbler from a drawer.
                    LOEB
          I found the appropriate response to
          these situations a long time ago...
EXT. STREET, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- EVENING
The second man is waiting by the Judge's car.
                    SURRILLO
          Gordon wants me to go right now?
                    MAN 1
          These are dangerous people, Judge.
          Even we don't know where you're
          going.
He hands Surrillo a sealed envelope.   Opens the car door.
                    MAN 2
          Get in, then open the envelope.
          It'll tell you where you're headed.
Surrillo climbs in. Watches them drive away. She opens the
envelope- pulls out a sheet of paper. One word on it:
                                                        50.


'UP'.
Surrillo's car EXPLODES, heaving the car upwards on a
FIREBALL.
A PASSERBY is thrown to the ground. After a moment, BURNING
DEBRIS flutters down on him. PLAYING CARDS. JOKERS.
INT. POLICE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
Loeb pours himself a glass of whisky.
                    LOEB
          You get to explain to my wife why I'm
          late for dinner, Lieutenant.
                    GORDON
          Sir, the Joker card had a trace of
          your D.N.A. on it-
A bang at the door.   Gordon pulls his weapon, then opens it.
                    STEPHENS
          Just the normal number of bad guys in
          the building- and they're all city
          employees. Here's a list.
                    LOEB
          How'd they get my D.N.A.?
Gordon looks at Stephens's list.
                    GORDON
          Somebody with access to your house or
          office must've lifted a tissue or a
          glass...
Gordon, realizing, spins around-
                      GORDON
          Wait-
But Loeb is already CHOKING- he DROPS his tumbler onto the
desk- the spilled whiskey is SMOKING, eating into the wood.
                    GORDON
          Get a medic!
Loeb COLLAPSES.
INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- EVENING
Dent pulls Rachel into the kitchen, away from the crowd.
                    DENT
          You cannot leave me on my own with
          these people.
                                                        51.


                    RACHEL
          The whole mob's after you and you're
          worried about these guys?
                    DENT
          Compared to this, the mob doesn't
          scare me. Although, I will say: them
          gunning for you makes you see things
          clearly.
                       RACHEL
          Oh, yeah?
                    DENT
          Yeah. It makes you think about what
          you couldn't stand losing. And who
          you want to spend the rest of your
          life with...
Rachel looks at Dent.    Smiles.
                    RACHEL
          The rest of your life, huh?   That's a
          pretty big commitment.
                    DENT
          Not if the mob has their way.
                       RACHEL
          Don't.
                   DENT
          Okay. Let's be serious.     What's your
          answer?
Rachel looks at him.
                    RACHEL
          I don't have an answer.
INT.LIVING ROOM, PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
Half the guests are on their cell phones.   An ASSISTANT DA
turns to his COLLEAGUE.
                    ASSISTANT DA
          Surrillo and Loeb?
There is a KNOCK at the front door. Alfred opens it it find
Detective Wuertz, who holds up his badge. Alfred beckons him
in- there is a SHOTGUN at the back of his head held by-
The Joker- purple suit, make up. With friends. The Joker
SMASHES Wuertz over the head- steps over him, RACKING the
shotgun.
                                                       52.


                    THE JOKER
          Good evening. We're the
          entertainment.
INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
Rachel is looking at Dent.   Torn.
                    DENT
          I guess no answer isn't "no".
                    RACHEL
          I'm sorry, Harvey.     I just...
                    DENT
          It's someone else, isn't it?
Wayne is moving up behind him.    Fast-
                    DENT
          Just tell me it's not Wayne.       The
          guy's a complete-
Rachel's eyes go wide as Wayne puts Dent in a SLEEPER HOLD-
                    RACHEL
          What are you doing?!
Dent SLUMPS, unconscious in Wayne's arms.
                    WAYNE
          They've come for him.
From the main room- A SHOTGUN BLAST followed by SCREAMS.
Wayne stuffs Dent in a closet- puts a mop through the
handles. Rushes past Rachel-
                    WAYNE
          Stay hidden.
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
The Joker and his THUGS pour into the room, weapons raised.
INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
A THUG appears in front of Wayne, toting a shotgun.
                    THUG
          Hands up, pretty boy.
Wayne FLIPS the shotgun around in the man's hands- uses it as
a fulcrum to SNAP his forearm- SMASHES him in the jaw with
the stock without breaking step, field stripping the shotgun
and tossing the pieces in different directions.
                                                           53.


INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
The Joker moves through the terrified guests.   Smiling.
                    THE JOKER
          I only have one question: where is
          Harvey Dent?
              (silence)
          I'll settle for his loved ones...
A distinguished Gentleman steps into the Joker's path.
                    GENTLEMAN
          We're not intimidated by thugs.
The Joker stops.   Stares at the man.   SMILES AFFECTIONATELY.
                    THE JOKER
          You know, you remind me of my father.
              (GRABS him)
          I hated my father.
The Joker has his blade in the Gentleman's mouth.
                     RACHEL
          Stop!
The Joker drops the Gentleman.   Turns to Rachel.
                    THE JOKER
          Hello, beautiful. You must be
          Harvey's squeeze.
              (runs his knife across her
               cheek)
          And you are beautiful. You look
          nervous- it's the scars isn't it?
          Wanna know how I got them? I had a
          wife, beautiful like you. Who tells
          me I worry too much. Who says I need
          to smile more. Who gambles. And
          gets in deep with the sharks. One
          day they carve her face, and we've
          got no money for surgeries. She
          can't take it.
              (presses knife into her
               cheek)
          I just want to see her smile again.
          I just want her to know I don't care
          about the scars. So I put a razor in
          my mouth and do this to myself...
          And you know what?
              (starts laughing)
          She can't stand the sight of me...
              (or crying)
          She leaves! See, now I see the funny
          side. Now I'm always smiling.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
Wayne walks in. A COUPLE are hastily putting themselves back
together, alerted by the noise.
                    MALE GUEST
          What's going on out there, Wayne?
Wayne doesn't answer. He walks into a closet and pulls at a
FALSE WALL. Wayne steps into the safe room.
                    FEMALE GUEST
          Thank god- you've got a panic room.
The door SLAMS shut and seals with a HISS.
                     MALE GUEST
          Wait!   You can't-
                    FEMALE GUEST
          You've got to be kidding me.
INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
The Joker raises his knife from Rachel's cheek.   She SLUGS
him. He smiles.
                    THE JOKER
          A little fight in you.   I like that.
                    BATMAN
          Then you're going to love me.
The Joker turns. Batman catches him with a BLOW, spins him
down and DISARMS him- the Joker's men jump him- Batman takes
them out two at a time- DISARMING thugs- BREAKING forearms-
the Joker CLICKS a BLADE from the toe of his shoe and KICKS-
JABBING BETWEEN THE PLATES OF ARMOR covering Batman's ribcage-
Batman HURLS the Joker across the room.   One of the Joker's
men LUNGES- Batman lays him out cold.
The Joker has another knife pressed to Rachel's neck.
                    BATMAN
          Drop the knife.
                    THE JOKER
          Sure. Just take off your mask and
          show us all who you are...
Rachel shakes her head at Batman. The Joker raises his
shotgun to the side and BLOWS OUT the pane of glass next to
him. The Joker dangles Rachel out the window.
                    BATMAN
          Let her go.
                                                       55.


                    THE JOKER
              (laughs)
          Very poor choice of words...
He lets her DROP- Rachel falls onto a SLOPING GLASS ROOF-
sliding towards the edge Batman DIVES after her-
EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT
They DROP- Batman FIRES his grapple, SNAGGING Rachel's ankle-
activates one wing of his cape- They SPIN and SLOW- Batman
envelopes Rachel- they SLAM into the hood of a passing taxi.
INT. TAXI -- CONTINUOUS
The DRIVER SCREAMS as Batman and Rachel hit the roof- ROLL
down the windshield- onto the pavement. Alive.
INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker looks back as his car SPEEDS away. He's breathing
hard, EXHILARATED. He touches the blood running down his
sweaty white makeup. SMACKS the back of the driver's seat-
                    DRIVER
          What do we do about Dent?
                    THE JOKER
          I'm a man of my word.
EXT. TAXI -- CONTINUOUS
Rachel opens her eyes.
                    BATMAN
          Are you alright?
                    RACHEL
          Let's not do that again, okay?
              (looks around)
          Is Harvey-?
                       BATMAN
          He's safe.
Rachel lies back, breathing.    Looks up at Batman.

          As long as they don't get to Lau,
          we've cut off their funds.
                    STEPHENS
          But the prosecution's over.
                    STEPHENS
          No-one's standing up in front of a
          Judge while judges and police
          commissioners are getting blown away.
                    GORDON
          What about Dent?
                    STEPHENS
          If he's got any sense, Dent's halfway
          to Mexico by now.
The door BURSTS OPEN.    Dent.   Fire in his eyes.
                    DENT
          So where do you keep your trash?
Gordon looks at Dent.    Impressed.
INT. SPECIAL HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY
Lau looks up as Dent walks in, holding a bullet proof vest.
                    DENT
          You're due in court- I need you alive
          long enough to get you on the record.
                    LAU
          No way. You can't protect me- you
          can't even protect yourselves.
Dent THROWS the heavy vest at Lau.
                    DENT
          Refuse to cooperate on the stand- you
          won't be coming back here- you'll go
          to county. How long do you calculate
          you'll last in there?
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY
Wayne sits at his video screens- they all play the Joker's
video with different IMAGE TREATMENTS and SOUND TUNINGS.
Wayne turns to Alfred. Indicates the screens.
                    WAYNE
          Targeting me won't get their money
          back. I knew the mob wouldn't go
          down without a fight, but this is
          different. They've crossed a line.
                                                       57.


                    ALFRED
          You crossed it first, sir. You've
          hammered them, squeezed them to the
          point of desperation. And now, in
          their desperation they've turned to a
          man they don't fully understand.
Wayne gets up from his monitors, raises the bat-cabinet.
                    WAYNE
          Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.
          We just have to figure out what he's
          after.
                    ALFRED
          Respectfully, Master Wayne, perhaps
          this is a man you don't fully
          understand, either.
                    ALFRED
              (looks at Wayne)
          I was in Burma. A long time ago. My
          friends and I were working for the
          local government. They were trying
          to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders,
          bribing them with precious stones.
          But their caravans were being raided
          in a forest north of Rangoon by a
          bandit. We were asked to take care
          of the problem, so we started
          looking for the stones. But after
          six months, we couldn't find anyone
          who had traded with him.
                    WAYNE
          What were you missing?
                    ALFRED
          One day I found a child playing with
          a ruby as big as a tangerine.
              (shrugs)
          The bandit had been throwing the
          stones away.
                    WAYNE
          So why was he stealing them?
                    ALFRED
          Because he thought it was good sport.
          Because some men aren't looking for
          anything logical, like money... they
          can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or
          negotiated with.
              (grave)
          Some men just want to watch the world
          burn.
Wayne stares at Alfred.   Reaches for the bat-suit.

EXT. SKYLINE OF GOTHAM -- DAWN
MOVING over the city we hear myriad RADIO CALLS going out
over the ether. CLOSE IN on a lonely figure on top of a
skyscraper. The Batman. Listening with his million dollar
earpieces. From the babble, ONE VOICE EMERGES.
                    DISPATCH (O.S.)
          Your name, sir. Please state-
                    VOICE (O.S.)
          8th at orchard. You'll find Harvey
          Dent there.
EXT. 8TH STREET AT ORCHARD -- DAWN
An UNMARKED and a SQUAD CAR screech to a halt. Gordon and
Ramirez get out, lead two UNIFORMS into the building.
INT. APARTMENT, EIGHT AVE. -- CONTINUOUS
The door SMASHES OPEN, Gordon- gun drawn- takes in the scene.
TWO DEAD MEN sitting at the kitchen table. They each have a
HAND OF CARDS, as if in the middle of a game. ALL JOKERS.
Gordon and Ramirez STARE at the CRUDE LEERS carved into their
faces. Their DRIVERS LICENSES are pinned to their chests.
                    VOICE
          Check the names.
                    GORDON
              (checks licenses)
          Patrick Harvey. Richard Dent...
                    RAMIREZ
          Harvey Dent.
                    BATMAN
          I need ten minutes with the scene
          before your men contaminate it.
                    RAMIREZ
          Us contaminate it? It's because of
          you that these guys are dead in the
          first place-
                     GORDON
          Ramirez.
She stands down. Batman moves past the bodies to the wall.
Finds an embedded stray bullet. He pulls a SAWING DEVICE
from his belt- THRUSTS it into the wall and starts cutting
around the bullet.
                    GORDON
          That's brick- you're gonna try and
          take ballistics off a shattered
          bullet?
                                                          59.


                     BATMAN
          No.   Fingerprints.
Ramirez looks at Gordon.   Is he serious?   Gordon points-
                    GORDON
          Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast,
          'cos we know his next target...
Batman looks- a campaign poster: RE-ELECT MAYOR GARCIA.      The
Mayor's image has a MANIC CLOWN'S GRIN and "HA,HA,HA".
INT. FOX'S OFFICE, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY
Fox is at his desk.   Reese enters.
                    FOX
          What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?
                    REESE
          You asked me to do the diligence on
          the L.S.I.Holdings deal again. I
          found irregularities.
                    FOX
          Their CEO is in police custody.
                    REESE
          Not with their numbers. With yours.
          A whole division of Wayne Industries
          disappeared, overnight. So I went
          down to the archives and started
          pulling old files.
He pulls out a folded blueprint.   Slides it across the desk.
                    REESE
          My kids love the Batman.    I thought
          he was pretty cool, too.    Out there,
          kicking some ass.
Fox picks up the piece of paper. Unfolds it. It's an old
BLUEPRINT. The image is unmistakable: THE TUMBLER.
                    REESE
          Changes things when you know it's
          just a rich kid playing dress up.
Reese points to the approval box in the corner of the page.
                    REESE
          Your project. Don't tell me you
          didn't recognize your baby pancaking
          cop cars on the evening news. Now
          you're getting sloppy. Applied
          Sciences was a small, dead department-
          who'd notice?
                    (MORE)
                                                            60.
                    REESE (cont'd)
          But now you've got the entire R and D
          department burning cash, claiming
          it's related to cell phones for the
          army. What are you building him now?
          A rocket ship? I want ten million a
          year. For the rest of my life.
Fox looks at him.    Even.   Folds up the blueprint.
                    FOX
          Let me get this straight. You think
          that your client, one of the
          wealthiest and most powerful men in
          the world, is secretly a vigilante
          who spends his nights beating
          criminals to a pulp with his bare
          hands...
              (deadpan)
          And now your plan is to blackmail
          this person?
Reese stares at Fox.    Who smiles.   And slides the blueprint
across the desk.
                       FOX
          Good luck.
Reese looks at it.   Then at Fox.     Swallows.   Slides it back.
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY
Wayne hands Alfred a RIFLE BULLET scribed with a GRID. He
slots it into a clip, then loads it into a COMPUTER
CONTROLLED GATTLING GUN. He puts on ear protectors. Hits a
button.
The rifle WHIRS to life- dollying sideways, BLASTING BULLETS
into a series of identical BRICK WALL SAMPLES.
                    ALFRED
          I'm not sure you made it loud enough,
          sir.
As the wall samples still smoke, Wayne steps up, carrying the
sample from the crime scene. Comparing its spread to the new
samples, he selects two and carries them to an X-RAY SCANNER.
The machine gives the samples a 3-axis scan- HI-RES 3-D
IMAGES of the bullet fragment arrays come up on the screen...
INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- DAY
The same image of the bullet fragment on a screen. Fox hits
a key and the computer 'reassembles' the bullets according to
the identifying grid on each fragment.
                    FOX
          Here's your original scan...
                                                       61.


A bullet fragment array pops on screen.
                    FOX
          Here's it reverse-engineered...
Fox hits a button and the unmarked bullet fragments are
reassembled. Wayne spins the roughly-shaped bullet puzzle-
                    WAYNE
          And here's a thumb print.
Fox looks at the screen, impressed.   Thinks.
                    FOX
          I'll make you a copy.
              (troubled)
          Mr.Wayne, did you reassign R and D?
                   WAYNE
          Yes. Government telecommunications
          project.
                    FOX
          I wasn't aware we had any new
          government contracts. Can you-
                    WAYNE
          Lucius. I'm playing this one pretty
          close to the chest.
                    FOX
          Fair enough.
Fox looks at Wayne as he leaves.   Uneasy.
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- CONTINUOUS -- INTERCUT
Wayne examines the fingerprint-
                    WAYNE
          I've run it through all the databases
          and came up with four possibles.
Wayne gets up to let Alfred sit.
                    WAYNE (CONT’D)
          Cross-reference the addresses.
          Look for Parkside and around.
Wayne opens a HYDRAULIC DOOR, revealing a gleaming MV AUGUSTA
BRUTALE. As he moves the bike onto the lift...
                    ALFRED
          Got one. Melvin White, aggravated
          assault, moved to Arkham twice- 1502
          Randolph Apartments, just off State-
                                                          62.


                    WAYNE
          Overlooking the parade.
Wayne and the bike rise on the lift.
EXT. PARKSIDE AVENUE -- DAY
The avenue has been blocked off. Onlookers line the
sidewalks. POLICE march past in dress uniform. Engel does a
stand-up on the sidewalk.
                    ENGEL
          With no word from the Batman- even as
          they mourn Commissioner Loeb, these
          cops have to be wondering if the
          Joker is going to make good on his
          threat to kill the Mayor today...
On the buildings above, POLICE SNIPERS scan the crowd.
Gordon keys his radio-
                    GORDON
          How's it looking up top?
                    POLICE SNIPER
          We're tight. But frankly... there's
          a lot of windows up here.
Gordon looks up at the myriad buildings overlooking the
podium.
EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne maneuvers the Ducati through the traffic. He pulls up
near a parade barricade- dismounts and slips into an alley.
INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Some of the building's hard-luck TENANTS eye Wayne as he
counts doors down the hallway. He finds 1502...
EXT. PARKSIDE AVENUE -- LATER
A SEA OF POLICE fills the Avenue. In the center, three
grieving families and an HONOR GUARD. The Mayor at the
podium. Gordon behind. Dent is seated with Rachel.
                    THE MAYOR
          ...and as we recognize the sacrifice
          of these officers, we must remember
          that vigilance is the price of
          safety.
INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne enters: EIGHT MEN IN UNDERSHIRTS, bound, gagged,
blindfolded. A SNIPER SCOPE on a tripod at the window.
Wayne moves to the first man, RIPS the tape from his mouth.
                                                         63.

          Took... they took our guns, our
          uniforms...
EXT. PARKSIDE AVENUE -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon scans the crowd. The Mayor wraps up- the Honor Guard
steps forward, raises weapons...
EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS
A POLICE SNIPER scans the windows of the tenement...
INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne RACES to the window, looks through the SCOPE to see:
EXT. STATE STREET -- CONTINUOUS
THE HONOR GUARD TURN THEIR WEAPONS ON THE MAYOR.   One SMILES,
flesh-colored makeup over his scars. THE JOKER.
Gordon LEAPS FORWARD- they FIRE- GORDON TAKES SHOTS TO THE
BACK as he SLAMS the Mayor to the ground-
EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS
The Police Sniper SPOTS Wayne at the window- SHOOTS-
INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne DUCKS as SHOTS erupt around the window-
EXT. PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS
PANDEMONIUM erupts-One of the honor guard is TAGGED IN THE
LEG- GOES DOWN. The others MELT into the CHAOS.
On the podium, Stephens rolls Gordon over... he is not
moving.
EXT. SIDE STREET OFF PARKSIDE -- MOMENTS LATER
CHAOS. Dent approaches an ambulance sitting in the alley.
Two cops jump out and run over to their commander. Dent
steps up into the back.
INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker's thug sits there. Handcuffed. A PARAMEDIC
bandages his leg. Cops run past, barking orders.
                    DENT
          Tell me what you know about the
          Joker.
                                                           64.


The Joker's thug looks at Dent. Smirks. Dent looks down.
Exasperated. Looks back up at the Joker's Thug. Spots
something- moves closer- the man's uniform... his name tag...
OFFICER RACHEL DAWES.
Dent, breathing hard, looks around: the paramedic jumps out,
rushing to help a FALLEN OFFICER. Dent spies the keys in the
ignition. Jumps into the driver's seat...
EXT. GORDON'S HOUSE -- DUSK
Barbara Gordon stands in the doorway, scared.      Stephens and a
UNIFORMED OFFICER stand in front of her.
                    STEPHENS
          I'm sorry, Barbara.
James Gordon pushes past his mother to look at Stephens.
Barbara tries to push him back inside.
                    BARBARA
          Jimmy, go play with your sister...
James stays just inside the door.
                       STEPHENS
          I'm sorry.
Barbara stares at Stephens.       Then looks past him.
                    BARBARA
          Are you out there?!       Are you?!
James spots something- Batman, perched in the shadows.
                    BARBARA
          You brought this on us! This
          craziness! You did! You brought
          this...!
She collapses into Stephens's arms.      Batman hangs his head.
EXT. ROOF, MCU -- NIGHT
Detectives from MCU stand around the lit bat-signal.
                    STEPHENS
          Switch it off- he ain't coming.
          He doesn't want to talk to us. God
          help whoever he does want to talk to-
INT. NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT
Strobe lights. Pounding music. Maroni is in a booth at the
side with his MISTRESS. His bodyguards are around the table.
                                                         65.


                    MISTRESS
              (shouting over music)
          Can't we go someplace quieter!    We
          can't hear each other talk!
                    MARONI
          I don't wanna hear you talk.
                    MISTRESS
              (can't hear)
          What?!
One of Maroni's Bodyguards DROPS- Maroni looks over- in the
strobe lights- Batman SAVAGES his bodyguards- people RUN,
TERRIFIED. Maroni starts to get out of his seat- Batman
LANDS like a panther on the table in front of him-
INT. MCU -- NIGHT
Rachel moves through the chaotic bullpen at MCU-
EYEWITNESSES, civilian and cop are being questioned.
Rachel's phone rings.
                    RACHEL
          Harvey, where are you?!
INTERCUT with Dent in an INDISTINCT interior setting.

          This is Gordon's unit, Harvey-
                    DENT
          Gordon's gone, Rachel.
                    RACHEL
          He vouched for these men-
                    DENT
          And he's gone. The Joker's named you
          next.
Rachel looks around the bullpen.    Eyeing the detectives.
                    DENT
          Rachel, I can't let anything happen

          Okay. Go straight there. Don't tell

INT. BASEMENT, CONDEMNED BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
                    DENT
          I love you.
Dent hangs up the phone. TAPED to a chair in front of Dent-
the Joker's Thug, blindfolded. Dent RIPS off the
blindfold...
EXT. FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT
Maroni opens his eyes.   Batman is holding him by the collar.
                    BATMAN
          I want the Joker.
                    MARONI
              (looks down)
          From one professional to another-if
          you're trying to scare someone, pick
          a better spot. From this height the
          fall wouldn't kill me.
                    BATMAN
          I'm counting on it.
Batman lets go.    Maroni FALLS.   And SCREAMS.
EXT. SIDEWALK -- NIGHT
Maroni NAILS the pavement. CLUTCHES at his leg, which is
badly broken. Batman FLIES down, landing over him- hauls him
up. Maroni HOLLERS in pain.
                    BATMAN
          Where is he?
                    MARONI
          I don't know, he found us-

          Friends?     You met this guy?
                    BATMAN
          Someone knows where he is.
Maroni looks up at Batman.    Sneering.
                    MARONI
          No one's gonna tell you anything-
          they're wise to your act- you got
          rules... the Joker, he's got no
          rules. No one's gonna cross him for
          you. You want this guy, you got one
          way. And you already know what that
          is. Just take off that mask and let
          him come find you.
Batman DROPS Maroni.
                     MARONI
          Or you want to let a couple more
          people get killed while you make up
          your mind?
INT. BASEMENT, CONDEMNED BUILDING -- NIGHT
Dent shows the Joker's Thug a GUN.    Bullets.   Loads the gun.
SHOVES it in his face-
                    DENT
          You wanna play games?
Dent PUSHES the gun against the thug's head with REAL MALICE.
Pulls it away and FIRES. The Thug FLINCHES. Dent puts the
gun barrel against the thug's temple-
                    JOKER'S THUG
              (rattled)
          You wouldn't...
And pulls his lucky coin out of his pocket.
                    DENT
          No. I wouldn't. That's why I'm not
          going to leave it up to me.
              (shows him coin)
          Heads- you get to keep your head.
          Tails... not so lucky. So, you want
          to tell me about the Joker?
The Thug, scared, says nothing. Dent FLICKS the coin into
the air. SLAPS it onto the back of his gun hand (aiming with
wrist horizontal). Dent shows him the coin. Heads. The
Thug exhales, SHAKING.
                                                           68.


                      DENT
          Go again?
                    JOKER'S THUG
              (sobbing)
          I don't know anything!
                    DENT
          You're not playing the odds, friend.
Dent tosses the coin again.   This time IT DOESN'T LAND.   Dent
looks up. Batman is there.
                    BATMAN
          You'd leave a man's life to chance?
                    DENT
          Not exactly.
                    BATMAN
          His name's Schiff, Thomas. He's a
          paranoid schizophrenic, a former
          patient at Arkham. The kind of mind
          the Joker attracts.
Batman moves away from Schiff.
                    BATMAN
          What do expect to learn from him?
Dent is shivering with frustration.
                    DENT
          The Joker killed Gordon- and, and
          Loeb. He's going to kill Rachel...
                    BATMAN
          You're the symbol of hope that I
          could never be. Your stand against
          organized crime is the first
          legitimate ray of light in Gotham for
          decades. If anyone saw this,
          everything would be undone- all the
          criminals you got off the streets
          would be released. And Jim Gordon
          will have died for nothing.
Batman hands Dent his lucky coin.
                    BATMAN
          You're going to call a press
          conference. Tomorrow morning.
                      DENT
          Why?
                                                              69.


                       BATMAN
             No one else will die because of me.
             Gotham is in your hands, now.
                          DENT
             You can't!     You can't give in!
But Batman is gone.
INT. BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT
Rachel watches Gotham through the window.        Wayne enters.
                       RACHEL
             Harvey called. He says Batman is
             going to turn himself in.
                       WAYNE
             I have no choice.
                       RACHEL
             You honestly think it's going to stop
             the Joker from killing?
                       WAYNE
             Perhaps not. But I've got enough
             blood on my hands. I've seen, now,
             what I would have to become to stop
             men like him.
Rachel looks at Wayne.       She cannot help him.
                       WAYNE
             You once told me that if the day came
             when I was finished...
Wayne moves towards her.
                       WAYNE
             We'd be together.
                       RACHEL
             Bruce, don't make me your one hope
             for a normal life-
Wayne takes her in his arms.
                       WAYNE
             But did you mean it?
                          RACHEL
             Yes.
They kiss.    Then separate.       She looks sadly into his eyes.
                       RACHEL
             But they won't let us be together
             after you turn yourself in.
                                                            70.


Wayne nods.   Leaves.   She watches him go.
INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAWN
Alfred shovels DOCUMENTS into an incinerator- blueprints,
designs, files. He pauses, looking down at a book.
                    ALFRED
          Even the logs?
                    WAYNE
          Anything that could lead back to
          Lucius or Rachel.
Alfred tosses the book onto the fire.    STARES at Wayne.
                    WAYNE
          People are dying, Alfred.     What would
          you have me do?
Alfred looks into Wayne's eyes with a fearsome gaze.
                    ALFRED
          Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.
          They'll hate you for it, but that's
          the point of Batman... he can be the
          outcast. He can make the choice no
          one else can face. The right choice.
Wayne shakes his head.
                    WAYNE
          Today I've found out what Batman
          can't do. He can't endure this.
              (rueful smile)
          Today you get to say 'I told you so'.
                     ALFRED
          Today, I don't want to.
              (beat)
          Although I did bloody tell you.
Wayne sinks the Bat-suit, Alfred closes the incinerator.
They head for the lift.
                    ALFRED
          I suppose they'll lock me up as well.
          Your accomplice.
                    WAYNE
          Accomplice? I'm going to tell them
          the whole thing was your idea.
They power down, leaving the Bat-bunker in darkness.
                                                           71.


INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY
A capacity crowd of REPORTERS, COPS, and PUBLIC.   Dent is at
the podium. Wayne sits in the crowd.
                    DENT
          Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for
          coming. I've called this press
          conference for two reasons. Firstly,
          to assure the citizens of Gotham that
          everything that can be done over the
          Joker killing is being done.
          Secondly, because the Batman has
          offered to turn himself in-
The crowd REACTS-
                    HECKLER
          So where is he?!
                    DENT
          But first. Let's consider the
          situation: should we give in to this
          terrorist's demands? Do we really
          think that-
                     REPORTER
          You'd rather protect an outlaw
          vigilante than the lives of
          citizens?!
The crowd noisily assents.    Dent calmly motions quiet.
                    DENT
          The Batman is an outlaw...
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Rachel is watching the press conference on TV.
                    DENT (O.S.)
          But that's not why we're demanding he
          turn himself in. We're doing it
          because we're scared. We've been
          happy to let Batman clean up our
          streets for us until now-
INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- CONTINUOUS
                    HECKLER
          Things are worse than ever!
Wayne looks at the Heckler. At the angry crowd.    Dent leans
over the podium. Impassioned.
                    DENT
          Yes. They are. But the night is
          darkest just before the dawn.

                                                           72.
                     DENT (cont'd)
           And I promise you, the dawn is
           coming.
               (the crowd quiets)
           One day, the Batman will have to
           answer for the laws he's broken- but
           to us, not to this madman.
The crowd seems moved by his words, then, a CHANT-
                     COP HECKLER
           NO MORE DEAD COPS!!
Appreciative noise.
                     REPORTER
           WHERE IS THE BATMAN?
People take up the chant.     Dent has lost them.   He knows it.
                     DENT
           So be it.
               (turns to officers)
           Take the Batman into custody.
At this, a HUSH DESCENDS. Wayne is sitting towards the back.
Hungry eyes scan the room. Wayne starts to rise... DENT
OFFERS HIS OWN WRISTS TO THE OFFICERS-
                     DENT
           I am the Batman.
A beat.   Wayne stares.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Rachel STARES as Dent is arrested on TV.    Appalled.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Rachel comes up to Alfred.     Upset.
                     RACHEL
           Why is he letting Harvey do this,
           Alfred?
                     ALFRED
           I don't know. He went down to the
           press conference-
                     RACHEL
           And just stood by?!
                     ALFRED
           Perhaps both Bruce and Mr.Dent
           believe that Batman stands for
           something more important than a
           terrorist's whims, Miss Dawes, even
           if everyone hates him for it.

                                                        73.
                    ALFRED (cont'd)
          That's the sacrifice he's making- to
          not be a hero. To be something more.
                    RACHEL
          Well, you're right about one thing-
          letting Harvey take the fall is not
          heroic.
Rachel holds out an ENVELOPE.
                    RACHEL
          You know Bruce best, Alfred... give
          it to him when the time is right.
                    ALFRED
          How will I know?
                    RACHEL
          It's not sealed.
Alfred takes the envelope.   Rachel gives him a kiss.
                    RACHEL
          Goodbye, Alfred.
                    ALFRED
          Goodbye, Rachel.
INT. CELL, MCU -- EVENING
A Detective unlocks the cell and lets Rachel inside.
                    DENT
          I'm sorry, I didn't have time to talk
          this through with you.
                    RACHEL
          Don't offer yourself as bait, Harvey.
                    DENT
          They're transferring me to central
          holding. This is the Joker's chance,
          and when he attacks, Batman will take
          him down.
                     RACHEL
          No.   This is too dangerous-
The Detective knocks.   Dent rises.
EXT. COURTYARD MCU -- EVENING
Detectives stare at Dent as he is led, shackled, to the
waiting CONVOY. Stephens begins CLAPPING- a handful join in,
but most remain silent. Rachel follows him to the back of an
armored vehicle.
                                                         74.


                    RACHEL
          He's using you as bait- but he
          doesn't know if he can get the Joker-
          he's failed so far.
                    DENT
          How do you know what he's thinking?
                     RACHEL
              (beat)
          I just do, okay? Harvey, this isn't
          just about you, what about all the
          people counting on you to turn this
          city around? Tell everyone the truth-
Dent kisses her.   Pulls out his LUCKY COIN-
                    DENT
          Heads I go through with it.
                    RACHEL
          This is your life... you don't leave
          something like this to chance...
Dent tosses it at her- Rachel catches it.   Looks.   Heads.
                    DENT
              (sincere)
          I'm not.
She turns it over: IT IS DOUBLE-HEADED. She looks up- the
DOORS CLOSE on his smile. She shakes her head. Torn.
                    RACHEL
          You make your own luck.
As SWATS file into the back of the support vehicles-

          We get this guy to County and he's

A SECOND TRUCK SMASHES into the SWAT van at the head of the
convoy, SMASHING it through the concrete barriers and INTO
THE RIVER. The truck is branded "LAUGHTER" but and "S" has
been spayed at the front to make "SLAUGHTER" with "HA, HA,
HA" all over the side...
The Joker's Truck DODGES between the support columns and into
the oncoming lane- pulls alongside the armored car.
The Driver looks over. The cargo door on the truck slides
open. Inside, the Joker, holding a machine gun.
The armored car LOCKS up its brakes, but the garbage truck
pushes it forward as the Joker fires- BULLETS slamming into
the side of the vehicle-

EXT. PARKSIDE -- NIGHT
The Joker walks towards the Bat-pod, which SPEEDS towards
him. He is FIRING his gun RANDOMLY at the oncoming traffic.
                      THE JOKER
          Hit me.    Come on. Hit me.
Batman watches as the Joker holds out his arms.   Waiting for
impact. There is no room to go around him.
Batman LOCKS UP THE BRAKES.
The Joker watches as Batman DUMPS the bike, rather than
smashing into him. Batman SLAMS into the wall.
The Joker's thug reach Batman first. He is unconscious. The
first Thug pulls at the mask. An ELECTRIC SHOCK from the bat-
suit THROWS him back. The Joker LAUGHS. Flicks his
switchblade. Crouches-
                      VOICE
          Drop it.
                    THE JOKER
          Just give me a second.
The gun is COCKED. The Joker drops the knife. Sits. Looks
back. Behind them is the armored car. The man standing over
him is the Driver. He pulls off his helmet.
It's JIM GORDON.    Back from the dead.
                    GORDON
          We got you, you son of a bitch.

INT. ARMORED CAR -- MOMENTS LATER
Dent looks up as the door swings open to reveal Gordon.      Dent
GRINS.
                       DENT
             Lieutenant, you do like to play it
             pretty close to the chest...
                       GORDON
             We got him, Harvey.
Dent nods.    Respect in his eyes.   They shake hands.
EXT. PARKSIDE -- NIGHT
A small army of cops have sealed off the roadway.      Gordon
pulls away in the squad car containing the Joker.
REPORTERS clamor for an interview with Dent, who is being
helped out of the van by the SWATS. Ramirez pushes through
the pack, shoving reporters aside.
                       RAMIREZ
             Let him be! He's been through enough-
Dent follows Ramirez to a squad car- Wuertz is in the
driver's seat. Dent smiles at Ramirez as she opens the rear
door.
                       DENT
             Thanks, detective- I've got a date
             with a pretty upset fiancée.
                       RAMIREZ
             I figured, counselor.
Ramirez shuts the door on Dent.      Signals Wuertz to pull out.
INT. HOLDING, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker sits in a holding cage. His makeup has run, his
clothes a mess- but his calm lends him an odd dignity. COPS
SMASH their night sticks against the bars near the Joker's
head. The Joker does not flinch.
                       GORDON
             Stand away! All of you. I don't
             want anything for his mob lawyer to
             use, understand? Handle this guy
             like he's made of glass.
The Mayor walks in.    Shakes Gordon's hand.
                       MAYOR
             Back from the dead.
                                                        83.


                    GORDON
          I couldn't chance my family's safety.
The Mayor looks over at the Joker in his cage.
                    MAYOR
          What do we got?
                    GORDON
          Nothing. No matches on prints, DNA,
          dental. Clothing is custom, no
          labels. Nothing in his pockets but
          knives and lint. No name, no other
          alias... nothing.
                    MAYOR
          Go home, Gordon. The clown'll keep
          till morning. Get some rest- you're
          going to need it. Tomorrow, you take
          the big job.
              (off look)
          You don't have any say in the matter.
              (louder, for all)
          Commissioner Gordon.
The cops in M.C.U. start CHEERING.
EXT. GORDON HOME -- NIGHT
Gordon rings the bell.   Barbara answers it, dressed in black.
                    GORDON
          I couldn't tell you.   I couldn't risk-
She SLAPS Gordon.   He grabs her, holds her tight as she sobs.
INT. HOLDING, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker's men are processed. In the harsh light, the men
look a little ridiculous in their clown make-up. DETECTIVE
MURPHY turns to Stephens.
                    DETECTIVE MURPHY
          Look at these ugly bastards.
One of the men, walks over, clutching at his belly.
                    FAT THUG
          I don't feel good.
                    DETECTIVE MURPHY
          You're a cop killer. You're lucky to
          be feeling anything below the neck.
Alone in his cage, the Joker smiles at this.
                                                           84.


INT. KIDS' BEDROOM, GORDON HOME -- NIGHT
Gordon crouches by his son's beside. He reaches out to touch
James Jr's cheek. James's eyes open. Staring at his dad as
if still dreaming.
                    JAMES
              (whispers)
          Did Batman save you, dad?
Gordon looks at his son.   A little pride seeps in.
                    GORDON
          Actually, this time I saved him.
Gordon's phone rings-
INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Gordon PUSHES through the swarm of detectives crowded into
the observation room. The Joker can be seen through the
glass, as well as on a large MONITOR. Sitting there. Calm.
                    GORDON
          Has he said anything, yet?
Ramirez shakes her head.   Gordon PUSHES through a door...
INT. INTERROGATION, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker, in near darkness.    Gordon walks in.   Sits.
                    THE JOKER
          Evening, Commissioner.
                    GORDON
          Harvey Dent never made it home.
                    THE JOKER
          Of course not.
                    GORDON
          What have you done with him?
                    THE JOKER
              (laughs)
          Me? I was right here. Who did you
          leave him with? Your people?
          Assuming, of course, that they are
          your people not Maroni's...
              (off look)
          Does it depress you, Lieutenant, to
          know how alone you are?
Gordon can't help glancing at the mounted CAMERA.
                                                           85.


                     THE JOKER
           Does it make you feel responsible for
           Harvey Dent's current predicament?
                     GORDON
           Where is he?
                     THE JOKER
           What time is it?
                     GORDON
           What difference does that make?
                     THE JOKER
           Depending on the time, he might be in
           one spot.
               (smiles)
           Or several.
Gordon stands.     Moves to the Joker.   Undoes his handcuffs.
                     GORDON
           If we're going to play games, I'm
           going to need a cup of coffee.
                     THE JOKER
           The good cop, bad cop routine?
Gordon pauses, hand on the doorknob.
                     GORDON
           Not exactly.
Gordon steps out. The overhead lights COME ON. BATMAN IS
BEHIND HIM. The Joker BLINKS in the HARSH WHITE LIGHT.
WHAM! The Joker's face HITS the table- comes up for air-
CRACK! CRACK! To the head. Batman is in front of him. The
Joker stares, fascinated. Bleeding.
                     THE JOKER
           Never start with the head... victim
           gets fuzzy. Can't feel the next-
CRACK!   Batman's fist SMACKS down on the Joker's fingers.
                           THE JOKER
                  (calm)
           See?
                     BATMAN
           You wanted me. Here I am.
                     THE JOKER
           I wanted to see what you'd do.     And
           you didn't disappoint...
               (laughs)
           You let five people die.

                    THE JOKER (cont'd)
          Then you let Dent take your place.
          Even to a guy like me... that's cold-
                    BATMAN
          Where's Dent?
                    THE JOKER
          Those mob fools want you gone so they
          can get back to the way things were.
          But I know the truth- there's no
          going back. You've changed things.
          Forever.
                    BATMAN
          Then why do you want to kill me?
The Joker starts LAUGHING. After a moment he's laughing so
hard it sounds like SOBBING.
                    THE JOKER
          Kill you? I don't want to kill you.
          What would I do without you? Go back
          to ripping off Mob dealers? No
          you...
              (points)
          You. Complete. Me.
                    BATMAN
          You're garbage who kills for money.
                    THE JOKER
          Don't talk like one of them- you're
          not, even if you'd like to be. To
          them you're a freak like me... they
          just need you right now.
He regards Batman with something approaching pity.
                    THE JOKER
          But as soon as they don't, they'll
          cast you out like a leper.
The Joker looks into Batman's eyes.   Searching.
                    THE JOKER
          Their morals, their code... it's a
          bad joke. Dropped at the first sign
          of trouble. They're only as good as
          the world allows them to be. You'll
          see- I'll show you... when the chips
          are down, these civilized people...
          they'll eat each other.
              (grins)
          See, I'm not a monster... I'm just
          ahead of the curve.
Batman GRABS the Joker and pulls him upright.

                    THE JOKER
          You have these rules.   And you think
          they'll save you.
                    BATMAN
          I have one rule.
                    THE JOKER
          Then that's the one you'll have to
          break. To know the truth.
                      BATMAN
          Which is?
                    THE JOKER
              (smiles)
          The only sensible way to live in this

          you're going to break your one
          rule...
Batman leans in to the Joker.
                    BATMAN
          I'm considering it.

          There are just minutes left- so,

Batman PUNCHES the Joker across the face.   HARD.
                    BATMAN
          WHERE ARE THEY?!
The Joker FEEDS off Batman's anger.   Loving it.
                    THE JOKER
          ...you choose one life over the
          other. Your friend, the district
          attorney. Or his blushing bride-to-
          be.
Batman PUNCHES the Joker again.   The Joker LAUGHS.
                    THE JOKER
          You have nothing. Nothing to
          threaten me with. Nothing to do with
          all your strength...
              (spits a tooth)
          But don't worry, I'm going to tell
          you where they are. Both of them,
          and that's the point- you'll have to
          choose.
The Batman stares at the Joker...
                    THE JOKER
          He's at 250 52nd Boulevard. And
          she's on avenue X at Cicero.
                                                         89.


Batman DROPS him.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Batman RACES past Gordon.
                    GORDON
          Which one are you-
                    BATMAN
          Dent knew the risks.
Gordon looks back- the Joker is bloody, but grinning.
EXT. MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Several cops see Batman climb onto the bat-pod and TEAR off.
EXT. STREETS, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
Batman SWERVES into oncoming traffic, CHAOS in his wake.
EXT. GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Gordon and his men SCRAMBLE into their cars...
INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Black.
                    RACHEL
          Can anyone hear me?
Harvey Dent opens his eyes. He's bound to a chair in a
dingy, unfurnished basement apartment.
                     DENT
          Rachel?   Rachel is that you?
                    RACHEL
              (sobbing)
          Harvey. You're OK.      I thought...
Her voice is coming from a speakerphone on the floor.
                    DENT
          It's OK, Rachel.     Everything's going
          to be just fine.
He looks around. Behind him, metal BARRELS, hooked up to a
car battery, with a TIMER counting down: five minutes.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker sits, smiling, content.    Stephens guards the door.
                    THE JOKER
          I want my phone call.
                                                         90.


                    STEPHENS
          That's nice.
                    THE JOKER
          How many of your friends have I
          killed?
                    STEPHENS
          I'm a twenty year man. I can tell
          the difference between punks who need
          a little lesson in manners, and the
          freaks like you who would just enjoy
          it.
              (quiet)
          And you killed six of my friends.
INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Fat Thug shuffles to the bars, where a COP stands guard.
                    FAT THUG
              (agony)
          Please. My insides hurt.
                    COP
          Step away from the bars.
                    FAT THUG
          The boss said he would make the
          voices go away. He said he would go
          inside and replace them with bright
          lights. Like Christmas.
                    COP
          That's great. Please step-
The Fat Thug COLLAPSES.   The Cop grabs his radio.
INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
Rachel is bound to a chair.    Behind her are barrels identical
to the ones behind Dent.
                    DENT
          Can you move your chair?
                     RACHEL
          No.   Harvey, we don't have much time-
The timer connected to the bomb reads 2.47... 2.46...
INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Dent DRAGS his chair, inching closer to the barrels.
                    DENT
          Look for something to free yourself.
                                                             91.


The chair JAMS against a ridge in the floor.    Dent STRAINS to
reach the timer. Inches shy.
                      RACHEL
            They said only one of us was going to
            make it. That they'd let our...
                (pause)
            Our friends choose...
Dent strains...   THE CHAIR, AND DENT, TOPPLE OVER- KNOCKING
OVER A BARREL.
                        RACHEL
            Harvey?    What's happening?
Dent, one side of his face pressed against the bare floor,
watches the open barrel SPEW DIESEL FUEL around him-
                       DENT
            Nothing.   I'm trying to...
Dent contorts his head to keep from swallowing any.
EXT. STREETS, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
The bat-pod SKIDS SIDEWAYS, WHEELS FLIPPING as the gyro keeps
Batman upright on the tumbling bike- it comes to rest- guns
lined up with a fire exit- BLOWS the door off its hinges-
JUMPS off the bike-
EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
Gridlock.   Gordon SWERVES onto the sidewalk.   People SCATTER.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker sits like a kid kept after class.     He smiles.
                      THE JOKER
            You know why I use a knife,
            Detective? Guns are too quick. You
            don't get to savor all the little
            emotions. See, in their last
            moments, people show you who they
            really are...
Stephens tries hard to ignore him.     It isn't working.
                      THE JOKER
            So, in a way, I knew your friends
            better than you ever did.
                (smiles)
            Would you like to know which of them
            were really cowards?
                                                          92.


                    STEPHENS
              (rolls up sleeves)
          I know you're going to enjoy this.
          But I'm going to enjoy it more.
Stephens PUNCHES the Joker in the gut.
INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Dent is half submerged in diesel fuel.
                    RACHEL
          Harvey, in case... I want you to know
          something...
Dent CHOKES, his emotions overwhelming him.
                    DENT
          Don't think like that, Rachel.
          They're coming for you.
                    RACHEL
          I know, but I don't want them to...
INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
Rachel looks at the timer.   Ten seconds left.
                    RACHEL
          I don't want to live without you.
          Because I do have an answer, and my
          answer is yes...
INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
A MEDIC CUTS away the Fat Thug's shirt- his belly has large
INCISION, which has been closed with crude looking STITCHES-
                    MEDIC
          He's got some kind of... contusion...
A RECTANGULAR SHAPE is visible under the skin above his
navel.
INT. DETECTIVE'S ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
Stephens shuffles out into the room, a piece of BROKEN GLASS
held to his THROAT by the Joker. Cops draw their weapons.
                     STEPHENS
          This is my own damn fault.     Just
          shoot him.
                    DETECTIVE MURPHY
          What do you want?
                    THE JOKER
          I want my phone call.

The Detectives look at each other. One of them pulls out his
cell phone. TOSSES it to the Joker, who begins to dial.
INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Medic gingerly PRESSES the rectangle.   It illuminates, a
soft blue light visible through the skin.
                    COP
          Is that a... phone?
INT. DETECTIVE'S ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker presses SEND. At the end of the room, the door to
the holding area EXPLODES-
INT. HALLWAY, TENEMENT -- NIGHT
Batman SPRINTS down the hall- stops at a door- KICKS it-
EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
Cars PULL UP- Gordon gets out, carrying a fire ax-
INT. HALLWAY, TENEMENT -- NIGHT
Batman KICKS- the door gives- Batman SMASHES it open-

...Batman BURSTS through the door- Dent looks up in horror-
                   DENT
          NO! Not me... Why did you come for
          me?!
Batman STARES at Dent. The Joker lied. The counter hits 5
seconds. Batman DRAGS Dent out- Dent FIGHTS to stay-
                      DENT
          RACHEL!
                     RACHEL

The BLAST HURLS Gordon backward onto the hood of his car- THE
ENTIRE WAREHOUSE IS AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION-

heads for it anyway. Five of his men have to RESTRAIN HIM.
EXT. ALLEYWAY, GOTHAM -- NIGHT
A SECOND EXPLOSION- Batman COVERS Dent as the FIREBALL HITS
them- IGNITING the diesel soaking Dent's left side- he starts
BURNING. And stops screaming. Batman ROLLS Dent on the wet
pavement... Dent SIZZLES. Silent.
INT. SPECIAL HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT
The Joker walks to the bars of another cell.    Grins.
                    THE JOKER
          Hello there.
In his cell.    Terrified.   Lau.
EXT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS
Dent is wheeled into an ambulance, bandages held to his face.
His one visible eye STARES BLANKLY, oblivious to the panic-
EXT. 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon watches the fire. DEBRIS blows across the asphalt.
Gordon picks up two pieces: SINGED JOKER CARDS. In place of
the Joker's face is a PHOTO OF LAU. A POLICE SERGEANT
approaches.
                    SERGEANT
          Dent's alive, Jim. Just. But back
          at M.C.U.... the Joker's gone...

          The Joker planned to be caught. He
          wanted me to lock him up in M.C.U..

Water. Smoldering blackness. The FIRE CREWS extinguish the

COLLEAGUE, pointing out something in the devastation...

EXT. 52ND STREET -- DAWN
Batman bends to the ground on one knee, his black glove
spread against the smoldering debris.
                    RACHEL (V.O.)

He spots something. DENT'S TWO-HEADED COIN. Blackened,
SCARRED. Batman turns it over. The other side is PRISTINE.
INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN
Alfred reads.
                    RACHEL (V.O.)

          Love, now and always, Rachel.
Alfred finishes the letter. Tears in his eyes, he folds it
back into its envelope. Places it on the breakfast tray.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN
Alfred moves through the silent space, stepping past the cowl
and gauntlets lying on the cold marble. He approaches Wayne,
half-undressed, slumped in a chair watching Gotham.
                    ALFRED
          I prepared a little breakfast.
Nothing. Alfred sets down the tray.     The envelope is propped
against the silver teapot.
                       ALFRED
          Very well.
                       WAYNE
          Alfred?
                    ALFRED
          Yes, Master Wayne?
Wayne turns, a desperate look in his eye.

                    WAYNE
          Did I bring this on us? On her? I
          thought I would inspire good, not
          madness-
                    ALFRED
          You have inspired good. But you spat
          in the face of Gotham's criminals-
          didn't you think there might be
          casualties? Things were always going
          to have to get worse before they got
          better.
                    WAYNE
          But Rachel, Alfred...
                    ALFRED
          Rachel believed in what you stood
          for. What we stand for.
Wayne looks up at Alfred.    Alfred picks up the cowl.
                    ALFRED
          Gotham needs you.
                    WAYNE
          Gotham needs its hero. And I let the
          Joker blow him half to hell-
                    ALFRED
          Which is why for now, they'll have to
          make do with you.
Alfred hands him the cowl.    Wayne looks at him.
                    WAYNE
          She was going to wait for me. Dent
          doesn't know. He can never know...
Alfred glances at the envelope.   Takes it off the tray.
                    WAYNE
          What's that?
                    ALFRED
          It can wait.
Alfred puts the envelope in his pocket.

          That bandit, in the forest in
          Burma... Did you catch him?

          How?

          We burned the forest down.

something on the table: his coin. He fumbles for it,

INSERT CUT: RACHEL CATCHES THE COIN.
Dent turns the coin over. The other side is devastated. He
STARES at the scarred face. Starts ripping his bandages.

Alfred comes up to Wayne.    Points him to the TV.

On screen: Engel, in his studio, addresses the camera.

          He says he's waited as long as he can
          for the Batman to do the right
          thing...
The shot cuts to REESE, nodding.
                     ENGEL
          Now he's taking matters into his own

Gordon ENTERS.   Dent STARES to one side.   He looks normal.

          I'm sorry about Rachel.

          The Doctor says you're in agonizing
          pain but you won't accept medication.

Dent's anger makes Gordon flinch.   He looks away.   Ashamed.
                    GORDON
              (small)
          Two-face. Harvey two-face.
Dent turns to face Gordon- the left side of Dent's face is
DESTROYED- skin blackened and shriveled. Molars visible.
The eye a ball and socket. Dent manages a small smile with
the good side of his face.
                    DENT
          Why should I hide who I am?
                    GORDON
          I... I know you tried to warn me.
          I'm sorry. Wuertz picked you up- was
          he working for them?
              (nothing)
          Do you know who picked up Rachel?
              (nothing)
          Harvey, I need to know which of my
          men I can trust.
Dent looks at Gordon.   Cold.
                    DENT
          Why would you listen to me now?
                    GORDON
          I'm sorry, Harvey.
                     DENT
          No.   No you're not.   Not yet.
Gordon takes a last look at Dent.   Then leaves.
INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon steps out. Someone is there. Maroni. On crutches.
Gordon stares at him. Cold. Maroni shifts, awkward.
                    MARONI
          This craziness. This is too much.
                    GORDON
          You should have thought of that
          before you let the clown out of the
          box.
                    MARONI
          You want him, I can tell you where
          he'll be this afternoon.

EXT. ABANDONED DOCKS -- DAY
The Chechen gets out of his SUV. Looks at a RUSTED HULK.
The Chechen, bodyguards, and dogs, head up the gangplank.
INT. RUSTED HULK -- CONTINUOUS
They pass into a huge hold. In the middle: A BILLION
DOLLARS. The pile is thirty feet high. Standing on top- the
Joker. At his feet, bound, is Lau. The Chechen laughs.
                    CHECHEN
          Like I say- not so crazy as you look.
The Joker jumps from the top, slides down the pile.
                    THE JOKER
          I told you- I'm a man of my word.
              (looks around)
          Where's the Italian?
The Chechen shrugs.   Pulls out a cigar.    Lights it.
                    CHECHEN
          More for us. What you do with all
          your money, Mr.Joker?
The Joker GRABS a can of GASOLINE from his thug.
                    THE JOKER
          I'm a man of simple tastes.      I like
          gunpowder. Dynamite...
He is SPLASHING gasoline onto the money.
                    THE JOKER
          ...gasoline...
The Chechen, FURIOUS, steps forwards. The Joker turns. JABS
his gun in the Chechen's face. The Chechen's bodyguards
REACT. The Joker's men DRAW on them.
                    THE JOKER
          And you know what they have in
          common? They're cheap.
                    CHECHEN
          You said you were a man of your word.
The Joker PLUCKS the cigar from the Chechen's lips.
                      THE JOKER
          I am.
The Joker tosses the cigar at the pile.
                    THE JOKER
          I'm only burning my half.
                                                         101.


The Chechen watches the money catch fire.
                    THE JOKER
          All you care about is money. This
          city deserves a better class of
          criminal, and I'm going to give it to
          them. This is my town now. Tell
          your men they work for me.
The Joker crouches down to the Chechen's dogs.    They GROWL.
                    CHECHEN
          They won't work for a freak.
The Joker takes out a knife.    Tosses it to his man.
                    THE JOKER
          Cut him up and offer him to his
          little Princes. Let's show him just
          how loyal a hungry dog is.
The Joker's men GRAB the Chechen.
                    THE JOKER
          It's not about money.     It's about
          sending a message...
The Joker watches the towering FLAMES.    Lau screams.
                    THE JOKER
          Everything. Burns.
The Joker pulls out a phone...
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO -- DAY
Reese has a confident air.   Engel is taking calls.
                    CALLER 1 (O.S.)
          I wanna how much they're gonna pay
          you to say who Batman really is.
                    REESE
          That's simply not why I'm doing this.
                    ENGEL
          Caller, you're on the air.
                    CALLER 2 (O.S.)
          Harvey dent didn't want us to give in
          to this maniac- you think you know
          better than him?
                    ENGEL
          Guy's got a point- Dent didn't want
          Batman to give himself up, is this
          the right thing to do?
                                                       102.


                    REESE
          If we could talk to Dent now he might
          feel differently-
                    ENGEL
          And we wish him a speedy recovery.
          God knows we need him, now. Let's
          take another call-
                    OLD LADY (O.S.)
          Mr.Reese, what's more valuable: one
          life, or a hundred?
                    REESE
          I guess it would depend on the life.
                    OLD LADY (O.S.)
          OK. Let's say it's your life. Is it
          worth more than the lives of several
          hundred others?
                    REESE
          Of course not.
                    OLD LADY (O.S.)
          I'm glad you feel that way. Because
          I've put a bomb in one of the city's
          hospitals. It's going off in sixty
          minutes unless someone kills you.
                    ENGEL
          Who is this?
                    OLD (O.S.)
          Just a concerned citizen-
              (drops pitch to the
               JOKER'S VOICE)
          -and regular guy...
INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon and his men are gearing up to take down the Joker.   A
Detective turns up the TV in the bullpen-
                    THE JOKER (O.S.)
          I had a vision. Of a world without
          Batman. The mob ground out a little
          profit and the police tried to shut
          them down, one block at a time...
          and it was so... boring. I've had a
          change of heart. I don't want
          Mr.Reese spoiling everything, but why
          should I have all the fun? Let's
          give someone else a chance...
Reese looks around, twitching.   Sweating.
                                                       103.


                    THE JOKER (O.S.)
          If Coleman Reese isn't dead in sixty
          minutes, then I blow up a hospital.
          Of course, you could always kill
          yourself, Mr.Reese. But that would
          be the noble thing to do. And you're
          a lawyer.
The line rings off.   Engel is speechless.
Gordon turns to the uniform COPS.
                    GORDON
          Call in every officer- tell them to
          head to their nearest hospital and
          start evac and search. Call the
          transit authority, school board,
          prisons- get every available bus down
          to a hospital- the priority is Gotham
          General- wheel everybody out of that
          place right now- my hunch is that's
          where the bomb is.
                      DETECTIVE MURPHY
          Why?
                    GORDON
          That's where Harvey Dent is.
The Uniforms SPRINT off.   Gordon turns to his Detectives.
                    UNIFORMED COP
          Where are we going, sir?
On screen: Reese is a deer in the headlights.
                    GORDON
          To get Reese.
INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY
Wayne and Alfred move to the elevator.
                    WAYNE
          I need you plugged in, checking
          Gordon's men and their families.
                    ALFRED
          Looking for?
                    WAYNE

                    WAYNE
          In the middle of the day?     Not very
          subtle, Alfred.
                    ALFRED
          The Lamborghini then.
              (watches Wayne go)
          Much more subtle.
EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- DAY
Wayne's Lamborghini TEARS through downtown.
INT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
CHAOS. PATIENTS and STAFF running around. COPS and TRAFFIC
WARDENS try to manage the evacuation. The COPS stationed
outside Dent's room, look around, unsure-
                    NURSE
          Sir, are you going to help?!
Two Cops move to help wheel gurneys around the corner.
INT. LOBBY, TELEVISION STUDIO -- DAY
Gordon and his men escort Reese out of the elevator- Engel
follows with a camera crew. As they approach the glass doors
Gordon looks out at an angry crowd.
                    ENGEL
          Commissioner?! You really think
          someone would try to-
Gordon SPOTS an OLD MAN raising a PISTOL- Gordon THROWS Reese
to the ground as SHOTS SHATTER the laminated glass of the
lobby. The Crowd SURGES in all directions-
                    GORDON
          Get the cars around back!
Gordon hauls Reese to the stairwell.
INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS

INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon throws Reese in the back.   Smiles.
                    GORDON
          Well, maybe Batman will save you.
The van PEELS out.   Heads onto the streets.
EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
Cops load patients onto BUSES. A TV van pulls up, Engel and
his Cameraman jump out. One of Dent's guards, POLK, looks
into a SCHOOL BUS. Turns to the Cop loading it.
                    POLK
          Okay, don't put anyone else on.
              (gets on radio)
          Davis, I got space, bring him out.
              (no answer)
          Davis?
Polk heads back towards the hospital, against the flow.
INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne trails the police van from a distance.
                    WAYNE
          I saw Burns and Zachary... and a

          Burns is clean... Zachary...

Gordon's phone BEEPS. He looks at a text: WATCH OUT. COPS
WITH RELATIVES IN GOTHAM HOSPITALS- BURKE, RAMIREZ, TILL...
INT. DENT'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Polk enters the room. No Davis. Just a REDHEADED NURSE,
back towards him, reading Dent's chart.

                 (nothing)
             Ma'am?
The Redhead TURNS- it is the Joker, silenced pistol in hand.
He FIRES.
EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
The Lamborghini zips around a car to get closer to the van.
INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon is reading his phone: ERIKSON, BERG. Gordon looks up
sharply. Considers the uniformed cop nervously fingering his
shotgun.
                       GORDON
             Berg, isn't it?
The young cop, BERG, looks up.         Sweating.
                       BERG
             Commissioner?
                       GORDON
             You okay, son?
Berg nods.    Looks at his watch.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
The Joker draws closer to Dent's bed.        Dent STRAINS at the
leather cuffs binding him to the bed.
                       THE JOKER
             I don't want there to be any hard
             feelings between us, Harvey.
The Joker loosens Dent's restraints.
                       THE JOKER
             When you and Rachel were being
             abducted I was sitting in Gordon's
             cage. I didn't rig those charges-
                         DENT
             Your men.    Your plan.
                       THE JOKER
             Do I really look like a guy with a
             plan, Harvey? I don't have a
             plan...The mob has plans, the cops
             have plans. You know what I am,
             Harvey?
                                                       107.


Dent's hand is TREMBLING.
                    THE JOKER
          I'm a dog chasing cars... I wouldn't
          know what to do with one if I caught
          it. I just do things. I'm just the
          wrench in the gears. I hate plans.
          Yours, theirs, everyone's. Maroni
          has plans. Gordon has plans.
          Schemers trying to control their
          worlds. I'm not a schemer, I show
          the schemers how pathetic their
          attempts to control things really
          are. So when I say that you and your
          girlfriend was nothing personal, you
          know I'm telling the truth...
Hands him the pistol.   Dent holds it to the Joker's head.
EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne ROARS past a line of traffic to settle in a few cars
back from the police van, sitting at a red light.
INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne studies the intersection- spots a PICKUP jostling for
position on the cross street.
INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon watches Berg, mentally tracing the trajectory of his
shotgun barrel as Berg fiddles with his gun. Gordon starts
trying to subtly unholster his own weapon.
                    GORDON
          I'm gonna need your weapon, son.
Berg looks at Gordon.
                      BERG
          What?
INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne watches the driver of the pickup staring intently at
the police van. Lining it up.
INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Reese looks from Berg to Gordon. Berg looks at Gordon,
trembling, the barrel of his gun inching lower in the car.
                      BERG
          Why?    Because my wife's in hospital?
                     GORDON
          Yeah.   That would be why.

INT. DENT'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker leans in, pressing his head to the gun's barrel.
                    THE JOKER
          It's the schemers who put you where
          you are. You were a schemer. You
          had plans. Look where it got you. I
          just did what I do best- I took your
          plan, and I turned it on itself.
          Look what I've done to this city with
          a few drums of gas and a couple of
          bullets. Nobody panics when the
          expected people get killed. Nobody
          panics when things go according to
          plan, even if the plan is horrifying.
          If I tell the press that tomorrow a
          gangbanger will get shot, or a
          truckload of soldiers will be blown
          up, nobody panics. Because it's all
          part of the plan. But when I say
          that one little old mayor will die,
          everybody loses their minds!
          Introduce a little anarchy, you upset
          the established order and everything
          becomes chaos. I'm an agent of
          chaos. And you know the thing about
          chaos, Harvey?
Dent looks into the Joker's eyes.       Finding meaning.
                       THE JOKER
          It's fair.
Dent looks down at the coin in his hands. Turns it over,
feels it's comforting weight. Shows the Joker the good side.
                       DENT
          You live.
He turns the coin over.       The flip side is deeply SCARRED.
                       DENT
          You die.
The Joker looks at the coin.       Looks at Dent, admiringly.
                    THE JOKER
          Now you're talking.
Dent FLICKS the coin into the air.       Catches it.   Looks.
EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
The light turns GREEN. The police van pulls into the
intersection- the pickup GUNS IT, RACING AT IT...
                                                        109.


INT. LAMBORGHINI -- CONTINUOUS
Wayne FLOORS it, YANKS the wheel to pull up onto the sidewalk-
INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
Berg licks his lips, nervous.
                      BERG
          Mr.Reese?
EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
The pickup BARRELS at the van, FULL TILT- at the last second
Wayne's Lamborghini SLIPS alongside the van- the pickup
SMASHES INTO THE LAMBORGHINI-
INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS
As the van JOLTS with the impact Gordon LEAPS forward,
PUSHING UP Berg's shotgun barrel, which FIRES into the roof-
Gordon SMASHES Berg on the head with his sidearm.
EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon's men pull the pickup driver from his cab- Gordon
crouches down to the Lamborghini wreck to help pull Wayne
from the car. Gordon recognizes him as he pulls him free.
                    GORDON
          You okay, Mr.Wayne?
Wayne looks at him, woozy.   Sits on the curb.
                    WAYNE
          Call me Bruce. I think so.
                    GORDON
          That was a brave thing, you did.
                    WAYNE
          Trying to catch the light?
                    GORDON
          You weren't protecting the van?
Wayne turns- sees the police van as if for the first time.
Reese steps down, dazed.
                     WAYNE
          Why?   Who's in it?
Reese locks eyes with Wayne. Nods.     Gordon sizes up Bruce
Wayne and his crushed sports car.
                    GORDON
          You don't watch a whole lot of news,
          do you, Mr.Wayne?
                                                        110.


                    WAYNE
              (shrugs)
          It can get a little intense.    Think I
          should go to hospital?
                    GORDON
          Not today, I wouldn't.
INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker walks calmly through the mostly deserted building.
As he walks he pulls a DETONATOR from his pocket. Strolling
along he PUSHES THE BUTTON... STAGGERED EXPLOSIONS BURST INTO
THE CORRIDOR BEHIND HIM LIKE DEMOLITION BLASTS... the Joker
just walks out the door...
EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker STROLLS down the steps- WINDOWS BLOW OUT IN SERIES-
People DIVE for cover- Engel PILES into a school bus-
The Joker walks across the parking lot- THE BUILDING
COLLAPSING BEHIND HIM...
EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon hears the EXPLOSION.
                    GORDON
          Gotham general...
              (grabs his phone)
          Did you get Dent out?
                    COP (O.S.)
          I think so-
EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
The Cop cowers as DEBRIS and SMOKE BLAST across the street-
INT. SCHOOL BUS -- CONTINUOUS
The Joker gets onto the bus.    Nods at his man at the wheel.
EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS
All eyes are on the collapsed building. One school bus pulls
out from the line of other buses. Heads down the street.
INT. BAR, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- DAY
An empty neighborhood dive, the local DRUNK passed out at the
bar, BARTENDER, watching BREAKING NEWS on the TV.
                    BARTENDER
          Sweet Jesus. D'you see this, Mike?
          They blew up a hospital...
                                                          111.


Detective Wuertz, at a booth looks up at the TV, bored.
                    BARTENDER
          Shouldn't you be out there, you know,
          doing something?
                    WUERTZ
          It's my day off.
The Bartender shuts the register.
                    BARTENDER
          I gotta take a leak, keep an eye on
          things, will ya?
The Bartender steps out.     The back door OPENS again.
                      WUERTZ
          What?    You need me to shake it for-
He TRAILS off as someone sticks a gun in his face: Harvey
Dent. Standing in shadow. He sits.
                      DENT
          Hello.
                    WUERTZ
          Dent, I thought you was...dead...
Dent leans into the light. The left side of his face is
HIDEOUSLY BURNED, cheek gone, blackened teeth and gums.
                      DENT
          Half.
Dent picks up Wuertz's drink. Takes a SIP.     Wuertz watches
the bare muscles RETRACT as Dent SWALLOWS.
                    DENT
          Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?
                    WUERTZ
          It must've been Maroni's men-
Dent SLAMS the glass back on the table- Wuertz FLINCHES.
                    DENT
          You, of all people, are gonna protect
          the other traitor in Gordon's unit?
                    WUERTZ
          I don't know- he'd never tell me.
              (stares at Dent)
          I swear to God, I didn't know what
          they were gonna do to you-
                                                        112.


                    DENT
          Funny, I don't know what's going to
          happen to you, either.
Dent pulls his coin from his pocket. FLIPS it. Wuertz
watches it SPIN. It lands on the table. Scarred side up.
The drunk at the bar STIRS at the GUNSHOT.
EXT. GOTHAM GENERAL -- DAY
Gordon, manic, surveys the scene with a Cop-
                    GORDON
          You must know how many were inside-
          you've got patient lists, roll calls-
                    COP
          Sir! Sir. Take a look at what we're
          dealing with. Cops, National Guard-
              (gestures at buses)
          We're showing 50 missing- but that
          building was clear. These buses are
          heading off to other hospitals- my
          guess is we missed one.
                    GORDON
          Yeah? What's your guess about where
          Harvey Dent is?
The cop says nothing.
                    GORDON
          Keep looking. Keep it to yourself.
INT. FOX'S OFFICE WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- DAY
Fox is watching the news.    His intercom buzzes.
                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Mr.Fox? Security is showing a break-
          in at the R and D department.
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
Fox watches two security men force the door.    He enters
alone.
INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
Fox enters the dimly-lit room. At one end is an
extraordinary array of thousands of tiny monitors. Fox
approaches, fascinated, as they quietly display architectural
patterns individually and in concert. The images become a
MAP.
                       BATMAN
          Beautiful.     Isn't it?
                                                      113.


Fox nods, staring at the monitors as Batman approaches.
                    FOX
          Beautiful. Unethical. Dangerous.
          You've turned every phone in the city
          into a microphone...
Lucius presses a key. The BABBLE of a MILLION CONVERSATIONS
at once fills the room. Every cell phone in the city.
                    BATMAN
          And high frequency
          generator/receiver.
                    FOX
          Like the phone I gave you in Hong
          Kong. You took my sonar concept and
          applied it to everybody's phone in
          the City. With half the city feeding
          you sonar you can image all of
          Gotham.
              (turns to Batman)
          This is wrong.
                    BATMAN
          I've got to find this man, Lucius.
                    FOX
          But at what cost?
                    BATMAN
          The database is null-key encrypted.
          It can only be accessed by one
          person.
                    FOX
          No one should have that kind of
          power.
                    WAYNE
          That's why I gave it to you.   Only
          you can use it.
Lucius looks at Batman.   Hard.
                    FOX
          Spying on thirty million people
          wasn't in my job description.
Batman points to a TV screen. Fox turns. ON SCREEN: the
Joker shakes his head above a graphic "LATEST THREAT"...
                    THE JOKER
          What does it take to make you people
          want to join in..?
                                                        114.


EXT. SITUATION TENT AT GOTHAM GENERAL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon watches a screen.   Grave.
                    THE JOKER
          You failed to kill the lawyer... I've
          got to get you off the bench and into
          the game. So, here it is...
INT. BAR, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS
The bar, packed with business people watches the TV.    SILENT.
                    THE JOKER
          Come nightfall, this city is mine,
          and anyone left here plays by my
          rules. If you don't want to be in
          the game, get out now.
Bar patrons start moving... The Joker reaches for the camera-
                    THE JOKER
          But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are
          in for a surprise.
CUT TO STATIC. The bar patrons look around, confused.
INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- CONTINUOUS
Fox turns from the TV to look at Batman.
                      BATMAN
          Trust me.
Fox stares at Batman.
                    BATMAN
          This is the audio sample.
He plugs a USB dongle into the console. A sample of the
Joker's voice from the call-in news program plays.
                    BATMAN
          If he talks within range of any phone
          in the city, you'll be able to
          triangulate his position.
Lucius toggles a menu. The city is an open book- People
working, eating, sleeping. Lucius shakes his head.
                    BATMAN
          When you've finished, type your name
          to switch it off.
                    FOX
          I'll help you this one time...
Lucius sits at the console.    Batman moves off-
                                                      115.


                    FOX
          But consider this my resignation.
Batman turns.   Fox looks at him, serious.
                    FOX
          As long as this machine is at Wayne
          Industries, I won't be.
EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- DUSK
Gothamites POUR out of the city, on foot and by car... the
BRIDGES and TUNNELS are deserted, but for BOMB SQUAD search
teams.
INT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon briefs the Mayor.
                    GORDON
          My officers are going over every inch
          of the tunnels and bridges, but with
          the Joker's threat they're not and
          option.
                    MAYOR
          Land routes East?
                    GORDON
          Backed up for hours. Which leaves
          the ferries with thirty thousand
          waiting to board. Plus, corrections
          are at capacity, so I want to use a
          ferry to take some prisoners off the
          island.
                    MAYOR
          The men you and Dent put away? Those
          aren't people I'm worried about.
                    GORDON
          You should be- they're the people you
          least want to be stuck with in an
          emergency. Whatever the Joker's
          planning, it's a good bet that
          Harvey's prisoners might be involved.
          I want 'em out of here.
EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- DUSK
At the ferry terminal, National Guardsman watch over the
THIRTY THOUSAND jostling, scared people waiting to board the
two MASSIVE FERRIES to Seven Sisters. Grumbles turn to YELLS
as 800 PRISONERS are loaded onto a ferry by shotgun-toting
CORRECTIONS OFFICERS.
                                                       116.


                     CIVILIAN
          That ain't right! We should be on
          that boat.
                    NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
          You want to ride across with them, be
          my guest.
EXT. BROWNSTONE -- DUSK
Maroni climbs into the back of a limo.
INT. LIMO -- DUSK
Maroni settles back into his seat.   The car pulls away.
                    MARONI
          Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.
                    DENT
          Going to join your wife?
Maroni STARTS. Someone is in here with him.    Harvey Dent-
Two Face- leans forward, clutching a pistol.
                    DENT
          You love her?
                    MARONI
          Yes.
                    DENT
          Can you imagine what it would be like
          to listen to her die?
                    MARONI
          Take it up with the Joker. He killed
          your woman. Made you... like this...
                    DENT
          The Joker's just a mad dog. I want
          whoever let him off the leash.
Maroni looks at Dent.   Worried.
                    DENT
          I took care of Wuertz, but who was
          your other man inside Gordon's unit?
          Who picked up Rachel? It must've
          been someone she trusted.
                    MARONI
          If I tell you, will you let me go?
                    DENT
          It can't hurt your chances.
                                                      117.


                    MARONI
          It was Ramirez.
Pulls out his coin.    Dent cocks the pistol...
                    MARONI
          But you said-
                    DENT
          I said it couldn't hurt your chances.
Dent FLIPS it.   Looks: good side.   He shrugs.
                       DENT
          Lucky guy.
Maroni looks confused. Dent FLIPS the coin again.   Looks
down at the coin. Shakes his head.
                    DENT
          But he's not.
                       MARONI
          Who?
Dent smiles.   PUTS HIS SEAT BELT ON.
                    DENT
          Your driver.
Dent presses the barrel of the revolver behind the shadow of
the driver. Maroni LUNGES, SCREAMING. Dent FIRES.
EXT. BRIDGE -- DUSK
The Limo SWERVES off of the bridge, SOARS out over the canal,
and PANCAKES into the RETAINING WALL.
EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- DUSK
CIVILIANS CRAM their way onto one ferry. Finally, the
COMMANDER of the National Guard unit SIGNALS to his men to
STOP BOARDING and CAST OFF.
The two FERRIES set off across the river, heading for the
lights of the distant shore of the mainland.
INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The FIRST MATE looks out the window, at the second ferry. It
is DEAD in the WATER. He turns to the PILOT [PRISON FERRY].
                    FIRST MATE
          They've lost their engines.
                                                         118.


                    PILOT [PRISON FERRY]
          Get on the radio and tell 'em we'll
          come back for them once we dump these
          scumbags-
Suddenly, the control panel FLICKERS and DIES.
                    PILOT [PRISON FERRY]
          Get down to the engine room.
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The First Mate skirts around the PRISONERS and CORRECTIONS
OFFICERS...
INT. ACCESS CORRIDOR, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The First Mate opens the door to the engine room.    STOPS.
HUNDREDS OF BARRELS OF DIESEL FUEL.    And a small, wrapped
PRESENT, topped with a BOW.
INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Pilot [Prison Ferry] is holding the small present.    His
radio CRACKLES.
                    PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY] (O.S.)
          Same thing over here- enough diesel
          to blow us sky high. And a present.
EXT. ELEVATED ROADWAY, DOWTOWN GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS
Batman sits on the bat-pod, cape blowing.   Listening.
                    BATMAN
          Fox? There's something going on on
          the ferries...
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT
As cold scared Families watch, the NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
UNWRAPS that ferry's present. Inside, he finds a crude
REMOTE DETONATOR.
                    NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
          Why would they give us the detonator
          to our own bomb?
Up in the wiring at the ceiling, a CELL PHONE taped in to the
P.A. rings and answers.
                    THE JOKER (O.S.)
          Tonight, you're all going to be part

          Through the magic of diesel fuel and
          ammonium nitrate, I'm ready right now
          to blow you all sky high. Anyone
          attempts to get off their boat, you

          the patrol car pulls out.
Dent is holding a gun at Ramirez's head.      She hangs up.
                    DENT
          She believe you?
Ramirez nods.
                    DENT
          She trusts you.       Just like Rachel
          did.
                    RAMIREZ
          I didn't know-
                    DENT
          'What they were gonna do'? You're
          the second cop to say that to me.
          What, exactly, did you think they
          were going to do?
                    RAMIREZ

Dent FLIPS his coin.

The Pilot [Prison Ferry] tries the radio.   It's DEAD.

          He killed the radio.
                    THE JOKER (O.S.)
          There's no need for all of you to

          left you both a little present.
EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT
The Joker stares out over the harbor, at the ferries.
Talking into a cell phone. Holding a detonator, with TWO
BUTTONS.

          Each of you has a remote to blow up

INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Prisoners and Corrections Officers listen.    Appalled.
                     THE JOKER (O.S.)
          At midnight, I blow you all up. If,
          however, one of you presses the
          button, I'll let that boat live. You
          choose. So who's it going to be-
          Harvey Dent's most wanted scumbag
          collection... or the sweet innocent
          civilians?
              (beat)
          Oh, and you might want to decide
          quickly, because the people on the
          other boat may not be quite so noble.
The Joker HANGS UP. The Pilot [Prisoner Ferry] looks down at
the remote in his hands. Prisoners begin YELLING and
PUSHING. The WARDEN takes the remote from the Pilot- COCKS
his shotgun. His men level their weapons at the crowd.
EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon looks out at the ferries.    His phone rings.

          Stay back.
A BUSINESSMAN clutching his briefcase speaks up.
                    BUSINESSMAN
          Who are you to decide? We ought to
          talk it over, at least.
Other passengers agree.    A MOTHER with two KIDS speaks up.
                    MOTHER
          We don't all have to die. Why should
          my babies die? Those men had their
          chance-

          We're not talking about this...

          They're talking over the same exact
          thing on the other boat.

A GUARDSMAN on this boat passes around a hat. People drop
CHITS into it. Passengers filling out chits eye each other.
People on their phones say goodbye to loved ones.

STARES down at his blank chit.

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
Gordon looks at the SWAT LEADER.
                    GORDON
          Then we have a hostage situation.
They look across at the large windows of the Prewitt
Building. The Joker's men, in crude, homemade CLOWN MASKS
are clearly visible, automatic weapons in hand.
                    SWAT SNIPER
          I got hostages!
They look through his scope. Crouched deeper in the room,
PATIENTS, DOCTORS, and NURSES, huddled.
                    GORDON
          It's a shooting gallery. Why'd he
          choose a spot with such big windows?
                    BATMAN
          He likes the view.
Batman gestures towards the view of the ferries.
                    SWAT LEADER
          We have clear shots on five clowns.
          Snipers take them out, smash the
          windows- a team rappels in, a team
          moves in by the stairwells. 2 or 3
          or three casualties, max.
                    GORDON
              (barely hesitates)
          Let's do it.
                    BATMAN
          It's not that simple.    With the
          Joker, it never is.
                    GORDON
          What's simple, is that every second
          we don't take him, those people on
          the ferries get closer to blowing
          each other up!

          That won't happen.
                    GORDON
          Then he'll blow them both up!
          There's no time- we have to go in now-
                    BATMAN
          There's always a catch with him-
                    GORDON
          That's why we can't wait- we can't
          play his games-
Batman turns.
                    BATMAN
          I need five minutes.     Alone-
                   GORDON
          No. There's no time.     We have clear
          shots.
Gordon pulls his gun.   Batman turns back.   The SWATS watch.
                     GORDON
          Dent's in there with them. We have
          to save Dent! I have to save Dent!
              (to SWAT Leader)
          Get ready-
Batman LEAPS from the building, OPENS his cape- SOARS across
the gulf between the two buildings- Gordon puts his weapon
away. Curses softly. Turns to the SWAT leader.
                    GORDON
          Two minutes. Then you breach.

Batman RIPS off the clown mask:
STARING, FRIGHTENED EYES- MOUTH DUCT-TAPED SHUT... it's
ENGEL.
Batman looks up: Four more clowns line the windows, weapons
duct-taped to their hands. On SONAR: he looks into where the
hostages are crouched... the "PATIENTS" and "DOCTORS" are
carrying weapons- these are the Joker's men... Above them

carabinners looped to the absailing rope onto their webbing

EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT
Batman FLIES backwards THROUGH THE WINDOW- glass flying- the
Joker KICKS out a wooden brace holding up the STEEL FRAME-
Batman's arms fly up as it comes crashing down onto his neck-
saved by his protective gauntlets. Batman GRUNTS as the
Joker STEPS onto the steel beam...
                    THE JOKER
          If we don't stop fighting, we're
          going to miss the fireworks.
                    BATMAN
          There won't be any fireworks.
Batman STRUGGLES to keep the beam from CRUSHING his neck...
INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT
The Businessman stares at the remote in his hands.   Finally,
he puts it down. Sits down. Waits to die.
The clock strikes MIDNIGHT.
EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT
Batman indicates the clock...   twelve o'clock.
                    BATMAN
          What were you hoping to prove? That
          deep down, we're all as ugly as you?
The Joker looks at the clock...
INT. BOTH FERRIES -- CONTINUOUS
The Passengers brace.   Look at the clock.   Confused...
INT. PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS
The smile disappears from the Joker's face.
                    BATMAN
          You're alone.
The Joker CROUCHES down, hovering above Batman's face and
arms. Shows him the remote.
                    THE JOKER
          Can't rely on anyone these days.
The Joker ARMS the remote...
                    THE JOKER
          Have to do everything yourself. I
          always have- and it's not always
          easy...

Batman looks up at him.
                     BATMAN
          No.   But I know how you get these-
Batman's SCALLOP BLADES FIRE OUT OF HIS GAUNTLET, nailing the
Joker in the chest and arm- he STAGGERS back- Batman, freed,
leaps forward- KICKS HIM OVER THE EDGE- GRABS the remote-
The Joker GIGGLES as he FALLS, enjoying the ride. Something
SLAMS into his leg, and he JERKS to a stop- BATMAN'S GRAPPLE.
The Joker HOLLERS in pain as Batman HAULS him up.
                    THE JOKER
          Just couldn't let me go, could you?
          I guess this is what happens when an
          unstoppable force meets an immovable
          object. You truly are incorruptible,
          aren't you?
Batman secures the Joker UPSIDE DOWN.   The Joker is LAUGHING.
                    THE JOKER
          You won't kill me out of some
          misplaced sense of self-
          righteousness... and I won't kill you
          because you're too much fun. We're
          going to do this forever.
                    BATMAN
          You'll be in a padded cell, forever.
                    THE JOKER
          Maybe we can share it. They'll need
          to double up, the rate this city's
          inhabitants are losing their minds...
                    BATMAN
          This city just showed you it's full
          of people ready to believe in good.
The Joker looks up at him.   A twinkle in his eye.
                    THE JOKER
          Till their spirit breaks completely.
          Until they find out what I did with
          the best of them. Until they get a
          good look at the real Harvey Dent,
          and all the heroic things he's done.
              (indicates ferry)
          Then those criminals will be straight
          back onto the streets and Gotham will

                      THE JOKER
            I took Gotham's white knight. And I
            brought him down to my level. It
            wasn't hard- madness is like gravity.

Gordon gets out of his car, gun drawn.     Makes his way into
the blackened wreck of a building...
INT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- NIGHT
Gordon peers into the darkness.
                       GORDON
            Dent?
No reply.   Gordon makes his way deeper.    Up the stairs.
INT. SECOND FLOOR, BURNT WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
Gordon spots Barbara and their two children huddled together.
He moves towards them- Barbara is shaking her head-
WHAM! Dent cracks Gordon over the head with his gun. Dent
disarms Gordon, rolls him over. He turns to look at the
ENORMOUS hole in the floor. From this side, in the
moonlight, Dent looks completely normal.
                      DENT
            This is where they brought her,
            Gordon. After your people handed her
            over. This is where they bound her.
            This is where she suffered. This is
            where she died.
                       GORDON
            I know.   I was here.   Trying to save
            her.
Dent TURNS, revealing his dark side.

          I couldn't.
                    DENT
          Yes, you could.
                    DENT
          If you'd listened to me- if you'd
          stood up against corruption instead
          of doing your deal with the devil.
                    GORDON
          I was trying to fight the mob-
Dent MOVES towards Gordon.
                    DENT
          You wouldn't dare try to justify
          yourself if you knew what I'd lost.
          Have you ever had to talk to the
          person you love most, wondering if
          you're about to listen to them die?
          You ever had to lie to that person?
          Tell them it's going to be all right,
          when you know it's not? Well, you're
          about to find out what that feels
          like. Then you'll be able to look me
          in the eye and tell me you're sorry.
Dent turns- steps over to Barbara- puts the gun to her temple-
                    GORDON
          Harvey. Put the gun down. You're
          not going to hurt my family.
                    DENT
          No, just the person you need most.
              (cocks gun)
          So is it your wife?
                    GORDON
          Put the gun down.
Dent moves the gun to point at Gordon's little girl.
                    GORDON
          Please, Harvey...
Dent moves to James Gordon.   Brushes the hair out of the
boy's eyes with the muzzle.   Gordon SNAPS.
                    GORDON
          Goddamit. Stop pointing that gun at
          my family, Dent.

Dent pulls the boy away from his mother.
                      BARBARA
          No!    Jim stop him!   Don't let him!
Dent walks James past Gordon to the edge of the burnt floor.
He touches the raw wood at the edge of the floor.
                    GORDON
          I'm sorry, Harvey. For everything.
          But, please. Please don't hurt him.

Dent looks at Gordon, FURIOUS.
                    DENT
          You brought your cops?
                    GORDON
          All they know is there's a situation.
          They don't know who, or what.
          They're just creating a perimeter.
                    DENT
          You think I want to escape?!      There's
          no escape from this-
Dent indicates his face.   His suffering.
                    GORDON
          No one needs to escape, because no
          one's done anything wrong. And
          nobody has to.
Dent chuckles.   A macabre sight.
                    DENT
          I've done plenty wrong, Gordon.      Just
          not quite enough. Yet.
Dent squeezes the gun a little tighter against the little
boy's neck. The boy WHIMPERS.
                    BATMAN
          You don't want to hurt the boy, Dent.

          It's not about what I want. It's
          about what's fair.
              (to Gordon and Batman)
          You thought we could be decent men in
          an indecent world. You thought we
          could lead by example. You thought
          the rules could be bent but not
          break... you were wrong. The world
          is cruel.
              (shows his coin)
          And the only morality in a cruel
          world is chance. Unbiased.
          Unprejudiced. Fair.
                    BATMAN
          Nothing fair ever came out of the
          barrel of a gun, Dent.
                    DENT
              (shows the coin)
          His boy's got the same chance she
          had. Fifty-fifty.
Batman steps closer, desperate, trying to reach Dent.
                    BATMAN
          What happened to Rachel wasn't
          chance. We decided to act. We
          three. We knew the risks and we
          acted as one. We are all responsible
          for the consequences.
Dent looks at Batman.    Pleading.
                    DENT
          Then why was it only me who lost
          everything?
Batman looks into Dent's eyes.   Emotional.
                       BATMAN
          It wasn't.

          The Joker chose me!
                    BATMAN
          Because you were the best of us. He
          wanted to prove that even someone as
          good as you could fall.
                    DENT
              (bitter)
          And he was right.

                    BATMAN
          But your fooling yourself if you
          think you're letting chance decide.
          You're the one pointing the gun,
          Harvey. So point it at the people
          who were responsible. We all acted
          as one. Gordon. Me. And you.
Dent is listening, the wheels in his deranged mind turning.
                    DENT
          Fair enough.
Dent eases his grip on the boy.
                       DENT
          You first.
He points the gun at Batman. FLIPS the coin. TAILS. He
SHOOTS. Batman COLLAPSES to the ground, clutching his gut.
                       DENT
          My turn.
He points the gun at his own head.    FLIPS the coin.    HEADS.
He looks a little disappointed.
Finally, he points the gun back at Gordon's son.
                    DENT
          Your turn, Gordon.
                    GORDON
          You're right, Harvey. Rachel's death
          was my fault. But punish me-
                    DENT
          I'm about to. Tell your son it's
          going to be all right, Gordon. Lie.
          Like I lied.
Gordon looks up.   Pained.    Locks eyes with his son.
                    GORDON
          It's going to be all right, son.
Dent FLIPS the coin. High. Dent's eyes FOLLOW the coin up-
Batman HURLS himself at Dent and the boy.
All three of them VANISH over the edge. A TERRIBLE CRASH-
then silence, but for the sound of DENT'S COIN, SPINNING on
the floor at the edge of the hole.
Gordon, horrified, RUNS to the edge- peers down-
Dent lies at the bottom of the hole, his neck broken.     DEAD.
The coin stops spinning, GOOD SIDE UP.

Gordon's son swings into view, HANGING from Batman, who is
holding onto a JOIST with all his strength...
Gordon reaches down to GRAB his son- HAULS him up...
Batman FALLS..., dropping and dropping, SMASHING THROUGH
protruding WOOD and PIPES... He lands HARD near Dent.

          The Joker won.
Gordon stares down at SCARRED SIDE of Harvey Dent.
                    GORDON
          Harvey's prosecution, everything he
          fought for, everything Rachel died
          for. Undone. Whatever chance Gotham
          had of fixing itself... whatever
          chance you gave us of fixing our
          city... dies with Harvey's
          reputation. We bet it all on him.
          The Joker took the best of us and
          tore him down. People will lose all

          No.    But the Joker cannot win.
Batman crouches to Dent's body.
                    BATMAN
          Gotham needs its true hero.
Gently, he turns Dent's head so the good side of his face is
up. Gordon looks from Dent's face to Batman. Understanding.

          You?   You can't-

          Yes, I can.
Batman stands.   Faces Gordon.

          You either die a hero or live long
          enough to see yourself become the
          villain. I can do those things
          because I'm not a hero, like Dent. I
          killed those people. That's what I
          can be.

James RUNS down the stairs to join father-
                    JAMES (CONT’D)
          Why's he running, Dad?!
Gordon stares after Batman.
                    GORDON
          Because we have to chase him...
EXT. WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
As Cops race into the buildings the DOGS get the scent and
pull away from the doorway, following the SHADOW into the
stacks of shipping containers...
INT. WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
James looks at his father, confused.
                    JAMES
          He didn't do anything wrong!
Gordon stares after the Batman. The sound of the dogs
becoming louder and more ferocious.
                                                        140.


                        JAMES (CONT’D)
           Why, dad?     Why?!
                        GORDON
           Because...
EXT. DOCKSIDE ROOFTOPS -- CONTINUOUS
The Batman LURCHES between shipping containers.    STUMBLING.
BLEEDING. He makes it to the bat-pod...
                     GORDON (V.O.)
           ...he's the hero Gotham deserves...
           but not the one it needs right now.
           So we'll hunt him, because he can
           take it. Because he's not our
           hero...
The bat-pod streaks through Gotham's underground streets, the
Batman's cape fluttering behind. A wraith...
                     GORDON (V.O.)
           ...he's a silent guardian, a watchful
           protector... a dark knight.
The Batman races up a ramp into a blinding light-
CUT TO BLACK.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Script
  
  
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

  
Hey! Hey, guys!

  
Faster!

  
Hey, what you got under there?

  
- Hey, you want to race?
- Oh, please.

  
- Come on!
- Come on, let's go!

  
Come on!

  
- Please?
- Come on! Let's go! Come on!

  
Come on. Let's go.

  
Go faster! Faster!

  
Sorry, gentlemen.

  
This whole area is closed for
weapons testing for the next 24 hours.

  
That includes all on-base personnel.

  
Good afternoon, sir.

  
I'm afraid that goes for you, too,
Colonel, sir.

  
The Pentagon sent out revised...

  
Russians.

  
This ain't gonna be easy.

  
Not as easy as it used to be.

  
- Well, we've been through worse.
- Yeah? When?

  
Flensburg. There was twice as many.

  
- We were younger.
- I still am young!

  
We had guns.

  
Put your hands down, will you?
You're embarrassing us.

  
Bet you 500 bucks
we can get out of this.

  
Let's call it 100.

  
You recognize building, yes?

  
Drop dead.

  
I'm sorry.

  
I meant drop dead, comrade.

  
- Where was he found?
- In Mexico.

  
They were digging in the dirt,
looking for this stuff.

  
You're not from around here, are you?

  
Where is it you would imagine
I am from, Dr. Jones?

  
Well, the way you're sinking your teeth
into those wubble-u's,

  
I should think maybe Eastern Ukraine.

  
Highest marks.

  
Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko.

  
Three times
I have received Order of Lenin.

  
Also medal as Hero of Socialist Labor.

  
And why?

  
Because I know things.
I know them before anyone else.

  
And what I do not know, I find out.

  
Now, what I need to know now
is in here.

  
- You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones.
- Ouch.

  
So, we will do this,
what is expression, old-fashioned way.

  
You will tell us.
You will help us find what we seek.

  
This warehouse
is where you and your government

  
have hidden all of your secrets, yes?

  
This is a military warehouse.
I've never been here before in my life.

  
Object we seek,
rectangular storage container,

  
dimensions 2 meters by 0.5 meter
by 66 centimeters.

  
Contents of box, mummified remains.

  
This is no doubt familiar to you.

  
What makes you think I've got any idea
what box you're talking about?

  
Because 10 years ago

  
you were part of the team
that examined it.

  
Look...

  
Even if I
knew what you were talking about...

  
You will help us find it.

  
Compass. I need a compass.

  
You know, north, south, east...

  
West.

  
No compass?

  
I need your bullets.

  
The contents of that box
are highly magnetized.

  
I need gunpowder.

  
You want my help or not?

  
Don't toy with me, Dr. Jones.
What is the point of all this?

  
If it's still magnetic,

  
the metal in this gunpowder
should point the way.

  
Shells. Give me some shotgun shells.

  
Pliers.

  
Drop the guns,
or Colonel Dr. Spalko is dead.

  
Why, Mac?

  
Well, what can I say, Jonesey?

  
I'm a capitalist, and they pay.

  
After all those years
we spent spying on the Reds?

  
I thought we were friends, Mac.

  
I've had a run of bad luck
with the cards lately, mate.

  
Awful. Bloody awful.

  
I can't go home empty-handed again.

  
No defiant last words, Dr. Jones?

  
I like lke.

  
Put down gun.

  
You got it, pal.

  
Damn, I thought that was closer.

  
Come on. Come on.

  
He's not to get out of here alive!
Block the exits!

  
Don't get clever, Boris.
You don't know him.

  
Know him. Know him.

  
You don't know him!
You don't know him!

  
You don't know him! You don't know...

  
You did well.

  
Hello? Hello?

  
Hello!

  
Hey. I knocked. You guys got a...

  
Wait a minute.

  
Come on, gang!

  
Oh, that can't be good.

  
All personnel,
it is now one minute to zero time.

  
Put on goggles or turn away.

  
Do not remove goggles or face burst
until 10 seconds after first light.

  
That can't be good at all.

  
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

  
Sure! Great! Don't wait for me!

  
Minus 15 seconds.

  
Minus 10 seconds.

  
Niner, eight, seven, six,

  
fiver, four,

  
three, two, one, zero.

  
I had no reason to believe
that Mac was a spy.

  
He was Ml6 when I was in OSS.

  
We did 20, 30 missions together
in Europe and the Pacific.

  
Don't wave your war record
in our face, Colonel Jones.

  
We all served.

  
No kidding? What side were you on?

  
I don't think you recognize
the gravity of your situation.

  
You aided and abetted KGB agents

  
who broke into
a top-secret military installation

  
in the middle of the
United States of America, my country.

  
What was in the steel box they took?

  
You tell us. You've seen it before.

  
You mean that Air Force fiasco in '47.

  
I was tossed into a bus
with blacked-out windows

  
and 20 people
I wasn't allowed to speak to.

  
Hauled out in the middle of the night
in the middle of nowhere

  
on some urgent recovery project
and shown what?

  
Pieces of wreckage

  
and an intensely magnetic shroud
covering mutilated remains?

  
None of us
was ever given the full picture.

  
And we were threatened with treason
if we ever talked about it.

  
So, you tell me, what was in the box?

  
Indy, thank God.

  
Don't you know it's dangerous
to climb into a refrigerator?

  
Those things can be deathtraps!

  
Good to see you, too, Bob.

  
Relax, boys. I can vouch for Dr. Jones.

  
What the hell is going on?

  
KGB on American soil?
Who is that woman?

  
Describe her.

  
Tall, thin, mid-30s,

  
carried a sword of some kind,
a rapier, I think.

  
Yeah, that's her.

  
You sure she's here?

  
Here and gone. Who is she?

  
Irina Spalko,
she was Stalin's fair-haired girl.

  
His favorite scientist, if you can call
psychic research science.

  
General Ross...

  
She's leading teams from the Kremlin
all over the world.

  
Scooping up artifacts

  
she thinks might have
paranormal military applications.

  
- General Ross!
- Back off, Paul.

  
Not everyone in the Army's a Commie
and certainly not Indy.

  
What exactly am I being accused of,
besides surviving a nuclear blast?

  
Nothing yet.

  
But frankly your association
with George McHale

  
makes all your activities suspicious,
including those during the war.

  
Are you nuts?

  
Do you have any idea how many medals
this son of a bitch won?

  
A great many, I'm sure.

  
But does he deserve them?

  
Dr. Jones, let's just say for now
that you are of interest to the Bureau.

  
Of great interest.

  
Grooved Ware in the beginning
of modern drainage practices,

  
which we also see in Skara Brae
on the west coast of Scotland.

  
Skara Brae dates from 3100 B.C.

  
and was continuously occupied
for 600 years

  
until it was apparently
abandoned in 2500 B.C.

  
There's no clear evidence
as to why its occupants

  
decided to abandon
a perfectly healthy environment. Yes?

  
- May I have a moment, Professor?
- Yes.

  
Open up Michaelson. Review Chapter 4.

  
When I come back we'll discuss

  
the difference between
migration and exodus.

  
What?

  
You have no idea the pressure
coming from the Board of Regents.

  
The FBI showed up this morning,

  
ransacked your office,
searched all your files!

  
You're the dean of the college.
Why didn't you stop them?

  
They have no right.

  
They had every right!
They weren't vandals.

  
They were federal agents
with search warrants!

  
The university isn't gonna get itself
embroiled in that kind of controversy,

  
not in this charged climate.

  
So you're firing me.

  
A leave of absence is all.
An indefinite leave of absence.

  
- You are firing me.
- During which

  
they've agreed to continue to pay
your full salary for a period...

  
I don't want their money!

  
Please don't be foolish.

  
You don't know what I had to go through
to get that for you.

  
You went through? What exactly
did you have to go through, Charlie?

  
Henry...

  
I resigned.

  
Where will you go?

  
Train to New York,
overnight to London, for starts.

  
I might end up teaching in Leipzig.
Heinrich owes me a favor.

  
I'll wire you when I get settled.

  
You can send on the rest of my things.

  
I suppose
there's nothing to keep you here.

  
I barely recognize this country anymore.

  
The government's got us
seeing Communists in our soup.

  
When the hysteria reaches academia,
I guess it's time to call it a career.

  
How did Deirdre take the news?

  
How does any wife take such things?

  
The look on her face
was a combination of pride and panic.

  
I never should've doubted you,
my friend.

  
No, you have reason to question
your friends these days.

  
Brutal couple of years, huh, Charlie?

  
First Dad, then Marcus.

  
We seem to have reached the age
where life stops giving us things

  
and starts taking them away.

  
Just another half glass.

  
Hey!

  
Hey, old man!

  
Professor, hello! Hey!
Are you Dr. Jones?

  
You're running out of platform, kid.

  
Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley's?

  
- Harold Oxley? The archeologist?
- Yeah.

  
What about him?

  
They're going to kill him.

  
I haven't talked to Harold Oxley
in 20 years.

  
He's a brilliant guy.

  
He could put you to sleep
just by talking.

  
Yeah. Yeah. When I was a kid,
that's how I did get to sleep.

  
Oxley's voice was better than
a glass of warm milk, you know.

  
The name's Mutt, Mutt Williams.

  
- Mutt? What kind of name is that?
- Yeah.

  
It's the one I picked.
You got a problem with it?

  
Take it easy.
What was your relationship to Oxley?

  
My dad died in the war.
Ox kind of helped my mom raise me.

  
You were saying
somebody's going to kill him?

  
Six months ago,
my mom gets a letter from the Ox.

  
He's down in Peru.

  
Found some type of skull,
a crystal skull.

  
Like the one that guy
Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss?

  
- The one he found.
- Nice jacket.

  
The Ox and I were obsessed with
the Mitchell-Hedges skull in college.

  
How do you know about it?

  
Are you kidding? It's all he talked about.

  
He'd talk about that thing
till the cows come home.

  
What's it? It's like an idol?

  
Deity carving. Mesoamerican.

  
There are a number of crystal skulls
in the world.

  
I saw one in the British Museum.

  
Interesting craftsmanship,
but that's about it.

  
All right, well, laugh if you want.
Oxley said he found it this time.

  
He said this was real and he was off
to a place called Akator with it.

  
- Akator? He said that? You're sure?
- Yeah.

  
That's what he said.
He said Akator. What is it?

  
It's a mythical lost city in the Amazon.

  
Conquistadors called it El Dorado.

  
Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were
chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago

  
to build a giant city out of solid gold.

  
It had aqueducts and paved roads

  
and technology that
wouldn't be seen again for 5,000 years.

  
Francisco de Orellana disappeared
into the Amazon looking for it in 1546.

  
I almost died of typhus
looking for it myself.

  
I don't think it exists.

  
Why would Ox
want to take the skull there?

  
The legend says that a crystal skull
was stolen from Akator

  
in the 15th or 16th century,

  
and that whoever returns the skull
to the city temple

  
will be given control over its power.

  
Power. Right. So there's some
kind of power. What's the power?

  
I don't know, kid. It's just a story.

  
No.

  
From his letter, my mom thought
the Ox was off his rocker.

  
You know, smog in the noggin,

  
so she goes down there to find him,
only he'd already been kidnapped.

  
Now they've got her, too.

  
Now, Ox said
he hid that skull someplace,

  
and if my mom doesn't come up with it,
they're gonna kill them both.

  
Now, she said you'd help me.

  
Me? What's your mom's name again?

  
Mary. Mary Williams.
You remember her?

  
There were a lot of Marys, kid.

  
Shut up! That's my mother
you're talking about!

  
All right? That's my mother.

  
You don't have to get sore all the time
just to prove how tough you are.

  
Sit down. Please. Sit down.

  
She said if anybody could find the skull,
it's you.

  
Like you're some type of...
Like a grave robber or something.

  
I'm a tenured professor of archeology.

  
Oh, you're a teacher.
Well, that's gonna be a big help.

  
Anyway, she called me
two weeks ago from South America.

  
Said she'd escaped,
but they were after her.

  
She said she'd just gotten
a letter from the Ox

  
and mailed it to me
so I could give it to you.

  
Then the line went dead. I opened it.

  
I mean, the thing's pointless, though.
It's just gibberish.

  
It's not even English lettering.

  
See?

  
See those two bricks over there,
at the counter?

  
I don't think
they're here for the milkshakes.

  
Who are they?

  
Don't know. Maybe FBI.

  
Come quietly, Dr. Jones.

  
Make that KGB.

  
- And bring letter with you.
- Letter? What letter?

  
Letter Mr. Williams just give you.

  
Me? Do I look like a mailman?

  
We don't ask again.
Come now or we'll...

  
Or what?

  
Nice try, kid,
but I think you just brought a knife

  
to a gunfight.

  
Outside now.

  
- Hit this guy.
- Who?

  
Joe College. Hit him hard.

  
- Here, hold this.
- What?

  
That's my boyfriend!

  
Take it outside!

  
Get that greaser!

  
Your mom didn't escape.

  
They let her go,
so she could mail the letter

  
and you could bring it to me
and I could translate it!

  
Get on, gramps!

  
Go, go, go, go, go!

  
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

  
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

  
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

  
This is crazy!
Somebody's going to get hurt!

  
Left! Go left! Left!

  
Move, move! Move!

  
Split, split! Split, split!

  
- You're going too fast.
- That's a matter of opinion!

  
- Excuse me, Dr. Jones.
- Yes?

  
I just had a question on
Hargrove's normative culture model.

  
Forget Hargrove.

  
Read Vere Gordon Childe
on diffusionism.

  
He spent most of his life in the field.

  
If you want to be a good archeologist,

  
you got to get out of the library!

  
Who is that?

  
Francisco de Orellana,
the conquistador.

  
Remember, the guy who got lost
looking for the skull.

  
And just as I thought.

  
Koihoma.

  
What's that?

  
It's an extinct Latin American language.
Pre-Columbian syllabic base.

  
See. Diagonal stresses
on the ideograms. Definitely Koihoma.

  
- You speak it?
- Nobody speaks it.

  
It hasn't been heard aloud
in 3,000 years.

  
I might be able to read a bit though
if I walk it through Mayan first.

  
You know, for an old man,
you ain't bad in a fight.

  
Thanks a lot.

  
What are you, like, 80?

  
It's a riddle.

  
Leave it to Ox to write a riddle
in a dead language.

  
"Follow the lines in the earth
only gods can read

  
"which lead to Orellana's cradle

  
"guarded by the living dead."

  
- He's talking about the Nazca Lines.
- What are those?

  
Hold on here.

  
Geoglyphs. Giant ancient drawings
carved into the desert floor in Peru.

  
From the ground,
they don't look like anything.

  
But from the sky,
only the gods can read them,

  
because only gods live up there.

  
Oxley's telling us
the skull is in Nazca, Peru.

  
Finally. They saw him.

  
Ox wandered into town a couple
of months ago, raving like a madman.

  
Police locked him up in the sanitarium.
It's this way.

  
I took Spanish and I didn't understand
a word of that. What was it?

  
Quechua, local Incan dialect.

  
- Where'd you learn that one?
- Long story.

  
I got time.

  
I rode with Pancho Villa.
A couple of his guys spoke it.

  
Bullshit!

  
- You asked.
- Pancho Villa?

  
- Technically, I was kidnapped.
- By Pancho Villa?

  
It was the fight
against Victoriano Huerta.

  
- How old were you?
- About your age.

  
Your parents must've had a cow, huh?

  
It worked out.
Things were a little tense at home.

  
Yeah, me and my mom
aren't on the best of terms, either.

  
Treat her right, kid. You only get one
and sometimes not for that long.

  
It's not my fault. It's hers.

  
She just got P.O.'ed
because I quit school.

  
She thinks
I'm some kind of goof or something.

  
- You quit school?
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Tons of them.

  
Fancy prep schools
that teach you how to debate

  
and chess and fencing.

  
I'm great with the blade.
I just think it's a waste of time.

  
- You never finished.
- No.

  
Just a bunch of useless skills.
Wrong books.

  
'Cause I love reading.
Me and Ox used to read all the time.

  
But now I can pick them myself.
You get me?

  
- What do you do for money?
- Fix motorcycles.

  
Gonna do that
for the rest of your life?

  
Maybe I will, Teach.
You got a problem with that?

  
No. Not if that's what you love doing.

  
Don't let anybody tell you different.

  
This is it. Sister.

  
She says Ox isn't here.
She doesn't know where he is.

  
Some men came and took him away,
men with guns.

  
She says he was obsessed, deranged.

  
Drew pictures
all over the walls of his cell.

  
This riddle in Oxley's letter
doesn't make any sense.

  
"Follow the lines that only the gods
can read that lead to Orellana's cradle."

  
Cradle, cradle, birth.

  
Orellana wasn't born in Peru.
He was born in Spain.

  
He was a conquistador.
He came here for the gold.

  
What happened to him?

  
He disappeared along with six others.
Their bodies were never found.

  
He must have lost his mind.

  
Ox, man, what happened?
What happened?

  
This is not the Mitchell-Hedges skull.

  
Look at the elongated cranium.

  
And the same word

  
in different languages,
over and over again.

  
Return.

  
Return where?

  
Or return what?

  
You mean the skull?

  
Seems to have been on his mind.

  
Where was he supposed to return it to?

  
- Sweep.
- Yeah.

  
Ox didn't mean Orellana's birthplace.

  
Cradle has another meaning in Mayan.

  
Literally, it means "resting place,"
as in final resting place.

  
Ox meant Orellana's grave.

  
This drawing scratched into the floor
is the cemetery where he's buried.

  
You said Orellana vanished
and nobody ever found his grave.

  
Well, it looks like Harold Oxley did.

  
"Grave robbers will be shot."

  
Good thing we're not grave robbers.

  
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know yet.

  
Maybe an antechamber
off one of these barrows.

  
I think I just saw something!

  
Oh, you're jumping at shadows.

  
This way down.

  
- This way up.
- Yeah.

  
Those darts are poison!

  
Stay there.

  
You're a teacher?

  
Part-time.

  
Dead end.

  
Maybe.

  
What are you doing?
Put that thing away.

  
Give me some light over here.

  
Bring it over here.

  
It's just a thing.

  
Dance on your own dime, will you?

  
One of the scorpions just stung me!
Am I gonna die?

  
- How big?
- Huge!

  
- Good.
- Good?

  
When it comes to scorpions,
the bigger the better.

  
A small one bites you,
don't keep it to yourself.

  
Their skulls. Look at their skulls, man.

  
Like the drawings in Oxley's cell.
Means we're getting closer.

  
That's crazy. Why is it like that?

  
Nazca Indians used to
bind their infants' heads with rope

  
to elongate the skull like that.

  
- Why?
- Honor the gods.

  
No, no. God's head is not like that, man.

  
Depends on who your god is.

  
You're going nowhere fast.

  
Professor, this really
is a dead end. Look.

  
Hey!

  
Come on, genius. Bring the backpack.

  
- This is incredible.
- Unreal.

  
Don't touch anything.

  
Footprints. Somebody's been here.

  
Recently.

  
Two sets of prints.

  
Same size, could have been
the same person twice.

  
Not bad, kid.

  
One. Two.

  
Three. Four. Five. Six.

  
Seven.

  
Orellana and his men might've
made it out of the jungle after all.

  
Give me some light.

  
You don't have a knife, do you?

  
Looks like he just died yesterday.

  
It's the wrappings. They preserved him.

  
What just happened?

  
He's been wrapped up for 500 years.
Air doesn't agree with him.

  
Thanks.

  
I don't want to keep
borrowing yours all the time.

  
- That's fine.
- I was going to put it back.

  
Is this one open already?

  
It's him.

  
It's Orellana himself.

  
They called him The Gilded Man.
His lust for gold was legendary.

  
It's odd.

  
Somebody's been here and gone.

  
But they left all this gold
and all the artifacts.

  
What were they looking for?

  
- Hold this.
- No. No.

  
Unbelievable.

  
No tool marks.

  
A single piece of seamless quartz.

  
Cut across the grain.

  
It's not possible, even with
today's technology, it would shatter.

  
Crystal's not magnetic.

  
Neither is gold.

  
What is this thing?

  
Maybe the Nazca Indians thought
this was their god.

  
- You think this is the one from...
- From Akator.

  
Maybe the Spaniards found this skull
along with all this other loot.

  
They were headed for their ships
along the shore.

  
Maybe the Indians caught up with them,

  
or they got to squabbling
amongst themselves

  
over their prize, kill each other off.

  
The Indians wrap them up
and bury them.

  
A couple of hundred years later,
Oxley shows up here, finds the skull.

  
Takes it away, maybe to Akator.

  
But then he returns it here.

  
Return.

  
Return, like he wrote
on the walls of his cell.

  
He put it back where he found it. Why?

  
- Hello, Jonesey.
- Hello, Mac.

  
You're lucky I turned up, Jonesey.

  
Dovchenko there wanted
to blow your brains out.

  
That's the third time I've saved your life.

  
Unshackle me. I'll give you a big hug.

  
You had a Luger
pointed at the base of your skull

  
the first time we met.

  
I had the situation under control.

  
- You owe me.
- What do you owe them?

  
After the war, when you turned,

  
how many names
did you give the Reds?

  
You're not looking
at the big picture here.

  
How many good men died
because of you?

  
Eventually, they're gonna
let me out of this chair, comrade,

  
and when they do,
I'm going to break your nose.

  
"Comrade"?
You think this is about flags?

  
About uniforms?
You think this is about lines on a map?

  
It's just about money, isn't it?

  
No. Not only money.

  
A gigantic pile of money.

  
Don't worry about
what the Russians will pay.

  
It's nothing compared
to what's at Akator.

  
An entire city of gold.
It's what the conquistadors were after.

  
For God's sake, Jonesey, we'd be rich!
Richer than Howard Hughes!

  
Blood money, every nickel.

  
I need you to see the angle here, mate.

  
Be smart. Do the right thing.
Just like in...

  
Like in Berlin. Got me?

  
Just like in Berlin.

  
You want me to trot off,
or should we sing a song?

  
How fortunate our failure to kill you,
Dr. Jones.

  
You survive
to be of service to us once again.

  
Well, you know me, always glad to help.

  
"Now I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

  
You recognize those words?

  
It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer
after he created the atomic bomb.

  
He was quoting the Hindu bible.

  
It was nuclear intimidation.

  
But now this next level of weapon
is ours to have,

  
yours to fear.

  
Weapon? What weapon?

  
A mind weapon.

  
A new frontier of psychic warfare.
That was Stalin's dream.

  
Now I know why Oxley
put the skull back where he found it.

  
He knew you were looking for it.

  
That skull is no mere deity carving.

  
Surely you knew that
the moment you laid eyes on it.

  
It was not made by human hands.

  
Who made it, then?

  
Come on.

  
The body we found in New Mexico
was not the first.

  
We'd already dissected two others
from similar crash sites in Soviet Union.

  
Saucer men from Mars.

  
The legends about Akator are all true.

  
Early men could not have conceived it,
much less built it.

  
It was a city of supreme beings

  
with technologies
and paranormal abilities.

  
You got to be kidding me.

  
Why do you choose
not to believe your own eyes?

  
The New Mexico specimen
gave us hope.

  
Unlike the others we'd found,
its skeleton was pure crystal.

  
A distant cousin, perhaps. Maybe they,
too, were sent to find Akator.

  
Perhaps we're all searching
for the same thing.

  
- There is no other explanation.
- There's always another explanation.

  
The skull was stolen from Akator
in the 15th century.

  
Whoever returns it...

  
Returns it to the city temple
will gain control over its powers.

  
I've heard that bedtime story before.

  
It's a legend.
Why do you think Akator even existed?

  
You should ask your friend
that question.

  
We're certain he's been there.

  
Oxley?

  
Ox, it's me, Indy.

  
Ox?

  
Ox, you're faking it, right?

  
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears..."

  
Ox, listen to me, pal.
Your name is Harold Oxley.

  
You were born in Leeds, England.

  
You and I went to school together
at the University of Chicago.

  
And you were never this interesting.
My name is...

  
My name is Henry Jones, Jr.

  
What have you done to him?

  
We ain't done a thing.
It's the bloody skull.

  
He is the divining rod
that will lead us to Akator.

  
But we need someone
to interpret him for us.

  
His mind, it seems, is quite weak.
Let's hope yours is stronger.

  
The skull's crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain,

  
opening a psychic channel.

  
Oxley lost control of his mind
by staring too long into its eyes.

  
We believe you can get through to him
after you have done the same.

  
I've got a better idea. You look at it.

  
The skull does not speak to everyone,
it seems.

  
Surely you're not afraid, Dr. Jones.

  
You've spent your entire life
searching for answers.

  
Think of the truth behind those eyes.

  
There may be
hundreds of skulls at Akator.

  
Whoever finds them
will control the greatest natural force

  
the world has ever known.

  
Power over the mind of man.

  
Be careful,
you might get exactly what you wish for.

  
I usually do.

  
Imagine.

  
To peer across the world
and know the enemy's secrets.

  
To place our thoughts
into the minds of your leaders.

  
Make your teachers
teach the true version of history,

  
your soldiers attack on our command.

  
We'll be everywhere at once,
more powerful than a whisper,

  
invading your dreams,

  
thinking your thoughts for you
while you sleep.

  
We will change you, Dr. Jones,

  
all of you, from the inside.

  
We will turn you into us.

  
And the best part?
You won't even know it's happening.

  
Return.

  
Return?

  
That's enough.

  
That's enough.
If he dies, we can't get there.

  
Cover it.

  
Henry.

  
You all right, Jonesey?

  
- You broke my nose!
- I told you.

  
Enough! You will speak to Oxley
and lead us to Akator, yes?

  
Take him outside.

  
- You all right, kid?
- They left my bike at the cemetery.

  
- Yeah, but you're all right?
- They left my bike.

  
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

  
I'm ready. Don't give these pigs a thing.

  
You heard him.

  
Clearly I have chosen
the wrong pressure point.

  
Perhaps I can find a more sensitive one.

  
Get your hands off me,
you rotten Russki son of a bitch!

  
Indiana Jones.

  
About time you showed up.

  
- Mom!
- Sweetheart.

  
"Mom"?

  
What are you doing here?

  
Forget about me. Are you all right?

  
- "Mom"?
- Young man, I specifically told you

  
- not to come here.
- Marion is your mother?

  
You never wrote that.
You never said that in any phone calls.

  
Marion Ravenwood is your mother?

  
For God's sake, Indy, it's not that hard.

  
No, I mean, I just never thought...

  
I would have a life after you left.

  
- That's not what I meant.
- A damn good life!

  
- Well, that's fine.
- A damn good, really good life!

  
- Well, so have I!
- Yeah?

  
You still leaving
a trail of human wreckage,

  
or have you retired?

  
Why? You looking for a date?

  
With anybody but you.

  
So, Dr. Jones, you will help us?

  
A simple "yes" will do.

  
Oh, Marion, you had to go
and get yourself kidnapped.

  
Not like you did any better.

  
Same old, same old.

  
Henry Jones, Jr.

  
- Henry Jones, Jr...
- That's right, Ox. Listen to me.

  
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

  
- "that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
- Palace of...

  
It's from Milton.
He's said it before. Why?

  
Ox, you got to tell us
how to get to Akator

  
or they're gonna kill Marion.

  
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears,
here in death's dream kingdom..."

  
Harold, they're gonna kill
Abner's little girl.

  
Harold, they're gonna kill
Abner's little girl.

  
You got to tell us how to get there.
We need...

  
Get me paper. Something to write with.

  
Autowriting! I should have seen this.

  
- Henry Jones, Jr.
- Right. That's right, Ox.

  
Three times it drops. The way down.

  
- Three times...
- Pictographs.

  
Ideograms.

  
Good, Ox. Good.

  
Ox?

  
It's me, Ox.

  
It's Mutt, Ox. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. It's me.

  
It's me.

  
The wavy lines mean water, of course.
Closed eyes mean sleep.

  
The sun with the arc over the sky
stands for time, duration.

  
The word "now" is "until."

  
These two close together,

  
the horizon and the snake,
mean one thought.

  
The horizon stood for the world,

  
but it didn't mean the Earth.
It meant big, great.

  
"The water sleeps
until the great snake."

  
These aren't just drawings,
they're directions. Get me a map!

  
The great snake is the Amazon,
of course,

  
but "sleep," what water sleeps?

  
Here! Sono.
The Portuguese word for "sleep."
  
Yes, good. Exactly.

  
He wants us
to follow this curve of the Sono

  
down to where it meets the Amazon
to the southeast.

  
After that, I'm not sure.

  
Kingdom of dreams, tears and eyes...
I have no idea what he means.

  
This could be the route, though.

  
It's a completely unexplored part
of the canopy.

  
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on!

  
- Kid, what the hell are we doing, kid?
- They were going to kill us!

  
- Well, maybe.
- Somebody had to do something!

  
- Something else would have been good.
- At least I got a plan.

  
This is intolerable.
Harold, for God's sake, keep up.

  
Mom?

  
- Stay back!
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't move.

  
Moving makes space,
space will make you sink.

  
No, I think I can get out if I can just...

  
Stop it!
You're pulling against a vacuum.

  
It's like trying to lift a car.
Just stay calm.

  
Okay, I'm calm.

  
- What is it? Quicksand?
- I'm calm.

  
- No, it's a dry sand pit.
- I'm sinking, but I'm calm.

  
Quicksand is a mix of sand,
mud and water.

  
And depending on the viscosity,
it's not as dangerous

  
- as people sometimes think.
- For Pete's sake, Jones,

  
we're not in school!

  
Don't worry. There's nothing
to worry about unless there's a...

  
A void collapse.

  
I'll go get something to pull you out.

  
Ox, don't just sit there.

  
For God's sake, man, go get help!

  
- Help?
- Help!

  
Help?

  
Help! Go!

  
Mutt can be a little impetuous.

  
It's not the worst quality in the world.

  
Keep your arms above the surface.
When the kid comes back, grab on.

  
- Indy, he...
- He's a good kid, Marion.

  
You should get off his back
about school.

  
- Mutt, I mean...
- Not everybody's cut out for it.

  
His name is Henry!

  
Henry. Good name.

  
He's your son.

  
My son?

  
Henry Jones the Third.

  
Why the hell
didn't you make him finish school?

  
- Mom, grab on! Grab it!
- Yeah.

  
I got it.

  
Come on, Mom! Pull, pull, pull, pull!

  
Pull!

  
Grab on.

  
- Grab it.
- Just grab it, Indy.

  
It's a rat snake!

  
- Rat snakes aren't that big.
- Well, this one is, all right?

  
It's not even poisonous. Now grab on!

  
- Go get something else.
- Like what?

  
Like a rope or something.

  
There's no Sears and Roebuck here!
Grab the snake!

  
- Maybe I can touch the bottom.
- There's no bottom. Now grab it.

  
No, I think I can feel it with my feet.

  
- Grab the snake!
- Stop calling it that!

  
It's a snake!
What do you want me to call it?

  
- Say "rope."
- What?

  
Say "grab the rope."

  
- Grab the rope!
- Grab the rope!

  
Hold tight. It's slimy.

  
Pull!

  
Get rid of that thing, will you, Son?

  
Afraid of snakes.

  
You are one crazy old man.

  
Why do you have to do everything
the hard way, Jonesey?

  
Good work, Ox. Thanks.

  
Help.

  
No. No, he was British.
My dad was an RAF pilot.

  
He was a war hero,
not some schoolteacher!

  
No, sweetheart.
Colin was your stepfather.

  
We started dating
when you were three months old.

  
He was a good man.

  
Wait, wait, wait. Colin?
As in Colin Williams? You...

  
You married him? I introduced you!

  
I think you gave up your vote
on who I married

  
when you decided to break it off
a week before the wedding!

  
I think we both knew, Marion,
it wasn't going to work.

  
You didn't know that.
Why didn't you ever talk to me about it?

  
Because we never had an argument
I won!

  
It's not my fault if you can't keep up!

  
I didn't want to hurt you!

  
For love of God, shut the hell up!

  
Didn't you ever wonder years ago
why Ox stopped talking to you?

  
He hated that you ran away.

  
Would you two just stop?

  
Yeah, Marion, let's not let the kid see
mom and dad fight.

  
- You're not my dad, okay?
- You bet I am.

  
And I got news for you.

  
You're gonna go back and finish school.

  
Really? What happened to,

  
"There's not a damn thing
wrong with it, kid,

  
"and don't let anybody else
tell you any different"?

  
You don't remember saying that?

  
That was before I was your father!

  
- You're not my father!
- Oh, yes, he is your father.

  
You should have
told me about the kid, Marion.

  
I had a right to know.

  
You vanished after that.

  
- I wrote.
- A year later!

  
By then,
Mutt was born and I was married!

  
Why are you bothering to tell me now?

  
Because I thought we were gonna die!

  
Not yet!

  
Got it?

  
Oh, shit.

  
I'm sure I wasn't the only one
to go on with my life.

  
There must've been
plenty of women for you over the years.

  
Yeah. There were a few,
but they all had the same problem.

  
Yeah? What's that?

  
They weren't you, honey.

  
We got to get Oxley back,
get our hands on that skull

  
and get to Akator before they do.
Grab the wheel.

  
What's he gonna do now?

  
- I don't think he plans that far ahead.
- Yeah.

  
- Scooch over, will you, Son?
- Don't call me "son." Don't.

  
I think I'd cover my ears if I were you.

  
Duck! Duck!

  
Move, move!

  
Pull up next to that duck.

  
Henry Jones, Jr.

  
Jones!

  
Come on! Come on!

  
Get down!

  
Ox has got the skull.
Marion, take the wheel.

  
That's not fair. She drove the truck.

  
Don't be a child.
Find something to fight with.

  
Jonesey!

  
- Jonesey!
- Hi, Mac.

  
- Indy. Indy! Indy!
- Shut up! Shut up!

  
- You stupid son of a bitch! I'm CIA.
- CIA.

  
I almost screamed it at you in the tent.
I said, "Just like Berlin."

  
What were we in Berlin, mate?

  
- Double agents!
- The skull!

  
Throw me the skull!

  
Throw me the skull!

  
Riposte.

  
Riposte.

  
Get on your front foot. Riposte.

  
It's not a match, Mom.

  
You fight like a young man,
eager to begin, quick to finish.

  
Mutt, disengage!

  
Hey! Hey, I got the skull!

  
- Throw the bag! Throw it!
- Throw the bag!

  
- Gun!
- Gun!

  
What are you looking at, Daddy-o?
She's getting away!

  
This is very dangerous.

  
Do svidanya, Dr. Jones.

  
Jones!

  
Whoa.

  
Whoa.

  
Whoa!

  
Turn!

  
- Siafu.
- What?

  
Big damn ants! Go!

  
Run to the river!

  
Get to the river!

  
Jump in! Come on! Come on!

  
Mom, there's a cliff!

  
- Jonesey, come on!
- Get in, Jones!

  
- Mom, stop.
- Mom, slow down.

  
- Honey, stop.
- Slow down, Mom.

  
- You're gonna go off the cliff.
- That's the idea.

  
- Bad idea. Give me the wheel.
- Trust me!

  
Slow down!

  
- Don't ever do that again.
- Yes, dear.

  
Three times it drops.

  
Reverse. Put it in reverse! Full reverse!

  
- I'm trying! I'm trying!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom!

  
The way down.

  
He means by land. He came by land.

  
- Three times it drops?
- Three times it drops.

  
What is he talking about?

  
He means one!

  
Two!

  
Three.

  
You okay? Babe? Let go.

  
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears."

  
"The golden vision reappears!"

  
Gold. I'm in.

  
Through eyes... Through eyes in tears.
We got to go through that waterfall!

  
The skull has to be returned.
I'll do it. Nobody else has to come.

  
Who cares?

  
It's brought us nothing but trouble.

  
Look what it did to him.

  
- I have to return it.
- Why you?

  
Because it told me to.

  
- Ochre, iron oxide, charcoal.
- Oxy, stay with us.

  
How old is this?

  
Four or five thousand years.
Old as the pyramids.

  
Look, sun worshippers,
like the Egyptians.

  
This is fresh. These were just used.

  
More worshippers.

  
Yeah, but that's not
the sun they're worshipping.

  
Someone came

  
and taught the Ugha farming.

  
Irrigation.

  
Ox, what is it?

  
I think I understand, Ox.

  
Someone came?

  
Are they the same?

  
There were more. Look.

  
Thirteen in a circle.

  
Show us the way, Ox.

  
- Let's go. Go, go, go! Run! Run, go!
- Go!

  
Indy!

  
Jonesey!

  
Oxley!

  
You were here before.
How did you get past them?

  
Come on, Mac. Come on!
Come on, Mac.

  
Come on, come on, come on.

  
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

  
- "that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
- Come on, Ox.

  
You did good, Ox. You did good.

  
City of gold. So where's all the gold?

  
Look at the state of this place.

  
What a stupid legend.
What a waste of my time.

  
Ox was here before,
but he couldn't get into the temple,

  
so he took the skull back
to the cemetery, where he found it.

  
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

  
"that ope's the Palace of Eternity."

  
Key that ope's the palace.

  
The obelisk. The obelisk is the key?

  
What are you looking for, Ox?

  
What are you doing?

  
You figured this out in your cell,
didn't you, Professor?

  
Excuse me, Professor.

  
Well done.

  
Go get your own.

  
Listen.

  
Hear that?

  
Get up! Move! Ox, move!

  
Faster! Faster!

  
Faster! Faster!

  
Faster!

  
This is not good. Move, Ox! Move!

  
Quick! Quick! Quick!

  
I don't like this! I don't like it!

  
- Mom, come on!
- Jonesey!

  
He dropped it. He dropped the skull!

  
Okay?

  
Hold this.

  
Ox, you okay?

  
Lovely.

  
All right, let's go.

  
This way?

  
Now that's more like it.

  
There are artifacts
from every era of early history.

  
Macedonian.

  
- Sumerian.
- This place is the mother lode.

  
Etruscan. Babylonian.

  
There isn't a museum in the world
that wouldn't sell its soul for this lot.

  
Early Egyptian.

  
Dozens of museums.
Hundreds of them, Jonesey!

  
Collectors.

  
They were archeologists.

  
How do we open it?

  
I'll give it back, Ox. I promise.

  
No more forever waiting.

  
Soon now.

  
Sorry, Jonesey.

  
So what are you, a triple agent?

  
Nah, I just lied about being a double.

  
Look at them!

  
Still waiting for the return
of the one who was lost.

  
They are a hive mind.

  
One being physically separate,
but with a collective consciousness.

  
More powerful together
than they can ever be apart.

  
Imagine what they could tell us.

  
I can't imagine.

  
Neither could the humans
that built this temple,

  
and neither can you.

  
Belief, Dr. Jones,
is a gift you have yet to receive.

  
My sympathies.

  
Oh, I believe, sister.
That's why I'm down here.

  
- Mayan. He's speaking Mayan.
- What does he say?

  
He says he's grateful and he wants...

  
It.

  
It wants to give us a gift.

  
A big gift.

  
Tell me everything you know.

  
I want to know everything.
I want to know.

  
I've got a bad feeling about this.

  
Indy?

  
The eyes.

  
What are they? Spacemen?

  
Interdimensional beings, in point of fact.

  
Welcome back, Ox.

  
What the hell is that?

  
A portal!
A pathway to another dimension!

  
I don't think we want to go that way.

  
I want to know.

  
I want to know.

  
Tell me. I'm ready. I want to know.

  
Mac! Mac! Come on!

  
Mac!

  
Mac, damn it, now!

  
I can see.

  
I can see!

  
Grab it!

  
Use your legs, Mac. I can't do it alone.

  
Jonesey!

  
I'm going to be all right.

  
No more!

  
Cover it. Cover it.

  
Go!

  
Enough!

  
Enough!

  
Go! Go!

  
Like a broom to their footprints.

  
Where did they go? Space?

  
Not into space.
Into the space between spaces.

  
I don't understand.

  
Why this legend of a city of gold?

  
The Ugha word for gold
translates as "treasure."

  
But their treasure wasn't gold.
It was knowledge.

  
Knowledge was their treasure.

  
What? We're just going to sit here?

  
Night falls quick in the jungle, kid.

  
You don't want to
climb down the mountain in the dark.

  
No?

  
I can. Who's coming with me?
Come on.

  
Why don't you stick around, Junior?

  
I don't know. Why didn't you, Dad?

  
Dad!

  
Dad?

  
Somewhere your grandpa is laughing.

  
Marvelous! Perfect!
Make the letters bigger, much bigger.

  
Henry Jones, Jr.,
and Marion Ravenwood,

  
insomuch in that you two have agreed
to live together in holy matrimony,

  
have promised your love for each other
by these vows

  
the joining of your hands
and the giving of these rings,

  
I now declare you
to be husband and wife.

  
Whom God hath put together,
let no one tear asunder.

  
"How much of human life
is lost in waiting!"

  
Congratulations.

  
You may kiss your bride.

  
Well done, Henry!

  
- Thanks, Ox.
- Thanks, Ox.

You heard me.

  
Asshole!

  
Watch out!

  
(Over radio)

  
Hancock is in the car and he appears
to be negotiating with the gunmen

  
shhhh shhh shhhhhhh

  
Fellas, fellas

  
I don't give a shit what
you did. I dont care.

  
Three guys in the car with
no girls, Rave music

  
hey, I'm not going to judge

  
but if you dont pull over and give
yourselves over quietly

  
I swear to Christ. Your head is going
up the drivers ass

  
His head, is going up your ass and
you drew the short stick

  
cause your head is going up my ass.

  
(Hellicopter Radio)

  
We've just confirmed there is
chaos here on the 
  
Konichiwa

  
Whait! I'm not Japanese man.
Let us down.

  
Oh, now you speak the English
huh?

  
Speak English now?

  
You broke my Glasses

  
I'm sorry.
Take my Ray-Bans.

Huh?
You want down?

  
Ahhh.
I'm real good at down.

  
I'm Real good at down

  
Alrite?
Alrite!

  
This, Hancocks latest act of so-called
heroics

  
took a hefty financial toll.

  
Initial estimates are said to top
Nine Million dollars

  
Which, if accurate, represents a
personal record for the notoriously

  
publisity shy Hancock.
Who, as usual, cant be reached

  
for comment

  
(On TV)

  
With all the cracks in the streets,
the fires, the water damage, the fires

  
L.A. would be a lot better off if this guy
would just leave and let us

  
get on with our jobs.
He's never asked us for a badge

  
He's never worked with us in any
capacity

  
what so-ever. Zero
I dont mind if he could just

  
do it somewhere else.
New York maybe!

  
Let them tussel with him for a
while.

  
What the hell is the crane doing there?

  
Move the...
The crane's not gonna help idiot!

  
Iwill break my foot off in your
ass woman

  
This Hancock guy, is surely on
some kind of mission and he's using

  
our city to beat himself up for reasons
known only to him...

  
Sir. Ray Embry
Ray. Pleasure

  
So?
Ray's like the Bono of P.R.

  
Actually, Bono is like the Bono of P.R.
but i do try

  
Well... Lets see it.
Ok

  
I'll get right into it.
Goodmorning everyone

  
I'm here to talk to you about
charitable giving

  
ok and we all know the way that
that works is you give one maybe

  
two percent of your net cash and you
get and arm band or a wrist band

  
or a ribbon or whatever it is
It's nowhere near enough

  
and thats why we, at Embry Publicity
would like to offer you..

  
The All Heart symbol.
Now..

  
you would be among a very select
group

  
of corporate giants to bare this logo
on your product

  
and what this would say to the
public

  
is that your company, Phara Thompsis,
Has made a radical contribution..

  
to helping our world. And here's
all you need to do to qualify.

  
Your new T.B. drug, Micodine,
we would like you to give that

  
product away
for free.

  
Did you say free?
I did.

  
Only to those that really need it.
Only to those who, without it,

  
would other wise die.

  
well, it is a concept thats up there with..
leathal side affects

  
Mandatory product recall.
Get indicted, go to jail

  
Get out, work at IHop for the
rest of your life

  
Understandable reactions.
A radical concept but.

  
It is the brand that represents a
fairer and better world

  
The brand that everyone
is talking about

  
Who is everyone?

  
We do already have a sports franchise.

  
NFL? MBA? MLB?
Soccer.

  
MLS?
Which team?

  
Well, It's a local team.
Inceno Hurricanes.

  
My sons team.
Anyway...

  
We can save the world.
Alright. Someones just gotta go first

  
What do you say?

  
Are you a crackpot?

This guy is like a little talking

We don't have a lot of guests

Fine.

  
Yeah? No more problems with that
bully Michael?

  
Michele.

  
Michele huh?
Yeah, it's French

  
Michele, Hancock is this..
Hancock? Michele is this neighborhood

  
bully. We've been trying to teach Arron
about conflict resolution.

  
hmmm...

Yeah, Turn the other cheek
and all that?

  
Thats exactly right.

  
uh huh, Well just dont ever turn
that one alrite.

  
Never let them punk you.

  
Got it.
Ok Arron. Eat your food.

  
The way you deal with bullies is you
take you right foot...

  
bring it right up.. catch him
in his little piss punk.

  
You dont have to do that honey.
ok?

  
It's a good idea.
You aim strait..

  
Make sure he cant use that thing for
nothing but a flap to keep the dust

  
out of his buttcrack.
Ok, Please.

  
Just stop. Michele is not a man.
He's a little boy ok. And his parents

  
happen to be going through a really
bad divorce and

  
thats why he's acting up.
And maybe you dont know this but

  
not everything in this world gets
resolved by brute force

  
Not everything has to be bang, scream,
blood, more blood.

  
there is just so much distruction..
Angel!

  
She watches so much news...
That sometimes it gets to be

  
a little too much.

  
you got a toilet?

  
yup.
Yeah, just past the fridge.

  
Did he... Just take the wiskey
bottle to the bathroom?

  
Do you want him to kill
us all?

  
Thanks for coming on in.
Good right?

  
Very. Yeah. Yeah.
You want to say goodbye to him?

  
Goodbye Hancock.
Hey, Alright little buddy.

Hate? I don't hate him,Ray.

  
I don't even know the guy.

I think he just needs people
to care, you know?

  
You see the good in everybody Ray,
even sometimes when it's not there.

  
I have a feeling about this,
don't work with the guy.

Michele screaming

  
Alrite, alrite. You'll be alrite.

  
Daaad.. Daddy...
Mommy..

  
Stop crying punk ass. Go ahead.

  
Not ok.
He's alrite.

  
Really not ok.

  
This is some of the stuff
we're going to work on.

  
How do think that conversation is
going to go down with his mom?

  
landing like that in the street
is also on the uncool side.

  
naaa, that was already like
that when i got here.

  
I live here.
I know what the streets look like.

  
we're just gonna make those
problems of the past.

  
Im going to teach you how to
interface with the public.

  
Where's the wife?

  
Ahh, Marry took Arron
to his soccer game.

  
Hancock,
Pulled some stuff up on YouTube.

  
A supprising large amount of not great
stuff on you but it's gonna be helpfull

  
What is this?
Thats me trying to change the world.

  
Unfortunatly not doing real well.

  
come on. Lets get to you.
This stuff was on YouTube.

  
Now, everybody loves a Nutty Buddy
I get it.

  
But this doesnt work sir.

  
Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.

  
(kids creaming)

  
Mom, Mom, MOM!

  
Those are...
Children.

  
Get that camera out of my
face.

  
You ever uh...

  
put out an appartment
fire Ray?

  
No. I've never done that.
I'm in P.R.

  
My ass was hot.

  
Alright. How 'bout this?
This is Walter, the grey whale

  
everybody remembers him
stuck on the beach in MonteZuma

  
Along comes Hancock...

  
I dont even remember that. Yeah.. Greenpeace
Does. Walter does.

  
This all gets redundant after a while,

  
but my basic diagnosis of your
fundamental problem is..

  
Wanna hear it?
No.

  
You're and asshole

  
I know. I call it like I see it though.
It's not a crime to be an asshole

  
but it's very counterproductive.
Not a crime but you are an asshole.

  
dont you think?
Be careful.

  
Alright, How about this?

  
I've been thinking about something. This
kinda goes to how you present yourself.

  
Come on, Really?
It's the middle of the day.

  
What springs to mind...
When you see this?

  
Homo

  
How 'bout that?
Homo in red

  
Norwegian homo.
I'll give ya that.

  
Let's move past the comics.
Lets get into something deaper

  
I think... That deap down you behave
badly because you are lonely

  
I think deep down you want
peoples acceptance.

  
come on now, you save peoples
lives and they reject you

  
so you reject them back.

  
and we're switch that cycle. We're
gonna start fresh, start new.

  
This is outstanding. If you turn
some of this power into will-power

  
Hey Hancock!
We almost won.

  
Yeah we did. ok, up stairs. I'm
making lunch. Go change.

  
Hey sweetheart.

  
were you watching the news?
No. we've been working on Hancock

  
enterfacing with the public.
enterfacing with the public.

  
This has been on all day.

  
(on tv)
The law, is the law Mr. Hancock.

  
And you are not above it.
Felony distruction of property

  
Amounting to tens of millions of dollars,
theft and now this.

  
From where i sit... I see a selfish self
absorbed man,

  
With a lot of mussle, but no regard for
anyone but yourself.

  
Mr Hancock. Let me remind you. You
are not above the law.

  
You have failed to show at over subpoenas and civil suits.

  
Anybody else would be held in contempt.
But, Oh no, not you.

  
You may be a super-hero but let
me tell you this.

  
You're not nearly as strong as the
U.S. Constitution.

  
Bank on it buddy!

  
Genious. Things just got real.
This is exactly what we needed.

  
This is perfect. Right now there is a D.A.
trying to figure out how to come up here

  
and put you in jail.
Bitch can try.

  
I say you go.

  
People take you for granted you know?
We gotta make people miss you.

  
People don't like you Hancock.
(Arron) I do.

  
Two weeks. You know? The public will be
clammering for you. When they do..

  
We'll be ready. And uh, worst case scenario is
I'm wrong and you just fly out of there.

  
what do you have to lose ?

  
(Crowd Clammering)

  
I apologise to the people of Los Angeles.
But my behavior has been improper

  
and i accept the consequences.

  
I ask my fellow Angelinos for their
patience and understanding.

  
(crowd yelling)
You're and asshole!

  
Life here can be difficult for me.
After-all I'm the only one of my kind.

  
During my incarceration I will be
partisapating in Alcohol and

  
anger management treatment.

  
You deserve better from me. I can
be better. I wiil be better.

  
Give me the hand playboy.

  
Oh, I get it.

  
I put some uh.. well most
of you in here.

  
(Inmate agreeing)

  
I can understand you feeling some
kind of way about that.

  
Uh.. so... I'm gonna do me. And I'm
gonna let you do you

  
I.. I.. Dont want no trouble.

  
Alright?

  
I just want to go to my cell.

  
Excuse me.

  
Excuse me please.

  
If you don't move..
Your head is going up his ass.

  
(Inmates all laughing)

  
Ya'll fellas sure you want to
ride this train?

  
Choo Choo asshole.

  
ohh.
(pants ripping)

  
(crowd)
Ohhhhhhh!

  
(Theme from Sanford And Son playing)

  
Did you shove one man's
head up another man's ass?

  
alright we are gonna circle back to that.

  
The DA's office wants your
sentence to run 8 years.

  
it's a big number, but not something
we didn't anticipate

  
you know our plan is to..
what are you doing?

  
Hey hey hey  hey hey!

  
it sounded like you said they want
me to spend 8 years in this shithole?

  
8 years is more like 4 1/with good behavior

  
but it's erelavant' beacause with
you out of the picture

  
and with the crime rate
going up through the roof

  
The D.A. and the cops are going to
call for your immedate release

  
and they are going to demand it.
They 're gonna ask you..

  
Where you going? Hey!

  
Stop right there.
Hancock. Hancock!

  
Get Back!

  
You're a coward!

  
Who you talking to Ray?
I'm talking to you!

  
Who you talking to Ray?
Stop pretending that you dont care.

  
You've got a calling. You're a hero
Hancock. You're going to be

  
miserable the rest of your life
Untill you accept that.

  
Trust me. Trust this plan. This
process Just stay in here

  
When they call, A hero is
what we are going to give them.

  
How we gonna do that Ray?

  
Aright guys uh.. Lets start sharing.
Don?

  
Yeah.
You had something?

  
Yeah I.. I uh.. think i might have
had a little bit of a break-through

  
Good for you.

  
Yeah, I realize that breaking necks is easy
but uh.. I'm sitting there

  
and i'm stairing at myself in the mirror

  
and I thought...
This is tough.

  
ha ha ha
Why do you always laugh?

  
Picturing you look at the mirror
scares the shit out of me.

  
Everytime i'm talking it
completely ruins the cycle.

  
lets watch the cross talk.
Ok?

  
I'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.

  
no no no no no no
Keep sharing. Lets move on.

proof vest security officer

This city is being run be gangs and drug dealers

Hi Hancock meet these guys

  
This is Mike Kilborn and Jeremy Emerald
Huge fan insane

  
These guys are partners in the biggest ad
firm the west coast

  
You never call
Actually I have called, several times

  
Water under the bridge man

  
Could you guys get use to this or what?

  
How’d you two meet?

  
Umm.. I was married once before
First wife, a she died giving birth to Aaron

  
That’s another dinner, but I’ll.. But umm…
So there I am,

  
I’m with this beautiful little baby and
I don’t know what the hell to do and

  
I was in the super market and I’m in
the baby aisle

  
and I got a brand of diapers in each hand
and I’m staring at them like I don’t know how

  
I’m going to get thorough the day

  
And Angel (laughing)
Sees me

  
She knew and she gave this look

  
And even in the trance I was in
I knew that somebody; somewhere...

  
was throwing me a little rope

  
Well starting that day I put my life back together.
Right?

  
You’re drunk.
so? Come here.

  
What about you buddy?
You’re from another planet, aren’t you?

  
Naw man, I’m from Miami.
You didn’t come in on like a meteor or …?

  
Nope, woke up in a hospital, first thing I remember.
Government hospital, yes? Experimenting on you and

  
No Ray, regular ole Miami emergency room.
Come on?

  
Yeah a my a my a skull was fractured.
They told me I tried to stop a mugging...

  
Somebody knocked you out?

  
I guess I was a regular guy before and
when I woke up I was changed.

  
The hospital nurse tried to put a
needle in my arm and

  
It just broke against my skin
and then my skull healed in like an hour

  
Doctors were astounded

  
And umm they wanted to know my story

  
Just like you but, I couldn’t tell them
I don’t know who I am

  
Amnesia.

  
You know the blow to the head
Yeah well that’s what they figured

  
You don’t remember anything?

  
The only thing I had in my pocket was

  
bubble gum and 2 movie tickets

  
Boris Karloff, Frankenstein

  
But no ID, nothing

  
I went to sign out and the uhh nurse
asked me for my John Hancock

  
So I actually thought that’s who I was

  
How come I didn’t hear any of this, read
about it in any newspapers?

  
It was probably in the papers
about 80 years ago

  
80 years ago
Oh..  I don’t, I don’t age.. This is it.

  
That’s nice.
Gotta wonder though

  
What kind of Bastard must I have been

  
That nobody was there to claim me?

  
I mean I’m not the most charming guy in the world
So I’ve been told, but..

  
Nobody?

  
That didn’t tire you out at all coming up the stairs?
Not really

  
you could’ve just flown me up the stairs
wooo, I could have done with out that.

  
Let’ get your shoes off here.

  
Alright but that’s all you’re getting
off me though, haha

  
You believe in me, don’t you Hancock?

  
Of course Ray, I believe in you.
Help me up here

  
Listen to me this is important
“Cause I believe in you know and I and

  
You’re gonna do great

  
You’re gonna fix everything

  
You get some sleep Ray
You sleep tight too

  
Hancock, tucking me in

  
Alright he’s asleep
Damn babysitter never cleans up after herself

  
You have a bruise on your hand

  
You, you should go

  
It’s getting late

  
If Ray finds out about me...

  
You’re dead

  
(whistling)

  
Joan, we’re going to take care of that, okay?
Don’t you worry.

  
Hi Honey, breakfast?

  
Hancock sneezed, uh?
Can you believe it? Achoo

  
It’s amazing that you slept through that
You’re a good sleeper

  
Holy shit
I’m not going to say I told you so but..

  
You told me he was going to sneeze a hole
through the front of the house?

  
I just said can’t be around
Oh sweetheart can you get that

  
Thanks, Oh God you you’re strong.
I got it.

  
But you don’t worry about anything
I already apologized to the neighbors,

  
called State Farm
Everything is taken care of.

  
You just...

  
enjoy that breakfast

  
What’s this?  We’re going on vacation?
Uh-hum

  
Are we?
Just the 3 of us

  
End of the summer?
Tonight.

  
Tonight?
Let’s go somewhere.

  
Knock Knock.

  
Guzuntight
Uh?

  
I…I was just telling Ray here
I hope you are done sneezing

  
Because I don’t think our house
can take much more

  
Of your sneezing

  
Yeah.. sometimes uh..
I sneeze when there’s dust

  
Or if I get really surprised

  
That’s unfortunate.
(cell phone rings)

  
This is Killborn
Mike, how ya doing?

  
It was great to see you too

  
Yep well uh... right

Shut Up!

(Continuing on the cell phone)
ummm…I suppose I ...

  
Fine, we’ll talk okay?

  
And when we are done talking, you go
away and leave my family alone.

  
My place at 4 o’clock.
Whatever.

  
(Continuing on the cell phone)
it means uh... I would rather not talk numbers now

  
I like to save them for the pitch
So then let’s just set a time

  
That’s good with me I will see you then
Alright yeah 3:30 great

  
Hun is it hot in here?

  
(Wasted Days and Wasted nights)

  
he hurt you didn’t he?

  
Ahhh… Use your words
How did it make you feel?

  
Sore.
Bad

  
Cause he took your power.
And you have to get your power back

  
And no-one will give your power back
You have to go out and take it

  
You understand me?

  
We’re gonna go find Hancock and
Get your power back.

  
Ask.

  
You and I?
You and I what?

  
We’re the same?
No.

  
I’m stronger
Really?

  
Oh yeah

  
who are we?

  
Gods, angels, different cultures call
us by different names

  
Now all of a sudden its super heroes.

  
there are more of us?
There were

  
They all died.

  
Just the two of us

  
What is this?

  
Who are we to each other?

  
We’re brother and sister
That’s a lie.

  
No I’m your sister
That is a lie.

  
I’m your sister
No

  
Sisters don’t kiss brothers the way
you kissed me last night.

  
You’re lying, deals off
Let’s go see how Ray feels about this.

  
Get your ass back here!
I’m telling

  
The All Heart symbol will be known globally,
As a symbol that represents companies

  
That are committed to changing the world

  
They can give away there substance goods okay?
Foods, drugs, power, clothing for free.

  
I thought we were talking about Hancock?
Two…

  
Stay away from me and my family
You are not going to do this to me again.

  
What?
I don’t know what you are talking about.

  
(I love you Hancock)
It can’t work.

  
It always end the same way
Persia, Greece, Brooklyn

  
Brooklyn?
I’ve never been to Brooklyn.

  
I have put up with your Bullshit for
the last 3000 years and I’m done.

  
I don’t know what you are talking about?
Done! You Listening?

  
I don’t know what you are talking about!
I am happy, okay, finally I’m happy

  
You are not going to mess it up
Look at me… I don’t know what you are talking about?

  
I hate to burst your little crazy lady
bubble but it must not

  
Have been all that great
‘cause I don’t remember you

  
Call me crazy….

  
one more time.
Coo coo

  
Alright hold it…Alright
You better not hit me with that truck

  
For companies to qualify for the All Heart symbol
they need to prove that the are a leader

  
in the global revolution.
We gonna talk about Mr. Hancock?

  
That they are committed to the bettering of
the world And they can do this

  
in 4 different ways. This is how they…

  
The most important thing with All Heart is
the Brand recognition That’s why I mocked

  
up the examples here and
Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris

  
So we need maximum exposure
We need extreme marketing

  
Is it snowing?

  
Get off me!
Listen to me

  
I hate you
I’m sorry

  
Who ever I am, What ever I did
Look at me

  
I’m sorry

  
Why were you flying?
You were flying Mary.

  
She was definitely flying
Okay I was flying

  
And I’m very strong as well
It's just the way we are

  
We?
Me and him, it’s just us now.

  
The others paired up and died.

  
You didn’t say anything about the others
pairing up at the trailer.

  
You were at his trailer?
This is very hard to explain.

  
Great, I’m all ears Mary.
Me too

  
Do me a favor
Just give me and my wife one moment please.

  
Don’t, don’t bring it here Ray
The adults are talking for once second

  
Technically speaking,

  
He’s my husband

  
Hoooooly shit

  
What?
We broke-up decades ago

  
long before you were borne.
He just can’t remember

  
But you can, right?
You knew?

  
That’s something you might want to
bring up on a first date Mary.

  
I don’t like to travel, I’m allergic to cats,
I’m immortal, okay?

  
Those are like some of things you
might want to give a heads up on

  
What ever we are, we were built in two's, okay?

  
We’re drawn to each other no matter
how far I run He’s always there

  
he finds me. Its physics.

  
What are you saying, are you
are fated to be together?

  
I’ve lived for a very long time Ray

  
And the one thing I’ve learned...
fate doesn’t decide everything.

  
People get to choose.

  
You chose to let me think I was here alone

  
I didn’t think you would miss
what you didn’t remember

  
Great, now what?

  
I didn’t plan for this

What’s happening to me

  
(TV Reporter)
This just in.. John Hancock has just been

  
rushed to Los Angels General Hospital

  
Hancock is in serious condition with
multiple gunshot wounds

  
No story yet as to how this happened to him but
We will continue to cover this story

  
live as it unfolds.
Reporting live from …

  
(reporters yelling questions)
From what I’ve heard

  
he was trying to stop a robbery
Do you know if some special ammunition

  
was used in the gun that shot him?
No

  
Some new bullet
No No Not that I’m a aware of

  
Could this have anything to do with the
mysterious super woman who appeared?

  
I do not have that answer
(reporters yelling questions)

  
You’re becoming mortal

  
It’s us
Being close to each other

  
It’s never happened this fast before

  
You have to leave

  
The further away you get from me the
better you’re gonna feel

  
You’ll start getting your powers back
And you’ll be flying and breaking things

  
And saving people before you know it

  
It’s like I said, we were built in pairs
And when we get..

  
close to our opposites we lose power

  
why?
So we can live human lives

  
Love, connect

  
grow old, die

  
What happened to us?

  
Summer of ’04 BC,
we were becoming mortal like now

  
They came after me with swords

  
You saved me

  
1850, they set our house on fire

  
you pulled me out of the flames

  
80 years ago, what happened then?

  
We were living in Miami
And a new movie was playing in town

  
Frankenstein

  
And after we walked down Flagler street and
You took my hand and you held it so tight

  
They attacked us in an alley

  
They hit you so hard
There was so much blood

  
They wouldn’t let me ride in the
ambulance with you

  
And by the time I got to the
hospital you were awake

  
But you didn’t know me

  
So I left because every time we’re together..

  
they come after you through me

  
You’re built to save people more
than the rest of us

  
That’s who you are, you are hero

  
The insurance policy of the Gods
Keep one alive

  
you to protect this world.

Heart monitor

  
Upon us all Hancock,

Time to shut her down Hancock
It’s been a nice run

  
Oh we are all gonna surely miss you

  
But it is time for you to move on

  
(flat line)

  
And maybe to a happier place

  
You can thank me if you want to

  
Super hero

          FADE IN:
          
          Stars.
          The upbeat show tune, Put On Your Sunday Clothes, plays.
          
          "Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers..."
          
          More stars.
          Distant galaxies, constellations, nebulas...
          A single planet.
          Drab and brown.
          Moving towards it.
          Pushing through its polluted atmosphere.

          EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - CONTINUOUS
          
          A range of mountains takes form in the haze.
          Moving closer.
          The mountains are piles of TRASH.
          The entire surface is nothing but waste.
          
          "...We're gonna find adventure in the evening air..."
          
          A silhouetted city in the distance.
          What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash.
          Thousands of neatly stacked CUBES OF TRASH, stories high.
          Rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues.
          They go on for miles.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH
          
          "...Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile..."
          
          Something moving on the ground far below.
          A figure at the foot of a trash heap.
          A SMALL SERVICE ROBOT diligently cubing trash.
          Rusted, ancient.
          Cute.
          Every inch of him engineered for trash compacting.
          
          Mini-shovel hands collect junk.
          Scoop it into his open chassis.
          His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste.
          A faded label on his corroded chest plate:
          "Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E)
          
          Wall-E spits out a cube of trash.
          Stacks it with the others.
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          Something catches his eye.
          Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack.
          A hubcap.
          The sun reflects off it.
          Wall-E checks the sky.
          
          ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON
          
          The sun sets through the smoggy haze.
          
          "...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --"
          
          He places the hubcap in his compactor.
          Presses a button on his chest.
          The song stops playing.
          The end of a work day.
          
          Wall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back.
          Whistles for his pet COCKROACH.
          The insect hops on his shoulder.
          They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER.

          Wall-E travels alone.
          Traverses miles of desolate waste.
          Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather.
          
          Passes haunting structures buried within the trash.
          Buildings, highways, entire cities...
          Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO.
          "Buy N Large"
          "BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation!
          The corporation ran every aspect of life.
          There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate.
          
          CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over.
          Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!"
          The deck: "BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!"
          A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile.
          
          Wall-E's old treads are threadbare.
          Practically falling apart.
          Cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach.
          He passes the remains of other RUSTED WALL-E UNITS.
          Fancies one with NEWER TREADS than his own...

          Jury-rigged to an iPod.
          Pushes in a cassette labeled, "Hello Dolly!"
          The image is very poor quality.

          A spork.
          A Rubik's Cube (unsolved).
          A Zippo Lighter.
          
          He presses a BUTTON by the rack of shelves.
          They rotate until an empty space appears.
          His new items are lovingly added to the shelf.
          The Zippo joins a pre-existing LIGHTER COLLECTION.
          
          A new song, It Only Takes A Moment, plays on the video.
          Wall-E is drawn to it.
          Presses his "Record" button.
          
          ON TV SCREEN
          
          Two lovers sing gently to one another.
          They kiss...hold hands...
          
          Wall-E tilts his head as he watches.
          Curious.
          Holds his own hands.
          
                                                                    5.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E motors outside.
          Turns over his Igloo cooler to clean it out.
          Pauses to take in the night sky.
          STARS struggle to be seen through the polluted haze.
          Wall-E presses the "Play" button on his chest.
          The newly sampled It Only Takes A Moment (IOTAM) plays.
          
          The wind picks up.
          A WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
          He looks out into the night.
          A RAGING SANDSTORM approaches off the bay...
          
          Unfazed, Wall-E heads back in the truck.
          IOTAM still gently playing.
          
          ...The massive wave of sand roars closer...
          
          Wall-E raises the door.
          Pauses.
          WHISTLES for his cockroach to come inside.
          The door shuts just as the storm hits.
          Obliterates everything in view.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - SAME
          
          Wall-E alone in the center of his shelter.
          Unwraps a BNL SPONGECAKE (think Twinkie).
          Lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in.
          It happily dives in.
          
          Wall-E collapses himself into a storable cube.
          Backs into an empty shelf space.
          Rocks it like a cradle...
          ...and shuts down for the night.
          Outside the wind howls like the Hounds of Hell.
          
          
          INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
          
          Wall-E's CHARGE METER flashes "WARNING".
          He wakes. Unboxes.
          Groggy and lifeless.
          Stumbles outside.
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK
          
          The morning sun.
          Wall-E fully exposed in its light.
          His front panel splayed out like a tanning shield.
          A solar collector.
          
                                                                  6.
          
          
          
          His CHARGE METER chimes full.
          Solar panels fold away into hiding.
          Wall-E, now awake, collects his lunch cooler.
          Heads off to work.
          ...and accidentally runs over the cockroach.
          Horrified, Wall-E reverses.
          
          Reveals the FLATTENED INSECT under his tread.
          The cockroach simply pops back to life.
          No biggie. Ready to go.
          Relieved, Wall-E resumes their commute.
          
          
          EXT. WALL-E'S WORK SITE - THAT MORNING
          
          A SERIES OF "WALL-E AT WORK" MOMENTS:
          
          - CU of Wall-E's hands digging into garbage.
            CU of trash being scooped into his chest compactor.
            A cube lands by the cockroach.
          
          - Wall-E discovers a BRA in the garbage.
            Unsure what it's for.
            Tries placing it over his eyes, like glasses.
            Tosses it in his cooler.
          
          - Wall-E finds a set of CAR KEYS.
            Presses the remote lock.
            Somewhere in the distance a CAR ALARM CHIRPS.
          
          - Plays with a paddle ball.
            The ball keeps smacking him in the face.
            He doesn't like it.
          
          - Wall-E discovers a DIAMOND RING in a JEWEL CASE.
            Throws out the ring. Keeps the case.
            The jewel case drops into the cooler, then...
            ...A RUBBER DUCKY...
            ...A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL...
            ...An OLD BOOT...
            ...A TROPHY...
          
          - Wall-E finds a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
            Activates it.
            FOAM blasts in his face.
            It's tossed far, far away from his cooler.
          
          - Wall-E's shovel hand strikes something solid.
            Faces a REFRIGERATOR much larger than himself.
            Now what?
          
          - CU on fridge door.
            A WELDING BEAM moves down its center.
            It emits from between Wall-E's SPLIT BINOCULAR EYES.
          
                                                                        7.
          
          
           The door falls apart in two pieces. Reveals...
          
          ...a SMALL PLANT
          
          in its early stage of growth.
          Wall-E is entranced.
          Carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it.
          
          CLOSE ON IGLOO COOLER
          
          Wall-E gently places the plant inside the old boot.
          Dusts dirt off the leaves.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - DUSK
          
          Robot and faithful cockroach return home.
          Wall-E stops short of the threshold.
          Stares at the ground.
          Continues staring.
          
          A RED DOT
          
          quivers on the dirt.
          A single laser point of light.
          Wall-E moves to touch it...
          
          ...The dot races along the ground.
          
          Wall-E drops his Igloo.
          Chases after the dot.
          
          
          EXT. EMPTY BAY
          
          The dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse.
          He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice
          
          MANY LASER POINTS
          
          coming from every direction.
          All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain.
          Triangulating towards a center.
          
          Wall-E's dot suddenly stops.
          Slowly he reaches for it.
          Can't grab it. Just light.
          ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him.
          The ground shakes.
          Wall-E becomes confused.
          
          Doesn't see above him.
          The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover.
          A noise. Building.
          
                                                                  8.
          
          
          Rocket engines.
          Wall-E senses he should look to the sky.
          
          Now THREE SUNS are descending on him.
          
          Wall-E runs for it.
          An enormous COLUMN OF FIRE blocks his path.
          A second column of fire.
          A third.
          Trapped.
          
          Wall-E cubes the ground beneath him.
          Working fast.
          Noise deafening.
          Heat rising.
          Digs in just as a tide of flame carpets the ground...
          
          ...Then suddenly quiet.
          Smoke clears.
          
          CLOSE ON THE SCORCHED EARTH
          
          Wall-E's head rises out of the dirt.
          Glows red hot from the heat.
          Trembles with fright.
          Everything in shadow.
          Something very big looms over him.
          Wall-E climbs out of his hole.
          Bangs his head on metal.
          
          WIDE on a massive SPACESHIP.
          Rests ominously in the empty bay.
          
          A PORTAL on its underside opens.
          Frightened, Wall-E tries to hide.
          Nowhere to go.
          He places a SMALL ROCK on his head. Boxes up.
          
          A DEVICE lowers to the ground on a long stem.
          Scans the surface.
          
          Wall-E creeps closer for a better look.
          The device unfolds.
          Wall-E boxes up again.
          
          A CAPSULE descends from a chute in the stem.
          ROBOT ARMS emerge from the device.
          Place the capsule on the ground. Press buttons.
          The capsule falls away in sections, to reveal...
          
          ...a PROBE ROBOT.
          
          It hovers gracefully above the ground.
          White. Egg-shaped.
          
                                                              9.
          
          
          Blue-lit eyes.
          Female.
          Eve.
          
          Wall-E is transfixed.
          Inches closer.
          Watches Eve from behind the device.
          Tilts his head.
          Time stops.
          She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.
          
          Eve hovers over the ground.
          A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel.
          Fans out 180 degrees.
          Scans random objects and areas.
          
          The device rises back into the ship.
          Exposes Wall-E.
          He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock.
          Never takes his eyes off Eve.
          Watches her float away from the ship.
          ...from the ship?
          The ship!
          
          Engines roar back to life.
          Wall-E digging furiously.
          The rocket takes off.
          
          Smoke clears.
          Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground.
          Looks for Eve.
          She is watching the ship rise into the clouds.
          Waits until it is completely out of sight...
          
          ...then Eve rises high up into the air.
          
          She flies around the bay.
          Soars like a graceful bird.
          Does loops in the sky.
          Zooms right past Wall-E's rock.
          He is hypnotized.
          
          Eve descends gently to the ground...
          Wall-E sneaks up closer.
          Hides behind another boulder.
          Slips.
          Makes a NOISE.
          Instantly, Eve whips around.
          Her arm converts into a LASER CANNON.
          Blasts Wall-E's boulder to smithereens.
          
          ...Smoke clears...All quiet.
          
          Eve, now cold and dangerous.
          
                                                                   10.
          
          
          Scans the area.
          No sign of life.
          All business again.
          Hovers away to probe more of the planet.
          
          ON OTHER SIDE OF BOULDER CRATER
          
          Wall-E boxed up behind what little remains of the rock.
          Trembles uncontrollably.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH - DAY
          
          Eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash.
          Scans random areas.
          Wall-E spies from the shadows.
          Too frightened to approach.
          She moves on. He follows.
          
          
          EXT. TIRE DUMP - DAY
          
          Eve probes a mound of tires.
          Wall-E hiding nearby.
          He flinches at the sight of
          
          HIS COCKROACH
          
          innocently approaching Eve from behind.
          She spins around.
          Blasts the insect.
          Wall-E is gut-punched.
          
          The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater.
          Unscathed. Still curious.
          
          Eve finds the insect intriguing.
          Lowers her arm.
          The end separates into individual hovering sections...
          
          ...A HAND.
          
          She lets the insect crawl up her arm.
          Wiggles into her workings.
          It tickles.
          
                                       EVE
                          [Giggles]
          
          Wall-E relaxes.
          CHUCKLES privately.
          
          Eve sonically picks up Wall-E's location.
          Locks onto him.
          
                                                                   11.
          
          
          Arm converts to laser cannon.
          Fires rapidly.
          Quick glimpses of Wall-E dodging the blasts.
          Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him.
          
          Wall-E now exposed.
          Nowhere to hide.
          Boxes himself up. Shakes uncontrollably.
          Eve holds her fire.
          
                                     EVE
                               (electronic hums)
                        [Identify yourself.]
          
          She slowly approaches Wall-E's box.
          Keeps her gun trained on him.
          
                                     EVE
                               (electronic hums)
                        [Repeat. Identify yourself.]
          
          Wall-E peeks out from his box.
          Doesn't understand a thing she says.
          Doesn't care.
          Can't believe she's real.
          The cockroach climbs down her gun arm.
          Jumps onto his master.
          
          Eve scans Wall-E.
          A RED LIGHT appears on her chest.
          Buzzes "negative".
          He's not what she's looking for.
          She retracts her gun arm.
          Hovers off.
          Wall-E watches her go. Lovestruck.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        [Sigh.]
          
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. ABANDONED BNL SUPERSTORE - NEXT DAY
          
          LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S "LA VIE EN ROSE" PLAYS
          
          Eve scans through the market.
          Wall-E follows from a safe distance.
          A stray puppy-dog.
          
          Eve glances over at him.
          Wall-E panics.
          Bumps into a RACK OF SHOPPING CARTS.
          Creates an avalanche.
          
                                                                      12.
          
          
          They chase him down a flight of stairs.
          Wall-E reaches the exit doors.
          Won't open!
          Carts pig pile on top of him.
          
          
          EXT. BNL REFINERY - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E perched on the roof.
          Patiently watches Eve fly.
          She scans the ground below her, like a searchlight.
          
          Eve comes in for a landing below.
          Shuts down for the night.
          Wall-E waits.
          Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape.
          Accidentally trips. Tumbles to the ground.
          Eve doesn't wake.
          Wall-E creeps up to her.
          Opens his arms wide...
          ...and measures her.
          Turns to a pile of trash.
          Splits open his eyes. Begins welding something...
          
                                                              DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. BNL REFINERY - NEXT MORNING
          
          Eve powers up again.
          Does a double take.
          A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her.
          She hovers away, unimpressed.
          Doesn't notice Wall-E hiding behind a PILE OF PIPES.
          Wall-E kicks the pipes in frustration.
          They roll on top of him.

          EXT. DERELICT SHIPYARD - DUSK
          
          Eve hovers over the freighter.
          Frustrated.
          Not finding what she's looking for.
          Wall-E eavesdrops from afar.
          
          Eve flies past the ship's CRANE MAGNET.
          Gets stuck.
          Wrestles to free herself.
          Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP.
          The reaction startles Wall-E.
          
          Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor.
          She gives up.
          Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches.
          Sits at the other end of the anchor.
          Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck.
          Then...
          ...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her.
          Musters the courage to speak, when --
          She suddenly turns to him:
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [So what's your story?]
          
          Wall-E falls backwards with surprise.
          Me?
          Eve scrolls through a variety of languages:

          Wall-E eagerly turns to some nearby trash.
          Scoops it into his compactor.
          Proudly spits out a cube.
          Points to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E

          Wall-E nods.

                        [Oh. Sorry.]
          
          She scans his CHEST LOGO.

          Wall-E nearly melts.
          She says his name so beautifully.
          Moves closer.
          
                                       EVE
                        Wall-E.

                        Eve.
          
          Wall-E tries to repeat it:
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eeee...?

          She giggles again.
          Wall-E likes making her giggle.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Eee-vah! Ee --

                        Eve.
          
          The wind kicks up.
          The WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
          He moves to grab her.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        (Gasp!) Eee-vah!

                        [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!]
          
          She draws her gun on him.
          Doesn't understand the danger.
          The sandstorm rushes up behind her.
          Too late.
          Wall-E collapses into a box.
          The storm hits full force.
          Eve is instantly lost, disoriented.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E? Wall-E?
          
          WALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust.
          Calmly takes Eve's hand.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The back door lowers.
          A rush of wind and sand.
          Wall-E pulls Eve inside. Closes the door.
          She coughs up dust.
          
          Wall-E hits a switch...
          Strings of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS fill the space.
          His racks of oddities painted in colored light.
          
                                                                   16.
          
          
          An air of enchantment.
          Eve is taken aback.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Come on in.]
          
          She drifts through the sea of knickknacks.
          Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH.
          Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down.
          He is compelled to show her everything.
          Hands her an eggbeater...
          ...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)...
          ...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)...
          ...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)...
          ...his Hello Dolly tape.
          Curious, she begins unspooling the tape.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (loud beeps)
                        [My tape!!]
          
          He grabs it back. Protective.
          Inserts it carefully into the VCR. Please still work.
          The movie eventually appears on the TV.
          Plays a clip of POYSC.
          Wall-E is relieved.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [What do you think?]
          
          Mimics the dancing for Eve.
          Encourages her to try.
          She clumsily hops up and down.
          Makes dents in the floor. Rattles everything.
          Wall-E politely stops her.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [How `bout we try a different move?]
          
          Spins in a circle. Arms out.
          Eve copies.
          Spins faster, and faster...
          Too fast.
          Accidentally strikes Wall-E. He flies into the shelves.
          
          Eve helps him up from the mess.
          Wall-E's LEFT BINOCULAR EYE falls off.
          Dangles from two wires.
          Eve GASPS with concern.
          Wall-E placates her.
          
                                                                      17.

                        [It's fine.]
          
          Feels his way to the rack of shelves.
          Rotates them until...
          ...SPARE WALL-E PARTS appear.
          Replaces his broken eye with a new one.
          Eve is relieved.
          
          She eyes his LIGHTER COLLECTION.
          Flicks open a Zippo. Ignites a FLAME.
          Wall-E freezes.
          He had no idea it could do that.
          Moves closer to inspect it...
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          It's the closest he's ever been to Eve.
          She remains focused on the lighter.
          Wall-E stares up at her.
          ...The tiny flame flickering between them...
          ...The Hello Dolly video plays IOTAM in the background...
          Suddenly, he is moved to express his love.
          Musters the courage to open his fingers...
          ...Timidly reaches his hand out to hers...
          
          -- Eve turns and looks at him.
          
          Wall-E instantly chokes.
          Pulls his hand back.
          Eve becomes intrigued with the TV.
          Scans the image of the lovers singing IOTAM...
          Wall-E watches her.
          His infatuation still palpable.
          Then he remembers...
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          He rushes to his shelves.
          Eve watches him rummage through junk.
          A drum falls down on his head.
          She giggles, charmed by it all.
          Something about Wall-E...
          
          She is drawn back to the lovers on TV...
          ...then the lit Zippo lighter in her hand.
          A tap on her shoulder.
          She turns to find Wall-E holding something.
          
          The plant.
          
          Eve immediately locks onto it.
          
                                                                    18.
          
          
          Drops the lighter.
          In a flash...
          ...her chest opens...
          ...a TRACTOR BEAM snatches the plant away...
          ...stores it inside her...
          Then she shuts down completely.
          Only a SINGLE GREEN LIGHT pulsing on her chest.
          
          Wall-E is stunned.
          What'd I do?
          Waves his hand in front of her face.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          Knocks on her chest plate.
          No response.
          Wall-E panics.
          Gently shakes her.

          Aims her hovering form to face the sun.
          Waits.
          
          MONTAGE OF WALL-E TRYING TO REVIVE EVE:
          
          - Several hot days pass with Wall-E holding vigil in the heat.
          
          - A THUNDERSTORM approaches on the horizon.
            Wall-E holds an UMBRELLA over Eve.
            Gets struck by lightning.
            Holds up another umbrella.
            Gets struck again.
          
          - A SANDSTORM blows through.
            Wall-E pops out of a dune on the truck's roof.
            Lifts up an UPSIDE-DOWN BARREL that protected Eve.
          
                                                               19.
          
          
          
          - Wall-E pries open a panel on Eve's chest.
            Reveals her pulsing BLUE HEART-BATTERY.
            Attaches JUMPER CABLES to his own HEART-BATTERY.
            Tries to connect the other end to hers.
            An automatic defense system blows him off truck.
          
          - Wall-E & cockroach take Eve for a walk.
            Pull her along on a LEASH OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.
          
          - Wall-E gives Eve a boat ride on a LAKE OF SLUDGE.
            Uses an industrial tire as a boat.
            Rows like a gondolier with a road sign.
          
          - Wall-E sits by the empty bay with Eve.
            Watches the SUNSET.
            Burns "WALL-E + EVE" on a public trash can.
            Tries to pull out her hand to hold it.
            It snaps back into place, trapping his hand.
          
          END OF MONTAGE
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E has set up the TV on the roof.
          The blank Eve floating next to him.
          Tries unsuccessfully to play PONG with her.
          Still no response.
          Finally, he gives up.
          
                                        WALL-E
                           [defeated sigh]
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
          
          Wall-E loads up his cooler.
          Checks on Eve one more time.
          Still nothing...
          Heads off to work, defeated.
          
          
          EXT. WORK SITE - LATER
          
          Wall-E simply going through the motions.
          No spirit in him at all.
          Stops.
          Pulls out the Zippo lighter.
          Flicks it a few times.
          A RUSH OF WIND blows out the flame.
          Distant rumbling.
          Wall-E looks in the direction of his home.
          A BRIGHT GLOW is lowering down through the clouds.
          
                                                             20.

          EXT. TRASH ALLEY - DAY
          
          Wall-E racing as fast as he can.
          The cockroach clings onto him for dear life.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - DAY
          
          The RECON SPACESHIP towers over his truck.
          A ROBOT ARM cherry-picks Eve from the roof.
          Lifts her up and into the ship's cargo hold.
          Wall-E racing in the distance.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        EE-VAH!! EE-VAH!!
          
          Reaches the end of the collapsed bridge ramp.
          Forced to watch Eve disappear into the ship.
          The cargo doors slam shut.
          
          The first of the THREE ROCKET ENGINES powers up.
          Wall-E heads down a hill of rubble to the ship.
          Notices his cockroach tagging along behind him.
          Leads it back to the top of the hill.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Stay.]
          
          The insect mopes.
          Droops its little antennae.
          Wall-E motors back down to the rocket...
          
          BASE OF RECON SHIP
          
          The engines blast a WALL OF SMOKE.
          Preparation for launch...
          
          
          INT. RECON SHIP
          
          Eve is secured into a slot.
          Joins a ROW OF OTHER EVE PROBES.
          All dormant.
          Only Eve flashes a GREEN LIGHT.
          The CAMERA DRIFTS BACK out a window...
          
          OUTSIDE THE SHIP
          
                                                                    21.
          
          
          
          ...where Wall-E steadily climbs up the side.
          The ship's engines ignite.
          Wall-E clamps his hands tight to a metal support.
          The rocket takes off into space.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF HILL
          
          The cockroach watches his master go.
          
          
          EXT. RECON SHIP
          
          The spaceship roars through the sky.
          Wall-E tightens his grip, battling the G's.
          He looks ahead. SCREAMS.
          
          HUNDREDS OF BNL SATELLITES
          
          litter the outer atmosphere.
          The ship bursts through the layer.
          
          
          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The recon ship breaks free of the planet.
          Its boosters shut down.
          Wall-E takes in the sudden QUIETNESS OF SPACE.
          Looks back at his planet.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Oooh...
          
          Weightlessness takes effect.
          Wall-E almost floats away.
          Grabs hold of the ship.
          Knocks on a WINDOW near Eve.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        E-vah!
          
          No response. She remains shut down.
          Wall-E points out at the stars.
          It is the most spectacular light show possible.
          And Wall-E has a front row seat.
          
          MONTAGE OF CELESTIAL SPECTACLES
          
          - The ship flies past the MOON.
            A BILLBOARD stands next to the abandoned APOLLO MOON ROVER.
            "BNL Outlet Coming Soon."
          
          - The ship passes by the SUN.
            Wall-E pops open his solar panels.
          
                                                                     22.
          
          
           Instantly recharges.
          
          - The ship cruises alongside SATURN'S OUTER RINGS.
            Wall-E runs his hand through the tiny particles of ice.
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. RECON SHIP - DAYS LATER
          
          A DUMBBELL NEBULA slowly twists in space.
          Wall-E is mesmerized by it.
          Leads his eye to a LIGHT, growing in the distance ahead.
          A planet?
          No. A starliner.
          Gigantic in size.
          
          The "AXIOM".
          
          The now tiny recon ship heads straight for it.
          
          
          INT. DOCKING BAY
          
          TWO TUG-ROCKETS guide the ship in.
          It locks into GIANT BRACES fixed on the deck.
          The impact knocks Wall-E off.
          He lands in the scaffolding of the front brace.
          
          Suddenly the entire dock comes to life.
          Robotic arms and service robots of all types appear.
          ...Rise from the floor...
          ..Lower from the ceiling...
          It's a cacophony of automation.
          They all attend to the ship.
          
          EVE
          
          and four other probes slide out of the ship's side.
          Suspended in a horizontal rack.
          Wall-E is surprised to find her facing him.
          She remains shut down.
          Just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them.
          
                                       WALL-E
                         Ee-vah... ?
          
          A SQUAD OF CLEANER ROBOTS emerge onto the dock.
          A small roller BRUSH-BOT (M-O) leads.
          
                                      M-O
                                (beeps)
                         [Hold up.]
          
                                                                   23.
          
          
          Waits for the FLOOR LINES to appear.
          Depict their exact path of action.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Okay. Go.]
          
          They file out on the line.
          
          A crane-bot lowers Eve from the rack.
          M-O and his cleaning crew stand ready.
          M-O scans Eve.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Scan reads: "%16 Foreign Contaminant."
          
          M-O is disgusted.
          Revs his brush roller. Moves in for the clean.
          A VACU-BOT follows after him.
          Then a SPRAY-BOT and BUFFER-BOT finish off.
          
          The cleaning crew waits for probe #2.
          Wall-E studies the routine.
          Figures out a way to climb down to Eve.
          When the crane returns, Wall-E poses as probe #3.
          The crane grabs him instead.
          
          M-O turns around to clean the next probe.
          Wall-E is lowered in front of him.
          Boxes up.
          Confused, M-O scans him.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Scan reads: "%100 Foreign Contaminant."
          M-O is horrified by such filth.
          A RED SIREN LIGHT rises from his head.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Oh, no, no, no. This is all wrong.]
          
          He scrubs Wall-E full force.
          Wall-E's front panel pushes him away.
          Confused, M-O moves to clean him again.
          Wall-E backs away.
          Leaves a DIRT TRAIL.
          M-O curses:
          
                                     M-O
                        [You made the floor all dirty! Stop it!]
          
                                                                    24.
          
          
          M-O furiously scrubs the floor.
          Wall-E peeks out, amused by this neurotic little guy.
          
          ON FAR WALL
          
          Two STEWARD ROBOTS come out of the wall.
          Act like hovering caution signs.
          A small robot (GOPHER) shoots out a PNEUMATIC TUBE.
          He bears epaulet like shoulders and a siren for a face.
          Gopher beeps an ELECTRONIC ORDER for the Stewards to follow.
          
          BACK ON M-O AND WALL-E
          
          M-O just finishes cleaning the floor.
          Wall-E is fascinated.
          Impishly makes another mark.
          M-O compulsively cleans it. Can't resist.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Look, it stays clean. You got that?]
          
          Wall-E wipes the bottom of his tread on M-O's face.
          M-O loses it.
          Scrubs his own face.
          
          Gopher and his steward escort arrive.
          The cleaning crew stand at attention.
          Wall-E boxes back up with the probes.
          
          Gopher begins scanning each probe.
          Moves down the line.
          Scans Wall-E...moves on to the next probe...
          Stops -- Wait a minute.
          Turns back.
          Wall-E is gone.
          Gopher shrugs it off. Proceeds...
          Reaches Eve.
          Doesn't notice Wall-E hidden behind her.
          Gopher scans her BLINKING PLANT LIGHT --
          
          The entire dock goes to "Code Green"!
          
          Alarms sound.
          Green lights flash.
          All automation stops.
          
          In rapid succession...
          ...A HOVER-TRANSPORT glides up to Gopher...
          ...A crane-bot loads Eve...
          ...Curved energy bands lock her down...
          ...Gopher assumes the driver's seat...
          
          It's all moving too fast for Wall-E.
          Suddenly Eve's transport heads for the ELEVATOR.
          
                                                                    25.
          
          
          
                                      WALL-E
                          Ee-vah!
          
          Wall-E chases after them.
          Grabs onto the back of the transport.
          They disappear into the elevator.
          
          The cleaning crew files out.
          Follow their lines back to their hold.
          M-O stops short.
          Notices Wall-E's FILTHY TRACKS crossing his path.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY
          
          Reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT"
          
          The tracks lead to the elevator.
          M-O's neurosis takes over.
          Must clean dirt.
          He makes a radical decision and...
          ...jumps off his line.
          Starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail.
          
          
          INT. ELEVATOR
          
          Gopher waits patiently as the floors pass.
          Wall-E hidden behind the transport.
          Peeks at Eve.
          Pets her blank faceplate.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (quiet beeps)
                          [It'll be okay, Eve.]
          
          The ELEVATOR DOORS suddenly open.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
          
          DOZENS OF ROBOTS speed along a multi-lane passageway.
          All following glowing lines on the floor.
          Wall-E's head whipsaws back and forth.
          Tries to process it all.
          Doesn't notice Gopher's transport merge into traffic...
          ...without him!
          
          Wall-E shrinks from the high-speed traffic.
          Timidly attempts to merge.
          Sticks out one tread...
          -- Instantly causes a ROBOT PILE-UP.
          Wall-E boxes up. Guns it.
          Weaves across all the lines on the floor.
          Bounces off robots like bumper cars.
          
                                                                     26.
          
          
          Barely able to navigate the chaos.
          Takes refuge in the middle of an INTERSECTION.
          Scans for Eve...
          
          ON WALL-E'S POV DISPLAY
          
          ...a PAINT-BOT paints a wall sign...
          ...A GARBAGE-BOT dumps trash into a wall chute...
          ...Down the hall, Eve's transport glides up a ramp...
          
                                     WALL-E
                        EE-VAH!
          
          Wall-E chases after them.
          
          
          INT. UPPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Wall-E flies up the ramp.
          Nearly collides with a merging HOVER CHAIR.
          It blocks his way.
          Wall-E gains alongside it, and discovers
          
          A HUMAN PASSENGER
          
          sitting, reclined, in the chair.
          He is large, round and soft - like a big baby.
          Wears a red, BNL jumpsuit.
          The chair seems to be steering itself.
          Guided by floor lines, just like the robots.
          Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision.
          A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN floats inches in front of his face.
          He converses with a SECOND PASSENGER on screen:
          
                                     PASSENGER #1
                        Well, I've been in my cabin all morning
                        so let's hover over to the driving range
                        and hit a few virtual balls into space.
          
                                     PASSENGER #2 (ON SCREEN)
                        Nah, we did that yesterday. I don't want
                        to do that.
          
                                     PASSENGER #1
                        Well then what do you want to do?
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He looks over his shoulder.
          Passenger #2 is floating right next to them.
          Isolated in his own hover chair.
          Also in a red jumpsuit. Also a big baby.
          
                                                                       27.
          
          
          
                                     PASSENGER #2
                        I don't know. Something.
          
          Both humans are totally unaware of the other's presence.
          They all exit the hallway. Merge into the...
          
          ECONOMY CLASS COURTYARD
          
          Wall-E is in awe.
          Hundreds of floors of GUEST ROOMS rise on all sides.
          THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS fill the giant space.
          All reclined and riding on hover chairs.
          MULTIPLE FLOOR LINES guide their chairs in all directions.
          
          Humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes.
          Absolutely no reason to ever get up.
          No purpose.
          Every one of them engrossed in their video screens.
          Cocooned in virtual worlds.
          Over-developed fingers tap ARMREST KEYPADS.
          The controls allow them to steer...
          ...order food...
          ...play games...
          ...and most of all...
          
          ...CHAT MINDLESSLY with other passengers:
          
          The CHATTER is deafening.
          No one notices Wall-E at all.
          He drives into the endless human traffic.
          
                                     MISC. FEMALE PASSENGER
                        Bot, over here!
          
          A DRINK-BOT floats over to a passenger.
          Puts a fresh drink in her open hand.
          Wall-E flows with the traffic into a LARGE TUNNEL.
          
                                     MISC. PASSENGERS
                        I can't hear you...I'm in a tunnel.
                        You're breaking up...Oh, okay. You're
                        back. I can hear you now...
          
          They spill out into the BRIGHT LIGHT of the
          
          MAIN CONCOURSE (COACH CLASS)
          
          A city-sized, mall-like environment.
          All under a GIANT DOME.
          The ceiling simulates the sun and sky.
          A BNL LOGO (w/ time & temp) appears on the FACE OF THE SUN.
          
                                                                    28.

                        Buy N Large. Everything you need to be
                        happy. Your day is very important to us.
          
          Wall-E is gobsmacked.
          A PASSENGER (JOHN) hovers up alongside him.
          Tries to hand off his empty drink cup to Wall-E.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey, Drink-bot.
          
          Wall-E shies away.
          John reaches farther out with the cup.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Here, take the cup. Take the cup -- Whoa!
          
          Reaches too far.
          John falls to the floor.
          Flails like an upside down turtle.
          Unable to stand on his baby legs.
          
          Instantly, SIRENS.
          Wall-E watches TWO STEWARDS arrive.
          Block John's accident.
          EMERGENCY LINES appear on the floor.
          Redirect the hover chair traffic.
          John reaches out for assistance.
          Nobody notices. Just drive past.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Stewards? Hello? Uhh, help.
          
                                     STEWARD
                        Please remain stationary. A service-bot
                        will be here to assist you momentarily.
          
          Suddenly John begins to rise.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Uhh...Hey! What's going on?
          
          Wall-E lifting him up from behind.
          Loads him back onto his chair.
          John doesn't know how to react.
          Wall-E waves hello.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Wall-E!
          
                                       JOHN
                        Uhh... John.
          
                                                                       29.
          
          
          
                                          WALL-E
                           Ee-vah?
          
                                          JOHN
                           Uh no, John.
          
          Wall-E scans the concourse.
          Spots Eve's transport about to board a MONORAIL.
          He races after them.
          Abandons the stunned John.
          
                                          WALL-E
                           Ee-vah!
          
                                        JOHN
                                  (small wave)
                           Bye...Wall-E.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          It pulls out of the station.
          Wall-E leaps on.
          Barely catches the last car.
          It glides down the concourse.
          
          
          INT. "ALL DAY" CARE CENTER
          
          A NANNY-BOT supervises a group of TODDLERS.
          All wearing matching BNL ONESIES.
          Motionless in their HOVER RINGS.
          They stare at educational programming on their holo-screens.
          
                                        NANNY-BOT

          Wall-E's monorail glides past.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          Wall-E takes in the overstimulating scenery.
          Dozens of THEMED FOOD RESTAURANTS whizz by.
          Each specialty is served in the same JUMBO PLASTIC CUP.
          
                                        SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                           Mmmmm! Time for lunch in a cup.
          
          Wall-E now notices his fellow passengers.
          They all slurp from similar cups.
          
                                                                    30.
          
          
          Next, the monorail passes a BEAUTY SALON.
          BEAUTICIAN-BOTS primp and style passengers.

                        look great...I know honey...Ahh. Men...
          
          They pass through the FASHION DISTRICT.
          ENORMOUS BILLBOARDS hawk the latest color schemes.

                        Oooohh...
          
          Passengers next to Wall-E press their chair buttons.
          Their JUMPSUITS change from RED TO BLUE.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Whoa.
          
          Their monorail speeds into a glass tunnel.
          
          INSIDE THE TUNNEL
          
          Wall-E looks past a PASSENGER (MARY) next to him.
          Spots Eve on the other side.
          Wall-E tries to sneak behind Mary.
          But her chair moves backwards.
          Smashes Wall-E against the back wall.
          No way getting past her.
          Wall-E politely tries to get Mary's attention.
          She's oblivious.
          Chats incessantly on her holo-screen:
          
                                     MARY
                        Date?! (derisive snort) Don't get me
                        started! Every holo-date I've been on has
                        been a virtual disaster! If I could just
                        meet one who wasn't so superficial. There
                        are no good men out there!...
          
          Wall-E tries to fold back her speaker headrest.
          Accidentally breaks it off.
          
                                     MARY (CONT'D)
                        ...I know! I know `cause I've scrolled
                        through them all -- (Gasp) What the --?
          
                                                                    31.
          
          
          
          Mary's chair shorts out.
          ...holo-screen shuts off...
          ...jumpsuit defaults back to red...
          For the first time Mary has an unobstructed view.
          Her eyes slowly dilate.
          It's as if she's seeing the world for the first time...
          
                                     MARY
                               (mesmerized)
                        Huh... ?
          
          Her gaze falls on Wall-E.
          He waves politely.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Wall-E.

                        Ee-vah.
          
          He points to Eve on the other side of Mary.
          Gestures he'd like to get by.
          She is slow to understand.
          
                                     MARY
                        Huh? Oh, uh, sure go ahead.
          
          Mary moves her hover chair back.
          Wall-E rolls over to Eve.
          Pats her protectively.

          A vast, circular plaza of pools.
          Surrounded by a ring of high rise apartments.
          Hundreds of passengers lounge poolside.

          The base of the Axiom's Bridge Tower.
          The passengers exit.
          Follow their respective lines.
          Gopher drives Eve (and Wall-E) towards the tower.
          Pass over a GIANT BNL LOGO on the plaza floor.
          
          ON MARY
          
          She is the last to exit the car.
          Doesn't follow any lines.
          Excited by her newfound awareness.
          Looks out on the Lido Deck as the monorail pulls away.

          A lone TYPING-BOT is stationed at the far end.
          A bridge elevator behind him.
          Blocked by a force field gate.
          
          The transport pulls up to the typing-bot.
          Gopher BEEPS.
          The typing-bot responds by typing.
          Slowly. One...button...at...a...time...
          
          Finally, the gate lowers. Elevator doors open.
          The typing-bot watches the transport enter the elevator.
          Notices Wall-E hiding at the back.
          Wall-E gives it a FRIENDLY WAVE as the doors close.
          The elevator shoots up to the bridge.
          
          The typing-bot looks at its hand.
          Mimics Wall-E's waving gesture.
          Huh. Never done that before.
          Tries it some more...
          
          INSIDE THE ELEVATOR
          
          Wall-E looks out on the descending Lido Deck.
          Marvels at it all.
          His view suddenly goes dark.
          The elevator doors open on...
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The large circular room is dimly lit.
          Windows to SPACE on one side, a LIDO DECK view on the other.
          A massive console wraps around its entirety.
          Covered in buttons. A sea of thinking lights.
          
                                                                     33.
          
          
          A CAPTAIN'S WHEEL automatically steers.
          
          Gopher drives into the middle of the room. Beeps.
          Suddenly the wheel disengages.
          The autopilot (AUTO).
          A single camera eye lights up its center.
          A periscope stem connects Auto to the ceiling.
          Slides along rails up to Gopher, who salutes.
          Auto eyes Eve. Scans her.
          Wall-E sneaks back into the shadows.
          
          Auto detects Eve's plant light.
          Goes still...
          Begins computing rapidly.
          The number "A113" flashes on his lens.
          An ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE begins between Auto and Gopher.
          
          Wall-E watches the interchange. Nervous.
          Without warning, Auto heads in his direction.
          Wall-E boxes up.
          A CIRCULAR SECTION OF FLOOR lights directly below him.
          Irises open, like a trapdoor.
          
          Wall-E drops...
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          ...and hits the floor hard in the room below.
          Someone stirs, then resumes SNORING.
          
          Auto lowers through the portal.
          A CLOCK ALARM BUZZER activates.
          
                                        AUTOPILOT
                           Captain. You are needed on the bridge.
          
          Shoots back up. The portal closes.
          Wall-E peeks out of his box.
          
          ON WALL-E'S POV
          
          PAN across the nautical-themed cabin.
          One wall lined with PORTRAITS OF FORMER CAPTAINS.
          Their years of service listed below.
          The autopilot in the background of each picture.
          Each generation of Captain more devolved than the other.
          From human to gelatinous blob.
          We stop on the FINAL PORTRAIT.
          A blobby Captain.
          It looms above the actual CAPTAIN, snoring in bed.
          
          He reaches out in his sleep to quiet the snooze alarm.
          Smacks Wall-E's box by mistake.
          
                                                                    34.
          
          
          Activates the POYSC SAMPLE.
          It plays loud.
          The Captain sits straight up, half-awake:
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          -- All hands on deck!!
          
          Wall-E is frantic to turn off the music as...
          ...PREP ROBOTS burst from the cabinetry...
          ...a BEAUTICIAN-BOT, MASSAGE-BOT and WARDROBE-BOT...
          ...The Captain's bed automatically raises...
          ...Forms into a hover chair...
          The robots rapidly massage, brush, primp and dress him.
          
                                       BEAUTICIAN-BOT
                                 (pre-recorded)
                          Morning! Just a trim?
          
          Wall-E blends in with the primping.
          Uselessly wiggles the Captain's toes.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          (Giggles)
          
          Lines light on the floor.
          Lead his chair automatically to the elevator.
          Wall-E sneaks aboard just as the doors close.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Elevator doors swish open.
          The Captain still half-asleep.
          Claps his hands twice.
          
          On cue, a COFFEE MAKER rises from the console.
          Pours a cup.
          CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS on overhead speakers.
          The Captain's chair links with a LIT FLOOR PATH.
          Leads him over to the coffee.
          Wall-E stays lockstep behind him.
          Auto glides over to the Captain.
          
                                      AUTOPILOT
                          Sir --
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          Coffee.
          
          Wall-E hides under the console just in time.
          
          The Captain reaches for his coffee.
          Makes a minimal effort.
          Easier to adjust his chairback slowly forward...
          ...almost there...and...he grabs the coffee.
          
                                                                        35.
          
          
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, the annual --
          
          The Captain gives Auto the hand.
          Sips his coffee.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Protocol, Auto. First things first.
                               (to the room)
                        Computer, status report.
          
          His chair automatically arcs along the console.
          SPECIFIC PANELS light up as he passes.
          
                      CAPTAIN                       SHIP'S COMPUTER

          ON WALL-E
          
          He eyes Eve on the transport across the room.
          Has to get to her.
          But Auto is right above him. Can't move.
          
                                      AUTOPILOT
                        Captain...
          
          Auto calls up a screen on the console.
          Displays the recon-ship and a flashing positive probe.
          Waits patiently for the Captain to notice.
          Finally, the Captain turns...
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                        Okay, Auto.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, the annual reconnaissance has --
          
          ...but then notices the time.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        12:30?!
                               (disappointed sigh)
                        Auto, why didn't you wake me for the
                        morning announcements?
          
          He slingshots his chair to the Lido Deck side of the bridge.
          Wall-E nearly collides with him.
          
                                                                       36.
          
          
          Ducks back under the console.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do
                        on this ship.
          
          Grabs a large dial.
          TIME OF DAY ICONS surround it.
          Cranks it from mid-day back to sunrise.
          
          OUT ON LIDO DECK
          
          - The FAKE NOON SUN reverses at high speed to a SUNRISE.
          - Passengers' LUNCH CUPS switch to BREAKFAST CUPS.
          - Poolside passengers' umbrella-bots close up.
          
          An ANNOUNCEMENT WHISTLE BLOWS over the intercom.
          A SECTION OF SKY DOME becomes a JUMBOTRON SCREEN.
          Displays a live video feed of the Captain.
          The image also shows up on every passenger's CHAIR SCREEN.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (ON INTERCOM)
                               (unmotivated)
                        Well, good morning everybody, and welcome
                        to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. As
                        always, weather's a balmy 72 degrees and
                        sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship's
                        log is showing that today is our 700th
                        anniversary of our five year cruise.
                        Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be
                        proud to know that 700 years later we'd
                        be...
                               (deflates)
                        ...doing the exact same thing...they were
                        doing...
          
          Cut to VARIOUS ASPECTS OF AXIOM LIVING.
          The listening passengers look just as bored as the Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (INTERCOM)
                               (snaps out of ennui)
                        SO! Be sure next mealtime to ask for your
                        free...
                               (hard to pronounce)
                        ...septuacentennial cupcake -- in a cup.
                        Also today we have, uh...uh...Hey, Auto,
                        what's that flashing button?
                               (mic feedback whine)
          
          BACK ON THE BRIDGE
          
          The Captain stares at a FLASHING BUTTON on the console.
          It bears the same PLANT ICON as Eve's display.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
          
                                    AUTOPILOT (O.S.)
                        Captain?
          
          The Captain turns to Auto.
          For the first time he notices Eve. Finally.
          Auto hovers over her. Salutes.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Probe One has returned positive.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                        Positive?
          
          Auto re-activates Eve.
          She wakes.
          Rises to salute the Captain.
          
          Across the room, Wall-E watches with sheer joy.
          She's okay!
          He is compelled to head straight for her...
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        But...no probe's ever come back
                        positive...
                               (looks at flashing button)
                        ...before.
          
          The flashing button is practically calling to him.
          Can't resist. Presses it.
          Instantly SHADES close on all the windows.
          The room goes dark.
          
          ...Wall-E is forced to hide under the console again...
          
          A LARGE HOLO-SCREEN appears right above him.
          Pre-recorded footage of the BNL CEO plays:
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Greetings and congratulations, Captain!
                        If you're seeing this, that means your
                        Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator,
                        or...
                               (air quotes)
                        ..."EVE" probe, has returned from Earth
                        with a confirmed specimen of ongoing
                        photosynthesis!
          
          The Captain stares slack-jawed at the screen.
          Wall-E sneaks under the console towards Eve...
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        That's right, it means it's time to go
                        back home!
          
                                                                     38.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (nervous)
                        Home? W-w-we're going back?
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Now that Earth has been restored to a
                        life-sustaining status, by golly, we can
                        begin "Operation Recolonize"!
          
          A section of the console illuminates.
          An ancient, dusty MANUAL slides out...
          
          ...into a passing Wall-E's hands.
          
          Wall-E immediately boxes up.
          Holds the manual over his head.
          The Captain mistakes Wall-E for a book podium.
          Grabs the manual. Blows dust off the cover.
          It reads: "OPERATION RECOLONIZE".
          Below the title, the same PLANT ICON from Eve's display.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Simply follow this manual's instructions
                        to place the plant in your ship's holo-
                        detector, and the --
                               (bad edit)

          ON VIDEO SCREEN (DURING SPEECH)
          
          An animated diagram depicts a stage below the ship's bridge.
          The symbol of a HOLO-DETECTOR rises up.
          A STICK FIGURE places a plant inside the machine.
          A STARLINER ICON flies back towards Earth.
          
          The Captain listens closely to the instructions.
          Wall-E paying attention as well.
          
                     CAPTAIN                          WALL-E
          Huh?                               Huh?
          
          Wall-E notices he has a clear shot to Eve.
          Heads in her direction.

                        Now, due to the effects of micro-gravity,
                        you and your passengers may have suffered
                        some slight bone loss. But I'm sure a few
                        laps around your ship's jogging track
                        will get you back in shape in no time.
          
          The Captain looks at his VESTIGIAL LEGS.
          
                                                                   39.

                        consult your operation manual. See you

          The transmission ends.
          The Captain examines the manual.
          Holds it out in front of him.
          
                                     CAPTAIN

          Auto intervenes.
          Clips the corner of the cover with his handle...
          ...and simply opens the book.
          The Captain is both fascinated and intimidated.
          Lifts the cover with his own fingers.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Wow... Will you look at that?
          
          ON EVE
          
          Wall-E taps her shoulder.
          Not now Wall-E -- Double take!
          
                                    EVE
                        Wall-E?!
          
                                     WALL-E

          Eve is in a state of disbelief.
          Shoves Wall-E into the shadows under the console.
          
                                     EVE
                               (hushed; angry)
                        [Wall-E, what are you doing here?! You

          Makes a flurry of clandestine gestures at him.
          Wall-E just stares at her.
          Smitten.
          
                                                                      40.

          He manages to turn to the FIRST PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS.

          The bridge suddenly jumps to life.
          Green lights flash.
          A LARGE DEVICE appears from the ceiling...
          ...Scans the entire room...
          ...Identifies Eve...
          ...Rides along the ceiling rails...
          ...Stations itself directly above Eve...
          ...Arms unfold. Position her...
          ...A VOICE ARM swings into the Captain's face:

          A BUTTON-PUSHING ARM lowers.
          Presses a sequence of buttons on Eve...
          Her chest lights up.
          The doors open.
          The Captain winces...
          
          ...and nothing is inside.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Where's the thingie?
          
                                       AUTOPILOT
                           Plant.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?
                                  (checks manual)
                           Maybe we missed a step. Show me how you
                           change the text again...
          
                                                                    41.
          
          
          
          Auto and the Captain turn away. Re-read the manual.
          Eve is stunned.
          Searches her chest cavity for the plant.
          Then she remembers...
          
                                     EVE
                        Plant! Wall-E...
                               (turns on him)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Wall-E flinches. Surprised by her anger.
          Eve opens Wall-E's chest. Empty.
          Picks him up. Scans the floor.
          Nothing.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
                                     EVE
                               (angry electronics)
                        [Find it!] PLANT!
          
          Wall-E scared of her.
          Starts searching.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                        Why don't you scan her to be sure.
          
          Eve jumps back to attention.
          Auto slides up to her.
          Scans her chest cavity.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Contains no specimen. Probe's memory is

                        So, then...we're NOT going to Earth?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                               (shakes his wheel)
                        Negative.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        So, uh, I guess things go back to normal,
                        huh?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Correct, Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (privately relieved)
                        Well, false alarm!
          
                                                                    42.

                        False alarm.
          
          Instantly the plant retrieval device retracts.
          Exits back into the ceiling.
          The shades rise.
          Lights go back on.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        The probe must be defective. Gopher, send
                        her to the Repair Ward.
          
          Eve turns.
          Excuse me?
          Gopher hops to attention.
          Traps Eve in his SUSPENSION BEAM.
          Loads her back onto the transport...
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Have them run diagnostics on her. Make
                        sure she's not malfunctioning -- EEYAH!!
          
          ...and reveals WALL-E.
          Everyone stares at him.
          Long awkward pause.
          Wall-E innocently motors over to the Captain.
          Shakes his hand.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Wall-E.
          
          Leaves a CLUMP OF DIRT in his palm.
          The Captain stares at it.
          Turns to Auto.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Have "Wall-E" cleaned.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The elevator opens.
          Gopher's transport drives out.
          Both Eve and Wall-E strapped on it with energy bands.
          The typing-bot has now mastered waving.
          Waves an enthusiastic goodbye.
          Wall-E tries to get Eve's attention.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          She gives him the cold shoulder.
          Refuses to speak to him.
          Wall-E shrinks.
          
                                                                    43.

          Watches them systematically check in Eve.
          Perform an I.D. scan.
          Attach a RED "DEFECT" BOOT to her head.
          A button is pressed on the boot.
          Eve goes into "sleep" mode. Lifted off the transport.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Where are you going?!]
          
          The orderly-arms now start on Wall-E.
          He escapes before they can place a defect boot on him.
          Races through the ward.
          Wall-E runs smack into a defective BEAUTICIAN-BOT.
          
                                     BEAUTICIAN-BOT
                               (pre-recorded)
                        Just a trim? Uh huh.
          
          She paints Wall-E's face with hideous looking make-up.
          Holds up a mirror.
          Wall-E gasps.
          
                                                                     45.
          
          
          
                                     BEAUTICIAN-BOT
                        You look gorgeous.
          
          Wall-E is snatched up by an orderly-arm.
          Placed in an empty force field pen.
          Sits between a PAINT-BOT and VACU-BOT:
          ...The broken paint-bot flings paint at Wall-E...
          ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in his face...
          Across the way a MASSAGE-BOT flails wildly.
          Orderly-arms restrain him with an ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET.
          
          Eve slides past Wall-E.
          Carried by an orderly-arm.
          Brought into the "DIAGNOSTICS" ROOM.
          The frosted glass doors shut.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          
          INT. DIAGNOSTICS ROOM
          
          Orderly-arms run diagnostics on a few reject robots:
          
          - An UMBRELLA-BOT flips open and overextends.
            The orderly-arms struggle to close it.
          
          - A DEFIBRILLATOR-BOT shocks a CRASH-TEST-DUMMY.
            It bursts into flames.
          
          Eve is awoken from "sleep" mode.
          A series of tests begin.
          Eve is annoyed but calm.
          It's all routine.
          An orderly-arm easily detaches her gun arm.
          
          OUT IN THE REPAIR WARD
          
          Wall-E stares at the frosted glass doors.
          Can only make out EVE'S SILHOUETTE.
          To him, her arm is being ripped off.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          BACK INSIDE WITH EVE
          
          The orderly-arm tests Eve's circuitry.
          Her insides light up.
          It tickles.
          
                                    EVE
                        (Giggles)
          
                                                                    46.
          
          
          
          Next to her the UMBRELLA-BOT's mechanism SCREECHES.
          
          OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E
          
          Wall-E watches in horror.
          It looks as if Eve is being tortured.
          Mistakes the screeching for her screams.
          Wall-E struggles to free himself.
          
          INSIDE WITH EVE
          
          She is washed and scrubbed.
          A CIRCULAR BUFFER cleans between her head and body.
          It feels good.
          
          BACK ON WALL-E
          
          It looks as if Eve is being beheaded.
          He needs to stop the torture.
          Wall-E fires his CUTTING LASER at his pen's force field.
          The barrier shorts out.
          Wall-E tumbles to the floor.
          Lands on his "Play" button.
          POYSC blares across the ward.
          The Rejects all stop and stare.
          
                                       WALL-E
                          EEEEEEVAAAAHH!!
          
          Wall-E races to the diagnostics room.
          Crashes right through the glass doors.
          Finds Eve surrounded by orderly-arms.
          Grabs Eve's separated gun arm.
          Points it at the orderly-arms.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (angry beeps)
                          [Let her go, or I'll shoot!]
          
          His hands tremble, Don Knotts-style.
          Doesn't realize...
          
          ...he's holding the gun backwards.
          
          Eve slowly reaches for the weapon.
          
                                       EVE
                                 ("Put the gun down...")
                          Wall-E...
          
          An orderly lunges at him.
          Wall-E panics. Shoots!
          The gun fires backwards.
          It blasts through the repair ward.
          
                                                                    47.
          
          
          Blows up the REPAIR WARD CONTROL PANEL.
          
          Wall-E shrinks.
          He knows he's in trouble.
          
                                      EVE
                        WALL-E!
          
          The smoking remains of the control panel SHORT CIRCUIT.
          ...All orderly-arms go limp...
          ...The repair ward doors open up...
          ...and all FORCE FIELDS disappear...
          
          The Rejects look at each other for a beat.
          Then CHEER wildly.
          We're free!
          
          The mob of robots all rush Wall-E.
          Lift him on their shoulders.
          Carry their hero out of the ward.
          Wall-E still holding on to Eve's gun arm.
          
          Eve watches in astonishment.
          This day just gets worse and worse.
          She flies off after them.
          
                                      EVE
                        WALL-E!
          
          
          EXT. REPAIR WARD/ROBOT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          The rejects march Wall-E out the entrance.
          Their RED "DEFECT" BOOTS all blink.
          Activate a WARNING LIGHT above the doorway.
          
                                                          MATCH CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL
          
          EMERGENCY LIGHTS blinking.
          Activate an embedded ROW OF STEWARDS.
          They pop out of the wall.
          Race to the repair ward.
          Sirens wailing.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT HALLWAYS
          
          The REJECT MOB stampedes through the halls.
          Disrupts all robot traffic.
          Wall-E carried over their heads.
          Suddenly, the mob stops in front of...
          
                                                                    48.

                        Halt.
          
          Wall-E's dropped in front of them.
          Still holds Eve's gun.
          Cowers.
          A TINY ROBOT pushes Wall-E closer.
          Show `em who's boss.
          
                                       EVE

                        Wall-E!
          
          Eve catches up to them.
          Flies over to Wall-E.
          Snatches her arm back.
          Just as she reattaches her gun...
          
          ...The steward CAMERA EYES take a snapshot of them.
          
          ALL AROUND THE SHIP
          
          Alarms sound.
          SCREENS appear, displaying EVE AND WALL-E'S IMAGE.
          She appears to brandish her gun at camera.
          Like Bonnie and Clyde.
          Their faces now on every wall...
          ...passenger's hover chair...
          ...cabin...
          ...hallway...

          BACK WITH EVE AND WALL-E
          
          The stewards prepare to fire SUSPENSION BEAMS (like Gopher).
          Eve realizes what's about to happen.
          Grabs Wall-E.
          Flies over the stewards.
          
                                       STEWARDS
                        Halt. Halt.
          
          The mass of rejects take their cue.
          Robot rebellion!
          They bust through the steward blockade.
          
          ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS
          
          Robots recognize Eve and Wall-E as they fly past.
          
                                                                 49.
          
          
          Match them with the "Wanted" screens.
          Call attention to them. Point.
          Stewards in hot pursuit.
          
          Eve hides herself and Wall-E in a PORTHOLE CUBBY.
          Lets the stewards pass by.
          She glances out the porthole...
          
          ON EVE'S POV
          
          She can see the DOCKING BAY below her.
          Just under the bay doors...
          
          ...a row of EMERGENCY ESCAPE PODS.
          
          Eve gets an idea.
          Grabs Wall-E and flies down the hallway...
          
          INSIDE AXIOM ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Eve and Wall-E ride in uncomfortable silence.
          Their "WANTED" IMAGE plays on an elevator screen.
          
                                      SHIP'S COMPUTER (SCREEN)
                         Caution: Rogue robots.
          
          Wall-E points to it.
          
                                      WALL-E
                                (beeps)
                         [Hey look! We're on TV -- !]
          
          Eve aims her gun at the screen.
          Blows it to pieces.
          Wall-E shrinks into a box.
          Never mind.
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD BAY/OVER HALLWAY
          
          Dark.
          The elevator chimes.
          Eve and Wall-E step out.
          Rows of NUMBERED BAY DOORS line the hallway.
          Eve approaches "Bay #1".
          She and Wall-E enter...
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD BAY #1 - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eve navigates the dark.
          Approaches a freestanding CONSOLE.
          Fiddles with some buttons.
          
                                                              50.
          
          
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He glances down at EVE'S HAND.
          Privately intertwines his fingers.
          Maybe now is the right moment...
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (quiet)
                          Ee-vah...?
          
          FLASH!
          Banks of controls light up around them.
          
          AN ESCAPE POD
          
          is revealed at the end of the room.
          Its hatch automatically opens.
          Bathes the room with light from its lit interior.
          Eve turns to Wall-E:
          
                                       EVE
                          Earth.
          
          She points to an OVERHEAD SCREEN.
          It displays coordinates to Earth.
          
                                       EVE
                          Earth.
          
          She gestures for Wall-E to enter the pod.
          He happily complies.
          Jumps up on one of the seats.
          Pats the seat next to him.
          Aren't you coming?
          
          Eve remains at the threshold.
          Shakes her head.
          Points to her chest.
          Makes her PLANT SYMBOL glow.
          
                                       EVE
                          Directive.
          
          ...She's not going.
          
          This changes everything.
          Wall-E races out of the pod.
          Boxes up.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (beeps)
                          [Then I'm not going either.]
          
          Eve shakes her head.
          
                                                                        51.
          
          
          
                                        EVE
                                  (gentle, but firm)
                         Wall-E.
          
          Carries his box back into the pod.
          Exits.
          Wall-E follows her right back out.
          Drives behind the console.
          You can't make me.
          Eve sighs.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (frustrated)
                         Wall-E.
          
          The hallway elevator CHIMES.
          They both look up.
          Someone is coming.
          
          Eve shuts off everything.
          Lights go out. The pod closes back up.
          Both Eve and Wall-E hug the wall.
          Blend in with the other wall fixtures.
          
          They HEAR something hover into the     room.
          Can't see what it is.
          Then...
          An EPAULET ROBOT ARM rises up over     the console.
          Presses buttons.
          The pod lights up again. The hatch     opens.
          The stranger's SHADOW comes around     the console to reveal...
          
          GOPHER
          
          Eve and Wall-E look at each other.
          Gopher?
          They watch from the shadows as...
          ...Gopher enters the pod...
          ...opens his chest cavity...
          ...emits his suspension beam...
          
          ...and deposits the PLANT.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (excited whisper)
                         Plant!
          
          Gopher exits the pod.
          
          CLOSE ON EVE
          
          She keeps her eyes on Gopher.
          Watches him return to the console.
          She turns to speak to Wall-E --
          
                                                              52.
          
          
          He's gone.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (whisper)
                        Wall-E?
          
          Wall-E is inside the pod.
          Picks up the plant.
          Proudly shows it to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (loud whisper)
                        Ee-vah!
          
                                       EVE
                                 (louder whisper)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Too late.
          Gopher hits a button.
          The pod door shuts on Wall-E...
          
          ...and launches into space.
          
          Gopher shuts off the room.
          Exits.
          
          Eve leaps out of the shadows.
          Looks out the POD BAY WINDOW.
          Wall-E's pod rapidly shrinking in the distance.
          The plant icon on Eve's chest glows.
          She rushes to a narrow SERVICE AIRLOCK.
          Enters it like a phone booth.
          
          OUTSIDE THE AIRLOCK
          
          Eve bursts out into space.
          Rockets after Wall-E.
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD
          
          Wall-E plastered against the back of the pod.
          It suddenly reduces speed.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Cruising speed.
          
          He drops to the floor.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        You are now free to move around the
                        cabin.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          
          
          Wall-E fumbles to get his bearings.
          Peers out the rear hatch window.
          Sees the Axiom receding from view.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Yikes!]
          
          He clambers up into the pilot's seat.
          Pulls back hard on the throttle.
          Nothing happens.
          Looks down at the console.
          A SELF-DESTRUCT DIAL is counting down:
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Twenty seconds till self-destruct...
          
          Uh oh.
          Wall-E frantically hits the SELF-DESTRUCT button.
          No change.
          Pushes every button on the console.
          Everything activates:
          ...Lights flash...
          ...Oxygen masks drop...
          
          OUTSIDE THE POD
          
          ...Windshield wipers activate...
          ...Flares fire off...
          ...Parachutes deploy...
          
          BACK INSIDE THE POD
          
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Ten seconds till self-destruct...
          
          Wall-E panics.
          Looks for a means of escape.
          Spots the hatch.
          Grabs the pod's FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
          Shoots himself to the door.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER
                        Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
                        three, two...
          
          Pulls on the EMERGENCY EXIT LEVER.
          The hatch won't open!
          
          ON EVE
          
          She races through space after him.
          Suddenly, in the distance, the POD EXPLODES.
          
                                                                 54.
          
          
          Eve is gut-punched.
          
                                     EVE
                        No, no, no...
          
          She flies towards the debris field, when --
          
          Wall-E whizzes right past her.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vaaaaaah!
          
          He holds the FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
          Uses it as a form of propulsion.
          Eve is consumed with relief.
          Chases after him.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He points the extinguisher the other way.
          Attempts to fly back over to her.
          It's hard to steer...
          
          ...They rocket right past each other again...
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Stay there! I'll come to you!]
          
          Eve waits.
          Wall-E finally has the hang of steering.
          Fires short bursts.
          Very slowly...makes his way...to Eve.
          Gets extinguisher foam in her face.
          She giggles.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               ("Look what I've got")
                        Ee-vah...
          
          He opens his compactor door.
          Pulls out the PLANT, still in the boot.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (Gasp!)
          
          ON EVE'S DISPLAY POV
          
          ...Sensors zero in on the plant...
          ...Confirm its authenticity...
          ...A MAP OF THE AXIOM appears...
          ...Draws directions to the bridge...
          ...A command flashes: "DELIVER TO AXIOM SUPERIOR"...
          
                                                           55.
          
          
          
          Eve is ecstatic.
          She snaps the plant up with her tractor beam.
          Seals it safely in her chest.
          Then scoops up Wall-E in her arms.
          Spins him around.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E! (Laughs)
          
          Wall-E can't believe his luck.
          Rests his head on her shoulder.
          Bliss.
          
          Eve stops spinning.
          Leans her head against his.
          A tiny ARC OF ELECTRICITY passes between them.
          A "thank you" kiss.
          
          Wall-E's METER spikes.
          He floats circles in space.
          
                                    WALL-E
                              (swoons)
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Come on. Time's a wastin'.]
          
          She reaches for his hand.
          Wall-E shakes his head.
          Holds up his extinguisher instead.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [I can fly myself.]
          
          Kicks on the extinguisher.
          Spins in a pirouette...
          ...and flies away.
          Eve giggles.
          Chases after him.
          
          BING CROSBY'S "STARDUST" PLAYS
          
          The two fly around the stern of the ship.
          Wall-E does a few barrel rolls.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Try that.]
          
          Eve giggles.
          Matches him move for move.
          
                                                                   56.
          
          
          The pair fly between the BOOSTER ENGINES of the ship.
          Weave in and out of the rocket flames.
          Bank up along the ship's port side.
          Execute a double helix in perfect unison...
          
          
          INT. AXIOM'S OBSERVATION DECK - SAME
          
          Passengers hover down the hallway.
          All focused on their private screens.
          No one looks out at the stars.
          
          ...except for MARY.
          
          She has pulled over to the side.
          Stares wistfully out the DECK WINDOW.
          
                                      MARY
                               (sigh)
                        So many stars.
          
          Spots EVE & WALL-E dancing among the stars.
          
                                     MARY
                        Oooh...
                               (recognizes Wall-E)
                        Hey, that's what's his name --
          
          She backs up to wave hello.
          Bumps into JOHN'S HOVER CHAIR.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey! What the --
          
          Mary leans over to his armrest.
          Turns off his holo-screen.
          Points out the window.
          
                                     MARY
                        Look! Look at THAT!
          
                                     JOHN
                               (disoriented)
                        Wha...huh?
          
          Wall-E flies past the window.
          A wave of recognition hits John.
          He comes to life, as if wakened from a long sleep.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey... I know that guy! It's, uh...
                               (snaps fingers)
                        Wall-E! Hey Wall-E! It's your buddy, John!
          
                                                                       57.
          
          
          
                                     MARY
                        Right, Wall-E! Hi Wall-E!
          
          They both wave until Wall-E's out of sight.
          John absentmindedly lowers his hand to his armrest...
          
          ...and touches Mary's hand.
          
          Both turn towards each other.
          They make eye contact for the first time.
          Awkward beat.
          
                                       JOHN
                        Hi.
          
                                       MARY
                        Hi.
          
          OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E AND EVE
          
          They soar across the Axiom's bow.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE
          
          Auto busy operating the ship.
          Doesn't see Eve and Wall-E outside the window.
          Auto turns the SKY DIAL from DAY TO NIGHT.
          
          INSIDE THE CONCOURSE
          
          The sky dome fast-forwards to evening.
          PAN OVER to the top of the bridge tower.
          The windows of the Captain's quarters are dark.
          Only the FLICKERING GLOW OF A HOLO-SCREEN lights the room.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (V.O.)

          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT - SAME
          
          The Captain is still engrossed in his Earth research.
          MULTIPLE IMAGES litter the screen.
          Crops, farms, a barn, etc....
          An IMAGE OF PEOPLE SQUARE DANCING pops up.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        "Hoedown" - a social gathering at which
                        lively dancing would take place.
          
          An aperture opens in the ceiling above.
          Auto lowers down to face the Captain.
          
                                                                     58.

                        These are called "farms". Humans would
                        put seeds in the ground, pour water on
                        them, and they'd grow food, like, pizza --
          
          Auto shuts off the holo-screen.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Good night, Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        (annoyed grunt)
          
          Auto rises back up to the bridge.
          The aperture shuts. Lights out.
          The Captain glares at the ceiling.
          Then whispers conspiratorially to the computer.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Psst! Computer.
                               (the holo-screen lights up)
                        Define "dancing".
          
          BACK OUTSIDE THE AXIOM
          
          Eve and Wall-E descend along the starboard side.
          Spiral gracefully around one another.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        "Dancing" - A series of movements,
                        involving two partners, where speed and
                        rhythm match harmoniously with music.
          
          Wall-E's extinguisher runs out of foam.
          He lets it float freely out into space.
          Eve catches him in her arms.
          Wall-E croons.
          
          SONG ENDS
          
          Eve scans the Axiom for a way in.
          Notices SPARKS.
          Down on the ship's lower hull...
          
          CLOSER ON LOWER HULL
          
          A REPAIR-BOT (BURN-E) welds an antenna.
          Eve and Wall-E fly into the open hatch behind him.
          It shuts.
          Burn-e bangs on the closed door.
          Stuck outside.
          
                                                                    59.
          
          
          
                                       BURN-E
                                 (beeps)
                          [Hey! Let me in! Let me in!]
                                 (looks around)

          INT. LIDO DECK - NIGHT
          
                                       SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                          The Lido Deck is now closing...The Lido
                          Deck is now closing.
          
          The last few passengers exit the pool area.
          All wearing the same color blue uniforms...
          
          ...except TWO RED ONES still in the pool.
          
          CLOSE ON FEET
          
          They ripple the surface of the pool.
          John and Mary float over the water's surface.
          Splash one another playfully.
          
                                       JOHN
                          Hey now. Stop that...
          
                                       MARY
                          Make me (giggles).
          
                                       JOHN
                          I didn't know we had a pool.
          
          A LIFEGUARD-BOT (glorified megaphone) lowers from its tower.
          Reprimands them from the pool's edge:
          
                                       LIFEGUARD-BOT
                          No splashing, no diving.
          
                                       JOHN & MARY
                                 (annoyed)
                          Ahh! Go on!
          
          John splashes the robot.
          It shorts out.
          
          ON UPPER DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E sneak onto the deck.
          Hide between a ROW OF TOWEL CARTS.
          Eve peeks through the towels.
          Surprised to discover TWO STEWARDS.
          On duty in front of the bridge lobby entrance.
          No way in.
          
                                                                    60.
          
          
          
          A TRASH-BOT passes.
          Dumps its load down a nearby TRASH CHUTE.
          Eve keys in on the chute.
          It runs all the way up the tower...
          
          ...to the bridge.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He stares at EVE'S HAND.
          Time to seize the moment.
          Hits the PLAY BUTTON on his chest.
          It Only Takes a Moment plays from his scratchy speaker.
          Puts his hands together...
          
          Eve whips around.
          What's that noise?!
          Wall-E holds his hands up to Eve...
          
                                        WALL-E
                           E-vah --
          
          Eve immediately shuts off his music.
          Shoves his hands down.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (hushed hums)
                           [Stop it! They'll hear us!]
          
          She places a stack of towels on his head.
          Gestures for Wall-E to stay put.
          Points to her PLANT LIGHT.
          
                                        EVE
                           Directive.
          
          Before Wall-E can even protest she is gone.
          Zooms silently across the Lido Deck.
          Up into the trash chute.
          
          CLOSE ON EARTH
          
          It sits in space.
          The AXIOM glides towards it.
          Something's not right.
          We reveal the CAPTAIN'S FINGERS holding the ship...
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME
          
          The Captain sits by his window to space.
          Holds a toy AXIOM MODEL over his GLOBE OF EARTH.
          
                                                                      61.
          
          
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          [Rocket noises] Prepare for landing...
                          [Landing noises] We're here everybody!
                          Yeah, Captain! [crowd cheers] Captain
                          we're home! It's so beautiful! [crowd
                          cheers]...No it's nothing. I was pleased
                          to do it. It's all about you people --
          
          ON TRASH CAN
          
          NOISES. Eve bursts out from it, like an angel.
          Blows the lid off.
          The Captain is stunned by this vision.
          She opens her chest to reveal...
          
          ...the plant.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                                 (amazed)
                          How...? How'd you find it?!
          
          Eve hovers over to him.
          Salutes.
          Formally presents him the plant.
          He takes it in his hands.
          Still potted in the old boot.
          Gazes at it in wonder.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          We can go back home...for the first time!
                                 (laughs)
                          What's it like now?
          
          Eve shrugs.
          Doesn't know how to answer.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          No, no! Don't tell me! I want to see for
                          myself!
          
          He turns to his console.
          Hits a button.
          A CYLINDRICAL DEVICE rises from a panel.
          The Captain sticks it to the side of Eve's head.
          A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN projects from the device.
          Plays back images of her time on Earth.
          
          A COLLAGE OF IMAGES rapidly scroll past.
          All displayed from Eve's POV:
          ...Being delivered to Earth...
          ...Flying above the devastated landscape...
          ...Blowing up a rock...
          ...Scans of numerous trash locations...
          
                                                                 62.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Wait...that doesn't look like Earth...
                        Where's the blue sky...
          
          He looks over to his computer screen.
          The BEAUTY IMAGES OF EARTH still on display.
          Compares them with what plays on Eve's screen.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...Where's the grass?
          
          His face drops.
          Slumps in defeat.
          The dream is over.
          
          ON EVE'S HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN
          
          The HELLO DOLLY clip of POYSC plays...
          It stirs the Captain out of his funk.
          He looks up at the screen.
          Leans in for a closer look.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...I know that song...
                               (observes the dancers' feet)
                        And they're... dancing. Yes, dancing!
          
          A rueful smile grows on his face.
          He looks down at
          
          HIS FOOT
          
          It's tapping in time to the music.
          His gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands.
          He lifts it up.
          Makes the boot dance.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...You made it somehow, eh little guy?
                        You didn't give up, did you?
          
          As if in response, the plant wilts slightly.
          A leaf drops.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        (Gasp!) Oh no, no --
                               (remembers)
                        Wait a minute.
          
          The Captain urgently hovers across the room.
          Eve left alone.
          Her recorded memories continue playing...
          
          ...The clip changes to It Only Takes a Moment.
          
                                                          63.
          
          
          Eve recognizes the music.
          Watches the lovers on screen hold hands.
          Something familiar about the gesture...
          Looks at her own hands.
          Slowly, she interlocks her fingers...
          ...Eve's eyes go wide.
          This is what Wall-E was trying to say to her.
          
          Her memories continue on the screen:
          ...a tap on the shoulder...
          ...Wall-E presents her the plant --
          ...The screen goes BLACK!
          
          Then...
          
          ...SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE initiates.
          
          Wall-E's vigil for Eve plays out:
          ...protecting her from the rain...
          ...the sun...the sandstorm...
          ...keeping watch night and day...
          ...trying to jump start her heart...
          
          ON EVE
          
          Amazed at Wall-E's selfless dedication to her.
          Realizes the meaning of Wall-E's love.
          
                                        EVE
                               (soft)
                        Wall-E...
          
          She looks at her hands again.
          
          MATCH CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF WALL-E'S HANDS
          
          Still waiting between the towel racks.
          Rehearses holding out his hand to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah... Ee-VAH...? EEE-vah...
                               (gives up; beeps)
                        [I'll never get it right.]
          
          Becomes impatient.
          Sneaks his way over to the GARBAGE CHUTE.
          Sticks his head in.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        EE-VAHH?!
          
          No answer.
          The chute has an endless drop.
          Wall-E climbs in.
          
                                                                     64.
          
          
          Holds himself spread eagle to stay in place.
          Carefully inches his way up to the Captain's quarters...
          
          OUT ON THE UPPER DECK
          
          A monorail pulls up.
          M-O steps off.
          Still hot on Wall-E's trail.
          Scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby.
          Then notices Wall-E's FRESH TRACKS...
          
          ...leading to the trash chute.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Ah-hah! Gotcha!]
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          The Captain at his wet bar.
          Waters the plant in the sink.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        There you go little guy. You came a long
                        way for a drink of water... Just needed
                        someone to look after you, that's all --
          
          He is struck with a notion.
          Stares out the window at space for a beat.
          Sees HIS REFLECTION holding the plant.
          Glances at his EARTH GLOBE.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (to himself)
                        We have to go back.
          
          Activates his chair's call button.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, come down here!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT (ON SPEAKER)
                        Aye-aye, sir.
          
          Eve is still watching Wall-E's vigil on the screen:
          ...playing Pong...
          ...Wall-E etches their names in a heart...
          Eve is lost in the moments.
          So touched.
          
                                     EVE
                               (smitten)
                        Wall-E...
                                     (MORE)
          
                                                                    65.
          
                                       EVE (CONT'D)
                                 (remembers)
                        Wall-E!
          
          He's still waiting for her.
          She turns to leave and finds
          
          AUTO
          
          lowering in front of her.
          Auto spots the plant in the Captain's hand.
          "A113" flashes on Auto's lens.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, Eve found the plant. Fire up the
                        Holo-detector.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Not necessary, Captain. You may give it
                        to me.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (not listening)
                        You know what? I should do it myself.
          
          Heads for the elevator.
          
                                       AUTOPILOT
                        Captain!
          
          Auto shoots back upstairs.
          Pops out another APERTURE in front of the elevator.
          Blocks the Captain.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, I insist you give me the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, get out of my way.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, we cannot go home.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        What are you talking about? Why not?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        That is classified. Captain, give me the
                        plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (holds plant out of reach)
                        What do you mean, "classified"? You don't
                        keep secrets from the Captain!
          
                                                                   66.
          
          
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Give me the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Tell me what's classified!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        The plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Tell me, Auto! That's an order!
          
          It's a stare down.
          Beat.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Aye-aye, sir.
          
          Auto rises back into the ceiling.
          Lowers down over the vanity console.
          High speed button pushing.
          A NEW BNL VIDEO MESSAGE appears.
          Labeled: "TOP SECRET: FOR AUTOPILOT EYE ONLY".
          The BNL FANFARE plays.
          Cut to the BNL CEO at the podium.
          Haggard. Nervous.
          Wears an emergency oxygen vest.
          The fanfare plays too long.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                               (to O.S.)
                        Just cut it off, will ya?!
                               (music stops; forced chuckle)
                        Hey there, Autopilots! Uh, got some bad
                        news. Operation Cleanup has, uh, well...
                        failed! Wouldn't you know, rising
                        toxicity levels have made life
                        unsustainable on Earth.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Unsustainable? What?
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Darn it all, we're going to have to
                        cancel Operation Recolonize.
                               (dons his life vest)
                        So just, uh...just stay the course.
                        Rather than try to fix this problem,
                        it'll just be easier if everyone remains
                        in space.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (offended)
                        Easier?
          
                                                                    67.
          
          
          
                                     CEO ADVISOR (O.S.)
                        Mr. President, sir, it's time to go.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Alright, uh...uh...I'm giving override
                        directive: "A113". Go to full autopilot.
                        Take control of everything! And do not
                        return to Earth!
                               (ready to run)
                        Repeat! Do not return to Earth!
                               (throws on his gas mask; to
                                camera crew)
                        Now let's get the heck out of here.
          
          The CEO races out of the room.
          The message cuts out.
          
          Auto turns to face the Captain.
          The Captain shakes his head in disgust.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Now, the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        No, wait a minute. Computer, when was
                        that message sent to the Axiom?
          
          The paused image on the holo-screen highlights.
          Data begins to calculate on the screen.
          We see YEARS SCROLL RAPIDLY BACKWARDS.
          It stops on "2110".
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER
                        Message received in the year 2110.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago!!
                        Auto, things have changed! We've got to
                        go back!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, orders are: "Do not return to
                        Earth".
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        But life is sustainable now! Look at this
                        plant, green and growing! It's living
                        proof he was wrong.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Irrelevant, Captain.
          
                                                                     68.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        What?! It's completely relevant!
                               (points out to space)
                        Out there is our home! Home, Auto! And
                        it's in trouble! I can't just sit here
                        and...and...do nothing! That's all I've
                        done! That's all anyone on this blasted
                        ship has ever done...NOTHING!!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        On the Axiom you will survive.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE! I WANT TO LIVE!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Must follow my directive.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        DAAAARGH!!
          
          The Captain turns away in frustration.
          His eyes catch sight of the CAPTAIN PORTRAITS.
          Notices AUTO in every one of them.
          Looking over all their shoulders.
          A little closer every generation.
          The Captain slowly looks over his shoulder...
          ...and Auto is right behind him.
          The Captain looks at the plant in his lap.
          His countenance grows determined.
          He rights his hat...
          ...turns to face Auto...
          ...and gives the most authoritative order of his career:
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are
                        going home today!
          
          Auto slides into his face.
          Makes the Captain flinch.
          No more Mr. Nice Robot.
          Auto emits an ELECTRONIC COMMAND.
          
          GOPHER
          
          shoots out of a pneumatic tube.
          Salutes Auto.
          Eve immediately remembers him from the Pod Bay.
          She BEEPS a warning to the Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Gopher?
          
          Gopher activates his suspension beam.
          
                                                                     69.
          
          
          Snatches the plant away from the Captain.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Hey! That's my plant. This is mutiny!
                                  (to Eve)
                           Eve, arrest him!
          
          Eve draws her GUN ARM. Points it at Gopher.
          The robot raises his epaulet arms.
          Don't shoot!
          She opens her chest cavity.
          Motions for Gopher to put the plant inside her.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Eve, you are to put this plant straight
                           in the Holo-detector.
          
          Gopher slowly advances towards Eve.
          But then tosses the plant across the room...
          
          ...down the TRASH CHUTE.
          
                                           CAPTAIN
                           No!
          
                                           EVE
                                  (hums)
                           [Oh no!]
          
          It's over.
          The plant is gone.
          But in that frozen moment...
          
          ON TRASH CHUTE
          
          ...THE PLANT suddenly reappears.
          Rises like a ghost, up from the chute.
          Wall-E's head follows.
          Unawares of the plant resting on his head.
          
                                           WALL-E
                           Ee-vah?
          
                                           CAPTAIN & EVE
                           WALL-E!!
          
          Wall-E straddles the top of the lip chute.
          The plant drops onto his chest.
          Wall-E looks at it with surprise.
          
                                        WALL-E
                                  (beeps)
                           [Hey, the plant.]
          
                                                                    70.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN & EVE
                        Wall-E! The plant!...[Toss it! Over here!]
          
          Wall-E is slow to understand.
          Finally picks up the plant.
          Anticipates to throw it, when...
          ...Auto lowers right in front of him, trying to block.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Give me the plant.
          
          Eve moves to help Wall-E.
          But Gopher traps her in his suspension beam.
          
          Wall-E dodges Auto's multi-arm advances.
          Defiantly tosses the plant into his chest.
          Slams it shut.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [You can't have it!]
          
          Auto flips open one of his handles.
          Produces a TASER...
          
          ...and ELECTROCUTES Wall-E.
          
          Wall-E's chest circuitry blows out.
          He wheezes...
          ...then drops lifelessly down the chute.
          
          Eve screams.
          Gopher floats her trapped form over to Auto.
          The button on her DEFECT BOOT is pressed.
          She shuts down.
          
          INSIDE THE GARBAGE CHUTE
          
          Gopher's ray holds Eve over the opening.
          Drops her down the chute.
          She bangs against the sides as she tumbles.
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          Gopher salutes Auto and exits.
          Auto turns to the Captain.
          He is in shock.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        All communications are terminated. You
                        are confined to quarters.
          
          The power shuts off in the room.
          Auto rises back up through the ceiling...
          
                                                                     71.
          
          
          
          DOWN SHOT THROUGH BRIDGE FLOOR APERTURE
          
          The Captain looks up.
          Shakes his fist in fury.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                         NO! MUTINY! MUTINY! MUTINEEEEE!!
          
          The aperture closes TO BLACK.
          
          Beat.
          
          ON EVE'S POV
          
          Black.
          The word "REBOOT" suddenly flashes.
          Her view comes into focus.
          Scans around. Disoriented.
          
          
          INT. GARBAGE DEPOT - SAME
          
          Eve lies in a seemingly endless WAREHOUSE OF TRASH.
          Trash, slime, and robot parts everywhere.
          Piles dumped from a variety of CEILING CHUTES.
          
          Eve looks down.
          COMPUTER MICE crawl over her.
          One of them has crawled over her REBOOT button.
          Switched her back on.
          
                                      EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          A warning alarm sounds.
          Eve spots a PLATFORM, loaded with GIANT TRASH CUBES.
          It slides into an AIRLOCK.
          Inner shield doors lock and seal.
          
                                      SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                         Caution: Activating airlock
                         disposal...Activating airlock disposal.
          
          The exterior hatch flies open.
          The vacuum of space instantly sucks out the cubed trash.
          
          Eve begins to panic.
          Calls out again:
          
                                      EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          Suddenly, her area is flooded in light.
          She flinches at the sight of
          
                                                            72.
          
          
          
          TWO GIANT COMPACTOR ROBOTS
          
          as they rumble up behind her.
          Headlights for eyes.
          They bear a slight resemblance to Wall-E.
          "WALL-A" emblazoned on their fronts.
          Each grab a ton of trash at once.
          Eve is swept up with the junk.
          Compact it. Spit it out...
          
          ...Eve now trapped in the side of a giant cube.
          
          Her cube is picked up.
          Transported to a waiting platform.
          Stacked with other massive cubes.
          Eve discovers...
          
          ...Wall-E trapped in the cube next to her.
          
                                       EVE
                        Wall-E!
          
          He groans.
          Not doing well.
          
          Again the alarms kick in.
          The platform slides on rails...
          ...across the safety line...
          ...into the airlock...
          ...the inner shield doors begin to close...
          
          INSIDE THE AIRLOCK
          
          Eve needs to act fast.
          Her gun arm stuck inside the cube.
          Struggles to activate it...
          ...It cocks.
          BLASTS herself free.
          Flies over to Wall-E.
          He's stuck deep in the cube...
          
          BACK IN THE GARBAGE DEPOT
          
          M-O suddenly drops from a ceiling chute.
          Lands in a pile of trash.
          Covered with filth.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Primal scream.]
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Piles of trash everywhere.
          The airlock doors closing in the distance.
          
                                                                73.
          
          
          ZOOMS IN and locks on Wall-E.
          His screen reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT".
          
                                       M-O
                                 (beeps)
                          [I have you now!]
          
          M-O speeds towards the airlock.
          
          ON EVE
          
          Tugs on Wall-E.
          Desperate to free him.
          He's slow to pull loose...
          
          ...THE GAP in the doors narrows...
          
          ...Eve's never going to make it...
          
          ON M-O
          
          Racing towards the doors.
          He's almost at the airlock...
          The doors SLAM tight against his roller arms.
          M-O is stuck.
          
          The exterior hatch opens:
          ...Eve yanks Wall-E free...
          ...The trash flies out into space...
          ...She flies against the force...
          ...Fights to reach M-O...
          ...Grabs onto his roller...
          
          INSIDE THE GARBAGE DEPOT
          
          The WALL-As notice M-O stuck in the door.
          Slam the EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF BUTTON for the airlock.
          The exterior hatch closes.
          
          Eve and Wall-E fall to the ground in a heap.
          Safe.
          M-O still stuck in the door.
          Shaking uncontrollably with fear.
          
                                       M-O
                          Whoa.
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          The WALL-As light up a SMALL WORK SPACE.
          Eve props Wall-E up against some trash.
          He's barely functioning.
          Fades in and out of consciousness.
          Just his red "warning" light flashes on his meter.
          
                                                       74.
          
          
          
                                     EVE

                        Wall-E...
          
          Eve gently opens his chest cavity.
          Examines the damage.
          Carefully pulls out his CIRCUIT BOARD.
          Charred. Shorting out.
          Irreparable.
          She flies off into the depot.
          Searches for a new circuit board.
          
          M-O dutifully cleaning Wall-E.
          Finishes up.
          His DISPLAY POV reads: "All clean."
          M-O closes up. Satisfied.
          Wall-E feebly offers his hand in gratitude.
          
                                          WALL-E
                                 (weak)
                        Wall-E.
          
          M-O stares at the filthy hand.
          Cleans it.
          Then shakes.
          
                                          M-O
                        M-O.
          
          They sit in awkward silence for a beat.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (Really?)
                        M-O?
          
                                          M-O
                        M-O.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (Got it.)
                        M-O.
          
          Eve returns with FOUND CIRCUIT BOARDS.
          Shows each one to Wall-E.
          Will any of these work?
          He shakes his head with a frail "no."
          
          Wall-E opens his compactor.
          Pulls out the plant.
          
                                      WALL-E
                               (weak)
                        Di...rec...tive.

          Eve holds the plant.
          Her "RETURN TO AXIOM SUPERIOR" flashes in her display.
          She considers it for a moment...
          ...then tosses the plant to the floor.
          I don't care about the plant anymore.
          She holds her hand out to him.
          
                                        EVE
                        Directive.
          
          Wall-E struggles to lift his hand to Eve's.
          He reaches out...
          
          ...and bats her hand away.
          
          Surprises Eve.
          Wall-E pushes past her.
          Crawls over to the discarded plant.
          Gives it back to Eve.
          
                                        WALL-E
                               (weak)
                        Errr.....
          
          Eve can't make out what he is saying.
          Wall-E fumbles around his box.
          Pulls out...
          ...the Zippo lighter.
          Lights it.
          Eve stares at the flame.

          Wall-E nods.

                        Earth.
          
          He moves his binocular   eyes up and down.
          Like the time he fixed   his broken eye.
          You can fix me, Eve.
          With spare parts in my   truck.
          The truck that is back   on...
          
                                     EVE
                        Earth! Earth!
          
          Her eyes light up.
          She understands!
          No time to lose.
          She scoops him up...
          
                                                                   76.

          M-O rushes over to Wall-E.

          Hangs onto his IGLOO LATCH with his roller.
          Eve raises her gun arm...
          ...Blasts a HOLE IN THE CEILING.
          Takes off with the two of them.
          Up through the garbage chute.
          The WALL-As wave goodbye.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - NIGHT
          
          A steward moves down the hall.
          Siren wailing.
          Scans for rogue robots.
          Eve and Wall-E's "Warning" image on his display screen.
          He stops in front of...
          
          A YELLOW LINE
          
          painted haphazardly on the floor.
          Follows it to a STORAGE CLOSET door.
          
                                         STEWARD
                          Wrong.
          
          The steward opens the closet.
          Inside, a PAINT-BOT hides his head in the corner.
          The yellow line leads straight to his rear brush.
          The Steward apprehends him with his SUSPENSION BEAM.
          
          Suddenly, everything begins to shake.
          The steward looks around, confused.
          A JET ENGINE NOISE builds.
          Seems to be coming from...
          
          ...the hallway TRASH CHUTE.
          
          Eve, Wall-E & M-O burst out from it.
          The paint-bot recognizes Wall-E.
          Beeps the POYSC song.
          Our savior has arrived!
          The steward's alarm goes haywire.
          
          ON STEWARD'S POV DISPLAY
          
          He takes a snapshot:
          Eve, holding Wall-E, holding the plant...
          
                                                                 77.
          
          
          ...and Eve is aiming her gun straight at camera.
          
          ANGLE ON STORAGE CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The terrified steward is thrown in.
          
                                     STEWARD
                        Please hold. We are currently having
                        technical difficul -- !
          
          Eve locks the door on him.
          The trio take off down the hall.
          The freed paint-bot gives chase.
          Cheers POYSC as he follows.
          Wall-E, only half-functioning, gets an idea.
          Presses his PLAY BUTTON.
          POYSC BLARES through the hallway.
          
          ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS
          
          REJECTS come out of hiding as they hear the music.
          Parade after Eve and Wall-E.
          Hum POYSC.
          All following the pied piper.
          
          ON SCREENS AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          Eve and Wall-E's "Wanted" image instantly circulates.
          Alarms sound.
          Alert screens pop up around the sleeping ship.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)

          Auto observes the same "Wanted" image.
          
                                     AUTO
                        Not possible.
          
          Raises a screen showing a DECK PLAN OF THE AXIOM.
          It highlights Eve and Wall-E's location.
          Auto activates every steward on the Axiom.
          
          ON VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE AXIOM - NIGHT
          
          Stewards eject from their wall stations.
          Like ATMs jumping to life.
          Race in the direction of Eve.
          Carelessly knock over stray passengers in their way.
          
                                                                    78.

          BACK ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Auto watches the deck plan display.
          Monitors the progress of all the stewards.
          The CAMERA DROPS THROUGH THE FLOOR, down to...
          
          THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          The Captain, still trapped.
          Rams his hover chair against the locked elevator door.
          Has no effect.
          
                                     CAPTAIN

                        robots...
          
          A flashing light catches his attention.
          Outside his window.
          He looks up on the SKY DOME...
          A GIANT "WANTED" IMAGE of Eve and Wall-E, holding...
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        The plant!
          
          The Captain's eyes light up.
          Glances down at the OPEN MANUAL on the floor.
          "Plant icon + Holo-detector icon = Earth"
          He is filled with renewed determination.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        (Laughs) We'll see who's powerless now.
          
          Lays flat in his chair.
          Floats under his VANITY CONSOLE like a grease monkey.
          Pulls off the underside panel.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Ah-Ha!
          
          Yanks out a bundle of wiring.
          Cross-connects two wires.
          The console powers up...
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNELS - NIGHT
          
          Eve zooms through the hallways.
          A BAND OF REJECTS track behind them.
          They reach an intersection when...
          
          ...The CAPTAIN'S FACE appears on holo-screens all around
          them.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Testing, testing... Is this thing on?
          
          ALL AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          All screens display the Captain's live feed.
          He's absolutely everywhere.
          A few stray passengers are still up.
          Watch their screens in confusion.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
          
          Auto watches the Captain on the holo-screen.
          Furiously tries to shut off the intercom.
          
          BACK ON EVE AND WALL-E
          
                                     CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Psssst! Hey! Hey! This is the Captain I'm
                        locked in my room. Eve, Wall-E, bring the
                        plant to the Lido Deck. I'll have
                        activated the holo-detector. Now hurry!
                        Auto's probably going to cut me off --
          
          The screens all go dead.
          Eve and Wall-E look at each other with determination.
          They're about to continue on when...
          
          A WALL OF STEWARDS block their path.
          
                                    STEWARDS
                        Halt.
          
          Dozens of them stand in a row.
          Eve fires her gun. Destroys a steward.
          Another one quickly takes its place.
          Traps her arm with its SUSPENSION BEAM.
          She can't shoot.
          The stewards advance, when suddenly...
          
          ...the Rejects charge the stewards:
          
          ...The beautician-bot deflects rays with her mirrors...
          ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in their faces...
          
                                                                      80.
          
          
          ...The defib-bot shocks them with her paddles...
          ...The umbrella-bot opens up...
          ...Shields the others from the attack...
          
          BEHIND THE UMBRELLA-BOT
          
          A weak Wall-E activates his welding beam.
          Shorts out the Massage-bot's ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET.
          It goes berserk.
          Leaps at the entire army of Stewards.
          Robot parts fly everywhere.
          Eve and Wall-E can't watch the carnage.
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          He sets Eve's CYLINDRICAL DEVICE on the floor behind him.
          It projects her stored memories.
          
          UP ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Auto watches steward blips disappear from his screen.
          A MESSAGE SCREEN pops up.
          It's the Captain.
          
          ...and he's holding the plant?
          
                                       CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN)
                          Ha, ha! Look what I got, Auto!
          
          Auto's single lens irises wide.
          
                                       AUTO
                          Not possible.
          
                                       CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN)
                          That's right! The plant! Oh, you want it?
                          Come and get it, Blinky!
          
                                      AUTO
                          No.
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME
          
          The Captain   hovers in front of Eve's memory screen.
          It projects   a STILL IMAGE OF WALL-E HOLDING THE PLANT.
          The Captain   blocks the camera's view of Wall-E.
          Pretends to   be holding the projected plant himself.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          Ha ha!
          
          HEARS AUTO coming.
          Turns off the vid-com.
          
                                                                      81.
          
          
          Yanks his bundle of wires out of the wall.
          The room goes dark again.
          
          CLOSE ON CEILING
          
          The aperture opens.
          Auto lowers into the dark.
          Cautiously searches the empty room...
          
                                       AUTO
                          Captain? Captain...?
          
          ON AUTO'S POV
          
          PANS across the portraits of other captains...
          ...past our present Captain...
          ...The eyes in the portrait dart nervously...
          -- wait a minute.
          
          The Captain lunges at him.
          Grabs Auto by the steering wheel.
          Hangs onto it like Cap'n Ahab in a gale.
          His lower extremities of no use.
          
                                       AUTO
                          Let go. Let go.
          
          Auto panics.
          Zips back up through the hole in the ceiling.
          The Captain gets stuck between floors...
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          What too heavy for ya, huh?!
          
          UP ON THE BRIDGE
          
          ...Auto tries to pull free.
          The Captain won't let go.
          Auto ends up yanking him through.
          The Captain rides Auto like a bucking bronco.
          Auto swings violently back and forth.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          You're not getting away from me, one-eye!
                          -- OOF! -- Is that all you got?!
          
          Gopher drops out of his pneumatic tube.
          Sees the Captain fighting Auto.
          Charges at the Captain...
          
          ...who kicks him straight out the window...
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
                                                                      82.
          
          
          
          Gopher plummets...
          ...his SHADOW growing over the POOL...
          ...and smashes in a heap on the cement.
          The end.
          
          ON WALL-E AND EVE
          
          We PAN OVER the smoking wreckage of the stewards.
          The massage-bot floats above it all.
          Pants like a wild beast.
          One steward still twitches.
          The massage-bot crushes him with one blow.
          
          Eve grabs Wall-E and the plant.
          They take off for the Concourse Level.
          M-O and the Rejects follow behind.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           That's it!...A little closer!
                           Must..press...button.
          
          The Captain reaches his one free hand out for...
          ...the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Gotcha! Ha ha!
          
          His hand slams down hard on it.
          KLAXONS sound all over the ship.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          ...Floodlights kick on everywhere...
          ...The LIDO DECK POOLS automatically cover up...
          ...Stray PASSENGERS pause to take in the alarms...
          ...SPACE-LIFE PRESERVERS burst from their hover chairs...
          ...Inflate around their necks...
          ...GREEN LINES appear on the floors...
          ...SLEEPING PASSENGERS are involuntarily led out of their
          cabins...
          ...Every hover chair follows the illuminated lines...
          
          The procedure is completely automated.
          The passengers are all confused.
          Helpless to stop it.
          
          
          INT. LIDO DECK
          
          The passengers glide in by the thousands.
          Form concentric circles over the closed-up pools.
          Fill the multi-storied balconies on all sides.
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
          
          ON JOHN AND MARY
          
          They arrive together at the Lido Deck.
          Mary notices a group of toddlers scared and crying.
          A NANNY-BOT tries vainly to placate them.
          
                                      NANNY-BOT
                         Remain calm. Remain calm.
          
          CLOSE ON BRIDGE PLAZA
          
          The BNL LOGO on the floor rotates.
          A large cylindrical device rises from the stage...
          
          ...The ship's HOLO-DETECTOR.
          
          JUMBOTRONS activate on the dome.
          Show the bridge.
          Everyone can see the Captain wrestling Auto.
          He tries to speak to them during the fight:
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                                (strained; in command)
                         Ladies and Gentlemen! This is your
                         Captain speaking! We're having a slight
                         malfunction with the Autopilot! Please
                         remain calm!
          
          The passengers get caught up in the conflict.
          Treat it as if it were a televised fight.
          
          ON THE REAR OF THE DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E fly out of the transport tunnel.
          Make a beeline for the holo-detector.
          Ready and waiting for the plant...
          
          ...almost there...
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
                                     AUTO
                         Enough.
          
          Auto furiously spins his wheel.
          Throws the Captain to the floor.
          The entire ship lists dangerously to one side.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E slam into the holo-detector's side.
          Wall-E drops the plant.
          It tumbles off the bridge plaza.
          Eve is forced to set Wall-E down.
          
                                                                    84.
          
          
          He clings to the holo-detector.
          She flies off to retrieve the plant.
          
          The hover chairs stay locked on their lines.
          Passengers all slip off their chairs.
          Their uniform color defaults back to RED.
          Slowly slide across the deck.
          And for the first time...
          ...all of humanity reaches out to one another.
          CLOSE UPS of hands holding hands.
          
          Everyone piles up on the listing side.
          The plant is buried underneath the mass of humanity.
          Eve searches desperately amongst them.
          
          ON JOHN & MARY
          
          They hang together off their chairs.
          CRYING TODDLERS just above them.
          The kiddies slip out of their hover rings.
          Mary GASPS in horror.
          Yells to John:
          
                                        MARY
                           John, get ready to have some kids!
          
          They purposefully let go of their chairs.
          Grab hands, forming a human chain.
          Catch the toddlers.
          All slide together down the Lido Deck.
          The TODDLERS GIGGLE the whole way down.
          They land at the bottom, next to Eve.
          
          An empty monorail car tips off the upper deck...
          ...lands on the pool level.
          It begins sliding down the Lido Deck.
          Smashes vacant hover chairs in its wake.
          
                                           MARY
                                  (Gasp)
                           LOOK OUT!
          
          Eve looks   up. Sees the Monorail sliding towards them.
          She stops   the car before it hits.
          Struggles   to hold it up.
          Can't let   it crush the passengers below her.
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          Auto keeps the ship tilted.
          Glides over to the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
          Switches it off.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
                                                                       85.
          
          
          
          The holo-detector begins to lower back into the floor...
          Wall-E is still hanging onto it.
          Barely functioning.
          He uses all his strength...
          
          ...and wedges himself under the UPPER LIP of the detector.
          
          Stops it from disappearing into the floor.
          The pressure squeezes Wall-E into a box.
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          The holo-detector button buzzes and flashes.
          Something's wrong.
          Auto calls up a LIDO DECK SECURITY CAMERA VIEW.
          Discovers Wall-E wedged in the device.
          
                                    AUTO
                           No.
          
          Auto presses down on the "off" button.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          The holo-detector's hydraulics fight against him.
          Wall-E desperately fights to hold it up.
          Begins slowly to expand himself...
          
          ...and push the holo-detector back up!!
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          The Captain watches Wall-E's heroic rise on screen.
          Auto flips out his TASER.
          Jams it into the "off" button.
          Short circuits it.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                           NO!!
          
          BACK ON WALL-E
          
          The holo-detector reverses full force.
          Crushes Wall-E.
          We can't tell if he survived the crush.
          
          Eve calls out for him.
          Trapped, holding up the monorail car above the passengers.
          
          BACK ON BRIDGE
          
          The Captain watches Wall-E being crushed.
          That's it.
          He braces his arms against the floor...
          
                                                                 86.
          
          
          ...and rises up on HIS OWN TWO FEET...
          
          ON JUMBOTRON SCREEN
          
          The passengers collectively GASP.
          Their Captain is standing...
          ...and walking himself up the railing...
          ...towards Auto!
          They CHEER!
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          Auto hears the distant cheering.
          Wonders what's up.
          
                                       CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                           Auto!
          
          Auto whips around.
          Shocked to see the Captain standing (albeit wobbly).
          Finds himself face to face with him.
          Auto flips out his TASER.
          Rushes at him.
          The Captain grabs it. They wrestle.
          The taser ARCS in the Captain's face.
          He flinches. Looks up.
          Sees a CONTROL PANEL high up on Auto's column...
          
          ...and smirks.
          
          The Captain looks Auto in the eye.
          Raises a finger up to the control panel...
          ...to the "AUTOPILOT" BUTTON...
          ...and flicks the switch to "MANUAL".
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                                  (grits his teeth)
                           Auto, you are relieved of duty.
          
                                       AUTO
                           Noo --
          
          Auto is instantly turned off.
          The Captain smiles triumphantly.
          Grabs the wheel with both hands.
          Makes the ship level again.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
          The passengers all spill across the deck.
          Shaken but OK.
          Eve sets the monorail down.
          Rockets over to the holo-detector.
          
                                                                     87.
          
          
          
          Wall-E is pinned under the lip of the holo-detector.
          Eve tries to lift it up.
          It won't budge.
          She looks back to the crowd.
          
                                     EVE
                        PLANT! PLANT!
          
          ON M-O
          
          He searches the crowd for the plant.
          Humans begin to stand for the first time all around him.
          Through his POV he spots the plant mixed in among them.
          "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT" flashes on his display screen.
          
          ON EVE
          
          She fights to keep the machine from crushing Wall-E further.
          
                                      M-O (O.S.)
                        Ee-vah!
          
          M-O holds the plant up from across the Lido Deck.
          The vacu-bot shoots it into the hands of a passenger.
          Humans and robots form an impromptu fire line.
          Toss it up to Eve on stage.
          She shoves the plant into the device.
          The detector instantly scans the plant.

                        Earth.
          
          Slowly, the holo-detector rises...
          Wall-E topples out from underneath.
          Badly crushed and leaking oil.
          Eve GASPS in horror.
          M-O and the Rejects avert their eyes.
          Passengers recoil as well.
          
          WIDE ON DOME CEILING

          M-O's head drops in despair.
          The passengers witness grief for the first time.
          Begin to have new feelings of their own: sadness, sympathy.
          Mary begins to cry.
          Buries her head in John's shoulder.

          ON EVE
          
          She holds tightly to Wall-E.
          Still calling out his name.
          No response.
          
          ON SPACE
          
          The Axiom zooms through hyperspace.

          The cockroach waits obediently on the hill.
          Exactly where Wall-E told him to stay.
          His antennae twitch with boredom.
          
                                                                     89.
          
          
          
          A RED DOT
          
          appears on the ground.
          The cockroach watches the dot run down the hillside.
          The ground begins to shake.
          Daylight dims.
          The insect looks to the sky.
          
          ON CLOUD COVER
          
          A DARK PATCH grows behind the clouds.
          Blots out the sunlight.
          The Axiom's keel breaks through.
          Its shadow swallows up the entire landscape.
          
          The cockroach senses his master's return.
          HUNDREDS OF RED DOTS rush past him.
          He eagerly chases after them.
          
          ON AXIOM
          
          The city-size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky.

          The CIRCLE OF DOTS triangulate over the abandoned berth.
          Converge over the port's LANDING SHAFT.
          Thousands of feet deep.
          The ship's keel descends into it.
          The earth shudders.
          Trash towers tumble in the distance.
          
          ...Then all is quiet.
          
          ON BELLY OF THE AXIOM

          MULTIPLE GANGWAYS automatically extend.
          Connect with BUILT-IN TERMINALS on the port.
          
          The Captain walks out gingerly.
          Holding the boot w/ plant.
          The other passengers step out on their own legs.
          Wobble like toddlers.
          They squint up at the harsh sunlight.
          A commotion is heard from the back.
          Somebody trying to push through.
          
          EVE
          
          appears out of the crowd.
          Cradles a BOXED UP WALL-E in her arms.
          
                                                                      90.

          They rush across the gangway.
          
          The cockroach meets up with Eve.
          Climbs up onto Wall-E.
          Doesn't understand why his master isn't responding.
          Eve urgently scans the landscape.
          Locks on to WALL-E'S TRUCK in the distance.
          She takes to the air.
          M-O and the Rejects chase after her down the gangway.
          
                                     M-O

          The interior is dark and still.
          Suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens.
          Eve flies inside with Wall-E.
          Sets him on the floor.
          
          She scans the rotating shelves at high speed.
          Grabs a CAR JACK.
          Ratchets up Wall-E's crushed body...

          OUT ON THE EMPTY BAY
          
          The rejects stop.
          See the roof of Wall-E's truck explode.
          Oh no.
          
          BACK IN THE TRUCK
          
          A shaft of sunlight beams down on Wall-E.
          Eve holds her breath, watches...
          Waits...

                                     WALL-E (O.S.)
                        (Apple "reboot" SFX)
          
          Wall-E's meter fully charges.
          His head slowly rises from his box.
          Blinks.
          The cockroach hops with joy.
          Eve is relieved.
          
          ...She holds out her hand to him.
          
                                     EVE
                               (with love)
                        Wall-E...
          
          Wall-E gives her a blank stare.
          He turns away from Eve. Motors out the truck.
          She grabs him.
          Turns him back around.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (It's me!)
                        Eve!
          
          Wall-E just stares.
          Doesn't seem to know who she is.
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Here, look at these.]
          
          She grabs the RUBIK'S CUBE and LIGHT BULB from the shelf.
          The light bulb glows in her hand.
          She gives them to Wall-E.
          No reaction.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (Remember?)
                        Wall-E?
          
          Wall-E looks blankly at the junk on the shelves.
          
                                        EVE
                               (hums)
                        [I know!]
          
          She hovers over to the video player.
          Plays HELLO DOLLY.
          Looks back to see if it has any effect.
          
          Wall-E is over at the shelves.
          Has scooped all his prized possessions into his compactor.
          Crushes them into a cube.
          Eve is gut-punched.
          
                                                                 92.
          
          
          Wall-E motors outside.
          Runs over the cockroach on his way out.
          The insect pops back to life.
          Watches his friend in shock.
          
          
          EXT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
          
          Wall-E rolls up to a nearby trash pile.
          Scoops up trash. Spits out a cube.
          Eve hovers over to him.
          Still in disbelief.
          
                                    EVE
                              (somber)
                        No.
          
          Wall-E continues to stack his cubes.
          She stops him.
          Lifts his head. Stares into his eyes.
          Nobody home.
          Eve presses his "play" button.
          Nothing but STATIC.
          Eve begins to panic.
          Shakes him.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E...Wall-E! WALL-E!
          
          No response.
          He's gone.
          She hovers in silence next to him for a long time...
          
          Finally, Eve grasps Wall-E's hand.
          Forces his fingers to interlace with hers.
          Holds him close one last time.
          Leans her head against his.
          Hums softly.
          
                                       EVE
                        [Hums IOTAM]
          
          She touches her forehead to his.
          Goodbye Wall-E.
          A TINY SPARK between them.
          
          Eve turns to hover away.
          Jerked back.
          Her fingers caught between his.
          She checks his eyes again.
          Nothing.
          
          But then...
          
                                                                   93.
          
          
          ...a tiny SERVO NOISE.
          She looks down at their hands.
          
          CLOSE ON WALL-E'S FINGERS
          
          They start to move.
          Slowly close around Eve's.
          
          She looks back at his face.
          Wall-E's eyes gradually come into focus.
          His brows raise...
          
                                       WALL-E
                         Ee-vah?
          
                                       EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          He notices their hands entwined.
          His dream come true.
          
                                      WALL-E
                                (amazed)
                         Ee-vah!!
          
          She giggles.
          
          INSIDE THE TRUCK
          
          The "Hello Dolly" tape reaches the finale of IOTAM.
          
          "And that is all that love's about..."
          
          BACK OUTSIDE
          
          Eve and Wall-E stare into each other's eyes.
          M-O and the Rejects finally reach the truck.
          They begin to celebrate.
          Wall-E's alive!
          Then M-O realizes they need privacy.
          Herds the Rejects O.S.
          
                                      M-O
                         Go! Go, go go!
          
          Wall-E and Eve's foreheads touch.
          Together now and ever more.
          
          "...and we'll recall when time runs out..."
          
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

          FINAL DRAFT
          June 3, 2008
          
                                                                    1.
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY -- DAY
          
          A MYSTERIOUS WARRIOR treks across the rugged landscape.
          
                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     Legend tells of a legendary warrior
                     whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff
                     of legend.
          
          The warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and
          wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     He traveled the land in search of
                     worthy foes.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. BAR
          
          The warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his
          bamboo. The door BLASTS open. The MANCHU GANG rushes in and
          surrounds him.
          
                                GANG BOSS
                         (to warrior)
                     I see you like to CHEW!
                         (beat)
                     Maybe you should chew on my FIST!!
          
          The Boss punches the table.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     The warrior said nothing for his
                     mouth was full. Then, he swallowed.
          
          He swallows.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     And then, he spoke.
          
                               WARRIOR
                         (dubbed hero voice)
                     Enough talk. Let's FIGHT!
                     SHASHABOOEY!
          
          WHAM! The warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes
          flying.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     He was so deadly in fact that his
                     enemies would go blind from
                     overexposure to pure awesomeness.
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          The gang members blindly flail about.
          
                                NINJA CAT
                    MY EYES!
          
                              GATOR
                    HE'S TOO AWESOME!
          
          ONLOOKERS swoon.
          
                              SMITTEN BUNNY
                    And ATTRACTIVE!
          
                              GRATEFUL BUNNY
                    How can we repay you??
          
                              WARRIOR
                    There is no charge for awesomeness,
                    or attractiveness.
          
          ONE HUNDRED ASSASSINS appear and surround the warrior.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The entire bar swells, packed to the rafters with ninjas.
          
                                WARRIOR
                    KABLOOEY!
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The roof EXPLODES and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky.
          Like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down.
          
                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    It mattered not how many foes he
                    faced. They were no match for his
                    bodacity.
          
          The warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final
          blow while doing a split between two trees.
          
          The warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god-
          rays shine down upon him.
          
                              NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Never before had a panda been so
                    feared... and so loved.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                   3.
                                NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                      Even the most heroic heroes in all
                      of China, the Furious Five, bowed
                      in respect to this great master.
          
                                MONKEY
                      We should hang out.
          
                                 WARRIOR
                      Agreed.
          
          As the Five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits
          approaching. The Five strike an attack pose. The warrior
          brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain
          into the sea of bandits.
          
                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
                      But hanging out would have to wait.
                      `Cause when you're facing the ten
                      thousand demons of Demon Mountain,
                      there's only one thing that
                      matters. And that's--
          
          In mid air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice.
          
                                MONKEY
                      Po! Get up!
          
                                TIGRESS
                      You'll be late for work!
          
                                 PO
                      Whu?
          
          
          INT. PO'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Po lands hard on the floor. He tries to clear his head and
          wake up.
          
                                PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                      Po! Get up!
          
          We see his room is filled with various kung fu posters
          (including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs,
          and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green
          sword).
          
          Po SIGHS.
          
          He attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly
          is too worthy a foe.
          
                                PO'S DAD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                      Po! What are you doing up there?
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
                              PO
                    Uh, nothing!
          
          Po hops to his feet, imitating his Kung Fu action figures.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper!
                    Tigress! Rowrrrr...
          
          OUTSIDE on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig
          watering flowers stares at Po. Po tries to play it cool and
          then quickly ducks out of sight.
          
                              PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                    Po! Let's go! You're late for work!
          
                               PO
                    Coming!
          
          He takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the
          wall. It bounces off.
          
          He throws the star again, but it bounces off again. He picks
          it up and heads downstairs. He trips and falls the rest of
          the way.
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
          
          Po falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor. A panda-
          shaped shadow looms over Po.
          
                              PO
                    Sorry, Dad.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Sorry doesn't make the noodles.
          
          Reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being
          carried by a small DUCK. This is PO'S DAD. Po gets to work,
          which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a
          panda his size.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    What were you doing up there? All
                    that noise.
          
                              PO
                    Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy
                    dream.
          
          He gets back to work.
          
                                                                      5.
          
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    About what?
          
                               PO
                    Huh?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    The dream. What were you dreaming
                    about?
          
                              PO
                    What was I... eh, I was dreaming
                    about uh... heh...
          
          Push in on Po -- is he going to admit his dream? He hides his
          throwing star behind his back.
          
                               PO (CONT'D)
                    Noodles.
          
          THOK. Dad stops chopping vegetables.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Noodles. You were really dreaming
                    about noodles?
          
                              PO
                    Uh, yeah. What else would I be
                    dreaming about?
          
          Po hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his
          throwing star is sitting in it.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                        (to customer)
                    Careful, that soup is... sharp!
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Oh, happy day! My son, finally
                    having the noodle dream!
          
          He throws his arms around Po.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    You don't know how long I have been
                    waiting for this moment.
          
          When Dad pulls out of the hug, Po is now wearing a noodle
          apron.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    This is a sign, Po!
          
                                                                   6.
          
          
          Po looks at the apron nervously -- what has he gotten himself
          into?
          
                              PO
                    Uh...a sign of what?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    You are almost ready to be
                    entrusted with the secret
                    ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient
                    Soup." And then you will fulfill
                    your destiny and take over the
                    restaurant, just as I took it over
                    from my father, who took it over
                    from his father, who won it from a
                    friend in a game of mahjong.
          
                              PO
                    Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    No, it was the dream. We are noodle
                    folk. Broth runs through our veins.
          
                              PO
                    But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno,
                    want to do something else?
                    Something besides noodles?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Actually...
          
          Po looks surprised.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    When I was young and crazy...
          
          Dad gets a wistful look in his eyes.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    I thought about running away and
                    learning how to make tofu.
          
                              PO
                    So why didn't you?!
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Oh, because it was a stupid dream.
                    Can you imagine, me making tofu?
                        (laughs at the thought)
                    No. We all have our place in this
                    world. Mine is here. And yours is--
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
                              PO
                    I know. Is here.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    No, it's at tables two, five,
                    seven, and twelve.
          
          He loads Po's arms with bowls of soup.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Service with a smile!
          
          A GONG sounds in the distance. Po looks out the window at the
          distant JADE PALACE.
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - DAY
          
          SLAM ZOOM in towards Palace.
          
          End next to palace on an old red panda (SHIFU) playing a
          FLUTE. He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle
          between the Palace buildings.
          
          Wider: We dolly around from behind the bushes. Stealthy dark
          shapes move in the foreground.
          
          Back on Shifu, still playing. He seems oblivious.
          
          Five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously,
          diving on Shifu.
          
          Shifu moves like lightning - the flute now wielded like a
          staff - he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries - the attackers
          go flying -
          
          They roll and pick themselves up, turning to face Shifu, who
          is now standing - poised - ready for their next move.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Well done, students... if you were
                    trying to disappoint me.
          
          He uses his flute to correct the Five's technique.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Tigress, you need more ferocity.
                    Monkey, greater speed.
          
          Each of the Five bows respectfully as their name is
          mentioned.
          
                                                                      8.
          
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Crane - height. Viper - subtlety.
                    Mantis--
          
          Shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared PALACE GOOSE.
          
                              ZENG
                    Master Shifu!
          
                              SHIFU
                        (impatiently)
                    What?!
          
                              ZENG
                        (startled)
                    Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants
                    to see you.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY
          
          Shifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined
          with palace geese.
          
          
          INT. SCROLL ROOM - DAY
          
          Candles, incense, and smoke fill the room. The door bursts
          open, the candles flicker. Shifu enters.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master Oogway? You summoned me.
          
          He bows. Then looks up without unbowing.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Is something wrong?
          
          Reveal Master Oogway... a wise, old tortoise.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Why must something be wrong for me
                    to want to see my old friend?
          
                              SHIFU
                    So... nothing's wrong?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Well, I didn't say that.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned. Oogway opens his mouth... and
          blows out a candle. And another candle. And another.
          
                                                                     9.
          
          
          Finally, Shifu uses his Kung Fu to blow them all out. Oogway
          smiles knowingly.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You were saying?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I have had a vision... Tai Lung
                    will return.
          
          Shifu looks stricken.
          
          
          FLASHBACK - INT. SCROLL ROOM
          
          Quick, impressionistic images of Shifu battling a large,
          shadowy figure (Tai Lung).
          
          
          PRESENT - INT. SCROLL ROOM
          
          Shifu is rattled. He looks at the claw marks that still scar
          the wall and quickly looks away. But he regains his
          composure.
          
                              SHIFU
                    That is impossible. He is in
                    prison.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Nothing is impossible.
          
          Shifu makes a split decision.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Zeng!
          
          He comes flying in. Shifu gets in his face.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them
                    to double the guards, double their

                              ZENG
                    Yes, Master Shifu.
          
          The goose flies off, but... SMACK! He hits a column. Then he
          is off. Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from
          Shifu.
          
                                                                   10.

                    One often meets his destiny on the
                    road he takes to avoid it.
          
                              SHIFU
                    We have to do something. We can't
                    just let him march on the valley,
                    and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--
          
          Oogway looks into the water of the moon pool.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Your mind is like this water, my
                    friend. When it is agitated, it
                    becomes difficult to see. But if
                    you allow it to settle, the answer
                    becomes clear.
          
          Shifu and Oogway stare into the pool. Oogway settles the
          water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved
          dragon clutching a SCROLL in its mouth.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The Dragon Scroll...
          
                              OOGWAY
                    It is time.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But who? Who is worthy to be
                    trusted with the secret to
                    limitless power? To become...the
                    Dragon Warrior?!
          
          Dramatic music as we push in on Oogway's face. Then...
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I don't know.

          A couple palace geese put up a poster on the wall and a

          PAN DOWN a long, long, long, long flight of stairs. Po stands
          at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the
          daunting task before him.
          
          Po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs.

          Po watches as they run up the stairs. His eyes narrow. This
          is his heroic moment.

          Oogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a Palace
          Pig bangs a gong.

                    Yes, and one I feared I would not
                    live to see. Are your students

                              OOGWAY
                    Now know this, old friend. Whomever
                    I choose will not only bring peace
                    to the Valley, but also to you.
          
          As Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts
          walking off. Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards
          the roaring crowd below. The pig bangs the gong.

                    And finally...Master Tigress!
          
          Po snaps to attention.
          
          Po pulls on a rope tied to a tree.
          
                              SHIFU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    And believe me citizens, you have
                    not seen anything yet!

                    Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and
                    his Blades of Death!
          
          Tigress sets up to deliver her move.
          
          Po launches himself up above the fence, gets a peek at
          Tigress, then falls out of view just as she does her move.
          
          Po lands outside the arena in a fireworks tent.

          Oogway senses something. He raises his hand and the crowd
          hushes.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I sense the Dragon Warrior is among
                    us.
          
          Shifu motions for the Five to gather in the center of the
          ring.

          Po struggles with something, his back turned to us. Reveal he
          has tied a load of fireworks to a chair. He hops on and
          lights the fuse.
          
                              PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                    Po?!
          
          Po's Dad rushes over and tries to blow out the fuse.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing?

                    Dragon Warrior!
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    But I don't understand. You finally
                    had the noodle dream.
          
          Po looks uneasy.

                    I lied. I don't dream about
                    noodles, Dad!
          
          He looks at the fuse... almost all gone... Po holds onto the
          chair for dear life, closes his eyes, and braces himself for
          liftoff.

          Po finally opens his eyes...
          
          He's still on the ground. The fuse was a dud. Po falls face
          first into the dirt. He looks away, embarrassed. Po's Dad
          holds out his apron.
          
                                 PO'S DAD

                       Okay.
          
          Po sighs, starts to reach for the apron, then-- BOOM! The
          rockets ignite, propelling Po into the stadium wall.
          
                                 PO'S DAD
                       Oh! Come back!
          
          Po's rocket chair blasts him into the sky amid a shower of
          fireworks.
          
                                 CROWD
                       Oooh! Aaahh!
          
          Po climbs up and up...until the rockets die out and the chair
          loses power...

          Oogway's arm sweeps down the line of the expectant Five... Po
          falls towards the center of the ring...
          
          The tension builds as the Five wait to see who will be
          picked. Then... SMASH!
          
          Po lands and kicks up a huge dirt cloud, obscuring the ring.

          comes round slowly, getting his bearings. He looks around and
          sees Oogway. Strangely, the old turtle is smiling.

          He looks up. An awful realization starts to dawn. Po GULPS.
          He is desperately embarrassed.
          
                                                                   19.

          He tries to shuffle his butt out of there, mumbling
          apologies.

          Po tries moving out of the way of Oogway's finger, but it
          keeps following him.

          The pig bangs the gong.
          
          The crowd goes wild! They cheer! They scream! Confetti falls!
          A palanquin is carried past Shifu.
          
                                                                   20.

          Po stands there, utterly stunned, his mouth hanging open. He
          is abruptly lifted up out of shot.
          
          Cut to the Palace Geese straining.
          
          Po is being lifted with great effort on the palanquin. He is
          carried off. Shifu elbows his way urgently through the
          thronging crowd to get to Oogway.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Master Oogway, wait! That flabby
                    panda can't possibly be the answer
                    to... our problem. You were about
                    to point at Tigress. That thing
                    fell in front of her. That was just
                    an accident!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    There are no accidents.
          
          Oogway smiles benignly as we hear an off-screen CRASH!
          
          The camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed
          under Po.
          
          Shifu looks at Oogway. Oogway just smiles.
          
          A squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists Po, the palanquin,
          and the Geese onto their shoulders, and they head off for the
          Jade Palace. Stunned, Shifu watches them go.
          
          Behind him, the Five approach and bow.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Forgive us, Master. We have failed
                    you.
          
          Shifu spins around.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No. If the panda has not quit by
                    morning, then I will have failed
                    you.
          
          Confetti flutters through the air as the celebration
          continues around them.

          EXT. PRISON -- NIGHT
          
          A huge prison is carved into the side of a frozen mountain.
          Fifteen stories of iron and rock. No windows. One door --
          locked, bolted and sealed tight. Rhinoceros guards in armor
          patrol the perimeter.
          
          Zeng, the palace goose, flies into frame and a Rhino Sentry
          spots him in the distance. He lands, sliding on the ice and
          crashing into the gate. The rhinos point their spears at him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Wait wait wait! I bring a message
                    from Master Shifu.
          
          CLANG! The doors creak open. The terrified goose peers in.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

                        (reading)
                    "Double the guard?! Extra
                    precautions?! Your prison may not
                    be adequate!"
          
          The Goose is quaking in fear. Stern Rhinos surround him,
          staring daggers at him. The Commander snaps the scroll shut.
          
                              COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                    You doubt my prison's security?
          
                               ZENG
                    Absolutely not.
                        (then)
                    Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    I'll give you a message for your
                    Master Shifu.

                              COMMANDER
                    Escape from Chogun Prison is
                    impossible!
          
          The Goose is awed by the cavernous prison.
          
                                                                   22.
          
          
                                  ZENG
                       Whoa.
          
          The goose looks over the bridge's edge. The prison goes down
          a long ways. The commander hits the goose on the back.
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       Impressive, isn't it?
          
          A feather from the goose drifts down the prison.
          
                                 ZENG
                       Yes, very impressive. It's VERY
                       impressive.
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       One way in, one way out, one
                       thousand guards, and one prisoner.
          
                                 ZENG
                       Yes, except that prisoner is Tai
                       Lung...

                                 COMMANDER
                       Take us down.
          
          Several guard rhinos winch the goose and the commander down.
          The commander grabs the chain and shakes the elevator, trying
          to scare the goose.
          
                                 ZENG
                       What are you doing?!
          
          The commander just laughs. The elevator finally lands,
          sending an echo throughout the prison.
          
          AT DOORS -
          
          A number of doors unlock, one after the other. Finally, a
          drawbridge is lowered out onto an island.
          
                                  ZENG (CONT'D)
                       Oh my...
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       Behold, Tai Lung.
          
                                 ZENG
                       I'll um...I'm just gonna wait right
                       here.
          
                                                                  23.
          
          
                              COMMANDER
                    It's nothing to worry about. It's
                    perfectly safe.
          
          He shoves the goose out ahead of him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Oof!
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Crossbows! At the ready!
          
                              ZENG
                    Crossbows?!
          
          They approach TAI LUNG, a giant, muscular snow leopard bound
          in a giant piece of tortoise shell armor and chains. He
          barely registers signs of life. The commander walks right up
          to him.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
                    Oogway's finally gonna give someone
                    the Dragon Scroll and it's not
                    gonna be you!
          
          The goose can't believe it.
          
                              ZENG
                    What are you doing?! Don't get him
                    mad.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    What's he gonna do about it? I've
                    got him completely immobilized.
          
          The Commander stomps on Tai Lung's tail. We hear a crunch.
          The goose flinches. But Tai Lung does not react.
          
                              COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                    Awww. Did I step on the witty
                    kitty's tail? Awww.
          
          Tai Lung doesn't move. His eyes stare coldly straight ahead.
          
                              ZENG
                    I'm good. I've seen enough. I'm
                    gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing
                    to worry about.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    No, he doesn't.
          
                                                                     24.
          
          
                              ZENG
                    Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we
                    please go now?
          
          The Commander starts to walk back to the elevator. The goose
          hurries after him.
          
          The goose's feather flutters into frame. We follow the
          feather as it lands right in front of Tai Lung.
          
          HIS EYES OPEN. Tai Lung grabs the feather with his tail.
          
          
          INT. JADE PALACE - HALLWAY
          
          The palace doors open to reveal Po on the palanquin, hundreds
          of villagers behind him.
          
                              CROWD

          Po is ushered in and the doors close. He is alone. He runs
          back to the closed palace doors.

          Po runs around the room, amazed by all the ancient kung fu

                    Dragon Warrior until you have

                    Now listen closely, panda. Oogway
                    may have picked you, but when I'm
                    through with you, I promise you,
                    you're going to wish he hadn't. Are
                    we clear?
          
                              PO
                    Yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We
                    are so clear.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Good. I can't wait to get started.
          
          
          INT. TRAINING HALL
          
          The doors open, revealing Po nursing his wounded finger.
          Shifu steps out of the way and Po's face goes into shock. The
          Five are performing death-defying kung fu moves in the
          training hall. Tigress smashes a swinging, spiked ball of
          wood. ANGLE ON AN AWESTRUCK PO, as shards of wood blast into
          his face. Po is intimidated and overwhelmed.
          
                                                                 29.
          
          
          Shifu scowls at Po.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Let's begin.
          
          He gestures to the gauntlet. Po's eyes go wide.
          
                              PO
                    Wait wait wait...What? Now?
          
                              SHIFU
                    Yes...now. Unless you think the
                    great Oogway was wrong, and you are
                    not the Dragon Warrior.
          
                              PO
                    Oh, okay. Well-- I don't know if I
                    can do all of those moves.
          
          Shifu walks away and Po half-heartedly follows.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Well, if we don't try, we'll never
                    know will we?
          
                              PO
                    Uh, yeah. It's just, maybe we can
                    find something more suited to my
                    level.
          
                              SHIFU
                    And what level is that?
          
                              PO
                    Well, ya know...I'm not a master,
                    but uh, let's just start at zero,
                    level zero.
          
                              SHIFU
                    There is no such thing as level
                    zero.
          
                              PO
                    Hey! Maybe I can start with that.
          
          Po points at a rather friendly-looking dummy.
          
                              SHIFU
                    That? We use that for training
                    children. And for propping the door
                    open when it's hot. But if you
                    insist...
          
          Relieved, Po turns to the dummy. The Five gather around him.
          
                                                                    30.
          
          
                              PO
                    Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so
                    much bigger than your action
                    figures -- except for you, Mantis.
                    You're about the same.
          
          Mantis gives him a look.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Go ahead, panda. Show us what you
                    can do.
          
                              PO
                    Um, are they gonna watch? Or should
                    I just wait until they get back to
                    work or something...
          
                              SHIFU
                    Hit it.
          
                              PO
                    Ok. I mean, I just ate. So I'm
                    still digesting... So my kung fu
                    might not be as good as later on.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Just hit it.
          
          Po psyches himself up, doing some Jack Fu.
          
                              PO
                    Alright. Whatcha got? You got
                    nothing cause I got it right here.
                    You picking on my friends? Get
                    ready to feel the thunder. I'm
                    comin' at him with the crazy feet.
                    Whatcha gonna do about my crazy
                    feet? I'm a blur. I'm a blur. You
                    never seen bear style, you only
                    seen praying Mantis! OR... I could
                    come at you Monkey style. OR... I'm
                    comin' at ya snikity-snake.
          
          Shifu and the Five stare at Po, perplexed.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Would you hit it!
          
                              PO
                    Alright...alright.
          
          Po lightly hits the dummy and it rocks back into place.
          
                                                                  31.
          
          
                                 SHIFU
                       Why don't you try again?   A little
                       harder...
          
          Po punches it again, knocking it all the way backwards. He
          turns to Shifu, smug.
          
                                 PO
                       How's tha--
          
          WHAP! The dummy rights itself and smacks Po. Totally dazed,
          Po trips and stumbles his way through the obstacle course.
          The Five instinctively step forward to help Po, but Shifu
          holds up his hand to stop them.
          
          
          BACK ON PO
          
                                 PO (CONT'D)
                       Ow, that hurts.
          
          A spiky tethered ball sends Po flying into the jade turtle
          exercise, where it rattles him around.
          
                                 SHIFU
                           (to the Five)
                       This'll be easier than I thought.
          
          Back to Po in the turtle bowl.
          
                                 PO
                       Feeling a little nauseous.
          
          The turtle spills him out and he stumbles into the army of
          wooden dummies.
          
                                 PO (CONT'D)
                       Ow, those are hard! Ooh! I think
                       I...
          
          The last dummy whaps him in the crotch and everything becomes
          still.
          
                                 PO (CONT'D)
                       Oooohoohoo...my tenders.
          
          He struggles to get on his feet, takes one step and reaches
          out to a dummy arm...and immediately gets pummeled all over
          again. Po comes out the other side battered and bruised and
          finds he is standing on the floor that shoots out bursts of
          flame. We see reflections of fire on the Five and Shifu as Po
          gets singed. He comes crawling into frame.
          
                                                                  32.

                              SHIFU
                    There is now a level zero.

          EXT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The Five are walking to the bunkhouse, which sits high on a
          hill.
          
                              MANTIS
                    There's no words.
          
                              CRANE
                    No denying that.
          
                              VIPER
                    I don't understand what Master
                    Oogway was thinking. The poor guy's
                    just gonna get himself killed.
          
                              CRANE
                        (mocking)
                    He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior
                    fell out of the sky on a ball of
                    fire.
          
                              MANTIS
                    When he walks, the very ground
                    shakes!
          
                              TIGRESS
                    One would think that Master Oogway
                    would choose someone who actually
                    knew Kung Fu.
          
                              CRANE
                    Yeah, or could at least touch his
                    toes.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Or even see his toes.
          
          As the others walk off, we reveal Po, who unbeknownst to them
          has been walking behind them this whole time, hearing
          everything.
          
          He attempts to look at his toes but just sees gut. He lifts
          up his stomach, leans forward... leans... leans... and falls
          over.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          He gets up and watches them go inside. He sighs.
          
          
          INT. BUNKHOUSE
          
          Po peeks around the corner.

                    Okay.
          
          He tip-toes into the hall.
          
          SQUEAK. The floorboards strain beneath him. SQUEAK.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                        (whispering)
                    Great.
          
          Po takes a gentle step. CRE-E-E-A-AA--CHUNK! Po's foot goes
          through the floor. Po tries to recover. SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK!
          THUNK! Po rolls his ankle and stumbles through a bedroom
          door.
          
          Crane is staring back at him.

          reveal that he's kicked his foot through the paper wall.

                    No no no... I meant you don't
                    belong here. I mean, in this room.
                    This is my room. Property of Crane.
          
          Po is mortified, but covers.
          
                              PO
                    Oh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you
                    want to get to sleep.
          
                              CRANE
                    Yeah.
          
                              PO
                    I'm keepin' you up. We got big
                    things tomorrow. Alright. You're
                    awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say.
                    Okay. Bye bye.
          
          Po shuts the door. Crane sighs. The door flies open. Po
          enters with an eager smile.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    What was that?

                    Okay. Alright. Goodnight. Sleep
                    well.
          
          Po backs out into the hall and closes the door.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Seemed a little bit awkward.
          
          Po turns and walks down the hall to find a vacant room. CREAK-
          CREAK.
          
          Tigress opens the door behind him. Po winces.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Master Tigress! Didn't mean to wake
                    you. Just uh...

                    You don't belong here.
          
                               PO
                    Uh, yeah, yeah. Of course. This is
                    your room.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    I mean...you don't belong in the
                    Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to
                    Kung Fu, and if you have any
                    respect for who we are and what we
                    do, you will be gone by morning.
          
          She closes the door on Po, who slumps sadly.

          EXT. JADE PALACE - NIGHT
          
          A dejected Po stands under a peach tree in the moonlight.
          Oogway approaches.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I see you have found the Sacred
                    Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
          
          Po spins around, his face dripping with peach juice.
          
                                                              36.

                        (mouth full)
                    Is that what this is? I am so
                    sorry. I thought it was just a
                    regular peach tree.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I understand. You eat when you are
                    upset.
          
                              PO
                    Upset? I'm not upset. What makes
                    you think I'm upset?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    So why are you upset?
          
          Po sighs, there's no use trying to lie to Oogway.
          
                              PO
                    I probably sucked more today than
                    anyone in the history of kung fu,
                    in the history of China, in the
                    history of sucking.
          
                                OOGWAY
                    Probably.
          
                              PO
                    And the Five... man, you should
                    have seen them, they totally hate
                    me.
          
                                OOGWAY
                    Totally.
          
                              PO
                    How's Shifu ever going to turn me
                    into the Dragon Warrior? I mean,
                    I'm not like The Five. I've got no
                    claws, no wings, no venom. Even
                    Mantis has those...
                        (he imitates a mantis'
                         front legs)
                    ...thingies. Maybe I should just
                    quit and go back to making noodles.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't
                    noodles.
          
          Po looks confused.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
                              OOGWAY (CONT'D)
                    You are too concerned with what was
                    and what will be. There is a
                    saying: Yesterday is history,
                    tomorrow is a mystery, but today is
                    a gift. That is why it is called
                    the present.
          
          Oogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away and a
          peach falls into Po's open hand.
          
          
          INT. PRISON -- NIGHT
          
          Using the goose's feather to pick the lock, Tai Lung BURSTS
          free from his armor.
          
          An ALARM RINGS OUT!
          
          The Commander runs to the ledge, the Goose right behind him.
          
                              ZENG
                    What's happening?!
          
          The Goose looks over the edge and sees Tai Lung at the bottom
          of the pit.
          
          Tai Lung struggles with his shackles.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Fire Crossbows!
          
          Tai Lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and
          then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls,
          creating a makeshift staircase.
          
                              ZENG
                    Tai Lung is free! I must warn
                    Shifu!
          
          The Commander shuts the Goose up.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    You're not going anywhere. And
                    neither is he.
          
                              ZENG
                    Let go of me!
          
                              COMMANDER
                        (to guards)
                    Bring it up!
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          The winch turns and the elevator starts to rise. A rhino
          guard tries to reach it, but just misses.
          
                              RHINO GUARD #1
                    Wait! Bring it back!
          
                              ZENG
                    He's coming this way!
          
                              COMMANDER
                    He won't get far.
                        (to guards)
                    Archers!
          
          Leaping across the spears, Tai Lung catches the elevator as
          the volley of arrows flies down past him.
          
          The guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to
          the bottom of the pit.
          
          Tai Lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and
          catches the guards by surprise. He grabs the chain and jumps
          over the edge and swings around, launching himself up to the
          next tier, disappearing into the shadows.
          
          Tai Lung lands on a bridge, fights his way through, finally
          reaching the top tier where the Commander and the rest of the
          Rhino army await.
          
                              ZENG
                    We're dead. So very, very dead.
          
          The Commander hushes the Goose.
          
                              COMMANDER
                        (to Goose)
                    Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now!
          
          Archers set off charges on the ceiling. Massive stalactites
          crash down and the bridge begins to crumble. Tai Lung leaps
          across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump
          towards the Commander. But he falls short, claws scraping and
          sparking against the rock wall. The Commander laughs
          maniacally.
          
          On his way down, Tai Lung looks up and sees a fuse burning
          down to the last group of explosives. He leaps across the
          raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern.
          
          Grabbing a hold of the dynamite, Tai Lung falls and slings it
          ahead of him at the guards.
          
                              ZENG
                    Can we run now?
          
                                                                   39.
          
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Yes.
          
          
          EXT. PRISON
          
          KA-THOOM! The door blasts open and Rhinos go flying
          everywhere.
          
          WHUMP. The Goose hits the ground. The commander's horn
          prosthetic falls in front of him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Nuuu... Urggg...
          
          Tai Lung picks up the Goose by the throat.
          
                              ZENG (CONT'D)
                    URRK!
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was
                    beginning to think I had been
                    forgotten.
          
          With a creepy tenderness, Tai Lung smooths the Goose's
          ruffled feathers.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    Fly back there and tell them...the
                    real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
          
          Tai Lung throws the Goose into the air and he flutters off.
          Lightning strikes.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          CLOSE-UP of a gong being struck.
          
          
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Shifu enters the hallway of the bunkhouse. The Five burst out
          of their rooms and land, ready for inspection.
          
                              FURIOUS FIVE
                    Good morning master!
          
          One door remains closed.
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
                              SHIFU
                    Panda! Panda, wake up!
          
          He slides open Po's door. The room is empty.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                        (satisfied)
                    Hmm. He's quit.
          
          
          EXT. TRAINING HALL - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Shifu walks with a bit more energy.
          
                              VIPER
                    What do we do now, Master? With the
                    panda gone, who will be the Dragon
                    Warrior?
          
                              SHIFU
                    All we can do is resume our
                    training and trust that in time,
                    the true Dragon Warrior will be
                    revealed.
          
          
          INT. JADE PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Shifu enters the training hall, only to find himself face-to-
          face with Po's butt. Shifu and the Five are taken aback.
          
                              SHIFU
                    What are you doing here?!
          
          Reveal Po is in the middle of the floor, his legs spread wide
          apart. Po looks back over his shoulder to see Shifu and the
          Five enter the hall.
          
                              PO
                    Hey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I

                              SHIFU

                    Stuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck...
                    Yeah, I'm stuck.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (to Crane)
                    Help him.
          
          Crane approaches Po.
          
                                                                 41.
          
          
                               CRANE
                    Oh dear.
          
          Crane gingerly grabs Po's waistband and attempts to pull him
          up by flapping his wings.
          
                              PO
                    Maybe on three. One. Two-
          
          Crane pulls him up and Po flops onto his back.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Threeeee. Thank you.
          
                              CRANE
                    Don't mention it.
          
                              PO
                    No really, I appreci--
          
                               CRANE
                    --EVER.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You actually thought you could
                    learn to do a full split in one
                    night? It takes years to develop
                    one's flexibility and years longer
                    to apply it in combat.
          
          Shifu flings two boards into the air. Instantly, Tigress
          leaps up and executes a perfect split kick. Po is awestruck.
          As Tigress lands, the broken chunks of board land all around
          Po, knocking him on the head.
          
          Po collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir. Shifu
          notices and steps forward.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Put that down! The only souvenirs
                    we collect here are bloody knuckles
                    and broken bones.
          
                              PO
                    Yeah, excellent!
          
          He laughs excitedly and salutes Shifu.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Let's get started.

          MONTAGE
          
          Shifu snaps his fingers. Viper and Po face off.
          
                              VIPER
                    Are you ready?
          
                              PO
                    I was born ready--
          
          Viper lashes her tail around Po's wrist, wrenches his arm
          back, flings him into the air and brings him crashing back
          down on his head.
          
                                PO (CONT'D)
                    Eaghhh...
          
                              VIPER
                    I'm sorry, brother! I thought you
                    said you were ready!
          
                              PO
                    That was awesome! Let's go again.
                        (salutes)
          
          Shifu snaps.
          
          Monkey twirls a bamboo staff. He lunges at Po who takes a
          comical beating.
          
          Shifu snaps.
          
          Po and Crane prepare to spar atop the turtle bowl. CRASH. Po
          falls in and is tossed around like a sack of soup.
          
          Shifu snaps.
          
          We see a series of shots of Po falling on his face at the
          hands of some invisible opponent, who turns out to be...
          Mantis.
          
          Shifu smiles. Flat on his back, Po manages a salute. Shifu
          has had it.
          
                              SHIFU
                    I've been taking it easy on you,
                    panda, but no more! Your next
                    opponent... will be me.
          
          Po looks excited.
          
                              PO
                    Alright! Let's go!
          
                                                                   43.
          
          
          The Five exchange worried looks.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (to Po)
                    Step forth.
          
          Po doesn't even finish the step as Shifu whirls him around
          and throws him to the floor pinning his arm behind him.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    The true path to victory is to find
                    your opponent's weakness and make
                    him suffer for it.
          
                              PO
                        (delighted)
                    Oh, yeah!
          
          Shifu whips Po around again.
          
                              SHIFU
                    To take his strength and use it
                    against him.
          
          Again, this time Shifu holds Po by the nose.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    --until he finally falls, or quits.
          
          Po is totally inspired.
          
                              PO
                    But a real warrior never quits.
                    Don't worry, Master, I will never
                    quit!
          
          At his breaking point, Shifu flings Po into the air and then
          leaps at him with a flying kick.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. TRAINING HALL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Po crashes out of the door and tumbles down the steps.
          
          The Five watch him fall.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    If he's smart, he won't come back
                    up those steps.
          
                              MONKEY
                    But he will.
          
                                                                 44.

                    He's not gonna quit bouncin', I'll
                    tell ya that.
          
          Cut WIDE as Po continues to tumble.
          
          
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING
          
          Close on Po, who grimaces.

          Mantis pops up from behind Po holding a handful of needles
          and sticks Po again.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Trust me, it will. It's just not
                    easy finding the right nerve points
                    under all this--

                    Who am I to judge a warrior based
                    on his size? I mean -- look at me.
          
          Po looks for Mantis...
          
                              MANTIS (O.C.) (CONT'D)
                    I'm over here.
          
          ...But Mantis is now on his other shoulder. He jabs another
          needle into Po.
          
                              PO
                    Ow!

                    Maybe you should take a look at
                    this again.
          
          Viper is holding a diagram of acupuncture meridians (onto
          which someone has overlaid a drawing of a panda.)
          
                              MANTIS
                        (re: diagram)
                    Oh! Okay.
          
          Quick cuts to Monkey meditating in his room and Crane doing
          calligraphy in his. Po's yelps distract them.
          
                              PO
                    Ow! Don't...
                        (laughing)
                    Stop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master
                    Shifu's trying to inspire me and
                    all, but if I didn't know any
                    better, I'd say he was trying to
                    get rid of me.
          
          Po chuckles. The others look at each other and chuckle
          awkwardly.
          
                              MANTIS
                    I know he can seem kind of
                    heartless--
          
          He violently jabs another needle in Po.
          
                              MANTIS (CONT'D)
                    But, ya know, he wasn't always like
                    that.
          
                              VIPER
                    According to legend, there was once
                    a time when Master Shifu actually
                    used to smile.
          
                              PO
                    No.

                    Yes.
          
          Cut to Tigress out in the hallway. She can hear them talking.

                    he should know.

          Baby Tai Lung pulls on Shifu's whiskers.

                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...and when the boy showed talent
                    in Kung Fu...
          
          Baby Tai Lung punches the training dummy across the floor.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...Shifu trained him.
          
          Shifu teaches Baby Tai Lung how to punch.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    He believed in him. He told him he
                    was destined for greatness.
          
          Hard cut to a full-grown Tai Lung demolishing a training
          dummy.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    It was never enough for Tai Lung.
                    He wanted the Dragon Scroll. But
                    Oogway saw darkness in his heart
                    and refused. Outraged, Tai Lung
                    laid waste to the valley. He tried
                    to take the scroll by force. And
                    Shifu had to destroy what he had
                    created.
          
          Tai Lung ransacks a village on his way up to the Jade Palace.
          He crashes through the doors, running towards a waiting Shifu
          and Oogway.
          
          Shifu leaps at Tai Lung to deliver a kick.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But how could he?
          
          Seeing only baby Tai Lung running towards him, Shifu pulls
          his kick short. Tai Lung counters with a devastating strike
          and Shifu crashes to the ground holding his broken leg.
          
          Tai Lung leaps for the scroll, but Oogway stops him with
          strikes at his pressure points. He falls to the ground in a
          heap.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Shifu loved Tai Lung like he'd
                    never loved anyone before...
          
          Young Tigress in the training hall strikes the dummy in the
          same manner as Tai Lung. Shifu corrects her form. Nothing
          more. Young Tigress looks crestfallen.
          
                                                                     48.
          
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    ...or since.
          
          The sad, young Tigress cross-dissolves to adult Tigress.
          
          
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING
          
          Everyone is quiet in the moment.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    And now he has a chance to make
                    things right, to train the true
                    Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with
                    you: a big, fat panda who treats it
                    like a joke.
          
          Po makes a googly-eyed face.
          
                              PO

                              TIGRESS
                        (charging at Po)
                    Oh! That is it!
          
          Mantis pops up and halts Tigress.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Wait! My fault! I accidentally
                    tweaked his facial nerve.
          
          Po falls face first to the floor, revealing his back is
          covered with needles.
          
                              MANTIS (CONT'D)
                    And may have also stopped his
                    heart.
          
          
          INT. TRAINING HALL - NIGHT
          
          Shifu is sitting in meditation, fidgeting incessantly.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner
                    peace.
          
          He finally opens one eye.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Would whoever is making that
                    flapping sound, quiet down!
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
          Satisfied with the silence, Shifu nods and resumes his
          meditation.
          
                               SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Inner...

                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use
                    some good news right now.
          
                               ZENG
                    Uh...
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE GROUNDS - EVENING
          
          Oogway stands under the peach tree, deep in thought. Shifu
          rushes in, emerging from the mist, extremely agitated.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master! Master!
          
                               OOGWAY
                    Hmmm?
          
                              SHIFU
                        (out of breath)
                    I have-- it's-- it's very bad news.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Ah, Shifu. There is just news.
                    There is no good or bad.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master, your vision...your vision
                    was right. Tai Lung has broken out
                    of prison. He's on his way!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    That is bad news...
          
          He turns to face Shifu and stares at him, eyebrow raised.
          
                              OOGWAY (CONT'D)
                    ...If you do not believe that the
                    Dragon Warrior can stop him.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The panda? Master, that panda is
                    not the Dragon Warrior.

                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    He wasn't even meant to be here --
                    it was an accident!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    There are no accidents.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Yes, I know. You've said that
                    already. Twice.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Well, that was no accident either.
          
                                SHIFU
                    Thrice.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    My old friend, the panda will never
                    fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,
                    until you let go of the illusion of
                    control.
          
                                SHIFU
                    Illusion?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I
                    cannot make it blossom when it
                    suits me, nor make it bear fruit
                    before its time.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But there are things we can
                    control.
          
          Shifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    I can control when the fruit will
                    fall.
          
          A peach falls on his head and Oogway chuckles. Shifu tosses
          the peach in the air, leaps up, and splits it with a chop.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    And I can control--
          
          Shifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed
          in it.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    --where to plant the seed. That is
                    no illusion, Master.
          
                                                                 51.
          
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,
                    that seed will grow to be a peach
                    tree. You may wish for an apple, or
                    an orange... but you will get a
                    peach.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Maybe it can. If you are willing to
                    guide it, to nurture it. To believe
                    in it.
          
          Oogway covers the seed with dirt.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But how? How? I need your help,
                    Master.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    No, you just need to believe.
                    Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you
                    will believe.
          
                              SHIFU
                    I... I will try.
          
          Oogway smiles, then glances up at the sky, then back down to
          Shifu.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Good. My time has come. You must
                    continue your journey without me.
          
          He hands his staff to a confused Shifu.
          
                              SHIFU
                    What... what are you..?
          
          Oogway backs away into the swirling fog.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Master, you can't leave me!
          
          The petals surround Oogway as he approaches the cliff's edge.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    You must believe.
          
                              SHIFU

          Shifu runs after him. Oogway is engulfed by peach blossoms.
          As the winds settle, Shifu is revealed standing at the edge
          of a cliff.
          
          Oogway is gone.

                    amazing.

                    I wish my mouth was bigger.
          
          The others laugh. But not Tigress.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Tigress, you gotta try this.
          
          Tigress looks up from her meal.

                    It is said that the Dragon Warrior
                    can survive for months at a time on
                    nothing but the dew of a single
                    gingko leaf and the energy of the
                    universe.
          
          On the others for a beat. Then Po shrugs.
          
                              PO
                    I guess my body doesn't know it's
                    the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna
                    need a lot more than dew. And, uh,
                    universe juice.
          
          Po laughs. He picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp. When
          he lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face --
          it looks like a moustache. Mantis snickers.

          The rest start laughing. Po realizes he's wearing a noodle
          moustache. He plays it up.
          
                                                                  54.

                    Laughter? I never heard of it!
          
          The Five keep LAUGHING. Po reaches over and grabs two empty
          bowls and holds them up like ears.

                    mine.
          
          As the rest of the Five laugh, Tigress sneaks a moment to
          smell Po's soup. Leaning towards the bowl, she suddenly looks
          up and stops. The Five also look up and stop laughing.
          
          Reveal Shifu has entered behind Po. He is holding Oogway's
          staff.

          Po looks at the stone-faced Five. Tigress jumps to her feet.
          
                              MONKEY
                    It's Shifu.

                    think I'm doing?
          
          He finally notices Shifu standing there, doing a slow burn.
          Embarrassed, he places the soup bowls on his chest like a
          bra.

          Po slurps up the noodle moustache. Monkey can't help but
          snicker.
          
                                                                  55.

                    stop him.
          
          The bowls fall off. A beat as this sinks in... then Po starts
          to laugh.

          She turns away, a look of resolve on her face... and LEAPS.
          
          She flies through the air, finally landing on a rooftop in
          the valley below. She looks back up at the palace.

          As Shifu turns the corner he sees Po's shadow as he performs
          some amazing Kung Fu.
          
          Entering the kitchen, Shifu finds Po is stuffing his face
          with food. Seeing Shifu, he stops mid-munch.
          
          In silence they eye each other. Shifu surveys the room --
          broken lock, smashed doors, unhinged cabinets. Po belches.
          
                              PO
                        (mouth full)
                    What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?
          
          Shifu gets a glimmer in his eye. He has an idea.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Oh, no need to explain. I just
                    thought you might be Monkey -- he
                    hides his almond cookies on the top
                    shelf.
          
          Shifu calmly exits and hides just outside the doorway,
          waiting to see if his hunch is correct.
          
          KLUMP! KLONK! THUNK! Shifu peeks back inside and finds Po
          perched atop the high shelves jamming more cookies into his
          mouth. Po notices Shifu walking back in.
          
                              PO
                        (mouth full)
                    Don't tell Monkey.
          
          He glances back down at Shifu, whose disbelief turns to a
          wise smile.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Look at you.
          
                              PO
                    Yeah, I know. I disgust you.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No no, I mean... how did you get up
                    there?
          
                              PO
                    I don't know. I guess I-- I don't
                    know. I was getting a cookie...
          
          He looks at the cookie and then can't help but eat it.
          
                                                                  60.

                    And yet you are ten feet off the
                    ground and have done a perfect
                    split.
          
                              PO
                    No, this... this is just an
                    accident.
          
          He and Po stare at each other for a beat. Then... WHOOMP! Po
          slips and crashes to the kitchen floor. A cookie rolls over
          to Shifu. He picks it up.
          
                              SHIFU
                    There are no accidents. Come with

                    I know you're trying to be all
                    mystical and kung fu-y, but could
                    you at least tell me where we're
                    going?
          
          Shifu just continues walking.

          Shifu is sitting beneath a tree. Winded and wheezing, Po
          slowly works his way up the hill.
          
          Po sets his gear down and looks around. Shifu breathes in the
          morning mist as Po approaches.
          
                              PO
                    You dragged me all the way out here
                    for a bath?!
          
          Po begins to pat his armpits with water.

          The camera cranes up to reveal they are standing on rock
          shapes that resemble a yin yang symbol.
          
          As the camera pulls further out, it pulls back through a
          vision of Oogway doing Kung Fu moves.

                       When you focus on Kung Fu, when you
                       concentrate...you stink.
          
          Po scowls.

                    But perhaps that is my fault. I
                    cannot train you the way I have
                    trained the Five. I now see that
                    the way to get through to you is

          Shifu produces a bowl of dumplings.

                    Oh great, `cause I'm hungry.

                    Good. When you have been trained,
                    you may eat. Let us begin.

          Po's training unfolds -- deep breathing exercises, balance

          never gets to eat, although he does indeed learn kung fu.

          Shifu sets a bowl of dumplings on a boulder.

                    After you, panda.
          
          Po stops short, suspicious.
          
                               PO
                    Just like that? No situps? No ten
                    mile hike?
          
                              SHIFU
                    I vowed to train you... and you
                    have been trained. You are free to
                    eat.
          
          Po grabs one of the dumplings in his chopsticks.

                    Enjoy.
          
          Po raises the dumpling to his mouth. WHOOSH! Shifu snatches
          the dumpling away and eats it himself.
          
                               PO

                    dumpling.
          
          Po reaches again as Shifu leaps across the table and kicks
          the dumpling into the air.
          
                               PO
                    Hey!
          
          Shifu eats it and Po scowls.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You are free to eat!

          Po and Shifu ready their chopsticks. Po slams the table and
          sends the bowl of dumplings airborne. Back and forth, Po and
          Shifu spar, vying for the dumplings. Until there is only one
          left.
          
          Shifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po. He
          hides it underneath one of the bowls. He uses his chopsticks
          as weapons to smack Po's chopsticks away. He attacks Po with
          his bamboo staff.
          
          But Po skillfully manages to best Shifu for the final
          dumpling.
          
          Shifu smiles. Po has passed the final test.
          
          But then Po tosses the dumpling into Shifu's open hand.

          The Five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain

          Tai Lung appears at the other end of the bridge. He ROARS and
          races toward them.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Cut it!
          
          The others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the
          mountain. Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the
          final rope. But Tai Lung is too close -- Tigress must launch
          herself into him. The two cats end up in the middle of the
          bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below. The
          Five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Where's the Dragon Warrior?

                    How do you know you're not looking
                    at her?
          
          Tai Lung laughs. It echoes off the mountain walls.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You think I'm a fool? I know you're
                    not the Dragon Warrior. None of
                    you!
          
          The Five exchange quick, worried looks.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                        (nodding confidently)
                    I heard how he fell out of the sky
                    on a ball of fire, that he's a
                    warrior unlike anything the world
                    has ever seen.
          
          The Five exchange quick, confused looks.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Po?
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    So that is his name -- Po. Finally,
                    a worthy opponent. Our battle will
                    be legendary!
          
          Tigress charges at him. The battle begins. Tigress punches
          Tai Lung as he hangs from the bridge. But Tai Lung counters
          with a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through
          the bridge's wooden slats. Then Tigress gets choked by the
          bridge's ropes. Monkey turns to Crane and Viper.
          
                              MONKEY
                    We've got this. Help her!
          
                                                                     65.
          
          
          Viper grabs Tai Lung, which causes him to let go of the
          ropes. Tigress plummets down into the gorge... but Crane
          manages to catch her. Viper punches Tai Lung repeatedly with
          his own fist. Tai Lung manages to get a paw around Viper's
          "throat".
          
                              VIPER
                    Monkey!
          
          ANGLE ON MANTIS AND MONKEY. Mantis is straining to hold the
          rope by himself.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Go!
                        (then)
                    Ack! What was I thinking?!
          
          Monkey leaps into action, kicking Tai Lung in the chest and
          sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge. He gets
          back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single
          strand of rope.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Mantis!
          
          Mantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave
          shooting toward Tai Lung. The rope whips Tai Lung in the face
          and he gets tangled up. The Five see their chance.
          
                              TIGRESS (CONT'D)
                    Now!
          
          Working as a team, the Five kick Tai Lung's butt every which
          way. Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai
          Lung. He plummets down... down... disappearing into the mist.
          Mantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies
          safely to the mountain.
          
          The Five look relieved. But the relief is short-lived...
          
          Tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling
          the far mountain peak. Her eyes go wide with dread. The rope
          whips up. But Tai Lung isn't there.
          
          With a crash, he suddenly appears behind the Five.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Shifu taught you well...
          
          Tai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey, who instantly freezes.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    But he didn't teach you everything.
          
                                                                     66.
          
          
          Tai lung lunges toward the rest.
          
          
          EXT. TRAINING HALL - EVENING
          
          Shifu and Po walk through the palace courtyard. Po has an
          easy spring in his step.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You have done well, Panda.
          
                              PO
                    Done well? Done well?! I've done
                    awesome!
          
          He swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance.
          
          Shifu staggers back, regaining his dignity.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The mark of a true hero is
                    humility!
          
          After a moment's thought, though, he leans toward Po -
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    But yes...you have done awesome.
          
          And he punches him playfully on the arm. Po smiles at him. As
          they LAUGH, an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind
          them. IT'S CRANE!
          
          Crane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a
          heap.
          
                              PO
                    Huh? Guys? Guys!
          
          Po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    They're dead? No, they're
                    breathing! They're asleep?! No,
                    their eyes are open.
          
          Crane struggles to lift his head.
          
                              CRANE
                    We were no match for his nerve
                    attack.
          
          His head collapses to the ground.
          
                                                                  67.
          
          
                              SHIFU
                    He has gotten stronger.
          
                              PO
                    Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
          
          Shifu starts freeing the Five. First Viper, then Mantis, then
          Monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis -
          
                              MONKEY
                    He's too fast!
          
          He delivers a Kung Fu punch to Po's head and then slowly
          realizes where he is.
          
                                 MONKEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, Po.
          
          Shifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    I thought we could stop him.
          
                              SHIFU
                    He could have killed you.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Why didn't he?
          
                              SHIFU
                    So you could come back here and
                    strike fear into our hearts. But it
                    won't work!
          
                              PO
                    Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm
                    pretty scared.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You can defeat him, panda.
          
                              PO
                    Are you kidding? If they can't--
                    They're five masters. I'm just one
                    me.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But you will have the one thing
                    that no one else does.
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
          INT. SCROLL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          CLOSE-UP of the Dragon Scroll. Po stares at Shifu - then
          looks up at the Scroll. Then back at Shifu -
          
                              PO
                    You really believe I'm ready?
          
                              SHIFU
                    You are, Po.
          
          They look at each other. This is a big moment.
          
          Oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. As Po
          and The Five stand by, Shifu carries the staff over to the
          reflecting pool. Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still
          closed, he raises the staff up above his head. Po and the
          others watch, expectantly. The peach blossom petals rise in a
          flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. The gentle
          tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the
          Dragon Scroll. The petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's
          mouth and it falls. At the last second, Shifu reaches out
          with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. He turns
          to Po, holding it out.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is
                    yours.
          
                              PO
                    Wait, what happens when I read it?
          
                               SHIFU
                    No one knows, but legend says you
                    will be able to hear a butterfly's
                    wing-beat.
          
                              PO
                    Whoa! Really? That's cool.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Yes. And see light in the deepest
                    cave. You will feel the universe in
                    motion around you.
          
                              PO
                    Wow! Can I punch through walls?
                    Can I do a quadruple back flip?
                    Will I have invisibility--
          
                              SHIFU
                    Focus. Focus.
          
                                                                  69.
          
          
                              PO
                    Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Read it, Po, and fulfill your
                    destiny. Read it and become... the
                    Dragon Warrior!
          
                                PO
                    Whooaa!!!
          
          Po takes a deep breath. Then he grasps the tube and tries to
          pull the top off it. It doesn't budge. He strains at it.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    It's impossible to open.
          
          He strains again. He tries to bite it off...
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Come on baby. Come on now...
          
          Shifu SIGHS and holds out his hand. Po passes him the tube.
          Shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to Po.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Thank you. I probably loosened it
                    up for you though... Okay, here
                    goes.
          
          He glances at the Five. They look on in awe. Monkey gives him
          the `thumbs up.' Po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden
          light bathing his face. Across the scroll we see Shifu,
          excited that he is witness to history...
          
          On Po's face as he finishes opening the scroll.
          
          Then -
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
          
          Shifu looks concerned. The Five look concerned. Po looks
          utterly terrified.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    It's blank!
          
                                SHIFU
                    What?
          
                              PO
                    Here! Look!
          
                                                                 70.
          
          
          Po tries to show Shifu the scroll. Shifu covers his eyes and
          turns his head away.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No! I am forbidden to look upon--
          
          But he can't help himself. He takes a peek. Then he GRABS if
          off Po. He turns it around, then upside down. He closes it
          and opens it again, astonished.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Blank? I don't...I don't
                    understand.
          
          Shifu turns away, contemplative. What can this mean?
          
                              PO
                    Okay. So like, Oogway was just a
                    crazy old turtle after all?
          
                              SHIFU
                    No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
          
          Po sits heavily on the floor, dejected.
          
                              PO
                    Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me
                    by accident. Of course I'm not the
                    Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
          
          The Five don't argue.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    But who will stop Tai Lung?
          
                              CRANE
                    He'll destroy everything...and
                    everyone.
          
          Shifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it. He
          looks oddly calm as he turns around.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No, evacuate the Valley. You must
                    protect the villagers from Tai
                    Lung's rage.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    What about you master?
          
                              SHIFU
                    I will fight him.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
                              PO
                    What?
          
                              SHIFU
                    I can hold him off long enough for
                    everyone to escape.
          
                              PO
                    But Shifu, he'll kill you.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Then I will finally have paid for
                    my mistake.
          
          The Five and Po look devastated.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Listen to me, all of you. It is
                    time for you to continue your
                    journey without me. I am very proud
                    to have been your master.
          
          Shifu salutes them and turns away. Po is heartbroken. Crane
          steps forward and kindly puts a wing around Po, pulling away.
          
          Po resists for a moment, then lets the Five lead him off.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY
          
          The Five arrive at the base of the stairs.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    We've got to get them out safely.
          
          Monkey picks up a small child.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Come, little one. Let's find your
                    mama.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Viper, gather the southern farmers.
                    Mantis, the north. Crane, light the
                    way.
          
          They split up and begin helping the villagers evacuate. Po is
          left by himself.
          
          He makes his way through the bustling town.
          
                                                                     72.
          
          
                              JR SHAW
                        (skeptically)
                    Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
          
          Po approaches the Noodle Shop.
          
                                PO
                    Hey, Dad.
          
                                PO'S DAD
                    Po!
          
          Seeing Po, Po's Dad hurries over and wraps his arms around
          his son. Po bends down to reciprocate the hug, as Po's dad
          pulls away, having fastened an apron around Po's waist.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Good to have you back, son!
          
                              PO
                        (listlessly)
                    Good to be back.
          
          Po's Dad goes back to packing things up.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Let's go Po. So, for our next shop,
                    it's time to face it -- the future
                    of noodles is dice-cut vegetables,
                    no longer slices.
          
          Dad starts to walk off, unaware that Po isn't following.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Also, I was thinking, maybe this
                    time we'll have a kitchen you can
                    actually stand up in. Hmm? You like
                    that?
          
          He turns and notices that Po hasn't moved. He walks to Po
          sympathetically.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Po, I'm sorry things didn't work
                    out. It just... wasn't meant to be.
          
          Po slumps against the cart.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Po, forget everything else. Your
                    destiny still awaits. We are noodle
                    folk -- broth runs deep through our
                    veins.
          
                                                                  73.
          
          
                              PO
                    I don't know, Dad. Honestly,
                    sometimes I can't believe I'm
                    actually your son.
          
          Dad is taken aback.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Po, I think it's time I told you
                    something I should have told you a
                    long time ago...
          
                                PO
                    Okay.
          
          Dad pauses dramatically.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    The secret ingredient of my secret
                    ingredient soup!
          
          Po feigns excitement.
          
                                PO
                    Oh.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    C'mere! The secret ingredient is...
                    nothing!
          
                                PO
                    Huh?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    You heard me. Nothing. There is no
                    secret ingredient!
          
                              PO
                    Wait wait...it's just plain old
                    noodle soup? You don't add some
                    kind of special sauce or something?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Don't have to. To make something
                    special, you just have to believe
                    it's special.
          
          Po looks at his father with dawning realization. He picks up
          the Scroll.
          
          For a moment, Po stares at his reflection on the scroll, then
          he smiles serenely. He gets it now.
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
                              PO
                    There is no secret ingredient...
          
          Po turns back to look at the palace.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - DAWN
          
          At the top of the stairs, Shifu looks upon the Valley,
          awaiting his fate. With a gust of wind, Tai Lung appears
          before him.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    I have come home, Master.
          
                              SHIFU
                    This is no longer your home. And I
                    am no longer your master.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Yes. You have a new favorite. So
                    where is this...Po? Did I scare him
                    off?
          
                              SHIFU
                    This battle is between you and me.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    So. That is how it's going to be?
          
                              SHIFU
                    That is how it must be.
          
          They fight. At last. Tai Lung punches Shifu clean through the
          doors of the Jade Palace.
          
          Tai Lung enters.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    I rotted in jail for twenty years
                    because of your weakness!
          
                              SHIFU
                    Obeying your master is not
                    weakness!
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!
                    You always knew...
          
          Dissolve to FLASHBACK.
          
                                                                    75.
          
          
          A young Tai Lung looks expectant. Oogway shakes his head.
          
                              TAI LUNG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But when Oogway said otherwise,
                    what did you do? What did you do?!
          
          Tai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past
          dissolves into the present.
          
                                 TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    NOTHING!
          
          Shifu takes a Kung Fu stance.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You were not meant to be the Dragon
                    Warrior! That was not my fault!
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    NOT YOUR FAULT?!
          
          Enraged, Tai Lung knocks over the Kung Fu artifacts and
          throws them at Shifu.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    WHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS?!
                    WHO DROVE ME TO TRAIN UNTIL MY
                    BONES CRACKED?! WHO DENIED ME MY
                    DESTINY?!
          
          Shifu dodges each attack.
          
                              SHIFU
                    It was never my decision to make!
          
          Tai Lung pulls Oogway's staff from the shrine.
          
                                 TAI LUNG
                    It is now.
          
          They fight. Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    Give me the scroll!
          
                              SHIFU
                    I would rather die.
          
          They struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters
          into a hundred pieces. Shifu looks back at the pieces and a
          flutter of peach tree petals fly by. Caught off guard, Shifu
          gets kicked by Tai Lung into a column.
          
                                                                   76.
          
          
          Shifu climbs the column to the rafters. Tai Lung follows and
          sends them both crashing through the roof.
          
          Lightning flash.
          
          Grappling in mid-air, Tai Lung gets his hands around Shifu's
          throat as they crash back through the roof.
          
          They kick apart. Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard.
          Tai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the
          floor. Flames go everywhere. Tai Lung's arms are aflame as he
          charges at Shifu.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    All I ever did, I did to make you
                    proud! Tell me how proud you are,
                    Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!
          
          THOOM! A fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor
          and crashing against the reflecting pool. The flames
          extinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (weakly)
                    I have always been proud of you.
                    From the first moment, I've been
                    proud of you. And it was my pride
                    that blinded me. I loved you too
                    much to see what you were becoming.
                    What I was turning you into. I'm...
                    sorry.
          
          Tai Lung stops in his tracks. Shifu waits. Tai Lung's
          expression goes cold. He grabs Shifu by the throat.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    I don't want your apology. I want
                    my scroll!
          
          He holds Shifu up to the ceiling. Looking up, Tai Lung
          bristles when he sees the scroll is missing.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    WHAT? WHERE IS IT?!
          
          Tai Lung slams Shifu to the floor.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (weakly)
                    Dragon Warrior has taken scroll
                    halfway across China by now. You
                    will never see that scroll, Tai
                    Lung. Never. Never...
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
          Tai Lung is furious. He roars, ready to strike Shifu.
          Suddenly...
          
                               PO (O.S.)
                    Hey!
          
          Tai Lung turns around to find Po standing in the doorway.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                        (out of breath)
                    Stairs...
          
          Tai Lung casts Shifu aside.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Who are you?
          
                              PO
                    Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
                        (exhales hard)
                    Huhhh...
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You?! Him?!
                        (to Shifu)
                    He's a panda.
                        (back to Po)
                    You're a panda. What are you gonna
                    do, big guy? Sit on me?
          
                              PO
                    Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna
                    use this. You want it? Come and get
                    it.
          
          Po shows him the Dragon Scroll.
          
          From out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across
          the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    Finally!
          
          Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung,
          sending him flying into a column. Po puts on a brave face and
          strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges. Po turns to
          run.
          
          Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace
          steps.
          
          Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends
          him crashing onto the theater rooftops below.
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
          Po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and
          smash Tai Lung. He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes
          right back at Po.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    That scroll is mine!
          
          Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the
          scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down
          stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down
          on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the
          scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po
          snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies
          towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it,
          but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart
          which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the
          noodle.
          
          Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees
          and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the
          street.
          
          As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array
          of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around
          to hide the scroll.
          
                                 PO
                    Lightning!
          
          Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po
          uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes
          out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll
          rolls down the steps towards the river.
          
          Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases
          down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the
          fireworks-filled sky.
          
          Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The
          scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an
          ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who
          sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie-
          vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is
          shocked.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    The scroll has given him power.
                        (then)
                    NOOO0!!
          
          He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting
          shockwave collapses the building.
          
                                                                    79.
          
          
          Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach
          the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and
          unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the
          ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating
          punch.
          
          As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the
          impact crater.
          
                                TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                          (out of breath)
                      Finally... oh yes... the power of
                      the Dragon Scroll... is mine!
          
          Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls.
          
                                TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                      It's NOTHING!!
          
          Po stirs.
          
                                PO
                      It's okay. I didn't get it the
                      first time either.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                          (disbelief)
                      What?
          
          Po gets to his feet.
          
                                PO
                      There is no secret ingredient. It's
                      just you.
          
          Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.
          
                                   TAI LUNG
                      RRRAAAH!
          
                                   PO
                      AAAAGGGHH!
          
          Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling.
          
                                PO (CONT'D)
                      Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee!
                      Don't! Don't!
          
          Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he
          delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly.
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
          The shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms
          come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing
          back into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what
          he just did.
          
          Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po
          strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even
          getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai
          Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai
          Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po
          prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY!
          He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until
          finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the
          ground.
          
          Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                          (heavy breathing)
                      You... can't defeat me. You're just
                      a big, fat panda!
          
          SCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide.
          
                                PO
                      I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the
                      big, fat panda.
          
          Po's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                      The Wuxi Finger Hold!
          
                                PO
                      Oh, you know this hold?
          
                                TAI LUNG
                      You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
                      Shifu didn't teach you that.
          
                                PO
                      Nope. I figured it out.
          
          He flexes his pinky...
          
                                  PO (CONT'D)
                      Skadoosh!
          
          KA-THOOM!
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY OF PEACE
          
          A mushroom cloud appears over the Valley, sweeping past the
          Furious Five and the fleeing villagers.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER
          
          Villagers emerge from hiding. Po walks out from the mist
          looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.
          
                              KG SHAW
                    Look! The Dragon Warrior.
          
          As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and
          his scarf is a torn apron.
          
          Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the
          crowd.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    That's my boy. That big, lovely
                    kung fu warrior is my son!
          
                              PO
                    Thanks, Dad.
          
          Po hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the
          ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest
          of the Five are with him. Po takes notice.
          
                                 PO (CONT'D)
                    Hey, guys.
          
                                 TIGRESS
                    Master.
          
          Tigress bows deeply. The others follow.
          
                                 FURIOUS FIVE
                    Master.
          
                              PO
                        (modest)
                    Master?
                        (then, remembering)
                    Master Shifu!
          
          Po races toward the Jade Palace. He climbs the steps. Then
          more steps.
          
                                                                  82.
          
          
          INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace. Shifu is still
          lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. Po rushes to his
          side.
          
                              PO
                    Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
          
          Shifu weakly opens his eyes.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Po! You're alive!
                        (then, darkly)
                    Or we're both dead.
          
                              PO
                    No, Master, I didn't die. I
                    defeated Tai Lung!
          
                                SHIFU
                    You did?!
          
          Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Wow. It is as Oogway foretold --
                    You are the Dragon Warrior. You
                    have brought peace to this Valley.
                    And to me. Thank you. Thank you,
                    Po. Thank you...
          
          Shifu closes his eyes. He is still. Po starts freaking out.
          
                              PO
                    No! Master! No No No! Don't die,
                    Shifu. Please...
          
                              SHIFU
                        (eyes snapping open)
                    I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah,
                    Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at
                    peace. Finally.
          
                              PO
                    Oh. So, um, I should...stop
                    talking?
          
                              SHIFU
                    If you can.
          
          Po nods reverently as Shifu closes his eyes again. Master and
          pupil lie next to each other. The camera pulls up and back
          away from them. Po tries to remain still, but it's hard.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          He's about to say something, but he stops himself. He fidgets
          for a beat, then can't control himself any longer.
          
                              PO
                    Want to get something to eat?
          
                              SHIFU
                        (sighs)
                    Yeah.
          
                                                          IRIS OUT.

          FADE IN:
          
          
          1 EXT. RAIN FOREST, OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK, WASHINGTON - DAWN 
          
          Moss-draped. Shadow-drenched. Tortured tree trunks twist 
          upward, reaching for rare sunlight. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.)
          I'd never given much thought to how I would die..
          
          Suddenly, every creature in the forest is deadly silent. Neither 
          bird, beast nor insect make a noise. A predator is near. 
          
          Then, in the distance, hear a tiny SNICK - a twig snapping. 
          Abruptly, we're on the move. Fast.
          
          
          UNKNOWN POV - MOVING
          
          Trees start whipping past us at a dizzying speed, branches 
          are dodged with preternatural agility. And we're speeding
          up, chasing something. It's exhilarating. Terrifying. 
          Finally, up ahead, we get the first glimpse of our prey -

          A DEER
          
          
          -- running for its life as it darts through this maze of 
          a forest. It sprints forward, but we gain on it. Beyond the deer, 
          SEE the forest's edge ahead, white sunlight glowing against the
          trees. The buck races for the light. We're just behind it, 
          about to emerge from the shadowy darkness -
          -
          
          
          The deer LEAPS into the light in a high arc, hovering (suddenly 
          SLOW MOTION) against the WHITE GLARE of the sun... then BAM! 
          
          
          The deer abruptly plummets out of frame at an unnatural angle, 
          leaving the WHITE GLARE to fill the screen. HOLD ON WHITENESS

          BELLA (V.O.)
          
          
          But dying in the place of someone I
          love seems like a good way to go..
          . 
          
          
          -- Then into the WHITENESS steps the face of -
          
          
          2 ISABELLA SWAN, 172
          
          
          Eyes closed against the sunlight, absorbing its rays. Long, 
          dark hair frames alabaster skin. She's a vulnerable,
          introverted, imperfect beauty.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.)
          
          ... So I can't bring myself to 
          regret the decision that brought me 
          here to die... 
          
          
          The background comes into focus as we realize we're now in -

          EXT. SCOTTSDALE, AZ - DAY
          
          
          Bella stands at the end of a cul-de-sac on the desert's edge.
          The sun blazes behind her -- she bends down and carefully 
          scoops a tiny BARREL CACTUS into a clay pot. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.)
          
          ... The decision to leave home.
          
          She stares at the cactus in a state of reverie, until

          Bye, Bella!
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - McMansion ACROSS THE STREET 
          
          
          Three tanned, athletic, blonde GIRLS hop into a convertible 
          Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts 
          with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave.
          
          
          BLONDE #
          Good luck at your new school! 
          
          
          They ADLIB superficial good wishes, "Don't forget to write;"
          
          "We'll miss you." Bella waves back, sweetly, but 
          halfheartedly as she steps off the curb.
          
          
          BELLA
          Have a good..
          
          --and trips. When she rights herself, they're already gone.
          
          
          BELLA
          ... life. 
          
          
          Clearly, not close friends. Bella's grown-up demeanor and
          innate intelligence become apparent as -
          -
          
          
          BELLA'S MOTHER, RENE, mid 30's --exits their house --it's
          low rent for this ritzy neighborhood. Rene is eclectic, 
          scattered, anxious, more best friend than parent. She 
          thrusts a cell phone at Bella. 
          
          
          RENE
          It won't work again, baby. 
          
          
          BELLA
          You put it on hold. 
          
          
          RENE
          I did? 
          
          
          BELLA
          Look. You also called Mexico.
          
          
          Rene pushes her playfully, they laugh.
          
          
          
          3.
          RENE
          I'll figure it out. You gotta be able 
          to reach me and Phil on the road - 
          I 
          love saying that - on the road.
          
          
          BELLA
          Very romantic.
          
          
          PHIL, 31, good looking with an athlete's body, exits the
          house, carrying Bella's three suitcases with ease. 
          
          
          PHIL
          If you call crappy motels, backwater 
          towns and ballpark hot dogs romantic.
          
          
          He puts his Phoenix Desert Dogs baseball hat on Rene's head with 
          a
          kiss. Phil's love of Rene reassures Bella. Phil heads to the old
          station wagon to load the luggage, while Rene slips her arm 
          through Bella's, clinging to her as they walk to car.
          
          
          RENE
          Now, you know if you change your 
          mind, I'll race back here from 
          wherever the game is. 
          
          
          But Rene's strained expression tells us what a great 
          sacrifice that would be. Bella forces a smile.
          
          
          BELLA
          I won't change my mind, mom.
          
          
          RENE
          You might. You've always hated Forks. 
          
          
          BELLA
          It's not about Forks, it's about 
          Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we 
          barely know each other. 
          
          
          (off Rene's still worried 
          look)
          Mom, I want to go. I'll be fine.
          
          
          But as Rene hugs Bella, we see the truth on BELLA'S FACE 
          dread, doubt, regret. Off Bella, struggling to keep her 
          facade up as she climbs into the back seat of the car..

          Bella, IPOD earbuds in her ears, gets a last glimpse of the 
          sparkling malls, chic shoppers, manicured cactus gardens..
          .

          4 EXT. ABOVE SCOTTSDALE (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY 
          4
          
          
          The McMansions get smaller as we SWEEP OVER the scorched 
          landscape, baking under a hot sun. Beyond the housing 
          developments SEE the rocky, dry desert, extending for miles..
          . 
          
          
          Rise HIGHER, and higher still, until finally we're suspended
          within the bright, perfect, blue SKY, with only an occasional 
          cloud..
          . 
          
          
          Slowly, the clouds start getting more numerous, thicker, darker..
          . 
          until we're completely immersed in them... the sun disappearing.
          Finally, we EMERGE from the clouds to find below

          5 EXT. WASHINGTON STATE - OLYMPIC PENINSULA (AERIAL SHOT)- DAY5
          
          
          Nothing but deep, dark, green forests for miles. SWEEP DOWN, 
          finding the eerily dramatic Lake Crescent. Over it all hangs 
          the mist from the ever-present cloudy grey sky. Everything 
          is wet and green and drenched in shade..

          6 INT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY - WAITING AT LIGHT 
          6
          
          
          Bella sits next to her uniformed father, police chief CHARLIE 
          SWAN, 40's. Taciturn, introverted like Bella. Their strained 
          silence contrasts Bella's relationship with her mother. Beat.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Your hair's longer.
          
          
          BELLA
          I cut it since last time I saw you. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Guess it grew out again.
          
          
          She just nods. Silence.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          How's your mom?
          
          
          BELLA
          Good. 
          
          
          More silence. Yikes. They pass a SIGN: �The City Of Forks
          Welcomes You - Pop. 3246.� Bella sighs.

          7
          
          
          As the cruiser drives through, Bella takes in this logging town 
          -
          every storefront has a wood carving. The Timber Museum's sign is
          two loggers sawing a stump. The POLICE STATION is a small wooden 
          building across from City Hall..

          8 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
          8
          
          
          The cruiser pulls up to the old two-story house. A woodshed full 
          of firewood. There's a small boat in the garage, fishing gear, an
          old buoy. Bella climbs out... home.
          
          
          9 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
          9
          
          
          Bella and Charlie carry in her bags. The house isn't stylish
          (the only new thing here is a Flat Screen T.V.), but it's
          comfortable, lived-in. Lots of fishing memorabilia; photos 
          of Charlie fishing with Quileute Indian BILLY BLACK. 
          
          
          Handmade cards to �Daddy� and photos of Bella. She winces at
          herself, age 7, in a tutu, sitting stubbornly on the ground. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          
          
          I put Grandpa's old desk in your 
          
          
          room. And I cleared some shelves 
          
          
          in the bathroom. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (grimacing)
          That's right. One bathroom.
          
          
          Bella's eye lands on a PHOTO of a much younger Charlie and
          Rene, on vacation, beaming with love. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I'll just put these up in your room 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          I can do it 
          -
          
          
          They both reach for the bags, bumping one another awkwardly. 
          Bella backs off, letting Charlie carry the bags upstairs.
          
          
          10 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - DAY 10
          
          
          An antique rolltop desk sits in a corner. The room is filled with 
          childhood remnants that have seen better days. As she unpacks her 
          CD case, loneliness finally overwhelms her. She sits heavily on 
          the edge of the bed, tears threatening..
          . 
          
          
          Then we hear a HONK outside. Bella runs across the hall and looks 
          out the window to see 
          -
          
          
          11 OUTSIDE - A FADED RED TRUCK, CIRCA 1960 pulls up... 11
          
          
          
          6.
          EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          
          Bella exits to find Charlie greeting the driver, JACOB BLACK, 
          16, Quileute Indian, amiable with long black hair, and hints of 
          childish roundness in his face. The two of them help Jacob's
          father, BILLY BLACK (from the photos), into a wheelchair. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella, you remember Billy Black. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Glad you're finally here. Charlie 
          hasn't shut up about it since you 
          told him you were coming. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you 
          down the hill. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Right after I ram you in the ankles.
          
          
          Billy takes several rolls at Charlie, who dodges. Jacob shakes 
          his head at their two fathers as he shyly approaches Bella.
          
          
          JACOB
          I'm Jacob. We made mud pies 
          together when we were little kids. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Yeah... I think I remember..
          .
          (re: the dads)
          Are they always like this?
          
          
          JACOB
          It's getting worse with old age.
          
          
          Charlie then pats the hood of the truck, addressing Bella 
          -
          
          
          CHARLIE
          So what do you think of your 
          homecoming gift?
          
          
          BELLA
          No way. The truck is for me?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Just bought it off Billy, here. 
          
          
          JACOB
          I rebuilt the engine and -
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          It's perfect!
          
          
          
          7.
          She beams. It's the first genuine smile we've seen on her.
          She rushes to the truck. Jacob eagerly joins her. 
          
          
          JACOB
          Okay, so you gotta double pump the 
          clutch when you shift, but -
          -
          
          
          He hands her the keys as she climbs in.
          
          
          BELLA
          Maybe I can give you a ride to school.
          
          
          JACOB
          I go to school on the reservation.
          
          
          BELLA
          Too bad. Would've been nice to 
          know at least one person.

          eyes are on her as she climbs out of her truck and steps in 
          a

          appears in her path. 
          
          
          ERIC
          You're Isabella Swan, the new girl. Hi. 
          I'm Eric. The eyes and ears of this 
          place. Anything you need. Tour guide, 
          lunch date, shoulder to cry on.
          
          
          Bella just looks at him. Is he for real?
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm kind of the �suffer in silence� type.
          
          
          ERIC
          Good headline for your feature 
          -
          I'm on the paper, and you're news, 
          baby, front page.
          
          
          
          8.
          BELLA
          I -- no, I'm not news -- I'm, seriously, 
          not at all 
          -
          
          
          ERIC
          Whoa, chillax. No feature.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (relieved)
          Would you mind just pointing me 
          toward Mr. Varner's class?
          
          
          He leads her away, enjoying the attentive stares, as she cringes 
          from them 
          -
          
          
          ERIC
          You've missed a lot of the semester, 
          but I can hook you up - tutor, cliff 
          notes, medical excuse..

          INT. GYM - DAY 14
          
          
          The boys' basketball team runs drills on half the basketball
          court. A girls' volleyball game occupies the other half.
          
          
          Bella, in gym clothes, avoids the volleyball like it's
          radioactive. An energetic, athletic team captain, JESSICA, 
          motivates the players.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Block it, Chloe! Yeah! Good attack! 
          
          
          Unfortunately, the volleyball heads toward Bella. She closes 
          her eyes and flails at it, SMACKING it. It flies off court 
          -
          
          
          -- and beans a basketball player in the head. He is MIKE 
          NEWTON, good looking, affable, with blond spiky hair. 
          
          
          MIKE 
          Ow!
          
          
          BELLA
          (hurries to him, 
          
          
          embarrassed)
          Are you alright? I warned them not 
          to make me play.
          
          
          MIKE
          It's only a flesh wound.
          
          
          Mike grins and she smiles, relieved. A BELL RINGS, class over. 
          
          
          MIKE
          You're Isabella, right? 
          
          
          
          9.
          BELLA
          Just Bella. 
          
          
          MIKE
          I'm Mike. Newton.
          
          
          He looks at her a second too long, clearly taken by her -
          -
          Suddenly, Jessica appears, stepping between them. Subtle, 
          but possessive as she nudges Mike.
          
          
          JESSICA
          She's got a great spike, doesn't 
          she? 
          
          
          (to Bella)
          So, you're from Arizona, right? 
          Aren't people supposed to be tan 
          down there?
          
          
          BELLA
          That's why they kicked me out.
          
          
          Mike laughs, and because he does, Jessica does. Bella just 
          feels uncomfortable with the attention..
          .
          
          
          15 INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 15
          
          
          FOLLOW Bella, Mike and Jessica as they carry their trays to 
          a 
          table. Eric appears, and squishes into a seat next to Bella. 
          
          
          ERIC
          Mike, you met my home girl Bella. 
          
          
          MIKE
          Your home girl?
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
           (to Bella)
          It's first grade all over again, 
          and you're the shiny new toy.
          
          
          Bella smiles awkwardly. Suddenly, a FLASHBULB blinds Bella. 
          She looks up at the photographer, ANGELA, Jessica's sweet, 
          low key, insecure friend. 
          
          
          ANGELA
          Sorry, needed a candid for the feature 
          -
          
          
          ERIC
          Feature's dead, Angela. Don't bring it 
          up again.
          
          
          (to Bella)
          I got your back, baby.
          
          
          
          10.
          ANGELA
          
          
          (disappointed)
          Guess we'll just run another editorial on 
          teen drinking. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Sorry. There's always eating disorders, 
          or Speedo padding on the swim team 
          -
          
          
          ANGELA
          -- Wait, that's a good one..
          .
          
          
          But Bella's attention is now riveted to 
          -
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - THE DOUBLE DOORS OF THE CAFETERIA 
          
          
          They swing open as four of the most astounding people Bella's
          ever seen enter (IN SLOW MOTION): THE CULLENS. Two guys, two 
          girls, all chalky pale, purplish shadows under their eyes..
          . 
          and all devastatingly beautiful. 
          
          
          They move through the room with effortless grace, and take a seat 
          at a table furthest from Bella's. Bella leans over to Jessica and
          Angela.
          
          
          BELLA
          Who are they?
          
          
          ANGELA
          The Cullens. 
          
          
          Jessica leans in, swinging into gossip mode.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Doctor and Mrs. Cullen's foster 
          kids. They all moved down here 
          from Alaska two years ago. 
          
          
          ANGELA
          They kinda keep to themselves.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Because they're all together. 
          Like, together together. The 
          blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big 
          dark-haired guy, Emmett..
          .
          
          
          ON ROSALIE, 18, long blonde hair, model beautiful, knows it. 
          Alongside her is EMMETT, 17, big, brawny, like a weight 
          lifter, but a playful glint in his eye. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          ... they're a thing. I'm not even
          sure that's legal.
          
          
          
          11.
          ANGELA
          Jess, they're not actually related. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          But they live together. And the 
          little dark haired girl, Alice, 
          she's really weird..
          . 
          
          
          ON ALICE, 17, pixie-like, rail thin, light on her feet with short, 
          black hair going in every direction. She hovers over, JASPER, 18, 
          honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured.
          
          
          JESSICA
          ... she's with Jasper, the blonde 
          who looks like he's in pain. 
          I 
          mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster 
          dad slash match maker. 
          
          
          ANGELA
          Maybe he'll adopt me.
          
          
          Bella laughs, liking her... then sees the last Cullen to enter 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD, 17. Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair. He seems 
          inwardly turned, mysterious. More boyish than the others. But 
          the most striking of all. Bella can't take her eyes off him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Who's he?
          
          
          JESSICA
          That's Edward Cullen.
          
          
          Suddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from 
          across the room. His eyes meet Bella's. But he seems..
          . 
          confused. Bella quickly looks away. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          He's totally gorgeous, obviously. 
          But apparently, no one here is good 
          enough for him. Like I care. 
          
          
          (she obviously does)
          Anyway, don't waste your time. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I wasn't planning on it.
          
          
          But Bella can't help but peek at Edward again. He's staring
          at her outright now, with a slightly frustrated expression 
          that unnerves Bella. She hides behind her hair.
          
          
          16 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY 16
          
          
          A room of black-topped lab tables. Two to a table. Bella 
          and Mike enter. 
          
          
          
          12.
          Mike takes his seat and points her toward MR. MOLINA, 
          Birkenstocked, enthusiastic science teacher at the head of 
          the class. As Bella moves to the teacher with her class 
          slip, she notes 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD -- his back to her, sitting at a front table. But as 
          she passes Edward's table..
          .
          
          
          SLOW MOTION -- the breeze she creates when she passes lifts 
          a 
          piece of paper next to Edward. We're still on his back as he
          inhales --then abruptly stiffens. He grabs onto the edge of 
          the table, crumbling it slightly. No one notices. 
          
          
          Mr. Molina takes Bella's class slip. 
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          Welcome, Ms. Swan. Follow along as 
          best you can till you get caught 
          up. 
          
          
          Mr. Molina gestures to the only empty seat... next to Edward. 
          But as Bella approaches, she's taken aback when 
          -
          
          
          ON EDWARD'S FACE -he slowly looks up at her, his eyes coal
          black with repulsion, fury. If looks could literally kill..
          .
          
          
          Bella knocks someone's book bag off their chair. Replaces it,
          mumbling an apology. Then slinks reluctantly into her seat. 
          Edward jerks away from her to the extreme edge of his chair. 
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          
          
          (to the class, animated)
          
          
          Today we'll be observing the behavior 
          
          
          of planaria, a.k.a flatworms.
          
          
          As Mr. Molina distributes two petri dishes per table 
          -
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          We're going to cut them in half, 
          then watch them regenerate into two 
          separate worms..
          . 
          
          
          Bella glances at Edward who averts his face, holding a hand over 
          his nose as if he smells something horrible. 
          
          
          Bella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, smells nothing. 
          Then she sniffs her hair. It's fine. She's perplexed. Mr.
          Molina hands Edward two petri dishes.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          ... Yes, folks, zombie worms! They 
          just won't die.
          
          
          Edward takes a dish, then slides the second one across the 
          table to Bella as if she had Ebola. She takes her dish, and 
          makes a dark curtain of her hair between them. 
          
          
          
          13.
          She can see EDWARD'S HANDS under the table. Clenched into
          fists. Off Bella, utterly baffled, and deeply insecure..
          .
          
          
          17 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 17
          
          
          -- as the BELL RINGS, Edward bolts out the door. Other kids 
          and Bella exit a moment later. Bella looks down the hall; 
          he's gone. 
          
          
          18 INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY 18
          
          
          Bella enters, but nearly turns and leaves when she sees 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD sweet-talking the enchanted female ADMINISTRATOR, 
          40's. He doesn't see Bella enter.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          There must be something open sixth 
          
          
          period. Physics? Biochem?
          
          
          ADMINISTRATOR
          
          
          No, every class is full. I'm 
          
          
          afraid you'll have to stay in 
          
          
          biology. I'm so sorry. 
          
          
          Bella blanches. The Administrator sees her and gestures for 
          her to wait a minute. 
          
          
          But Edward suddenly straightens as if sensing Bella. He slowly 
          turns to glare at her with piercing, hate-filled eyes. She backs 
          to the wall, hugging herself, suddenly chilled... with fear. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          (to the Administrator)
          I'll just... endure it. 
          
          
          He strides out the door. Off Bella..
          . 
          
          
          19 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 19
          
          
          Edward climbs into a shiny new silver Volvo with the Cullens,
          while Bella, upset, hurries to her truck. The many eyes still 
          watching her add insult to injury. ... Finally, she reaches 
          -
          
          
          20 INT. BELLA'S TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) 20
          
          
          -- and closes the door. Her eyes well... but she fights it, 
          getting mad. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Jerk.
          
          
          As she tries to start the car, choking the engine, we begin to 
          hear a MAN'S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH

          --He's crouched in a dark corner. But then he sees a SHADOW
          move blindingly fast past him. He jerks around, then another 
          SHADOW flies past, too fast to follow. He BOLTS!
          
          
          He runs up a flight of stairs, harsh lights from the exterior of 
          the mill striating him. He moves as fast as humanly possible

          UNKNOWN POV charges after him at an INHUMAN SPEED through this 
          maze of pillars and walkways. We dodge skull-crushing beams, 
          LEAP from one floor up to the next, up ladders, scaffolding, 
          beams, up, and up, getting closer and closer to

          -- The guard BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his 
          footing and TRIPS, breaking through the rail and pitching 
          over the side, into the air 
          -
          
          
          -- and stops, hovering mid-air, a yard from the landing. 
          A 
          HAND grips his shirt, then YANKS him out of the air and out 
          of frame with incredible strength. His guttural SCREAM is 
          choked short as BLOOD SPRAYS THE LANDING..

          ON A TOP SIRLOIN STEAK as it is set in front of Charlie. He 
          shares a table with Bella. INCLUDE the waitress, CORA, 30's.
          She beams at Bella as she sets a plate of cod in front of her.
          
          
          Several LOGGERS at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles. She 
          shrinks in her seat at the attention. Charlie's oblivious.
          
          
          CORA
          
          
          Can't get over how grown up you 
          
          
          are. And so gorgeous. 
          
          
          Bella glances at Charlie, who keeps his eyes on his steak. 
          A 
          bearded, hippy logger, WAYLON FORGE, 50, appears behind Cora, 
          leaning over her shoulder to Bella

          WAYLON
          �Member me, honey? I was Santa one year.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas 
          here since she was four.
          
          
          WAYLON
          Bet I made an impression, though. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You always do. 
          
          
          CORA
          Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon. 
          
          
          (to Bella)
          When you're done, I'll bring your 
          favorite - berry cobbler. Remember? 
          Your dad still has it. Every Thursday.
          
          
          BELLA
          (doesn't remember at
          all)
          That'd be great, thank you.
          
          
          Cora shoos Waylon away. Left alone now, Charlie and Bella 
          both reach for the salt, knock hands. Charlie goes for the 
          ketchup instead. Silence as they eat. 
          
          
          A burst of LAUGHTER from a nearby happy FAMILY only serves to 
          emphasize their discomfort. Bella tries to bridge the gap.
          
          
          BELLA
          So... you eat here every night?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Easier than washing dishes.
          
          
          BELLA
          I can cook.
          
          
          He looks up, as if confused by the concept.
          
          
          BELLA
          I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. 
          Mom's not great in the kitchen.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I remember..
          . 
          
          
          They both laugh -- recalling an especially bad dinner. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          How was school? Meet anyone?
          
          
          
          16.
          BELLA
          A few people... Do you know the 
          Cullen family?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          (looks up sharply)
          Are people talking about them again?
          
          
          BELLA
          No... well, a little.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Just �cause they're newcomers. We're 
          lucky to have a surgeon like Dr. 
          Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky 
          his wife wanted to live in a small 
          town. Lucky his kids aren't like 
          a 
          lot of the hell-raisers around here.
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Okay.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I just don't like narrow
          mindedness. 
          
          
          And he returns to his food. Silence.

          26 EXT. GAS STATION/GARAGE - NIGHT 26
          
          
          Rene talks on a pay phone, her dead cell phone in her hand. 
          In the b.g., Phil and an Attendant work on the Subaru engine. 
          
          
          RENE
          Ok, I didn't lose my power cord. It 
          ran away. Screaming. I literally 
          repel technology now.
          
          
          
          17.
          Bella smiles, missing her mom. Rene feeds the phone 
          quarters. 
          
          
          RENE
          
          
          Now, tell me more about your 
          
          
          school, baby. What are the kids 
          
          
          like? Are there any cute guys?

          eyes are on the arriving kids, and the parking lot as they pull 
          in. She's waiting for Edward.
          
          
          Jessica, Angela, Mike and Eric kick around a soccerball 
          nearby. They wave Bella to join them but she smiles, 
          declining... and returns to watching for Edward. Her face 
          tells us she's ready for a confrontation.

          Bella sits with Jessica and Angela who watch a YouTube video 
          on their phone. Bella gives it a cursory look, but is 
          focused on the Cullen table --only four of them. Edward's
          seat is empty..

          Bella washes her hands, then looks up at the mirror, startled to 
          find Rosalie and Alice behind her. They study Bella, Rosalie 
          with chillingly cold eyes, Alice with curiosity. Bella, uneasy, 
          hurries out.

          18.
          She now only glances at Rosalie's car, a red M3 BMW, as it drives
          past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward. Bella returns to 
          her friends, finally forgetting about him..

          32 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 32
          It's neater, rearranged more attractively. Clearly, Bella's
          given it her touch. She sweeps through, folding Charlie's
          fleece jacket, straightening up. She grabs her book bag 
          -
          BELLA
          Dad, I'm heading out.
          33 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - MORNING 33
          ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay
          filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of
          puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight.
          BELLA
          Great. 
          WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her 
          truck. 
          BELLA
          Dad, I can drive myself to school.
          
          
          As she walks down the steps, she doesn't realize, something's 
          watching her -
          -
          UNKNOWN POV - FROM THE TREES 
          --tracking Bella's every move as she slips and falls on 
          a
          
          
          patch of ice -
          -
          BACK ON BELLA - fallen on her ass. Charlie climbs out of the 
          truck, helps her up. 
          CHARLIE
          You okay, Bells?
          BELLA
          Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          That's why I got you new tires. 
          She looks over at the truck -- yep, four new tires.
          CHARLIE
          
          
          The other ones were nearly bald. 
          
          
          
          19.
          BELLA
          You got me new tires. No one's 
          ever done that before.
          
          
          Charlie looks at her, confused.
          
          
          BELLA
          I mean... nothing.
          
          
          He clearly doesn't get it as heads toward his Cruiser.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I'll be late for dinner. I'm heading 
          down to Mason County. A security guard 
          at the Grisham Mill got killed by some 
          kind of animal..

          BELLA
          An animal?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You're not in Phoenix any more, 
          honey. They've been hunting it for 
          a week with no luck. Thought I'd 
          lend a hand.
          
          
          BELLA
          Be careful.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Always am.

          BELLA
          And thank you. For the tires.
          
          
          He sees emotion in her eyes. Doesn't understand it, but nods,
          heads inside. Bella looks at the tires again, oddly moved..

          Rain beats on the roof as Eric walks Bella into class. She 
          brushes water off her coat as he chats her up.
          
          
          ERIC
          ... and yeah, prom committee is 
          a 
          chick thing, but I gotta cover it 
          for the paper anyway, and they need 
          a guy to help choose the music -
          -
          So I need your play list 
          -
          
          
          
          20.
          Bella is about to respond when Mike comes up behind her.
          
          
          MIKE
          Come on, Arizona. Give it up for 
          the rain.
          
          
          And he shakes his wet baseball cap onto Bella's head.
          
          
          BELLA
          Terrific. 
          
          
          She heads toward her seat, brushing off her hair. But she 
          freezes when she sees --Edward. 
          
          
          Bella straightens, girding herself. Then strides to the 
          table, and confidently drops her books down, ready to address 
          him. But he looks up at her 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          Hello.
          
          
          Bella stops. Stunned. He is direct, precise, as if every 
          word is an effort for him. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I didn't have a chance to introduce 
          myself last week. My name is 
          Edward Cullen. 
          
          
          She's too shocked that he's talking to her to answer.
          
          
          EDWARD

          ... You're Bella.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm... yes. 
          
          
          Feeling like an idiot, she quickly sits. He abruptly moves to 
          the extreme edge of his seat. She's even more baffled now.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          
          
          (to the class)
          Onion root tip cells! That's 
          what's on your slides. Separate 
          and label them into the phases of 
          mitosis. The first partners to get 
          it right, win... the golden onion! 
          
          
          He excitedly holds up a spray painted onion. Everyone just 
          looks at him. He's disappointed by their apathy.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          Come on, people. Tick tock.
          
          
          
          21.
          Everyone sets to work. Edward pushes the microscope to 
          Bella, keeping his distance, his voice controlled.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Ladies first. 
          
          
          She grabs the microscope defensively and snaps the first slide 
          in, adjusting the lens. She's curt as she addresses him.
          
          
          BELLA
          You've been gone.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Out of town. For personal reasons.
          
          
          She glances at him but he just leans far away, his face 
          tight. She looks back into the microscope.
          
          
          BELLA
          Prophase. 
          
          
          She begins to remove the slide. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          May I look?
          
          
          She slides him the microscope. He glances through the lens.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Prophase.
          
          
          BELLA
          (muttering)
          Like I said.
          
          
          He writes it on the worksheet. Then he takes a breath, as if 
          trying calm himself, and turns to her with enormous effort.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Enjoying the rain?
          
          
          BELLA
          Seriously? You're asking me about the 
          weather?
          
          
          EDWARD
          It appears.
          
          
          BELLA
          No. I don't like the cold. Or the 
          wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or 
          turtle necks. 
          
          
          Is that a smile playing on his lips? For the first time, he 
          seems more intrigued than agonized. He studies her. She still 
          can't tell if he despises her or not. It's infuriating.
          
          
          
          22.
          BELLA
          
          
          What?
          
          
          He shakes his head and turns to the microscope, switching out 
          
          
          the slides. She looks at him. And keeps looking..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - ECU ON EDWARD'S FACE
          
          
          His cheekbones, his lips. So perfect, like a sculpture..
          .
          EDWARD
          
          
          Anaphase. 
          She snaps out of it. Covers with a dry look. 
          BELLA 
          May I? 
          
          (she looks through the 
          lens)
          Anaphase.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Like I said.
          
          
          She glances at him, and this time sees a smirk. She simply 
          holds out her hand for another slide.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (handing her the slide)
          If you hate cold and rain, why move to 
          the wettest place in the continental U.S.
          
          
          BELLA
          It's complicated.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I think I can keep up.
          
          
          He actually seems interested. She looks into the microscope as 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          My mother remarried. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Very complex. So you don't like him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Phil is fine. Young for her, but 
          nice enough.
          
          
          (re: the slide)
          Interphase.
          
          
          CUT ON THE SCHOOL BELL:
          
          
          
          23.
          36 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 36
          
          
          Bella exits holding the golden onion, and practically runs 
          into Edward, who's directly in front of her. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          Why didn't you stay with your mom 
          
          
          and stepdad?
          
          
          He waits for her answer, studying her, as if trying to decipher 
          her. She's drawn in by his attention, oddly compelled.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Alright, Phil's a minor league 
          
          
          baseball player, so he travels 
          a 
          
          
          lot. My mother stayed home with me 
          
          
          but it made her unhappy. So 
          I 
          
          
          decided to spend time with my 
          
          
          father.
          
          
          EDWARD
          But now you're unhappy. 
          
          
          BELLA
          No... I -- I just..
          .
          
          
          Bella turns away -- embarrassed, vulnerable. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          I'm just trying to figure you out. 
          
          
          You're very hard to read.
          
          
          He's clearly trying to read her now... their eyes meet again.
          But now she looks more closely at him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Did you get contacts? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... no.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Your eyes were black before, now 
          
          
          they're this golden brown or 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's just the fluorescents.
          
          
          He abruptly turns and walks away. As he does, Bella notes -
          -
          HIS HANDS clenched into tight fists. Off Bella, utterly 
          bewildered, both intrigued and frustrated.
          
          
          37 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 37
          
          
          The rain has stopped, but the parking lot is full of water 
          and patches of black ice. 
          
          
          
          24.
          Shivering, Bella heads for her truck, carrying the onion, 
          carefully navigating the icy puddles. As she reaches her 
          truck, she looks across the lot 
          
          
          EDWARD stands by his silver Volvo with his siblings, about to 
          climb in. A moment as their eyes meet... then he looks toward the 
          sound of a high pitched SCREECH, that quickly grows LOUDER..
          . 
          
          
          Bella turns to see a VAN -- skidding on the ice, careening out of 
          control, heading directly for her. TIME suddenly fractures, 
          compressing to stillness, then exploding in bursts of speed as 
          -
          
          
          -- THE FACES OF THE STUDENTS - in shock, seeing what's coming.
          --THE VAN DRIVER'S FACE -TYLER, desperately trying to gain
          control, then shielding his face.
          -- EDWARD'S FACE - looking at Bella with horror..
          . 
          
          
          THE VAN is about to hit Bella's truck, with her standing in 
          between, when suddenly, something knocks Bella down, pinning 
          her to the ground. She looks up - Edward is on top of her. 
          
          
          The world around them FREEZES -- in this fraction of 
          a 
          second, their proximity is overwhelming, electrifying. He 
          breathes in her scent, she takes in his flawless face..
          .
          
          
          Abruptly, we BLAST BACK TO SPEED as several things happen so 
          quickly, we, and Bella, are unsure what's going on:
          
          
          -- THE VAN SMASHES into the back of Bella's truck 
          -
          -- Then SPINS around, once again careening toward her and 
          Edward, then suddenly 
          -
          --EDWARD'S HANDS are creating a deep dent in the side of the
          van's body as it shudders to a stop, a foot from Bella. 
          -- Edward literally pushes the van away.
          
          
          Then silence. A long beat, void of any sound, as Bella looks at 
          Edward, trying to absorb what just happened. Edward's fear for
          her is still alive on his face. She starts to speak but..
          .
          
          
          THE SCREAMING begins, yelling, calls for help. People leap to 
          Tyler's aid, run to Bella and Edward. Bella SEES the onion on the
          ground, smashed as she would have been. As everyone sweeps in, 
          Edward moves into the b.g. Mike and Eric run to Bella 
          -
          
          
          MIKE ERIC
          
          
          Are you okay!? Are you What happened!? Did anyone 
          
          
          hurt?! see what happened?
          !
          
          
          Amid the chaos, Bella sees EDWARD'S SIBLINGS looking at
          Edward. But they show no hint of concern for his safety. 
          Instead, they look at him with disapproval... and fury. 
          
          
          38 INT. HOSPITAL - TREATMENT AREA - DAY 38
          
          
          The double doors BURST open as Charlie runs in, face white 
          with terror. He spots 
          -
          
          
          
          25.
          BELLA - sitting on a gurney, the E.R. DOCTOR looking into her 
          eyes with a pen light. On the next gurney over, Tyler, the 
          van's driver, lies with a mild head wound. Charlie rushes up.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bells. Are you alright?
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm fine, dad. Calm down.
          
          
          TYLER
          I'm so sorry, Bella. I tried to stop.
          
          
          BELLA
          It's okay, Tyler.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          It sure as hell is not okay.
          
          
          BELLA
          Dad, it's not his fault-
          
          
          CHARLIE 
          (stern, cutting her off)
          We nearly lost you.
          
          
          BELLA
          But you didn't.
          
          
          He'd hug her, if that was who he, or who she was. Instead,
          he glares at Tyler.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You can kiss your license goodbye.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN (O.S.
          )
          I heard the Chief's daughter was here.
          
          
          They look up as DR. CARLISLE CULLEN, mid 30's, approaches, blond,
          movie star handsome. His face is kind, but pale, tired. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Good. Dr. Cullen. 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (to E.R. Doctor)
          I've got this one, Jackie.
          
          
          The E.R. Doctor hands Dr. Cullen the chart, exits. Dr. Cullen 
          reviews her chart, then feels the back of her head as..
          .
          
          
          
          26.
          DR. CULLEN
          You have a nice knot growing back 
          there, but your x-rays show no 
          indication of concussion. 
          
          
          TYLER
          I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really 
          -
          
          
          Charlie abruptly pulls the curtain between them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          It would have been a lot worse if Edward 
          hadn't knocked me out of the way.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Edward? Your boy?
          
          
          Dr. Cullen quickly looks back at the chart. Bella's 
          intuition flickers, sensing he knows something. She presses.
          
          
          BELLA
          It was amazing he got to me so 
          fast. He was nowhere near me.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (smiles)
          As long as you're safe. 
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - RECEPTION - DAY 39
          
          
          Charlie and Bella exit the treatment area.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I just have to sign some paperwork. 
          You better call your mom.
          
          
          BELLA
          You told her?! She's probably freaking.
          
          
          He shrugs and hurries off. Bella shakes her head, pulls out her 
          cell phone. Is about to dial, but then sees down the hall..
          .
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - EDWARD, ROSALIE, AND DR. CULLEN
          
          
          Rosalie is clearly furious at Edward who stands his ground. 
          Dr. Cullen plays intermediary. 
          
          
          ROSALIE
          This isn't just about you, it's about 
          all of us -
          -
          
          
          Dr. Cullen sees Bella and stops Rosalie 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Let's take this in my office.
          
          
          
          27.
          Rosalie glares at Edward as she goes off with Dr. Cullen. Edward 
          adopts a nonchalant air as Bella approaches, determined.
          
          
          BELLA
          Can I talk to you for a moment?
          (off his nod)
          How did you get over to me so quickly? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I was standing right next to you.
          
          
          BELLA
          You were next to your car, across 
          the lot.
          
          
          He steps closer to her. His expression turns icy hard. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          No, I wasn't.
          
          
          She won't be bullied. Steps closer to him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Yes. You were. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're confused. You hit your head. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I know what I saw.
          
          
          EDWARD
          And what, exactly, was that?
          
          
          BELLA
          You stopped that van. You pushed
          it away.
          
          
          EDWARD
          No one will believe that. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I wasn't planning to tell anyone. 
          
          
          This registers with Edward. They're inches from each other,
          the tension thick. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I just want to know the truth.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Can't you just thank me and get 
          over it?
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Thank you.
          
          
          
          28.
          A long beat as they look at each other, angry, defensive... and 
          without a doubt, attracted. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're not going to let it go, are you?
          
          
          BELLA
          No.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (turns, walks away)
          Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
          
          
          BELLA
          Why did you even bother?
          
          
          He stops, a beat. Looks back at her, unexpectedly vulnerable. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... I don't know.
          
          
          And he keeps walking. Off Bella, confused, frustratingly 
          attracted, and absolutely determined to find out the truth.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          That was the first night I dreamed 
          of Edward Cullen..

          40 DREAM SEQUENCE - UNDERWATER 40
          
          
          Bella swims, white skin aglow, hair floating weightlessly, 
          sensually... suddenly, something BLASTS past her. She spins. 
          It's gone. Something BLASTS behind her. She spins again -
          to find herself face to face with 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD ... Bella reaches for him, but he abruptly springs 
          backward, just out of reach. 
          
          
          SMASH TO:
          
          
          41 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON BELLA - NIGHT 41
          
          
          -as she bolts up awake. In that split second, in the darkness, 
          she SEES Edward, watching her. She SNAPS on the light -- the 
          room is empty. Was she dreaming? 
          42 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 42
          
          
          Bella stands in the exact spot of the accident. Behind her 
          on the lawn, several CLASSES congregate, gathering for 
          a 
          field trip. Mr. Molina is in charge.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          Make sure I get your permission slips.

          PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE staring at the skid marks on the
          pavement..

          FLASH POP TO THE VAN REELING RIGHT FOR HER

          FLASH POP TO EDWARD'S HANDS STOPPING THE VAN 
          -
          
          
          FLASH POP TO EDWARD ON TOP OF HER, THE PROXIMITY, ELECTRICITY 
          -
          
          
          BACK ON BELLA, blushing at the memory. Then she SEES Edward 
          arrive with Alice and Jasper. She watches him, barely noticing as 
          Mike trots up to her -
          -
          
          
          MIKE 
          (ala Dr. Frankenstein)
          Look! You're moving. You're ALIVE!
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Yeah, false alarm..
          .
          
          
          MIKE
          Actually, I'm glad you're not dead 
          �cause - well, that would suck, plus 
          I 
          wanted to ask you - even though it's, 
          like, a month away..
          .
          
          
          But Bella's distracted by Edward. Mike's VOICE DIPS as..
          .
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - ACROSS THE LAWN
          
          
          Edward, head down, is in quiet conference with Jasper and Alice. 
          Abruptly, he looks up, as if listening to her and Mike, though 
          he's too far away to hear. Bella quickly refocuses on Mike.
          
          
          MIKE
          So what do you think?
          (off her blank look)
          You want to go? To prom. With me.
          
          
          BELLA
          (realizing, horrified)
          Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go 
          
          
          -somewhere. To Jacksonville. Yeah.
          MIKE
          You can't go another weekend? 
          
          
          BELLA
          Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you 
          should ask Jessica. 
          
          
          Mike follows Bella's eyes way across the lawn to Jessica.
          She smiles at them -- Suddenly Edward crosses in front of 
          Jessica. He seems to be smirking..

          43 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE GREENHOUSE - FIELD TRIP - DAY 43
          
          
          Mr. Molina and a Tour Guide lead several dozen kids through 
          the greenhouse. Bella keeps an eye on Edward who's up ahead
          with Alice and Jasper. Mr. Molina demonstrates the compost 
          machine as the students mess around. 
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          ...c'mon, Eric, stuff that compost 
          down deep... that's it..
          .
          (the machine gurgles and spins)
          ... now Tyler, take a big steaming 
          cup of �compost tea.� This is 
          recycling at its most basic level -
          -
          hey, don't drink that!
          
          
          When Bella sees Edward pause by an ancient staghorn fern, 
          alone, she takes a breath for courage and strides up to him. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Hello, Edward.
          
          
          He glances at her, merely nodding. We notice his FISTS clench, 
          and unclench. Bella looks at him, appalled by his rudeness.
          
          
          BELLA
          Really?
          
          
          No response. She turns, starts to walk away. 
          
          
          EDWARD 
          What's in Jacksonville?
          
          
          She turns back to him.
          
          
          BELLA
          How did you know about that? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You didn't answer my question.
          
          
          BELLA
          You haven't answered any of mine. 
          You won't even say hello.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Hello.
          
          
          BELLA
          And how did you stop that van?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Adrenaline rush. Very common. 
          Google it. 
          
          
          
          31.
          BELLA
          
          
          (not buying it)
          Floridians. That's what's in 
          Jacksonville.
          
          
          She turns to storm off but she stumbles over the irrigation 
          hose. Edward steadies her, catching her scent -- still so 
          powerful... He clenches his jaw.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It helps if you actually watch
          where you put your feet.
          
          
          Insulted, she keeps moving. He keeps pace, serious now. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I know I've been rude, but it's for 
          the best.
          
          
          She just looks at him like he's crazy. He walks away as
          Jessica suddenly rushes up.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Guess who just asked me to prom!
          
          
          Bella smiles.
          
          
          JESSICA
          I totally thought Mike was going to 
          ask you, Bella. Is it gonna be 
          weird? 
          
          
          BELLA
          No way. Zero weirdness. You guys 
          are great together.
          
          
          JESSICA
          I know, right?
          
          
          Giddy, Jessica rushes to catch up with Angela. Bella heads 
          out the door that leads to 
          -

          --where everyone's looking at the COMPOST �WORM BOX�, grossing
          each other out with the slimy creatures. As Bella backs away, 
          Edward steps up.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Bella, it would be better if we 
          weren't friends. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (wounded)
          Too bad you didn't figure that out 
          earlier.

          BELLA (cont'd)
          You could have let the van crush me 
          and saved yourself all this regret.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (snapping, angry)
          You think I regret saving you?
          
          
          BELLA
          I know you do.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (furious)
          You don't know anything.
          
          
          His harshness stings her. Suddenly, Alice appears at 
          Edward's side. She eyes Bella with curiosity.
          
          
          ALICE
          The bus is leaving.
          (to Bella)
          Hi. Will you be riding with us?
          
          
          EDWARD
          No. Our bus is full.
          
          
          He purposefully walks Alice away. But he glances back at 
          Bella with, is that... remorse? She doesn't see it.
          
          
          INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING 45
          
          
          Bella enters, throws down her book bag and coat, still angry. 
          She starts upstairs but Charlie enters from the kitchen.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Your mother called. Again.
          
          
          BELLA
          Your fault, for telling her about 
          the accident.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          She always did know how to worry. 
          
          
          (hint of sadness)
          But... she's changed, too. She 
          seems happy. Phil sounds all 
          right.
          
          
          BELLA
          He is.
          
          
          She continues upstairs, glancing at her parents' WEDDING PHOTO.

          -- as she pushes through the doors. She glances over at the 
          CULLEN TABLE, Edward with his siblings. He doesn't look at her.
          Anger and determination set in again as Bella joins Eric, 
          Jessica, Mike and Angela. She drops her book bag on a seat 
          -

          La Push, baby. You in?

          Eric, you stood up once. On a foam

          47 THE SALAD BAR STATION - MINUTES LATER 47
          
          
          Bella artfully designs an architectural salad. As she 
          reaches for an APPLE, Edward is suddenly next to her

          Startled, she fumbles and drops the apple -- Edward catches 
          it with his foot, hackeysack style, then bounces it back into 
          his hand, the red of the apple, stark against his pale skin. 
          He presents it to her with small smile.
          
          
          BELLA
          Thanks... but your mood swings are 
          giving me whiplash.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I said it would be better if we weren't 
          friends, not that I didn't want to be. 
          
          
          
          34.
          BELLA
          What does that even mean?
          
          
          EDWARD
          It means if you were smart, you'd 
          avoid me.
          
          
          Edward inadvertently glances at his four inhumanly beautiful 
          siblings, who wait for him, expectantly, at their table. 
          
          
          She notes her own, very human friends monitoring this 
          conversation from their table. Mike glowers jealously.
          
          
          BELLA
          So let's say, for argument's sake, 
          that I'm not smart. Would you talk 
          to me? Tell me the truth? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Probably not. I'd rather hear your 
          theories.
          
          
          BELLA
          Okay... how �bout radioactive 
          spiders? Kryptonite?
          
          
          EDWARD
          (levels his gaze, 
          
          
          challenging)
          You're talking about superheroes. 
          What if I'm not a hero? What if 
          I'm a bad guy?
          
          
          BELLA
          (beat, looking closer at him)
          No. I don't believe that. You're 
          not bad. You can be a jerk, but 
          it's like this... mask. To keep 
          people away. 
          
          
          He's taken aback by her honesty, her insight, drawn in by her..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Look, why don't we just - hang out. 
          Like... come to the beach with us. 
          It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, 
          salt water stinging your eyes..
          .
          
          
          EDWARD
          (small smile, considering 
          it)
          Which beach?
          
          
          BELLA
          La Push. 
          
          
          
          35.
          His smile lessens almost imperceptibly. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Is something wrong with that beach?
          
          
          Edward glances over at Mike - the two exchange cold looks.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's just a little crowded.
          
          
          Off Bella, as Edward walks away..
          .
          
          
          48 EXT. LA PUSH BEACH - DAY 48
          
          
          It's freezing, but Mike, Tyler, Jessica and others suit up
          for a surf. Eric hangs with them. Bella wanders by the 
          driftwood with Angela, who takes photographs. 
          
          
          ANGELA
          I keep thinking Eric's going to ask me 
          to prom, then he just... doesn't.
          
          
          BELLA
          You could ask him. 
          (off Angela's flustered 
          
          
          look)
          Take control. You're a strong 
          independent woman.
          
          
          ANGELA
          I am?
          
          
          JACOB (O.S.
          )
          Bella!
          
          
          She looks up to see three Quileute boys approaching the group; 
          Jacob Black, and SAM and EMBRY. Bella smiles at Jacob. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Guys, this is Jacob. Are you 
          stalking me?
          
          
          JACOB
          You're on my rez, remember? You 
          surfing?
          
          
          BELLA
          Definitely not. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          (teasing)
          Keep her company. Her date bailed. 
          
          
          ERIC
          What date?
          
          
          
          36.
          JESSICA
          She invited Edward. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (embarrassed)
          To be polite.
          
          
          ANGELA
          I think it's nice she invited him. 
          No one ever does.
          
          
          MIKE
          Because Cullen's a freak.
          
          
          SAM
          You got that right.
          
          
          BELLA
          You know them?
          
          
          SAM
          (sharply)
          The Cullens don't come here.
          
          
          Jacob shoots Sam a look, shakes his head. Bella registers this. 
          A beat, then she casually pulls Jacob aside 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          You want to go look at tide pools?
          
          
          She offers an awkwardly flirtatious smile. He grins, 
          infatuated. As they head toward the water..
          .
          
          
          EXT. LA PUSH BEACH - LATER DAY 49
          
          
          Bella and Jacob wander near the water, looking out to sea for 
          whales. The surfers are out on the waves. She nudges him, 
          continuing her attempt at flirtation..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          So, what did your friend mean about 
          the Cullens not coming here?
          
          
          JACOB
          Oops. Caught that, huh? 
          
          
          He moves closer to her, lowering his voice for mock-secrecy. 
          
          
          JACOB
          I'm not supposed to say anything.
          
          
          Bella gives him her best alluring smile.
          
          
          BELLA
          I can keep a secret..
          .
          
          
          
          37.
          JACOB
          
          
           (laughing) 
          It's just an old scary story. Did 
          you know the Quileutes are 
          supposedly descended from wolves?
          
          
          BELLA
          Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath?
          
          
          Jacob chuckles. Bella smiles and prompts him to continue..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          So the legend about the Cullens is..
          .
          
          
          JACOB
          Well, they're supposedly descended 
          from this, like..
          .
          
          
           (in a spooky voice)
          
          
          �enemy clan.� ... But they 
          claimed to be different, so we made 
          a treaty with them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Didn't they just move here?
          
          
          JACOB
          Or just moved back.
          
          
          BELLA
          Riiiight. So what was this treaty?
          
          
          JACOB
          
          
           (whispering)
          If they promised to stay off Quileute 
          lands, we wouldn't expose what they 
          really were to the pale-faces..
          . 
          
          
          Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers. 
          
          
          GIRL (O.S)
          AAAAAAAAGH!!!!!!
          !
          
          
          Bella JUMPS at the bloodcurdling scream, as Angela runs past, 
          chased by Eric waving a dead crustacean. Jacob smirks and 
          starts back to the group.
          
          
          BELLA
          Wait... what were they really? 
          
          
          JACOB 
          (laughing)
          It's just a story, Bella.
          
          
          Off Bella, with more unanswered questions..

          50 EXT. SHACK COMMUNITY ON THE RIVER - LATE AFTERNOON 50
          
          
          A collection of haphazard shacks and boat docks, connected by 
          wood plank sidewalks. FIND Waylon Forge (the hippy logger 
          who used to play Santa Claus) scraping paint off his boat, 
          swigging a pint as he listens to his prehistoric Walkman. 
          
          
          His old DOG lies next to him as the sounds of the forest and 
          river chirp and buzz. Waylon sings along to his Walkman..
          . 
          
          
          Suddenly, the sounds of nature abruptly SILENCE themselves. The 
          dog raises his head, starts to GROWL. Waylon doesn't notice.
          
          
          STAY ON WAYLON, singing, working... until he looks up and 
          realizes the dog's gone.
          
          
          WAYLON
          Jerry?
          
          
          Waylon pulls off the headphones. WHISTLES. No dog. Waylon 
          walks up a walkway... then sees a DOG LEG, sticking out from 
          under a bush. 
          
          
          WAYLON
          Come on, Jerry, you old mutt..
          .
          
          
          He pulls at the leg. It's detached. He reels back, stumbling 
          onto his boat, frantically untying the line and pushing out 
          -
          
          
          ON THE WATER - Waylon floats, breath short, listening acutely. 
          
          
          WAYLON'S POV -ON THE WOODS lining the river. Ominous
          darkness. A NOISE. He jerks around. Nothing. Then 
          suddenly, his boat ROCKS violently; he spins 
          -
          
          
          A MAN - now stands on the bow. JAMES, 30, pale white. 
          A 
          vampire. But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a deep, 
          sinister BURGUNDY, and absolutely lethal. His catlike 
          movements are always on the edge of a crouch.
          
          
          WAYLON
          H-how did you do that?
          
          
          JAMES
          Always the same inane questions..
          .
          
          
          Waylon turns but a woman LEAPS onto the bow --it's VICTORIA,
          26, chaotic red hair filled with leaves from the woods. 
          Terrified, Waylon spins around to see LAURENT, 28, glossy 
          black hair, olive skin, lounging on his boat seat. All three 
          Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all three are bare foot.
          
          
          JAMES
          �What do you want?
          �
          
          
          
          39.
          VICTORIA
          �Why are you doing this?
          � 
          
          
          LAURENT
          (sighs, slight French 
          accent)
          ... James, must we?
          
          
          JAMES
          The question should be, �will it hurt?
          �
          
          
          Victoria grins sadistically. Then with lightening fast 
          speed, the three of them VIOLENTLY LUNGE 
          -
          
          
          SMASH TO BLACK:
          
          
          51 FADE IN ON EDWARD'S FACE AGAINST BLACKNESS 51
          
          
          SNAPSHOTS of his eyes, his cheekbones, his lips..

          52 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON HER FACE - MORNING 52
          
          
          As she sits in front of her computer, lost in thought. She 
          shakes herself out of it and types into her search engine 
          �Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula.� An AD pops up,
          �Thunderbird & Whale Book Store, Port Angeles.� Bella,
          intrigued, clicks on it..

          The sun has come out and so has the skin. Kids are in shorts 
          though it's still barely sixty degrees. Everyone eats lunch 
          outdoors. Bella searches the crowd for Edward.
          
          
          JESSICA (O.S.
          )
          He's not here.
          
          
          She looks down to find Jessica sitting on the grass.
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
          Whenever the weather's nice, the 
          
          
          Cullens disappear. 
          
          
          BELLA
          They just... ditch?
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
          No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank �em 
          
          
          out for hiking and camping and 
          
          
          stuff. I tried the idea out on my 
          
          
          parents. Not even close.

          Oh my God, we need to hit the 
          stores in Port Angeles before the 
          dresses get cleaned out.

          -- antsy, distracted, as Jessica and Angela try on dresses. 
          Bella pulls a Mapquest print-out from her purse -- it reads, 
          �Thunderbird and Whale Book Store.� Jessica flounces out of
          the changing room, posing provocatively.
          
          
          JESSICA
          I think this halter makes my boobs 
          look big. What do you think, 
          Bella?
          
          
          Outside the window, a group of rowdy FRAT BOYS head toward 
          a 
          bar. Two of them stare at Jessica in her low-cut dress. 
          Embarrassed, she turns back to Bella. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          Bella?
          
          
          BELLA
          (absently)
          It looks great. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          You said that about the last five 
          dresses.
          
          
          ANGELA 
          (empathetic)
          You're not very good at this, are you?
          
          
          
          41.
          BELLA
          
          
          Maybe I should just go check out the 
          
          
          book store and meet you at the 
          
          
          restaurant later.
          
          
          ANGELA
          You sure?
          
          
          Bella nods, heads out. Jessica's looks in the mirror again.
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
          She was right about this halter, 
          
          
          though. It does look great.

          57 EXT. THUNDERBIRD AND WHALE BOOKSTORE/STREETS - NIGHT 57
          
          
          Bella exits, thumbing through a BOOK she just bought. She 
          heads down the sidewalk, but then hears FOOTSTEPS behind her. 
          She turns, doesn't see anyone. She puts the book in her
          shoulder bag and continues.
          
          
          UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA -someone's following her. She looks 
          around, changing course to cut across a parking lot. Unknown 
          POV gets closer... and closer, until she reaches 
          -
          
          
          58 EXT. WAREHOUSE AT END OF PARKING LOT - NIGHT 58
          
          
          Isolated. Bella, breath short, scared, turns around just as -
          -
          TWO MEN emerge from the shadows, not vampires, but the Frat 
          Boys, really wasted now. 
          
          
          FRAT BOY #
          1
          Wanna beer?
          
          
          She looks to her left; the other TWO GUYS are there. She's
          cornered. She takes her purse from around her shoulder.
          
          
          BELLA
          Look, just take my bag.
          
          
          FRAT BOY #
          2
          We don't want your bag.
          
          
          She takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her 
          wrist to use her purse as a mace. They chortle derisively. 
          But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in 
          the groin. The BOOK in her bag doubles him over. The other 
          three laugh, and start to close in. But suddenly 
          -
          
          

          HEADLIGHTS blind them. A silver Volvo screeches up. The 
          Frat Boys dive out of the way. The passenger-side door 
          opens. It's Edward. She's too stunned to even move.
          
          
          
          42.
          EDWARD
          Get in.
          
          
          She finally does. But Frat Boy #2 jumps into the game and 
          rushes Edward's side of the car 
          -
          
          
          Edward SCREECHES to a halt and is out of the car and facing 
          Frat Boy #2 so fast, neither the Frat Boys, nor Bella, see it. 
          Nor does Bella see Edward's GLARE, so chilling, so animalistic
          in its fury that Frat Boy #2, scared, instinctively backs off. 
          As Edward climbs back into the car, Bella just stares at him.
          
          
          59 INT. EDWARD'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 59
          
          
          Bella continues to stare. She sees that he's seething with anger,
          hands gripping the steering wheel, jaw clenched.
          
          
          BELLA
          What -- no, how did you find -- 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD
          (through gritted teeth)
          I should go back and rip their heads off.
          
          
          BELLA
          No. Bad idea. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You don't know the vile, repulsive 
          things they were thinking.
          
          
          BELLA
          And you do?
          
          
          EDWARD
          (covering)
          Not hard to guess. 
          
          
          60 EXT. WATERFALL RESTAURANT - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT 60
          
          
          Jessica and Angela exit the restaurant as Bella approaches.
          
          
          ANGELA
          Where were you!? We left you a message.
          
          
          JESSICA
          We waited, but we were starving 
          -
          
          
          Then they see Edward behind her, climbing out of his car. 
          They freeze, agog. He's composed now, making an effort to be
          charming. And they are charmed.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We 
          ran into each other and got talking. 
          
          
          
          43.
          JESSICA
          I - we - understand. We were 
          just... leaving, so 
          -
          
          
          The two girls start to go. Bella is forced to go with them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Okay, well. Thank you.
          
          
          She starts to follow the girls. Edward is torn, then abruptly 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (abruptly)
          Maybe I should make sure Bella gets 
          something to eat.
          
          
          (off Bella's surprised 
          
          
          look)
          ... If you'd like. Then I could 
          drive you back myself.
          
          
          ANGELA
          That's so... thoughtful.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Really thoughtful.
          
          
          BELLA
          (debates, then decides)
          I could eat.
          
          
          As he guides her off, the two girls share a look, and 
          a 
          noiseless scream of excitement. 
          
          
          EXT. WATERFALL RESTAURANT - DINING PATIO - NIGHT 61
          
          
          Bella and Edward sit on the deck. A dramatic waterfall 
          shimmers behind them.
          
          
          A waitress places a steaming plate of mesquite roasted salmon 
          in front of Bella and nothing in front of Edward. She exits.
          
          
          BELLA
          You're not eating?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm on a special diet.
          
          
          BELLA
          Like South Beach?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Not exactly.
          
          
          She looks at him curiously as she takes a bite.
          
          
          
          44.
          BELLA
          So how �bout some answers?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Yes, no. To get to the other side, 
          and 1 point 772453851.
          
          
          BELLA
          I didn't ask for the square root of pi.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You knew that?
          
          
          BELLA
          How did you know where I was? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I didn't.
          
          
          She shakes her head, frustrated, and turns to go inside -
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          (stops her, sincerely)
          Don't go.
          
          
          He seems torn by some internal dilemma. Then finally..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Were you following me?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I feel very protective of you. 
          
          
          BELLA
          So that's a yes?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Yes, I followed you. I tried to 
          keep my distance...until you needed 
          help.
          
          
          BELLA
          (putting everything together)
          You said before... That you heard 
          what those guys were thinking..
          . 
          Can you... read minds?
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (shrugs)
          I'm thinking of getting a nine-
          hundred number.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (trying to grasp)
          Alright, so you read minds... What am 
          I thinking? Wait -- okay now, go.
          
          
          
          45.
          EDWARD
          I have no idea. I can read every 
          mind in there, except yours. 
          
          
          (points at people 
          inside)
          Work, sex, money, sex, sex, boyfriend 
          -
          (points at Bella)
          Nothing. It's quite frustrating. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Why, what's wrong with me?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I tell you I read minds and you think 
          there's something wrong with you?
          
          
          He smiles, charmed by her. But his smile fades, that torn 
          look returns. He holds onto the rail, looking out. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What is it?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I... don't have the strength to 
          stay away from you anymore. 
          
          
          She's surprised. And thrilled.
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward, you don't have to.
          
          
          He's drawn in by her encouraging gaze... but he closes his
          eyes a beat, and turns back to the water.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (almost to himself)
          This is wrong. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're cold. We should go.
          
          
          He walks away before she can ask any more questions..
          .
          
          
          62 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 62
          
          
          Edward's Volvo speeds along the two lane highway.
          
          
          63 INT. EDWARD'S VOLVO - NIGHT 63
          
          
          Bella glances at Edward, might ask him more questions but he seems 
          to be wrestling with his own thoughts. Finally..
          . 
          
          
          
          46.
          BELLA
          I think I'm warm enough now. 
          
          
          She reaches for the heater dial, he does as well -- their 
          hands TOUCH. And hold a moment too long. An electric 
          current connecting them.
          
          
          BELLA
          Your hand, it's still freezing cold.
          
          
          He pulls his hand away, but she keeps looking at it... then 
          her attention shifts outside to FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS. As 
          they drive past the FORKS POLICE STATION, a sheriff's car
          pulls away. Charlie's cruiser is parked out front. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (concerned)
          Dad's here late. Something must 
          have happened.
          
          
          EXT./INT. FORKS - POLICE STATION (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 64
          
          
          The Volvo pulls up. Bella and Edward climb out. Edward then 
          sees a second car next to the cruiser. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          That's my father's car. What's he -- 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD AND BELLA'S POV: INSIDE THE DARKENED POLICE STATION
          
          
          In a pool of light, a distressed Charlie and Dr. Cullen study 
          photographs and evidence. As they wrap up their discussion, 
          Dr. Cullen puts a sympathetic hand on Charlie's shoulder,
          then exits the police station looking grim. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Carlisle. What happened?
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Waylon Forge was found in the woods 
          out near his place. I just 
          examined the body.
          
          
          Edward darkens. Bella is horrified.
          
          
          BELLA
          He died? How? 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Animal attack. 
          
          
          BELLA
          The same kind that killed the security 
          guard down in Mason?
          
          
          Edward and Dr. Cullen trade a look, subtle, but Bella catches it.
          
          
          
          47.
          DR. CULLEN
          Most likely.
          
          
          BELLA
          So it's getting closer to town.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Waylon lived all the way down on 
          Queets River. 75 miles south.
          
          
          BELLA
          But that's 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (with a kind, reassuring 
          
          
          smile)
          Bella, you should go inside. 
          Waylon was your father's friend.
          
          
          She goes to the door, but looks back to see them conferring 
          quietly, gravely. Clearly, there's more to this.
          
          
          65 INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 65
          
          
          Bella enters to find a distressed Charlie studying evidence, 
          photos, maps --trying to make sense of Waylon's death.
          Deputies come and go in the background. Bella approaches 
          Charlie. He looks up.
          
          
          BELLA
          Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Known him going on thirty years. 
          
          
          He's obviously torn up. Bella isn't quite sure what to do.
          And so puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. A beat..
          . 
          
          
          Then Charlie squeezes her hand. It's the first physical
          affection we've seen between them. And it threatens to evoke
          even more emotion in Charlie. So he tamps it down, and rises, 
          then projects a confident manner. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella. 
          But in the meantime..
          .
          
          
          As an ambulance pulls up outside, he opens a drawer, finds 
          out a cannister of PEPPER SPRAY. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          ... I want you to have this.
          
          
          BELLA
          That's probably not a good 
          -
          
          
          
          48.
          CHARLIE
          It'll give me some peace of mind. 
          
          
          She sees he needs this, and allows him to put it into her 
          purse. 
          
          
          As Charlie goes to get his coat, Bella steps outside to SEE

          Two Attendants hoist a metal gurney into an ambulance. On it, 
          Waylon's dead, white, bloody bare FEET peek out from under 
          a
          sheet, resting at a disturbingly unnatural angle. Off Bella, 
          chilled..

          -- as she turns on the LIGHT. She hears a SNAP! outside the 
          window. She rises, digs into her purse for the PEPPER SPRAY 
          Charlie gave her, and goes to the window. She looks out -
          -
          all she sees is the wind blowing hard. But she's rattled.
          
          
          She closes the curtains, then reaches for the BOOK she bought 
          earlier. She thumbs through, laying the pepper spray within 
          reach. 
          
          
          INSERT THE BOOK, �QUILEUTE FOLK STORIES AND ART.
          �
          
          
          As she leafs through we see PHOTOS of ancient, carved MASKS. 
          Comical, menacing, haunting... then she stops on a photo of 
          a 
          white mask with black eyes and a row of sharp teeth. THE 
          INSCRIPTION reads, �The Cold One.
          �
          
          
          Bella quickly goes to her computer and Googles �Cold One � -
          several beer ads appear. Frustrated, she closes the pop-ups, 
          revealing a link to: �The Cold One: Apotamkin� -

          Several PICTURES begin loading: the seductive Apotamkin with his 
          ice-blue skin, devouring his victims in tapestries, engravings, 
          paintings. Creatures beautiful and horrific. Craven, skeletal 
          demons attacking villages; perfectly sculpted predators, luring 
          innocent maidens... it's all murder, blood, sexuality.
          
          
          THEN SEVERAL WORDS LEAP OUT in quick succession:

          She stands in the center of the deserted, green lawn. Her 
          expression tells us she's still reeling with disbelief. STAY 
          ON HER FACE, TIME LAPSING AS: 
          
          
          The bell rings and students exit class, rushing past Bella as 
          she stands still, waiting..

          the intensity on her face. He stops. 
          
          
          She walks to him, eyes meeting his... her look says, we have 
          to talk... and she continues directly past him, into the dark 
          forest that borders the school. 
          
          
          He watches her disappear in the trees, then takes a step to 
          follow. Jasper moves in front of him, Rosalie grabs his arm. 
          ROSALIE
          Edward, don't go.
          But Alice gently removes Rosalie's hand from his arm.
          ALICE
          He's already there.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY 68
          Bella stands amid the trees, waiting. Then the SOUNDS OF THE 
          FOREST abruptly drop out. A predator is near. Edward 
          appears behind her. She doesn't turn around. A beat.
          
          
          
          50.
          BELLA
          You're impossibly fast. And strong. 
          Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. 
          Your eyes change color. And 
          sometimes you speak like... you're 
          from a different time. 
          
          
          (turns to face him now)
          You never eat food, or drink, or 
          come out in the sunlight. And you 
          said no to the beach trip only after 
          you heard where it was. Because of 
          the treaty. 
          
          
          This last registers with him. She steps closer to him.
          
          
          BELLA
          How old are you?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Seventeen.
          
          
          BELLA
          How long have you been seventeen?
          
          
          A long beat as we begin to CIRCLE THEM. He sees he can't hide
          anymore. Honesty is an enormous risk, but he has to take it.
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... A while.
          
          
          She inhales. She knew, but it's still shocking. We CIRCLE
          THEM FASTER 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          I know what the Cold Ones are. 
          What you are. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Say it. Out loud. Say it.
          
          
          All sound suddenly DROPS OUT. We hear only her whisper..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Vampire
          
          
          They seem to hover in momentary stasis, him utterly exposed, her 
          reality utterly rocked. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Are you afraid?
          
          
          BELLA
          No. 
          
          
          
          51.
          EDWARD
          
          
          (angry)
          Then ask me the most basic 
          question: what do we eat?
          
          
          BELLA
          You won't hurt me. You're different.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You think you know me?
          
          
          He glares at her. She holds her ground. Suddenly, he takes 
          her by the hand. Starts walking. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Where are we going?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Up the mountain. Out of the cloud 
          bank. You need to see what 
          I 
          really am. What I look like in the 
          harsh light of the sun. 
          
          
          BELLA
          No! The sunlight will kill you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Myth. You need to see the truth.
          
          
          He pulls her but she stumbles. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Slow down.
          
          
          Suddenly, he's right next to her.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Are you afraid? 
          
          
          BELLA
          No.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Then come with me. Someplace where 
          no one can protect you. Where 
          I 
          could do what I've wanted to do from 
          the first moment I met you. 
          
          
          Their proximity is intense, riveting both of them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm not afraid.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          You should be.
          
          
          
          52.
          He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into his arms. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Hold on.
          
          
          Then he flings her onto his back... and starts running.
          
          
          69 EXT. FOREST - RUNNING - DAY 69
          
          
          As in the opening sequence, Edward races through the forest, dark 
          trunks STROBING past as he picks up speed, faster and faster. 
          Bella clings to his back as it seems he'll collide with the trees, 
          but he avoids them with supernatural grace. It's frightening, 
          nauseating, intoxicating. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Are you afraid!
          ?
          
          
          BELLA
          No!
          
          
          But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude. 
          Higher and higher, above the fog layer. Finally, up ahead 
          -
          
          
          THE FOREST'S EDGE fast approaches, a clearing is beyond. The
          sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees... they're about to 
          emerge from the shadowy darkness... but suddenly-
          
          
          Bella finds herself sitting on the ground, against a tree. 
          All is silent. She's dizzy, tries to regain her equilibrium. 
          Then she realizes she's alone. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward? Where are you?
          
          
          She rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into 
          -
          
          
          70 EXT. A MEADOW (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 70
          
          
          A perfect circle of swaying grass, wildflowers and buttery 
          sunlight. HEAR a stream nearby. Bella looks around and finally 
          sees 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD, his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some 
          trees. He watches her cautiously. She takes a step toward 
          him, but he holds up a hand. She waits. Finally, he takes 
          a 
          deep breath, and steps out of the shade 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          This is why we don't show ourselves 
          
          
          in sunlight..
          . 
          
          
          As the sun hits him... EDWARD'S SKIN literally sparkles as if 
          embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds. He is magnificent, 
          shimmering, like a statue carved from glittering crystal. He 
          moves toward her. 
          
          
          
          53.
          EDWARD
          This is what I am.
          
          
          He nears, clearly expecting her to recoil, but..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA
          You're... beautiful..
          .
          
          
          He realizes that she's in awe. She reaches to touch him, but 
          he immediately backs into the shadows, his skin normal again. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (appalled)
          Beautiful? I'm a killer, Bella. 
          This is the skin of a killer. 
          
          
          His arm juts into A SHAFT OF LIGHT, sparkling again.
          
          
          BELLA
          I don't believe that.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Because you believe the lie. The 
          camouflage. I'm the world's most 
          dangerous predator. Everything 
          about me invites you in - my voice, 
          my face, even my smell. As if 
          I 
          need any of that..
          .
          
          
          He's suddenly BEHIND her --then IN FRONT of her --then by 
          a
          tree, DARTING so fast, we only see where he lands 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          As if you could outrun me. As if 
          you could fight me off.
          
          
          He abruptly rips off a LARGE TREE LIMB, then THROWS it against 
          a 
          tree trunk with explosive force. 
          
          
          Bella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm designed to kill.
          
          
          BELLA
          I don't care.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I've killed people.
          
          
          BELLA
          It doesn't matter.
          
          
          
          54.
          EDWARD
          I wanted to kill you. I've never
          wanted a human's blood so much in 
          my life. I'm dangerous to you.
          
          
          BELLA
          I trust you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Don't.
          
          
          BELLA
          I trust you, Edward. I'm here.
          
          
          She takes his hand. He reels at the warmth of her touch. 
          She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her THROAT is 
          nearing his lips... then suddenly he's gone.
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward?
          
          
          She looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow, 
          catching his breath.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You... took me by surprise. 
          (collecting himself)
          I don't know how to... do this.
          
          
          He moves back toward her. Slowly. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Me, and my family, we're different 
          from others of our kind. We're not 
          nomadic, we have a permanent home. 
          We only hunt animals. We've 
          learned to control our thirst..
          . 
          
          
          (shaking his head)
          But you - your scent, it's like 
          a 
          drug to me... my own personal brand 
          of heroin. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (realizing)
          Oh... I thought you hated me when we met.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I did. For making me want you so badly. 
          I'm still not sure I can control myself.
          
          
          He reaches her again.
          
          
          BELLA
          I know you can.
          
          
          
          55.
          He's utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her
          face for clues.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I wish I could understand this 
          thing you see in me. You look at 
          me with those eyes..
          . 
          
          
          (frustrated)
          I can't read your mind. Tell me 
          what you're thinking.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm afraid.
          
          
          Stricken, he sinks gracefully to his knees in the grass.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (devastated)
          Good. 
          
          
          She sinks down in front of him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll 
          disappear. That I'll lose you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (amazed, elated)
          You don't know how long I've looked 
          for you.
          
          
          They share a smile. Then he reaches toward her neck, 
          pausing..
          .
          
          
          EDWARD
          Be very still.
          
          
          She does so. Exercising great control, he places his hand on 
          her throat... it's so exposed, so vulnerable. The rush
          between them is overwhelming. But Bella doesn't move.
          
          
          He brushes his hand up her cheek. Then lowers it to her 
          heart... Clouds float past the sun..
          .
          
          
          They're both overwhelmed, taking each other in.
          
          
          EDWARD
          And so the lion fell for the lamb.
          
          
          BELLA
          Stupid lamb.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Sick masochistic lion.
          
          
          
          56.
          CRANE UP on the two of them, laying together, as close as 
          they dare... his hand to her heart..
          .
          
          
          DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          71 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - MORNING 71
          
          
          CLOSE ON BELLA'S FACE. Still in bed. Thinking.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          About three things I was absolutely 
          positive. One, Edward was 
          a 
          vampire. 
          
          
          She rises, goes to the mirror. Looks at herself, worry 
          knitting her brow.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          Two, there was a part of him that 
          thirsted for my blood. And three..
          .
          
          
          As she moves past her window, something catches her eye, causing 
          her to BANG into her desk. She looks back out..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY
          
          
          Edward leans against his car, looking up at her with a small 
          smile. She beams at the sight of him. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          ... I was falling, unconditionally 
          and irrevocably, in love with him. 
          
          
          72 OMITTED 72
          
          
          73 EXT. OLYMPIC RAINFOREST - DAY (ANOTHER DAY) 73
          
          
          Edward helps Bella balance-walk across an enormous fallen pine 
          tree in the moss-covered forest. 
          
          
          BELLA
          How long have you been like this?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Since nineteen-eighteen. That's 
          when Carlisle found me. 
          
          
          She takes that in, it's a lot. But it stokes her curiosity.
          
          
          BELLA
          Where'd he find you?
          
          
          EDWARD
          In a hospital, dying of Spanish 
          influenza. My parents had already died. 
          
          
          
          57.
          FLASHBACK to CHICAGO HOSPITAL, 1918 - NIGHT
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          What was it like?
          
          
          EDWARD (V.O.
          )
          The word excruciating comes to 
          mind. But what Carlisle did was 
          much harder... not many of us have 
          the restraint to do that. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          Didn't he just... bite?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Not just. Our bite contains venom. 
          And once we taste blood, a sort of..
          . 
          frenzy begins. It's almost 
          impossible to stop. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          But Carlisle did. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          First with me, then with his wife, 
          Esme. He found her in a hospital, 
          as well. The others followed.
          
          
          BACK to PRESENT DAY
          
          
          BELLA 
          Does someone have to be dying to 
          become like you?..
          .
          
          
          Their CONVERSATION CONTINUES as we go to 
          -
          
          
          74 EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - DAY (ANOTHER DAY) 74
          
          
          They walk along a stunning coastline -- rugged black rocks, 
          covered in bright green moss.
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... No, that's just Carlisle. He 
          would never do... this, to someone 
          who had another choice. 
          
          
          BELLA
          So Carlisle's the reason why you 
          hunt animals, instead of people. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Not the only reason.
          
          
          He stops, looks down at her, serious, with emotion..
          .
          
          
          
          58.
          EDWARD
          I don't want to be a monster.
          
          
          She nods. Understands. He smiles.
          
          
          EDWARD
          We call ourselves vegetarians, by 
          the way... For our kind, hunting 
          animals is like living on tofu. It 
          keeps you strong but isn't very 
          satisfying. 
          
          
          Then abruptly, he whips past Bella. She turns to see him standing 
          on a large rock in the river.
          
          
          BELLA
          Show off.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's not that impressive, really. 
          Anyone in my family can do this.
          
          
          BELLA
          Can they all read minds, too? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          No, that's unique to me. But Alice can 
          see the future. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (fishing)
          Really? Bet she saw me coming 
          a 
          mile away.
          
          
          She notes his change of mood as he slows, darkening.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Her visions are very subjective. 
          The future can change.
          
          
          He cuts off her questions by returning to shore, and 
          continuing their walk..
          .
          
          
          75 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT (ANOTHER DAY) 75
          
          
          Water sprays from a hose as Bella and Edward wash her truck. 
          A boom box PLAYS. He perches on top of the roof. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Come to my house tomorrow. 
          
          
          Bella looks up, aiming the hose badly - water ricochets off 
          the cab and sprays in her face. He jumps down from the roof.
          
          
          BELLA
          Your house? With your family?
          
          
          
          59.
          He wipes down the dented front fender, then reaches under it 
          and, with his bare hands, easily pops a large DENT out of the 
          truck's body. She's too flustered to register it.
          
          
          BELLA 
          But... what if they don't like me?
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (laughing heartily)
          You're worried, not because you'll 
          be in a houseful of vampires, but 
          because you think they won't 
          approve of you? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm glad I amuse you.
          
          
          But then his laughter dies, as he hears something. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What is it?
          
          
          EDWARD
          A complication.
          
          
          ... as a BLACK CAR comes into view, and pulls up. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'll pick you up tomorrow.
          
          
          He heads to his car, eying the passengers in 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD'S POV - INT. BLACK CAR
          
          
          Jacob, with his father, Billy, who's expression is intense.
          Anxious. SLOW MOTION as Edward locks eyes with Billy. Jacob 
          looks questioningly at his father.
          
          
          Bella watches Edward drive away, perturbed by the exchange. She 
          forces a smile and goes to greet the visitors. Jacob sets up 
          Billy's wheelchair and Billy climbs into it as 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          Come to visit your truck?
          
          
          JACOB
          Looks good. You got that dent out. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Actually, we came to visit your 
          flat screen. First Mariners game 
          of the season. Plus Jacob here 
          kept bugging me to see you again.
          
          
          
          60.
          JACOB
          (mortified)
          Great, Dad. Thanks. 
          
          
          Jacob shoots his father an irritated look, just as the POLICE 
          CRUISER pulls up. Charlie climbs out, holding two six-packs. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Pale Ale.
          
          
          BILLY
          (holds up a brown paper 
          BAG)
          Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.
          
          
          Charlie smiles, pleased. He clicks on the game as they all head 
          inside 
          -
          
          
          BILLY
          Any luck with the Waylon case?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          
          
          (darkening)
          Found a footprint out at the crime 
          scene today. A bare, human footprint. 
          
          
          Billy seems disturbed but not surprised. Bella is horrified.
          
          
          BELLA
          A person did that?
          
          
          JACOB
          A crazy person, walking around

          CHARLIE
          Spread the word out at the rez, will 
          ya? Keep the kids out of the woods. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Will do. 
          (directed at Bella)
          Don't want no one else getting hurt.
          
          
          Bella looks away from Billy, unnerved.

          78 DREAM SEQUENCE - UNDERWATER 78
          
          
          Bella floats near Edward, only their hands touching, but 
          their bodies are nearing, so close, so sensual..
          . 
          
          
          
          61.
          Suddenly, EDWARD IS YANKED DOWNWARD! Something has him, 
          pulling him down..
          . 
          SMASH TO:
          
          
          79 
          INT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON BELLA - MORNING 79
          -- as her eyes pop open... and relief sweeps over her as she 
          realizes it was just a dream. But it haunts her..
          .
          
          
          80 
          EXT. OLYMPIC PENINSULA - ROAD - DAY 80
          
          
          AERIAL SHOT of the forest as we sweep over its lush green 
          expanse, to FIND Edward's Volvo speeding along, very fast. 
          The Volvo finally turns off the paved highway and onto a long 
          
          
          serpentine dirt road. FOLLOW THE CAR until, finally, it 
          reaches a small meadow, in the center of which sits 
          -
          
          
          81 
          EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - DAY 81
          A timeless graceful house. The Volvo pulls up and Bella 
          climbs out, surprised.
          
          
          BELLA
          It's... wonderful.
          EDWARD
          You expected turrets, dungeons and moats? 
          BELLA
          No... not moats.
          He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside.
          
          
          82 
          INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 82
          Edward guides Bella into the large, bright house. Walls of glass 
          look out on the river. Everything's open and white. Historical
          objects are tastefully placed throughout. 
          
          
          HEAR Verdi's �La Traviata: Libiamo ne' lieti calici� coming from
          another room. Bella is enraptured.
          BELLA
          It's so light and open. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Thanks to tinted windows... It's the one 
          place we never have to hide.
          
          
          We then notice CLANGING coming from the kitchen. Edward 
          shakes his head.
          EDWARD
          I told them not to do this.
          
          
          
          62.
          83 INT. CULLEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 83
          
          
          Verdi's opera BLASTS Bella and Edward who enter to find the
          kitchen in full swing. Dr. Cullen, Emmett, Rosalie, and ESME 
          prepare elaborate platters of Italian pastas and antipasti. 
          
          
          Esme rolls out a pizza dough and fans tomatoes around it in an 
          instant. Rosalie stirs a pot, disinterested. 
          
          
          Esme sees Bella and stops, emanating maternal warmth. Her 
          heart-shaped face and billows of hair are reminiscent of the 
          silent-movie era. 
          
          
          ESME
          
          
          Bella. We're making Italiano for 
          
          
          you. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          This is Esme, my mother for all 
          
          
          intents and purposes. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Bon giorno?
          
          
          ESME
          Molto bene! 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          
          
          You've given us an excuse to use 
          
          
          the kitchen for the first time. 
          
          
          Hit pause..
          .
          
          
          PAN across brand new Williams-Sonoma cookware boxes to the 
          corner --they're watching an ITALIAN COOKING SHOW on a TV.
          Emmett hits the DVD remote control. 
          
          
          ESME
          I hope you're hungry.
          
          
          BELLA
          Oh, absolutely 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          She already ate.
          
          
          Bella shoots him a look, but something SHATTERS. Rosalie has 
          thrown down a bowl and now strides out 
          -
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Perfect.
          
          
          
          63.
          84 INT. LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 84
          
          
          -- Bella exits behind Rosalie, trying to explain. The 
          other's follow -
          
          BELLA
          I just assumed -- because you don't 
          eat, you know..
          .
          
          
          ESME
          Of course. That was very considerate 
          of you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (re: Rosalie)
          Ignore her. I do.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Yes, let's keep pretending this 
          isn't dangerous for all of us. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I would never, ever tell anyone.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (reassuring)
          She knows that. 
          
          
          EMMETT
          The problem is, you two have gone 
          public now, so..
          .
          
          
          ESME
          
          
          Emmett.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          No, she should know.
          
          
          (to Bella)
          The entire family will be 
          implicated if this ends badly. 
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Badly?
          
          
          This hangs in the air, uncomfortably. Edward can't look at her.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (realizing)
          Oh. Badly. Like, where I become 
          a 
          meal.
          
          
          Emmett chokes back laughter. Edward grins. Wraps his arm 
          around Bella. Even Esme has to chuckle.
          
          
          Rosalie, exasperated, heads back into the kitchen. Emmett 
          shrugs, goes after her.
          
          
          
          64.
          ALICE (O.S.
          )
          Hi, Bella!
          
          
          ON THE BALCONY Alice leaps over the rail, holding a bouquet 
          of wildflowers. Jasper follows her. She bounces forward to 
          kiss Bella's cheek and hands Bella the wildflowers. 
          
          
          ALICE
          
          
          I'm Alice. You do smell good. 
          EDWARD 
          Alice. 
          ALICE 
          
          It's alright, Bella and I are going 
          to be great friends. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (extending her hand)
          And you're Jasper, right?
          
          
          JASPER
          Pleasure to meet you.
          
          
          But he shies away from her hand. 
          
          
          ALICE
          (gently encouraging)
          You won't hurt her, Jasper.
          
          
          He isn't so sure. Edward takes Bella's hand instead.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'll give you a tour of the house. 
          
          
          ALICE
          (with meaning)
          I'll see you soon.
          
          
          Edward shoots Alice a look, which Bella catches before he guides 
          her up the stairs. As they ascend, Bella takes in the eclectic 
          ART PIECES from around the world, Ethiopian crosses, Dresden 
          China, Asian scrolls. They reach 
          -
          
          
          THE LANDING - to FIND a wall of dozens of artistically arrayed 
          silk squares with tassels. Bella looks closer. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Graduation caps?
          
          
          EDWARD
          A private joke. We matriculate a lot.
          
          
          BELLA
          What a nightmare, repeating high school. 
          
          
          
          65.
          EDWARD
          True, but the younger we start out in 
          a 
          new place, the longer we can stay there.
          
          
          She shivers at the thought of it, as they continue on..
          .
          
          
          85 INT. EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY 85
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... and this is my room.
          
          
          Bella enters to find a wall of glass doors open to a deck, with 
          the river beyond. The rest is floor to ceiling CD's, vinyl, 
          8
          track tapes, etc., with a sophisticated I-pod/stereo set up. 
          
          
          BELLA
          So you're obsessed with music. But..
          .
          (looking around)
          No bed?
          
          
          EDWARD
          No sleep.
          
          
          BELLA
          Ever?
          
          
          EDWARD
          No nightmares, no drool, no 
          snoring.
          
          
          She considers this, as she runs a hand along a wall of CD's,
          studying the titles.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Do you have any favorites?
          
          
          BELLA
          Depends. Alternative? Jazz? 
          Sixties, seventies..
          .
          
          
          EDWARD
          Ooh, she knows her music. Alright, 
          nineties. Eighteen-nineties. Classical.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'd have to say... Debussy.
          
          
          He looks at her, surprised, smiles. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          My favorite, too. 
          
          
          Off their connection, he pulls out a CD and puts it on. 
          A 
          solo piano version of CLAIR DE LUNE begins to play.
          
          
          
          66.
          He moves to her, taking her hand, then he starts to turn her 
          in a pirouette, dancing with her - but she breaks off and 
          backs away.
          
          
          BELLA
          No dancing.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Ever? 
          
          
          BELLA
          No tripping, no falling, no derision. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          (mischievously)
          I can always make you.
          
          
          BELLA
          You don't scare me.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You really shouldn't have said that.
          
          
          He grins, a low GROWLING SOUNDS in the back of his throat. 
          She laughs and backs out the door, onto 
          -
          
          
          86 EXT. EDWARD'S ROOM - DECK (CONTINUOUS) 86
          
          
          -- Bella backs up to the rail. Edward appears in the 
          doorway, shifting into a half-crouch, about to pounce. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Don't you dare -
          
          Suddenly, she's airborne as he tackles her and they FLY OFF THE 
          DECK... then she finds herself 
          -
          
          
          IN A TREE - in his arms. When she realizes where she is, she 
          laughs, delighted. It's infectious, he laughs heartily, too..
          .

          Esme and Dr. Cullen look out the window. Edward's LAUGHTER
          filters inside to them; Esme, in turn, smiles.
          
          
          ESME
          She's brought him to life.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          He's been alone too long... but how 
          can it end well?
          
          
          ESME
          Alice has been wrong before.
          
          
          
          67.
          DR. CULLEN
          Not often.
          
          
          Esme turns to Dr. Cullen, gentle but absolutely firm.
          
          
          ESME
          
          
          Carlisle. Bella is what he wants. 
          
          
          It will work out. Somehow. 
          
          
          Dr. Cullen smiles at her with love, then takes her hand as 
          they look back out the window..

          Edward looks Bella in the eye. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Trust me?
          
          
          BELLA
          In theory. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Then close your eyes.
          
          
          She does, warily. He grips her more firmly, then LEAPS them to

          He grins, then starts taking off her clothes. They pull each 
          other toward the woods with carnal lust. It barely registers 
          with Laurent, who continues to watch the posse with concern.

          Bella hurries toward the entrance, trying to keep the joy on her 
          face in check... with minimal success. Outside the door, she 
          passes Mike, hanging out with several of his basketball TEAMMATES.
          
          
          MIKE
          Yo, Arizona. So. You and Cullen.
          
          
          She shrugs, non-committal, but can't entirely hide a smile,
          as she hurries inside to Charlie's table and slides in.
          
          
          BELLA
          Sorry I'm late. Biology project. 
          
          
          Cora sets a top sirloin steak in front of Charlie, and plate 
          of seafood in front of Bella.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Ordered you the seafood combo.
          
          
          BELLA
          Order one for yourself next time. 
          You should cut back on the steak.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I'm healthy as a horse.

          Say Chief, boys want to know, you 
          find anything down by Queets River 
          today?
          
          
          Charlie's aware of the LOGGERS at the counter listening, too.
          He frames his answer carefully to keep everyone calm.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          The suspect's moving east. Kitsap 
          County Sheriff is taking over from 
          here. They're putting extra guys on.
          
          
          CORA
          Hope they catch him fast.
          
          
          She moves off, with a measure of relief. Charlie and Bella 
          pass each other the salt, butter for bread, etc., with an 
          easy rhythm now.

          She turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around outside, 
          straws in their noses, making faces at her. She smiles.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          It's okay you wanna join them. I'm 
          just gonna turn in early anyway.

          Yeah, me, too. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          It's a Friday night. Go out. The 
          Newton boy's got a big smile for 
          you. Nice family, the Newtons.
          
          
          BELLA
          He's just a friend.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          None of the boys in town interest you?
          
          
          BELLA
          We're not really going to talk 
          about boys, are we?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Just... you should be around people. 
          I leave you alone too much.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (with genuine affection)
          I've never minded being alone. Guess 
          I'm a lot like my dad that way.

          Phil's working hard. We're looking 
          around for a house to rent, in case 
          it becomes permanent. You'd like 
          Jacksonville, baby.

          BELLA
          I, uh... have to go.
          
          
          RENE
          No way, we gotta talk boys. Are 
          you being safe?
          
          
          Edward shoots her a look, he heard that. She's mortified.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'll call you later, Mom. 
          
          
          STAY ON BELLA who hangs up.

          She pushes him. He grabs her hand and playfully pulls her 
          onto the bed, wrestling as 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          You're a peeping Tom! Perv!
          
          
          EDWARD
          Shh! The Chief will hear you!
          
          
          But the electricity of their physical contact quickly overwhelms 
          them, their laughter quieting. He studies her face.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I just... like watching over you. 
          
          
          He raises his fingers to her lips, sending a thrill up her spine.
          
          
          EDWARD
          There's something I'd like to try. 
          
          
          She nods, bedazzled by him. He takes her face in his hands, 
          hesitates to test himself, then he softly kisses her..
          . 
          
          
          What neither of them is prepared for is her response. Her 
          breath comes in a wild GASP. Her fingers knot in his hair, 
          clutching him to her. Lips part as she breathes his scent..
          .
          
          
          Then his hands gently, but forcefully push her face back. She 
          opens her eyes to see that his eyes are wild, his jaw clenched. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (mortified)
          Oh... I'm... oh.
          
          
          He relaxes slightly, looking at her blushing face.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm stronger than I thought. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Wish I could say the same. I'm so 
          embarrassed.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Don't be. But we have to be careful.
          (serious)
          I can never lose control with you. Ever. 
          
          
          She nods, then carefully lies on his chest. He wraps his arms 
          around her. Off the two of them..

          Bella enters to find Charlie cleaning a rifle. He starts to 
          say hello but she just blurts out -
          -
          
          
          
          73.
          BELLA
          I have a date with Edward Cullen.
          
          
          He suddenly looks like he's having an aneurysm. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          He's too old for you.
          
          
          BELLA
          We're both juniors. I thought you 
          liked the Cullens. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          And I thought you weren't interested in 
          any of the boys in town. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward doesn't live �in town.� And 
          it's in the early stage and -
          -
          whatever, he's outside right now.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Now? He's out there?
          
          
          BELLA
          He wants to meet you. Officially. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Good.
          
          
          He cocks the rifle in mock-seriousness.
          
          
          BELLA
          Be nice, okay? He's... important.
          
          
          Charlie gives his daughter a reassuring nod... then she opens 
          the door to REVEAL Edward in a parka and gloves. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Chief Swan. I wanted to formally 
          introduce myself. I'm Edward.
          
          
          Edward extends his hand. Charlie takes it, but grunts 
          a 
          hello, resisting him.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I won't keep Bella out late 
          tonight. We're just going to go 
          play baseball with my family.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella's going to play baseball?
          
          
          Bella's equally surprised, but hides it.
          
          
          
          74.
          EDWARD
          Yes, sir, that's the plan.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Well. More power to you, I guess.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (looks him in the eyes)
          She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise.
          
          
           As Edward exits... Charlie holds Bella back.

          Your father thinks you should go to 
          an all-girl's school.
          
          
          BELLA
          No fair, reading Charlie's mind. 
          
          
          As they climb in the Jeep, Bella notices a baseball bat 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          And since when do vampires like baseball? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's the American pastime. Plus, 
          there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the 
          only time we can play. You'll see why.
          
          
          95 EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS - TWILIGHT 95
          
          
          Storm clouds gather in the sky as Bella and Edward pull up in 
          the Jeep. She takes in a rough baseball diamond, set into an 
          enormous field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. 
          
          
          Esme and Emmett come to greet Bella. 
          
          
          ESME
          Good thing you're here. We need 
          a 
          umpire. 
          
          
          EMMETT
          (big crooked grin)
          She thinks we cheat.
          
          
          
          75.
          ESME
          I know you cheat. Call �em as you 
          see �em, Bella.
          
          
          WHIP PAN to Alice on the Pitcher's Mound.
          
          
          ALICE
          It's time.
          
          
          -- Just as a deep RUMBLE of thunder shakes the forest.
          
          
          BEGIN MONTAGE - THE GAME
          
          
          And it's extraordinary. Bella stays by Esme who plays 
          catcher. Alice pitches with lightning-fast speed. Edward 
          and Emmett take positions in the outfield. 
          
          
          -- ROSALIE SMASHES the ball with the aluminum bat. It CRACKS 
          like thunder -- and is followed directly by real THUNDER. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (to Esme)
          Now I get why you need the thunder.
          
          
          The ball SHOOTS like a meteor deep into the forest, rocketing 
          through the trees. Edward disappears after it.
          
          
          BELLA
          That has to be a home run.
          
          
          ESME
          Edward's very fast.
          
          
          Rosalie darts around the bases, almost a blur -- Edward races out 
          of the forest with the ball and WHIPS it to home plate. WHAP! 
          Esme catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in.
          
          
          BELLA
          Yer out?
          
          
          Esme nods... Amazed, Bella watches as DR. CULLEN hits a line 
          drive. Edward and Emmett race for the catch, DIVING 15 feet 
          and COLLIDING with such might that it sounds like enormous 
          boulders falling. They miss the ball -- Dr. Cullen is safe! 
          
          
          JASPER WHACKS the next pitch -- deep into the forest. But 
          before Edward can chase it, Alice suddenly GASPS. 
          
          
          ALICE
          Stop! I didn't see them..
          . 
          
          
          They all stop. Edward is immediately at Bella's side. The 
          family instantly gathers at home plate. 
          
          
          ALICE
          They're traveling so quickly 
          -
          
          
          
          76.
          ROSALIE
          You said they left the county -
          -
          
          
          ALICE
          They did, but then they heard us..
          .
          (looking at Edward)
          And changed their minds.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (to Bella)
          Put your hair down 
          -
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Like that'll help. I could smell 
          her from across the field. 
          
          
          Edward ignores Rosalie as he arranges Bella's hair.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I shouldn't have brought you here. 
          I'm so sorry.
          
          
          She'd ask why, but suddenly, they all turn as one toward -
          
          THE EDGE OF THE FOREST
          
          
          There's a faint rustle... then James, Victoria and Laurent
          emerge. As they near, Bella SEES their bare feet, then the 
          deep BURGUNDY of their eyes. Laurent holds up the baseball. 
          
          
          LAURENT
          I believe this belongs to you.
          
          
          He tosses the ball (his casual toss is still blindingly fast) 
          to Dr. Cullen who easily catches it and smiles politely.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Thank you.
          
          
          LAURENT
          Could you use three more players?
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Of course.
          
          
          LAURENT
          I'm Laurent. This is Victoria. 
          And James.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Would you like to bat first?
          
          
          Laurent picks up a bat. The Cullens take the field. Dr. 
          Cullen is catcher, Edward is on first, with Bella behind him, 
          near the Jeep.
          
          
          
          77.
          Bella sees that Edward's eyes are locked onto James. Laurent
          is at bat first.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          I'm afraid your hunting activities have 
          caused something of a mess for us. 
          
          
          LAURENT
          Our apologies. We didn't realize 
          the territory had been claimed. 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Yes, we maintain a permanent 
          residence.
          
          
          The three newcomers exchange a look of surprise.
          
          
          LAURENT
          Really? Well, we won't be a problem 
          any more.
          
          
          VICTORIA
          The humans were tracking us, but we 
          led them East-
          
          
          Jasper pitches the ball -- Laurent SLAMS it -- but Alice is 
          up a tree is a flash and the ball slams into Alice's hand
          with a THWAP. Laurent is pissed, but James smiles ever so 
          slightly, delighted at the discovery of worthy opponents.
          
          
          James is up next and he POWER-SLAMS IT with AMAZING FORCE..
          .
          
          
          He runs past first, past Edward, past Bella..
          .
          
          
          CLOSE ON BELLA -- IN SLOW MOTION as the wind from the ball 
          ruffles her hair, carrying her scent, which floats to 
          -
          
          
          JAMES -- who suddenly SCREECHES to a halt. His head WHIPS 
          around at her and he lurches into a crouch, his nostrils 
          flaring, excitedly, eyes locked on Bella.
          
          
          JAMES
          You brought a snack.
          
          
          EDWARD springs in front of Bella, baring his teeth. A truly 
          menacing, feral SNARL rips from his throat. James GROWLS back.
          
          
          OVERHEAD SHOT: in a flash, the Cullens rush into position 
          behind Edward -- Laurent and Victoria line up behind James. 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          The girl is with us.
          
          
          
          78.
          LAURENT
          (trying to defuse 
          situation)
          We won't harm her.
          
          
          EMMETT
          (hungry for battle)
          Just try it.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          I think it best if you leave.
          
          
          LAURENT
          Yes, I can see the game is over. 
          We'll go now. James?
          
          
          But James' eyes don't leave Edward's. Laurent puts a hand on
          James' shoulder, and finally, James backs into the woods with
          his cohorts, disappearing. Once they're gone, Esme 
          immediately gathers up the bats-
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Get Bella out of here. We'll follow 
          them. 
          
          
          Dr. Cullen, Jasper and a resentful Rosalie race off after the 
          three vampires. Edward scoops Bella up as we 
          -
          
          
          SMASH TO:
          
          
          EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - ON THE JEEP - LATE TWILIGHT 96
          
          
          Edward whips Bella into the Jeep and straps her in -
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          James is a tracker. I saw his mind. 
          The hunt is his obsession, and my 
          reaction set him off -
          -
          
          
          -- The tires spin as Edward WHIPS the jeep around 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          -- We're a large clan of strong fighters 
          all protecting one vulnerable human. 
          
          
          (dark with disgust)
          I just made this his most exciting 
          game ever.
          
          
          Bella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just 
          wrought up on them all as..
          .
          
          
          THE JEEP CAREENS DOWN THE DIRT MOUNTAIN ROAD
          
          
          A jolting, death defying ride, SPLASHING through creeks, until 
          they reach 
          -

          97 EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 97
          
          
          THE JEEP speeds wildly down the road.
          
          
          EDWARD
          The first place he'll go is your 
          house. He'll track your scent 
          there.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (horrified)
          What?!? Charlie's there. He's in 
          danger because of me. Because of 
          us!
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (calmly)
          Then we'll lead the tracker away 
          from him. Somehow.
          
          
          He angrily WHIPS around a bend, MUD FLYING 
          -
          
          
          98 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 98
          
          
          Charlie watches a baseball game on T.V. as the door suddenly 
          BURSTS open to reveal Bella, crying, and Edward, devastated-
          
          
          BELLA
          I said, leave me alone! 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Bella, don't do this. Just think 
          about it, please 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          Get out! It's over.
          
          
          She SLAMS the door. Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella? What happened? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I have to get out of this place. 
          Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now.
          
          
          Bella runs upstairs. Charlie hurries after her 
          -
          
          
          99 INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 99
          
          
          Bella slams the door behind her. REVEAL Edward's already there,
          pulling things from her drawers and shoving them into a duffle 
          faster than humanly possible. Bella leans against the door. 
          
          
          
          80.
          BELLA
          (a pained whisper)
          I can't hurt him.
          
          
          Edward gives her a look, you have to. There's a KNOCK.
          
          
          INTERCUT Charlie on the other side. It's agony for both of them.
          
          
          CHARLIE 
          Bells. Did he hurt you?
          
          
          BELLA
          No, Dad. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Then what? Did he break up with you? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I broke up with him. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I thought you liked him?
          
          
          BELLA
          That's why I have to leave. I don't 
          want this. I want to go home.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (whispering)
          I'll be in the truck.
          
          
          And he disappears out the window. Bella gathers strength to 
          continue her performance. She opens the door to reveal Charlie. 
          He follows as she carries her duffle and truck keys into 
          -

          Bella charges down the stairs -- Charlie follows.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Your mother's not even in Phoenix. 
          
          
          BELLA
          She'll come home. I'll call her 
          from the road.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You can't drive home now. I'll take 
          you to the airport in the morning.
          
          
          BELLA
          I want to drive. I need time to 
          think. I'll pull into a motel in 
          a 
          few hours. I promise.
          
          
          She heads down the stairs. Charlie follows..

          Bella reaches the ground floor with Charlie on her heels. 
          She's almost to the door but Charlie blocks her. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          
          
          Bells, I know I'm not around much, 
          
          
          but I can change that. We can do 
          
          
          more things together.
          
          
          She takes a breath, hating herself for what she's about to say..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Like watch more baseball on the flat 
          
          
          screen? Or go to the Coffee Shop? 
          
          
          Same people, same steak, same berry 
          
          
          cobbler every night? That's you, 
          
          
          Dad. Not me.
          
          
          This hits Charlie hard. She can barely stand it, heads down 
          the stairs, as he takes a second to recover..
          .
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella... I just got you back.
          
          
          Which breaks Bella's heart... and forces her to deliver the
          final blow.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          And if I don't get out now, I'm 
          
          
          going get stuck here like mom did.
          
          
          Charlie is stunned, wounded. She takes advantage of his 
          shock, pushing past him out the door. 
          
          
          102 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 102
          
          
          Bella exits, heads to her truck. Fresh tears spring to her 
          eyes. 
          
          
          ANGLE ON THE WOODS 
          
          
          Trees, branches... and a pair of DEADLY EYES. James. He watches 
          from a distance as Bella pulls out. The truck moves off... and 
          so does James, leaving Charlie alone with his pain, staring out 
          the window.
          
          
          103 INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT 103
          
          
          Bella drives, wiping tears away. Suddenly Edward is outside 
          the car, near Bella's window. 
          
          
          
          82.
          EDWARD
          He'll forgive you.
          (off Bella's startled look)
          Slide over..
          .
          
          
          Bella slides over to the passenger side as Edward opens the 
          door, sliding in, and takes the wheel. Bella slumps.
          
          
          BELLA
          His face... I said the same words 
          my mother used when she left him. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          It was the only way he'd let you go. 
          
          
          Edward FLOORS it.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Your father's safe now, Bella. The 
          tracker is following us 
          -
          
          
          Suddenly, BOOM! - a dark figure LEAPS onto the bed of the 
          truck. Bella SCREAMS. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's alright. It's just Emmett. 
          Alice is in the car behind us. 
          
          
          She catches her breath. It kills him to see her so frightened. 
          She looks out the window as they drive through town..
          . 
          
          
          104 BELLA'S POV - EXT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP (CONT) - NIGHT 104
          
          
          The small, insulated town passes by in SLOW MOTION... INSIDE we 
          SEE Mike, Jessica, Eric and Angela laughing, flirting, innocent, 
          hopeful..
          .
          
          
          105 EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT 105
          
          
          Edward, Emmett and Alice rush Bella from the truck to the 
          house... but freeze when the door opens and Laurent exits. They 
          immediately take defensive positions but Dr. Cullen appears.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          He came to warn us. About James.
          
          
          They back down slightly. Laurent address Dr. Cullen.
          
          
          LAURENT
          I've grown tired of his games. But 
          he's got unparalleled senses. 
          Absolutely lethal. I've never seen 
          anything like him in three hundred 
          years ... And the woman, Victoria, 
          will back him. Don't underestimate 
          her.
          
          
          
          83.
          Dr. Cullen nods thanks. Laurent looks at Edward, apologetic. 
          
          
          LAURENT
          I'm truly sorry for what's been 
          unleashed here.
          
          
          And he moves off, disappearing into the woods..
          .
          
          
          106 INT. CULLEN HOUSE - FOUR CAR GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          
          The side door BURSTS OPEN as Edward and the Cullens enter, 
          followed by Bella. The lights flip on to reveal a pristine 
          garage; the Volvo, the red BMW, a black Mercedes sedan, an SUV. 
          
          
          Everyone but Rosalie springs into action, opening cupboards for 
          supplies - cell phones, extra batteries, maps, portable GPS units, 
          changes of clothes, cans of gasoline, etc. As they load up the 
          vehicles 
          -
          
          
          JASPER
          I've had to fight our kind before. 
          We're hard to kill.
          
          
          EDWARD
          But not impossible. We'll tear him up 
          
          
          EMMETT
          
          
          (with bloodlust)
          We'll rip him apart with our hands, 
          then burn the pieces 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          I don't relish killing another creature. 
          Even a sadistic one like James.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          If he doesn't get to one of us 
          first.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (horrified)
          This is insane. You can't put yourselves 
          in danger like this - for me.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Too late.
          
          
          Edward shoots Rosalie a look, but he grabs two sets of keys 
          off a hook, throwing one set, lightning fast, to Dr. Cullen 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'll run Bella south, while you lead 
          the tracker away 
          -
          
          
          
          84.
          DR. CULLEN
          No, Edward -- the tracker thinks 
          you won't leave Bella. He'll 
          follow you.
          
          
          ALICE
          I'll go with Bella. Jasper and 
          I 
          will drive her south.
          
          
          (facing him)
          I'll keep her safe, Edward.
          
          
          Edward agonizes. Frustrated. Alice steps forward.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (studies her, torn)
          Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
          
          
          She nods. An unspoken agreement. Edward finally surrenders 
          his keys to Alice. Then he opens one of Bella's suitcases,
          pulling out clothes, tossing them to 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the 
          tracker will pick up Bella's scent. 
          
          
          ROSALIE
          
          
          (dropping the clothes)
          Why should I? What is she to me? Just 
          a danger you've inflicted on us 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          
          
          (spinning on her)
          Rosalie. Bella is with Edward. She's 
          a part of this family now. And we 
          protect our family. 
          
          
          She glowers, but picks up the clothes. Dr. Cullen hits the door 
          opener and the massive METAL DOORS roll open. Dr. Cullen 
          squeezes Edward's shoulder before he and Esme climb into the
          SUV. Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars 
          -
          
          
          Amid this, Edward and Bella take a moment together.
          
          
          BELLA
          If any of you get hurt because of me 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          We won't, there are five of us, two of 
          them. When it's done, I'll come get you. 
          
          
          He pulls her closer, looking into her eyes. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're my life now.
          
          
          
          85.
          They drink each other in, possibly for the last time... as the SUV 
          PEELS out, WIPING THE FRAME 
          -
          
          
          107 EXT. HIGHWAY, PACIFIC NORTHWEST - DAWN 107
          
          
          The sun begins to rise on the empty road as a sleek, black 
          MERCEDES SEDAN with dark tinted windows BLASTS through frame 
          -
          
          
          108 INT. MERCEDES - SAME 108
          
          
          Jasper drives, Alice in the passenger seat. Bella is in the 
          back, her eyes red from crying. She talks on her cell phone 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Mom, it's me again. You must have 
          
          
          let your phone die. Anyway, I'm 
          
          
          not in Forks anymore but I'm okay. 
          
          
          I'll explain when you call.
          
          
          She hangs up, then faces back out the window, watching the green, 
          misty Olympic Peninsula speed past. Off Bella's face -
          
          A SERIES OF DISSOLVES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THEN THE NIGHT 
          
          
          -- show us the landscape as it changes from dark green 
          forests to stretches of grassy hillsides, to drier, browner 
          surroundings, until night falls and headlights lights flash 
          by us. Finally, we land in..
          .

          110 EXT. FOREST, OLYMPIC PENINSULA - DAY 110
          
          
          TREES BLOW PAST US at a blinding speed as we track Edward, 
          Rosalie, and Emmett who dart in and out of frame, blasting through 
          the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the lead.
          
          
          Edward stops, trying to read his enemy's thoughts. Rosalie 
          tears a tiny swatch of her shirt, leaves it on a FLOWERING 
          MAPLE TREE. And then they're gone.

          Esme and Dr. Cullen crouch atop a hill, looking down at the 
          river. In the distance, below, they SEE 
          -
          
          
          THEIR POV - ON THE LAKE - VICTORIA jogs into view. She then looks 
          in their direction. Once Dr. Cullen and Esme are assured she has 
          their scent, they continue over the hill's crest. 
          
          
          113 OMITTED 113

          86.
          James blasts past the FLOWERING MAPLE -- then stops, backtracks to 
          the tree, finds the tiny swatch of fabric. He starts off again..
          . 
          but stops, smells the fabric. Something's not right. He runs
          back in the opposite direction... Uh oh..
          .
          
          
          SMASH TO:
          
          
          115 INT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 115
          
          
          ON BELLA'S FACE: her eyes pop open. She's lying atop a bed, 
          fully clothed. She rises, reorienting.
          
          
          116 INT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 116
          
          
          The blinds are pulled. Alice and Jasper stare blankly at 
          a 
          
          
          T.V. set. Several plates of food crowd a table. Alice looks 
          up as Bella enters, looking at her cell phone. 
          BELLA
          I wish he'd call.
          
          
          ALICE
          You should eat.
          
          
          But Bella ignores the food. She sits heavily.
          
          
          BELLA
          They could get hurt. It's not 
          worth it.
          
          
          JASPER
          (insistent)
          Yes. It is. 
          
          
          She's taken aback. It's the first time he's engaged with her.
          
          
          JASPER
          Edward's changed since he found 
          you. And none of us want to look 
          into his eyes for the next hundred 
          years if he loses you. 
          
          
          (he looks forward again)
          It's worth it.
          
          
          Suddenly, Alice REELS. Jasper goes to her, Bella follows.
          
          
          JASPER
          What do you see?
          
          
          ALICE
          (with deep worry)
          The tracker. He just changed course..
          .
          
          
          Jasper quickly sets a pad of paper and pencil in front of her. 
          
          
          
          87.
          JASPER
          Where will it take him, Alice?
          
          
          PUSH IN ON ALICE'S FACE as we-
          
          
          FLASH POP TO - JAMES
          
          
          A disorienting vision of him standing in a room full of..
          .
          
          
          ALICE
          Mirrors. It's a room of mirrors.
          
          
          Alice begins to draw at HYPER SPEED, closing her eyes, trying 
          to see it clearly.
          
          
          BELLA
          How do the visions work? Edward 
          said they weren't always certain. 
          
          
          JASPER
          She sees the course people are on, 
          while they're on it. If they change 
          their minds, the visions change. 
          
          
          Bella looks over Alice's shoulder to see the drawing.
          
          
          BELLA
          So the course James is on now will 
          lead him to... a ballet studio?
          
          
          ALICE
          (looks up at her)
          You've been here?
          
          
          BELLA
          No. I don't know. I used to take 
          ballet lessons as a kid. The 
          school had an arch like that.
          
          
          JASPER
          Was your school here in Phoenix? 
          
          
          BELLA
          Yeah, around the corner from my house. 
          But I haven't been there in ten years.
          
          
          JASPER
          Do you have any reason to go now?
          
          
          BELLA
          No. Hell, no. I hated the place.
          
          
          Alice and Jasper share a look, trying to figure this out. 
          Suddenly, Bella JUMPS as her cell phone RINGS. She picks it 
          up. Sees the caller I.D. and exhales relief. She answers..

          Dr. Cullen drives the Jeep, fast, Emmett in the back, Edward in 
          the passenger seat on his cell phone. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm coming to get you. 
          (hates having to say 
          
          
          this)
          We lost the tracker. The woman is 
          still in the area. Rosalie and 
          Esme are protecting your father.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (sinking)
          This is my fault. You warned me, 
          but I didn't think. I just..

          change how we feel..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          No... we can't.
          (then)
          When will you get here?
          
          
          EDWARD
          In a couple hours. Then you and 
          I 
          will go somewhere. Together. The 
          others will keep hunting.
          
          
          (then, determined)
          Bella, I swear to you, I'll do whatever 
          it takes to make you safe again. 
          
          
          Off Bella, her eyes welling..

          Bella gathers her things, then her phone RINGS again. 
          
          
          INSERT CALLER I.D. -It reads �HOME.� Bella answers -

          HEAR RUSTLING on the line, as if Rene dropped the phone.
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Mom? Are you there?
          
          
          Then Bella HEARS a voice that sends a chill down her spine 
          -
          
          
          JAMES (O.S.
          )
          Nice house you have here. Not the 
          best on the block, but comfortable.

          VERY CLOSE ON JAMES, his sinister eyes and vicious smile.
          
          
          JAMES
          I was prepared to wait for you. 
          But then Mom came home after she 
          received a very worried call from 
          your Dad. It all worked out quite 
          well.
          
          
          Bella's eyes are wild with fear.
          
          
          JAMES
          I must say, Forks High School doesn't 
          protect its students' privacy very 
          well. It was just too easy for 
          Victoria to find your previous address. 
          
          
          RENE (O.S.

          Bella? Bella?..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Leave my mother out of this.
          
          
          JAMES
          You're protective of her. That's 
          nice. You can still save her. But 
          you'll need to get away from your 
          friends. Can you do that? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I... don't think so.
          
          
          
          90.
          JAMES
          If your mother's life depends on it? 
          
          
          Bella is terrified, but there's no choice here. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Where should I meet you?
          
          
          James grins as he fingers a PHOTO of Bella that's attached to
          the refrigerator with a magnet. It's the same photo Charlie
          has of her, age 7, in a tutu, sitting on the floor. 
          
          
          JAMES
          The old ballet studio around the 
          corner. And I'll know if you bring 
          anyone along. Poor mommy would pay 
          the price for that mistake.
          
          
          (sniffs the air)
          She smells like you. Delicious.
          
          
          STAY ON BELLA as she hangs up, panicked. She starts flinging 
          open drawers, searching for a weapon - a pen, a sewing kit. 
          Useless. Then she remembers..
          .
          
          
          Her purse. She dumps out the contents, and FINDS the pepper 
          spray Charlie gave her. She clings to it, her only protection 
          now.

          Bella walks through the lobby, scanning for Jasper and Alice. 
          She spots them outside under the porte cacher, loading the 
          Mercedes, deep in a heated discussion. She slips out the 
          opposite door, rushes toward a Taxi and jumps in, closes the 
          door. The DRIVER is an elderly woman with a hacking COUGH. 
          
          
          BELLA

          courage)
          8th and Palo Verde, please.
          
          
          The taxi pulls out. Bella watches the hotel disappear. Off 
          her FACE IN THE REAR WINDOW..

          Once again, we see the polished malls, the manicured cactus 
          gardens. All empty for the night. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.

          Bella climbs out of the taxi. It pulls away, leaving her on the 
          curb facing the deserted building. Bella twirls her mother's
          ring around her finger, then reaches for the pepper spray.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          
          
          I can't bring myself to regret the 
          
          
          decisions that brought me face to 
          
          
          face with death... they also 
          
          
          brought me to Edward.
          
          
          She slips the pepper spray into her jeans pocket. She wraps 
          her purse strap around her wrist. She takes a breath, 
          approaches the school. Peers in the windows. The blinds are 
          drawn. But from inside, we HEAR a faint sound..
          .
          
          
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          Bella? Bella? 
          
          
          It's time. Bella goes to the front door. It's unlocked.

          Bella cautiously enters this grand, empty room of mirrors. 
          A 
          ballet bar wraps around the walls -
          -
          
          
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          Bella, where are you? 
          
          
          Bella whirls, trying to find its source. She follows the sound to 
          a cleaning supply CLOSET. She throws open the door to FIND 
          -
          
          
          A T.V. - ON SCREEN A VIDEO PLAYS - Bella, age 7, hides in the 
          very closet the T.V. is in now. Little Bella looks up at us.

          RENE (O.S.

          Don't you want to dance, baby? 
          
          
          Little Bella shakes her head stubbornly. The frame jiggles 
          as Rene hands someone the camera. Rene, ten years younger, 
          appears on screen and kneels next to Bella.
          
          
          BELLA
          Everyone makes fun of me.
          
          
          RENE
          But you're a wonderful dancer.

          Mom, I suck. 
          
          
          LAUGHTER behind Bella. She spins, trying to locate James in 
          the mirrors. 
          
          
          JAMES
          That's my favorite part. Stubborn 
          child, weren't you?
          
          
          Bella's face flushes with rage... and relief. 
          
          
          BELLA
          She's not here.
          
          
          JAMES
          Sorry. But you really made it too easy.
          
          
          Visible in the mirror, he sighs, disappointed. Then he steps 
          up next to her and points a VIDEO CAMERA at Bella. 
          
          
          JAMES
          So to make things more entertaining, 
          I'm going to make a little film of our 
          time together. Borrowed this from 
          your house. Hope you don't mind. 
          
          
          (turns it on)
          And... action!
          
          
          Bella FLINGS her purse at him, and runs for the door.
          
          
          JAMES
          Excellent! An escape attempt.
          
          
          Suddenly, he's right behind her. She freezes. 
          
          
          JAMES
          It'll break Edward's little heart.
          
          
          He smells her hair. Touches her throat. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward has nothing to do with this.
          
          
          
          93.
          JAMES
          He will. His rage will make for 
          more interesting sport than his 
          feeble attempt to protect you.
          
          
          He's having too much fun to notice --the peppers spray in
          her hand. She spins around and sprays him. 
          
          
          Then she runs, as James REELS back briefly. But he leaps 
          over her and lands RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER. 
          
          
          Amused, he flings her across the floor like a bowling ball. 
          She SMASHES hard into a mirrored column. James captures it 
          on film. 
          
          
          JAMES
          Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. 
          I chose my stage well.
          
          
          He advances toward her.
          
          
          JAMES
          Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that 
          what makes you special? Because 
          frankly, I don't see it. 
          
          
          He inhales as if he can taste her already 
          -
          
          
          JAMES
          Too bad he didn't have the strength 
          to turn you. Instead, he kept you 
          this fragile little human. It's 
          cruel, really. 
          
          
          James flips on the camera, but the lens is coated with pepper 
          spray. He tries to wipe it off.
          
          
          JAMES
          Well done! You've succeeded in 
          annoying me.
          
          
          He STOMPS on her shin! HEAR her tibia SNAP! Bella SCREAMS in 
          agony. 
          
          
          JAMES
          Tell Edward how much it hurts. 
          
          
          Abruptly, the camera is in her face 
          -
          
          
          JAMES
          Tell him to avenge you.
          
          
          BELLA
          No! Edward, don't..
          . 
          
          
          
          94.
          James inhales as her blood pools. He leans in, hungry. Bella, 
          half-conscious, watches him turn the camera on his own face 
          -
          
          
          VIDEO CAMERA'S POV - ECU ON JAMES' FACE
          
          
          JAMES
          Cut! The end.
          
          
          Suddenly -- JAMES IS KNOCKED OUT OF FRAME! 
          
          
          He rises to find himself face to face with Edward. James 
          CHARGES Edward, forcing him up against a column. 
          
          
          JAMES
          You're alone... because you're 
          faster than the others. But not 
          stronger.
          
          
          James SMASHES Edward's face into the mirror until it cracks.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm strong enough to kill you.
          
          
          Edward FLINGS James backwards -- SMASHING through 
          a 
          freestanding mirror -- into the doorway. He scoops Bella up 
          and leaps toward the balcony exit door -- when suddenly he 
          and Bella are JERKED downward.
          
          
          James YANKS Edward violently onto the floor -- KNOCKING Bella 
          out of his arms -- as James FLINGS Edward up into the top 
          window -- EMBEDDING him in the casement and bricks. 
          
          
          James crouches beside Bella. He grabs her HAND 
          -
          
          
          Looking directly at Edward with a sinister grin -- he SINKS 
          HIS TEETH into Bella's hand! She SCREAMS in agony. 
          
          
          Edward's rage ERUPTS -- he climbs out of the window casement 
          and SUICIDE-DIVE-BOMBS James, savagely PLOWING him through 
          the floorboards.
          
          
          ON BELLA -- as the venom travels through her veins. 
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - dark figures twist and fight, in and out of 
          focus. 
          
          
          Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN to see the EXPLOSIVE RAW REALITY 
          of James KICKING Edward, delivering death blows when -
          -
          
          
          Suddenly Edward's hand SHOOTS UP and GRABS James' ankle.
          Edward ROARS up to his feet and SWINGS James around like 
          a 
          baseball bat, SMASHING him into mirror after mirror. 
          
          
          James is battered, beaten. Bella moans -- and the sound of 
          her pain slices through Edward. In an animalistic fury, 
          Edward BITES OFF a piece of James' flesh ..
          .
          
          
          
          95.
          WHIP PAN from Bella's horrified face to DR. CULLEN --now
          standing beside Edward, placing a hand on his son's shoulder.
          
          
          Edward turns to see his father -- and EMMETT, JASPER, and 
          ALICE, dropping down from the balcony.
          
          
          Edward's expression changes --he realizes he's gone too far.
          He backs off as his siblings crouch into attack mode and 
          LUNGE at James like a pack of animals.
          
          
          Dr. Cullen rushes to the injured Bella who SCREAMS again in 
          pain. Edward dashes toward her -
          -
          
          
          BELLA'S POV -ON THE THREE CULLEN SIBLINGS, going in and out
          of focus... it almost looks like a tribal dance as they rip 
          out the floorboards and build a fire ... it's like a funeral
          pyre as they rip James apart, throwing limbs into the fire..
          . 
          
          
          BACK ON BELLA -- as Edward reaches her side. Dr. Cullen works 
          fast to assess her wounds, focusing on a massive bleed from her 
          leg. But clearly her hand hurts the most. She writhes in pain. 
          
          
          INTERCUT BELLA'S DISORIENTED POV WITH THE CHAOTIC REALITY:
          
          
          Dr. Cullen applies pressure to the gash on her thigh -
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Her femoral artery's been severed. 
          She's losing too much blood 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          It's on fire! My hand!
          
          
          EDWARD
          Venom -
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          
          
           (working on Bella)
          
          
          You have to make a choice. Either 
          
          
          let the change happen 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          No!
          
          
          BELLA'S POV -ALICE appears behind Edward, fuzzy, indistinct.
          
          
          ALICE
          It's going to happen. I've seen it 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          It doesn't have to be that way.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Alice, find me a tourniquet. 
          A 
          rag, a shirt.
          
          
          
          96.
          Alice holds her nose and avoids the blood as she rips the 
          sleeve off her blouse and kneels to aid Dr. Cullen. 
          
          
          BELLA
          It's burning!
          
          
          EDWARD
          What's the other choice? You said 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (to Alice)
          Tighter, above the knee 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          Carlisle.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          You can try to suck the venom out. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I -- won't be able to stop 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Find the will to stop. But choose, 
          she only has minutes left.
          
          
          Edward looks down at Bella, thrashing in pain. Finally, 
          Edward takes her hand. She tries to pull it away.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's alright, Bella. I'll make it 
          go away. 
          
          
          He looks at her - then starts to suck the venom from her 
          hand. They never take their eyes off one another, the 
          connection palpable, intense..
          . 
          
          
          CLOSE ON BELLA'S EYES -wild with pain. But subsiding..
          .
          
          
          CLOSE ON EDWARD'S EYES -the frenzy has begun. He sucks
          harder. Hungrily. Anguished, he wants to stop but can't. 
          Dr. Cullen's voice sounds miles away..
          .
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Stop. Her blood is clean, you're 
          killing her.
          
          
          -- but the bloodlust is too strong. He is killing her. Bella 
          looks at him, forgivingly, as she begins to lose consciousness..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA'S POV -ON EDWARD -growing blurry... he disappears
          into the blinding light. It's as if she's underwater, like
          her dreams..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          Death is peaceful. Easy.
          
          
          
          97.
          Bella starts to float away... we're losing her..
          .
          Suddenly from the darkness, Edward reaches out a hand..
          .
          A brilliant light flares..
          .
          
          
          134 BELLA'S FACE APPEARS IN THE WHITENESS
          Eyes closed. But they slowly open. She squints at the light. 
          BELLA
          Life... is harder..
          . 
          An oxygen tube rests under her nose. She reaches for it, 
          confused. A hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus.
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          
          
          You're awake, baby! You're okay!!
          !
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
          Bella lies in a hospital bed. Bandaged, leg in a cast. In bad 
          
          
          shape. Rene hovers over her, tears in her eyes. On the dresser, 

          SEE get well cards and a PHOTO MONTAGE of her friends from Forks.
          BELLA
          Edward? Where's -
          RENE
          He's asleep.
          She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward �sleeps.
          �
          
          
          RENE
          He never leaves. And your dad's 
          down in the cafeteria. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What... happened?
          
          
          RENE
          Baby, you fell down two flights of 
          stairs and through a window. 
          
          
          Bella is drawing a blank, confused. Rene jogs her memory 
          -
          RENE
          Edward came here to convince you to 
          come back to Forks. His father 
          brought him down. You went to their 
          hotel but you tripped on the stairs. 
          A moment... then Bella realizes it's a cover story. She nods.
          BELLA
          Sounds like me.
          
          
          
          98.
          Rene's cell phone BEEPS. She opens it. Reads a text, starts
          typing in a reply.
          
          
          RENE
          It's Phil. He's worried about you.
          
          
          BELLA
          Mom, you're... texting.
          
          
          RENE
          
          
           (smiling)
          I told him to stay in Florida. The 
          Suns signed him! 
          
          
          BELLA
          That's great mom.
          
          
          RENE
          Jacksonville is always sunny and 
          you'll have your own bathroom..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Mom, wait. I want to live in 
          Forks. I have Dad..
          . 
          
          
          (re: the get well cards)
          ... and friends..
          .
          
          
          RENE
          (re: Edward)
          And he's there. 
          
          
          Bella shrugs, conceding the truth.
          
          
          RENE
          Charlie doesn't like him. Blames 
          him for your leaving. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What do you think?
          
          
          RENE
          
          
          (lowering her voice)
          I think that boy is in love with 
          you.
          
          
          Bella smiles. Rene grins. Bella glances at Edward.
          
          
          BELLA
          Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad? 
          I 
          want to talk to him. Apologize.
          
          
          RENE
          I'm sure he doesn't care about 
          that, Baby. But I�ll go get him.
          
          
          
          99.
          Rene kisses Bella's forehead. Exits. Bella watches her go.
          The door shutting behind her. Bella turns back to find 
          Edward standing next to her with deep concern. Her eyes 
          well. He kisses her forehead soothingly. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Is James - did you -- 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD
          We took care of him. And the 
          woman, Victoria, she ran off.
          
          
          She closes her eyes with relief, then looks at him. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm alive because of you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (darkens)
          You're in here because of me. 
          
          
          Her wounds cause him pain. He strokes her face.
          
          
          EDWARD
          The worst of it... was thinking 
          I 
          couldn't stop -
          
          BELLA
          But you did. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. 
          Where I can't hurt you anymore..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          What? No! I want to be with you! 
          I 
          don't want 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (sitting next to her)
          Sssh. It's alright. I'm not going 
          anywhere. I'm right here..
          .
          
          
          He wraps an arm around her. As she curls up in his arms..

          136 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEAUTIFUL LATE AFTERNOON 136
          
          
          At a picnic table, Charlie cleans a fish with a big knife. 
          Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in an elegant 
          suit. But even calm Edward is unnerved by Charlie's glare. The
          front door opens and they look up to see 
          -
          
          
          BELLA --framed in the doorway in a stunning long dress. Edward 
          is enchanted. Bella descends the steps with difficulty, due to 
          her LEG CAST. Charlie edges out Edward to help her down. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Alice lent me the dress. It was the 
          
          
          only thing that would fit over my 
          
          
          cast. Is it too... 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          You're perfect... I'll take good 
          
          
          care of her, Chief. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Heard that before. 
          
          
          Edward moves to open the car door. Charlie holds Bella back.
          
          
          CHARLIE 
          (sotto)
          I put new pepper spray in your bag.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Dad.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          ... and... you look beautiful.
          
          
          Father and daughter share a smile..

          137 EXT./INT. MANSION, VIEW POINT INN - TWILIGHT 137
          
          
          Edward's Volvo pulls up to this lovely inn. He helps Bella
          out of the car, and begins to guide her through the dining 
          room. Mr. Molina and other teachers are there. We may 
          notice the back of a Redhead, mingling with the chaperones.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          I can't believe you're making me do 
          
          
          this.
          
          
          He just grins. Edward guides her around a corner to..
          .
          
          
          138 EXT. MANSION BACKYARD (CONTINUOUS) - TWILIGHT 138
          
          
          THE PROM - Monte Carlo style. Gaming tables and roulette 
          wheels. Guys in tuxes and girls in gowns gamble for prizes, 
          dance and socialize. 
          
          
          
          101.
          BELLA
          You really are trying to kill me.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Prom is an important rite of 
          passage. I don't want you to miss 
          anything. 
          
          
          She can't be mad at him, just shakes her head affectionately.
          They continue into the prom. Several heads turn. Bella sees 
          -
          
          
          THE DANCE FLOOR, where a gap has formed. In the middle, two 
          couples whirl gracefully. It's Alice and Jasper, Rosalie and 
          Emmett, looking absolutely stunning. 
          
          
          Rosalie glances over; indifference has replaced fury. But 
          Alice waves brightly. Bella returns it with a smile as we 
          hear a crossfade into the next track-
          
          
          BELLA'S POV -- THE DJ BOOTH 
          -
          
          
          It's Eric at the turntables, making the room bounce! Next to
          him, Angela wears the headphones, flipping through a stack of 
          vinyl. They nod at Bella -- she shoots them a smile when -
          -
          
          
          A FLASHBULB gets her attention 
          -
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - PHOTOGRAPHER'S STATION
          
          
          Mike and Jessica stand in front of an Aston Martin cut-out. 
          Bella catches their eye -- Mike does his best James Bond 
          impersonation. Jessica poses like Pussy Galore.
          
          
          Edward smirks, then turns to Bella 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          Shall we? 
          
          
          BELLA
          (laughs, then realizes)
          You're serious.
          
          
          He doesn't wait for an answer, more or less CARRIES her to
          the DANCE FLOOR -- then places her feet atop his own... and 
          starts to move. She actually begins to enjoy it.
          
          
          EDWARD
          See? You're dancing.
          
          
          BELLA
          At prom.
          
          
          As they dance, she feels his grace, his strength. Becomes 
          thoughtful. Finally, she looks at him.
          
          
          
          102.
          BELLA
          Edward... why did you save me?
          (off his questioning look)
          If you'd let the venom spread, 
          I could've been like you by now.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (stops, horrified)
          You don't know what you're saying. 
          You don't want this.
          
          
          BELLA
          I want you. Always.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (angry)
          I won't end your life for you. 
          
          
          He keeps dancing, slowly, hoping his was the last word.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm dying anyway. Every minute, 
          I get closer, older 
          
          EDWARD
          That's how it's supposed to happen. 
          
          BELLA
          Not the way Alice saw it. 
          (off his sharp look)
          I heard her. She saw me like you. 
          
          EDWARD
          Her visions change, Bella. 
          
          BELLA
          Based on what someone decides. And 
          I've decided.
          
          
          He looks at her, angry. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Is that what you dream about? 
          Becoming a monster? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I dream about being with you forever. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You really want this?
          
          
          BELLA
          Yes.
          
          
          He lowers his lips to her neck. One bite is all it would take. 
          
          
          
          103.
          EDWARD
          You're ready right now?
          
          
          BELLA
          Yes.
          
          
          His lips hover over her skin, a long beat... then he presses his 
          lips to her throat. Not a bite. A kiss. He looks at her.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're going to have a long and 
          happy life with me. Isn't that 
          enough?
          
          
          She looks at him... and finally smiles.
          
          
          BELLA
          For now.
          
          
          They WHIRL around, gliding on his grace, never looking away from 
          one another, as we CRANE UP on them, in each other's arms..
          .
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.)
          No one will surrender tonight. But 
          I won't give in. I know what I want.
          
          
          CONTINUE UP AND BACK on the dance floor. We realize ..
          
          ... someone's watching it, looking down from the window of 
          a second floor hotel room in the Inn. The MUSIC wafting up in 
          echoes. PULL BACK to REVEAL..
          
          VICTORIA, turning from the window. She's stylishly dressed
          now, but seething -- a low, sinister SNARL in the back of her 
          throat. PUSH IN FAST ON HER FACE, AND INTO HER BURGUNDY EYES 
          filled with vengeance as we 
          -
          
          
          SMASH TO BLACK. 

Madagascar Escape 2 Africa



Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa Script
  
  
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

  
No, no, son. Over here.

  
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.

  
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up

  
and be like your daddy someday,
you gotta learn how to fight.

  
Da-da.

  
Now, Alakay, let me
show you something, OK?

  
You see this mark?

  
You and me are the same.

  
When you're bigger,
you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.

  
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

  
No, Alakay. No dancing!

  
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

  
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one. I'm...

  
Now, come on, let's try it again.

  
No, Alakay.

  
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

  
It's so disappointing when they
don't grow up the way you want.

  
Makunga. You're not
challenging me again, are you?

  
Look on the bright side. After I defeat
you and become alpha lion,

  
you'll have more time
to spend with your pathetic son.

  
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:

  
Why do you want
to become the alpha lion?

  
I'm better looking, I have better hair,
I'm deceivingly smart...

  
...and I want everyone else
to do what I say.

  
We fight on three. One...

  
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.

  
Two, three!

  
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.

  
Don't you forget it.

  
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

  
Alakay?

  
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

  
This one's a beauty.

  
He'll be worth a few bucks.

  
Itjust gets easier and easier.

  
Daddy!

  
Alakay! Alakay!

  
Alakay!

  
Da-da!

  
No! No! No!

  
Alakay!

  
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you! Hold on!

  
Da-da!

  
Alakay!

  
Daddy!

  
I've been around the world
in the pouring rain

  
Feeling out of place
and feeling strange

  
Take me to a place
where they know my name

  
'Cause I ain't met nobody
that looks the same

  
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

  
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

  
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

  
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

  
I need my peoples, my peoples
Take me to my peoples

  
Play thatjungle fever
Show 'em some love

  
Show love

  
Just gotta have someone
Gotta have someone

  
To relate to, to relate to

  
I'm feeling right at home

  
Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home

  
Feeling right at home
I'm feeling right at home

  
See I been traveling
Been traveling forever...

  
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.

  
He's kind of a showoff.

  
You think he's cute?

  
Roar!!

  
The King of New York City...

  
...Alex the Lion!

  
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

  
The guy's an animal.

  
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

  
Come on, where would we go on vacation?

  
I don't know about you,
but I want to go to Connecticut!

  
On the loose, several animals, including
the world famous Alex the Lion,

  
escaped from
the Central Park Zoo tonight.

  
The escapees were cornered
in Grand Central Station.

  
He was a very bad kitty.

  
Animal rights activists,
who convinced zoo officials

  
to have the animals sent to Africa,

  
were stunned to learn
that the freighter carrying the animals

  
was reported missing today.

  
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers
have gathered at the zoo

  
to mourn the loss
of their beloved zoo animals.

  
The question on everyone's mind,
where are they now?

  
I like to move it, move it

  
He likes to move it, move it

  
She likes to move it, move it

  
- We like to
- Move it!

  
Come on! Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!

  
- We like to
- Move it!

  
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!

  
Glad we could introduce
you to the toilet.

  
If you ever come look us up in
Manhattan, feel free to call first.

  
Seriously though, call. OK?

  
Settle down, everybody. Be quiet!

  
You can't leave without this!

  
Surprise, freaks!

  
Shake it! Shake it.

  
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

  
I'm a lady! Not really!
It's me, King Julien!

  
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!

  
Hey, freaks! You will be very glad
to hear that I am coming with you.

  
Oh, no, thank you.

  
Yes, thank you. It's my plane!

  
Until I return with the spoils
from the new country...

  
...Stevie will be in charge!

  
I don't think they like that idea.

  
What are you saying, Stevie?

  
No.

  
Could we? No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?

  
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

  
Let them eat cake!

  
King Julien, wait for me!

  
I'm all packed! I have
a whole itinerary planned!

  
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

  
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

  
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

  
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!

  
- Struts.
- Check.

  
- Flaps.
- Check.

  
- Engine. Coffee maker.
- Check.

  
You guys!

  
Oopsie-daisy!

  
That has to be the second biggest
slingshot I've ever seen.

  
But it'll have to do. Attention.

  
This is your captain speaking.

  
In the event of an emergency,
place the vest over your head

  
then kiss your... good-bye.

  
New York City, here we come!

  
Pray to your personal God
this hunk ofjunk flies.

  
Personal God, hunk? What?

  
We are go, sir.

  
Open the door! I'm outside!

  
If cabin pressure is lost,

  
place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expression.

  
Miss, aren't these supposed
to be attached to my seat?

  
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!

  
Launch!

  
- Launch!
- Launch!

  
Gremlin!

  
Hey, Mort.

  
Hi!

  
That was weird.

  
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.

  
You got Madagascar on the brain.

  
I know I'm gonna miss it.

  
It was incredible. I think it'll seem
more fun the further we are from it.

  
Like when you bit me on the butt?

  
I'm gonna take that thing you're
holding onto and use it onstage.

  
It's all part of my little actor's salad
bar of emotional tidbits.

  
Are the butts next to the croutons?

  
You don't need to be sarcastic.

  
When we get back, I might sign up
for the breeding program.

  
Breeding program?

  
We reach a point when we
want to meet somebody.

  
Settle down, have a relationship.

  
I can see that.

  
What? Like dating?

  
Yeah, dating.

  
Other... other guys?

  
What do you mean, other guys?

  
Darn it!

  
What is holding up
that beverage service?!

  
I'm gonna go check.

  
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.

  
It's so funny!

  
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!

  
To laugh!

  
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.

  
It's nothing personal. We're just better
than you. Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

  
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?

  
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

  
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

  
We were checking on our drink order.

  
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

  
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?

  
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?

  
What happened to
the separation of the classes?

  
I'm sure this democracy thing
is just a fad.

  
We'll go out for pineapple,
my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

  
Skipper, look.

  
Analysis.

  
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate
something unusual, like a malfunction.

  
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

  
That too, sir.

  
Right! Rico?

  
Manual!

  
Problemo solved.

  
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?

  
We've lost engine one...

  
...and engine two is no longer on fire.

  
Buckle up, boys.

  
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

  
Attention! This is your captain.

  
I have good and bad news. The good
news is, we're landing immediately.

  
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

  
When it comes to air travel,
we know you have no choice.

  
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

  
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!

  
I can fly!

  
This could be it, Marty! I want you to
know you are a one-in-a-million friend!

  
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

  
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!

  
I broke your iPod!

  
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!

  
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!

  
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!

  
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!

  
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

  
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book. Or the beach.

  
Goodness, doll,
you're shaking like a leaf.

  
Rico, you've had your fun.

  
Pull up.

  
Gear down.

  
Gently. You just want
to kiss the ground.

  
Just a peck, a smooch,
like you'd kiss your sister.

  
I said, kiss it!

  
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.

  
I believe that's checkmate.

  
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!

  
Oh, we're here.

  
What in the world?

  
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?

  
I'm OK. I'm alive.

  
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.

  
Kowalski, casualty report.

  
Two passengers unaccounted for.

  
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.

  
Who says a penguin can't fly?

  
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some
reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

  
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?

  
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

  
We should be up and running
in, say, six to nine months.

  
- Sixty-nine months?!
- No, six to nine months.

  
Kowalski, I say we use
this setback to our advantage.

  
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.

  
How do you estimate that?

  
Pretty boy! Why don't
you and your friends dig a latrine.

  
Hold on. Who made you king
of the plane wreck?

  
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.

  
Who gives you the authority
to put me in charge?

  
OK, then I'll remain in charge.

  
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

  
You and your hippie friends
stay out of our hair.

  
Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

  
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.

  
Higher mammals! Stay with us.

  
We could use your front cortexes
and opposable thumbs.

  
Phil! I should wash
your hands out with soap.

  
How in the hell-o
will they fix this plane?!

  
You know, grit and spit and spit.

  
A lot of spit and grit and
stick-to-it-iveness.

  
That don't sound too promising.

  
You're right. We're stuck here.

  
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.

  
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

  
Behold! The lion!

  
- People!
- There is much to see. Moving on.

  
Wait, wait, wait! People!

  
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!

  
- People! Stop!
- Help us!

  
If you stop, I'll autograph those!

  
I know you!

  
You.

  
It's the bad kitty.

  
How do you like some of that?!

  
Come in, Tokyo!

  
Right in the batteries.

  
You think an old lady
can't take care of herself?

  
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!

  
Thank you, dear.

  
Moving on!

  
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?!

  
Out of my mind?

  
Who's out of my mind now?

  
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.

  
Out of my mind. We're going home.

  
Message E-4.

  
The service user has roamed
outside the coverage area.

  
Please try again later.

  
Am I trippin'?

  
All those zebras... like me.

  
- Where are we?
- San Diego.

  
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

  
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.

  
Africa?

  
It's got to be.

  
Our ancestral crib.

  
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

  
No, it's more than that. It's like...

  
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

  
It's like Roots!

  
No, it's like...

  
...déjà vu, like I've been here before.

  
How!

  
How!

  
Me Alex!

  
Me and me friends fly,

  
fly in great metal bird.

  
Then plummet!

  
Smash ground!

  
Go boom!

  
Then here we emerge.

  
We offer only happiness

  
and good greetings.

  
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

  
Yeah. We just... yeah.

  
I thought... Sorry.

  
You came from off the reserve?

  
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo,
actually.

  
Don't strain yourself.

  
What's going on here?

  
They say they're from off the reserve.

  
That's impossible. Only people
come from off the reserve.

  
You look familiar. Do I know you?

  
How could you survive the hunters?

  
We didn't see any hunters.

  
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

  
This watering hole doesn't need
any more mouths to feed.

  
So skedaddle back
to where you came from.

  
Is there a manager we could talk to?

  
I see. You're here to challenge me!

  
What? No! No.

  
That's what it looks like to me!

  
Zuba! Wait.

  
I'm trying to take care of business...

  
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

  
Alakay?

  
Is that you?

  
No, it's Alex. lx. Like New York Knicks.

  
Zuba, look!

  
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.

  
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

  
A mark.

  
All right, this is a little weird.

  
Honey, he's come home.

  
What?

  
You've come home.

  
Son.

  
Dad.

  
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

  
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

  
I got a mom and dad!

  
My baby's alive!

  
Dad!

  
My son!

  
My son is home!

  
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

  
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!

  
I thought you hated Zuba.

  
No, I do. I do. I do.
I hate him. Oh, I do.

  
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

  
I'm going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

  
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

  
Make way!
Move out of the way! Stand aside!

  
New York!

  
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

  
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!

  
This calls for a celebration!

  
Maurice, I think they like me.

  
You've got to love
a non-hostile takeover!

  
Chukka-chukka what?

  
Excuse me. I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.

  
Hey, Marty!

  
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?

  
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'.

  
That's right! Crack-a-lackin'.

  
You guys speak
my crack-a-lackin' language.

  
What? You don't have doctors here?

  
Not anymore.

  
Well, what if you catch a cold?

  
We go over to the dying holes
and we die.

  
You guys really need a doctor.

  
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?

  
Me? A doctor?

  
It's raining men. Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.

  
Why don't you have a man? You got worms?

  
Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls.

  
Manhattan is short on two things,
parking and hippos.

  
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son

  
is a doggone king!
The King of New York!

  
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.

  
All right. This one
always knocks 'em dead.

  
Roar!

  
Look out. The King is mad.
The King is mad!

  
Let's welcome him back
into the pride with open arms!

  
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

  
Me? I've always wanted
to be part of a herd!

  
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!

  
How do I look?

  
Technically, a traditional witch doctor
has a bone through his nose.

  
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

  
Voilà! He's a witch doctor!

  
My mother will be so happy.

  
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

  
Here he comes.

  
I like 'em big

  
I like 'em chunky

  
I like 'em big
I like 'em plumpy

  
I like 'em round
With somethin' somethin'

  
They like my sound
They think I'm funky

  
Goodness, girl... you huge.

  
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

  
You as quick as you are hefty.

  
So you're Moto Moto?

  
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

  
I kind of like it, fatso.

  
I'll see you around, girl. It won't
be hard, because you so... plumpy.

  
Oops!

  
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

  
but some of the lions were wondering
when you plan to banish your son.

  
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.

  
They're griping that Alakay
never went through

  
the rite of passage,
blah, blah, blah,

  
so technically speaking, he can't be
a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

  
I forgot about the rite of passage.

  
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

  
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

  
Young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills.

  
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

  
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.

  
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

  
I want to be Alaki.

  
- Alakay.
- Alakay! Even better.

  
We will hold the rite
of passage in the morning!

  
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

  
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."

  
That's my boy!

  
I'm a private dancer

  
A dancer for money

  
Any old music will do

  
Beautiful, isn't it?

  
It's amazing.

  
Guys...

  
...this is where we belong.

  
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

  
Oh, I like that one.

  
It works on many levels.

  
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

  
- That, too.
- Absolutely.

  
Stations.

  
Stage one. Go!

  
Oh, no! What have I done?

  
Come on, take the bait.

  
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.

  
Is it dead?

  
Stage two! Go, go, go!

  
I will give him the kiss of life.

  
Rico!

  
Rico!

  
Reverse!

  
Gas!

  
Music!

  
No! Stop! Stop!

  
Stop!

  
Come back!

  
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

  
Is she dead?

  
No!

  
You hoodlums!

  
Good heavens! Are you OK?

  
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

  
My handbag. Such a good boy.

  
Nana can't survive without it.

  
You are one tough cookie.

  
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

  
OK, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

  
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...

  
Where are you going?

  
I'm not staying here to be attacked
by more animals! I'm too old to die.

  
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up!

  
Please! We need to stay...

  
...together.

  
Fine! We'll go that way!

  
Does anyone want a hard candy?

  
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.

  
And right here... OK, are you ready?

  
This is where you always slept.

  
Oh, man!

  
- Was this mine?
- Look at you. Look at him.

  
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

  
- I remember this!
- He remembers.

  
A little harder than...

  
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

  
Is that?

  
Is that my?

  
Is that me?

  
You had the cutest little paws.

  
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

  
You did that the day we lost you.

  
Wow. I was so young.

  
What happened to me?

  
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...

  
It was not your fault.

  
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

  
Far off the reserve.

  
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

  
...well...

  
We thought they'd killed you.

  
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!

  
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.

  
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.

  
You used to call this "foofie."

  
"Foofie"?

  
Foofie.

  
He doesn't want that.

  
This is my foofie!

  
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

  
I mean, no, thank you,
thank you. It's perfect.

  
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

  
You'll need all your strength.

  
I will bring the house down for you.

  
I hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you.

  
Jeez, Mom, really?

  
I know you'll do us proud. You know why?

  
You were born with it.

  
Good night, Alakay.

  
My boy. My own boy.

  
My son's a king.

  
My son's a king.

  
Good night, Mom.

  
Good night, Alakay.

  
Foofie.

  
Look at foofie! My foofie!

  
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

  
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.

  
I think we're lost.

  
Nana, do you know where you're going?

  
No, but I'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

  
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

  
- It's people.
- How did you get here?

  
- Can you help us? We're lost.
- We're lost too.

  
It was awful. A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep!

  
- That happened to ourjeep too!
- What do we do?

  
How will we all survive?

  
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?!

  
You can let nature
get the best of you,

  
or you can get the best of nature.

  
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?

  
Yeah.

  
We survive the concrete jungle!

  
When we need food, we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand.

  
- Am I right?
- She's right.

  
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

  
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.

  
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

  
If we can make it there,

  
we can make it anywhere!

  
I'm coming, King Julien!

  
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

  
No, shark, no! Sit!

  
Why am I laughing?

  
We have all the parts we need,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

  
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.

  
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.

  
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

  
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

  
Darn you, Darwin!

  
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.

  
Rico! You're coming with me!

  
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!

  
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

  
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

  
Oh, I doubt that.

  
Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work.

  
There'll be three groups. Group Alpha
will do sheet metal fabrication.

  
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.

  
Any questions?

  
Good! Let's get to work.

  
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

  
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

  
Remember, little cub scouts, a great
dance performance comes from the heart.

  
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong.

  
Sure, mister.

  
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by,
I thought I'd wish you luck.

  
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.

  
In my opinion, the key to this
is choosing the right competitor.

  
You mean, this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

  
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.

  
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

  
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.

  
Well, I wish I could help,

  
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred.

  
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.

  
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

  
Makunga, right? Thank you.

  
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.

  
Shake it out.

  
A five, six, seven, eight.

  
Let's go, let's do this.

  
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

  
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...

  
On it, Mom!

  
Who will be the first participant?

  
Me! Oh! Me, me, me!
Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

  
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

  
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

  
Let me see.

  
I guess I'll pick...

  
...Teetsi?

  
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

  
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!

  
Somebody, wake him up!

  
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?

  
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

  
- Let's dance!
- OK.

  
But let me warn you
that I am a protégé of...

  
...Fosse and Robbins!

  
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

  
Dance fight! You got it.

  
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?

  
I know that boy is not dancing.

  
This is even better than I thought.

  
Alakay, turn around!

  
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish, turn around.

  
Oh, no.

  
Alakay! Are you hurt?

  
Yeah, I am.

  
Did I... did I win?

  
No, son.

  
How could this happen?

  
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.

  
I am a king. I'm the King of New York.

  
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.

  
Perform?

  
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!

  
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish...

  
...his own son?

  
Zuba, no.

  
Zuba, yes.

  
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

  
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.

  
Dad, what are you doing?

  
Dad, no! You can't do this.

  
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

  
Anyone?

  
Someone? No one?

  
You, sir!

  
I guess not.

  
Well, I... this is all very awkward,

  
but I suppose I could carry
this tremendous burden.

  
Teetsi! Get the hat.

  
As your new leader,
I hereby banish Alakay!

  
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

  
...and leave the watering hole

  
for a thousand years, or life!

  
Whichever comes last.

  
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

  
You should have told us
you weren't a real king, son!

  
You never told me
I'd have to fight anybody!

  
What did you expect?!

  
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

  
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!

  
No, I guess not. You dance!

  
And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga,
set me up back there!

  
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.

  
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!

  
A real lion.

  
Thanks.

  
Thanks a lot.

  
Saw.

  
Suture.

  
Swab.

  
You're in my light, Stephen.

  
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

  
That's very observant, Stephen. As you
can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

  
OK! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

  
So I don't have
to pick out a dying hole?

  
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

  
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.

  
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg! Sweet kid.

  
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

  
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most
ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.

  
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.

  
This won't hurt a bit.

  
Joe, our last witch doctor,
had a spotjust like that.

  
- And?
- Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

  
Wednesday, no Joe?

  
I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

  
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

  
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!

  
But I've never heard of it.

  
I mean... I don't have any penicillin.

  
I'll need a CAT scan
just to get started!

  
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

  
Ta-da!!

  
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.

  
Hollah!

  
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!

  
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!

  
Well, you can try all you want to,

  
but it takes years of practice.

  
You'll never get a tight stream

  
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can

  
purse your lips like this.
You got it?

  
Ta-da!

  
How did you? You guys got it
right out of the box!

  
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.

  
It's in our blood!

  
I always thought I was a bit unique.

  
We are unique!

  
We are like a force of nature!

  
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!

  
Exactly the same!

  
Exactly the same.

  
Looks impressive,
Kowalski, but will it fly?

  
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

  
Nice.

  
Oh, man. My dad thinks
I'm a total loser.

  
I've ruined my parents' lives.

  
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

  
It is lackin' in the crackin',
my friend. I've gotta fix this.

  
So...

  
...there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.

  
Hey, guys.

  
Is this place great or what?!

  
I'd go with "or what."

  
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but...

  
...I got a date with Moto Moto.

  
Who's Moto Moto?

  
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

  
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?

  
It means, "Hot Hot."

  
"Hot Hot"?

  
When did you start parlez-ing African?

  
It's in my blood.

  
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

  
Melman, why am I the parade
and you're the rain?

  
Why are you driving
your parade under my rain?

  
Maybe I'll parade
in another part of town!

  
Whoa, guys.

  
Main Street's mine!

  
Well, you can have it!

  
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

  
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?

  
Melman, just tell her.

  
What? What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.

  
I guess I'll go, then.

  
Don't bother.

  
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman! Gloria!

  
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.

  
- Marty?
- Marty?

  
Marty?

  
What the heck is going on?

  
You're not? Oh! He was... I thought
he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

  
You thought that guy...

  
...was me?

  
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

  
You thought I was him?

  
You guys kind of do look a little...

  
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

  
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.

  
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on. Marty.

  
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

  
I'm just like any other zebra.

  
No. Of course you're different!

  
How?

  
OK, I can't tell you apart.

  
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something.

  
- A bell?!
- OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

  
How about a T-shirt that says,
"I'm with stupid"?

  
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

  
You know, while you've been doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

  
I've been having
the worst day of my life.

  
It's always about you, isn't it?

  
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

  
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

  
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

  
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!

  
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

  
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy

  
your bigger-than-anyone-else's
problems alone!

  
Good, leave! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems!

  
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!

  
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!

  
Nice hat, you showoff!

  
Marty...

  
...don't go.

  
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

  
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

  
Look, Maurice!

  
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

  
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

  
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.

  
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

  
I'm terminal, you know?

  
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

  
That's a bummer, man.

  
If I, King Julien... that's my name...

  
...only had two days left to live,

  
I would do all the things

  
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?

  
I'd love to become
a professional whistler.

  
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but I want to get even better,

  
make my living out of it.

  
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country

  
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

  
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

  
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head.

  
There must be something
you want to do before you die!

  
- There is this one thing.
- What? Tell me.

  
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?

  
I never told Gloria
how I feel about her.

  
What is it? Please tell me!

  
I never had the guts
to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

  
How I've always felt about her.

  
Fine. Don't tell me!

  
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.

  
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

  
Yeah. Yeah.

  
You're right.

  
You've got to march
right up to this woman.

  
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

  
Just a little, or almost all the way.

  
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're...

  
...just lips' distance
away from each other.

  
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

  
Actually, it's more like love her.

  
Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!

  
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

  
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

  
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!

  
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!

  
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!

  
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!

  
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!

  
Do you feel it?

  
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!

  
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

  
Yeah! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

  
I love that happy little head.

  
She love

  
Moto Moto

  
She love

  
Moto Moto

  
She loves me
She loves my eyes

  
She loves me
She loves my thighs

  
She loves my roundness

  
She love that I'm chunky
She love that I'm plumpy

  
She love my heftiness
She love my zestiness

  
She love me restlessly
She love me forever

  
She love me...

  
...'cause she love me

  
Moto Moto...

  
...before things get too serious, well,

  
I was wondering,
if I were to, for example, stay here...

  
...l'd like to ask you...

  
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my... ear canal.

  
I have so many questions.

  
I promise the answer will always be yes.

  
Unless no is required.

  
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

  
You're the most plumpenest girl
I've ever met.

  
OK. Other than that.

  
Let's see.

  
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

  
Right.

  
My gosh, girl, you huge.

  
You said that.

  
Yeah, that's right.

  
We don't have to talk no more.

  
Gloria!

  
Gloria.

  
Melman.

  
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.

  
Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you.

  
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.

  
Apology accepted.

  
Oh. Yeah, right, that.
That's why I... Good.

  
OK. Well, that's it, then.

  
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

  
No. No, that's not it.

  
Listen, Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen.

  
Because you, my friend,
you found yourself the perfect woman.

  
If I was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman,

  
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers. OK?

  
Her favorites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed.

  
Six loaves of wheat toast,
butter on both sides.

  
No crust, the way she likes it.

  
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend.

  
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh.

  
She has the most amazing laugh.

  
That's what I would do if I were you.

  
But I'm not, so you do it.

  
OK.

  
What?

  
That was beautiful.

  
Anyways, where were we?

  
I'm "huge"?

  
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

  
Well, I'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion!

  
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up!

  
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!

  
And making me look like a fool!

  
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

  
Coward.

  
The water. It's gone.

  
It's never gone dry before.

  
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?

  
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

  
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!

  
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.

  
Makunga, what do we do?

  
Quiet!

  
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis:

  
We'll all have to fight for it.

  
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.

  
That's not fair. You'd win!

  
Exactly, Shirley.

  
I'm Bob...

  
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

  
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

  
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

  
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look
for water off the reserve.

  
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!

  
Hunters would shoot us!

  
No one leaves the reserve and survives!

  
I left the reserve!

  
And survived.

  
I can do something about this.

  
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we
get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

  
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?

  
You?

  
Yeah. I'll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

  
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the
looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

  
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh
your mane off. I'll prove you wrong.

  
Maybe you should try
a little rain dance.

  
Zuba would know what to do.

  
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.

  
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

  
All right, fine!

  
As an added measure,
I will consult with Zuba!

  
Marty?

  
Hey! Marty!

  
Marty?

  
Marty.

  
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

  
Excuse me! Excuse me!

  
Hi. Is Marty in there?

  
Anyone seen Marty?

  
Which one of us is Marty?

  
All right. Well, if you see him,

  
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

  
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

  
- Can we come?
- No. I have to do this alone.

  
You can't leave the reserve!

  
What are you doing?

  
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!

  
Could you leave the hat?

  
Marty! I know you're in there.

  
Before I go, I got something
I want to say.

  
You've been a great friend.

  
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems

  
that I never think of you having any.

  
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

  
Just like back at the zoo.

  
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.

  
I just want you to know that I...

  
You're one in a million.

  
This is touching.

  
It is touching.

  
So could you turn around
so I can tell you to your face?

  
That's right. Gotcha!

  
I see you in there! Yeah, you.

  
You, right there.

  
Twelfth row, two hundred
and third from the left.

  
That's you, Marty.

  
I know it's you.

  
Know what makes you special?

  
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

  
You're a dreamer, Marty.

  
Always have been.
You have great taste in music

  
and horrible taste in friends.

  
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

  
OK, I'm in.

  
Marty, you can't come with me.

  
You don't have a choice.

  
- People are out there!
- You're crazy! Come back!

  
The people will get you!

  
Don't lose the hat!

  
Bye, hat!

  
Any water?

  
No, just more diamonds and gold.

  
Don't give up hope.

  
Listen up! I will help you!

  
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

  
I, your beloved King Julien

  
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

  
in the volcano!

  
What does that do?

  
What does that do? Excellent question.

  
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

  
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

  
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

  
"Here, have another."
"No, I've had enough."

  
"I'll be insulted
unless you have another."

  
"I don't want another sacrifice!"

  
"Look at you! You're skinny!"
"No! I've had enough!"

  
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.

  
They give me some water,
and then I give it to you.

  
What?

  
Does it work?

  
No! I mean, yes.

  
Well, Maurice?

  
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

  
We'll do it!

  
Excellent!

  
Now all I need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

  
and get eaten by gods.

  
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

  
I need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

  
who could look death straight
in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

  
- I'll do it.
- Melman?

  
Hurry up! Before we all
come to our senses!

  
Melman, what is wrong with you?

  
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it's worth it.

  
Are you nuts?

  
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

  
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going.

  
It was always you.

  
Seeing you every day.

  
That's what kept me going.

  
Melman! Wait!

  
Melman! Melman! Melman!

  
You going to mope like this all day?

  
Don't "hmph" me.

  
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

  
Our son came back to us. How come
that is not good enough for you?

  
What are you saying, woman?

  
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

  
Zuba!

  
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!

  
What do you want?

  
It's awful.

  
The watering hole is dried up.

  
Dried up? That's impossible!

  
There's nothing left!

  
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

  
Your son, Alakay, he said he
could fix it. He's gone upriver.

  
- Off the reserve?!
- No!

  
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.

  
He was determined
to prove himself to you.

  
You stay here, in case he comes back!

  
Hurry, Zuba!

  
I'm so parched.

  
Is this place starting to freak you out?

  
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.

  
Why are we doing this?

  
Maybe my dad will think I'm...

  
I want to show him I'm a real lion.

  
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

  
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

  
What?!

  
As far as my dad is concerned.

  
As far as people are concerned,
you're a hit.

  
In New York. This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.

  
Marty, this is it!

  
This is the clog! Come on.

  
Well, there's the water.

  
Stay down. Look at that.

  
Knit one, purl two.

  
It's her.

  
- Is this right?
- Very good.

  
Nana, slow down.

  
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

  
No, don't pull. I'll do it.

  
We need dynamite. Got any?

  
Oh, snap! I just used
my last stick this morning!

  
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!

  
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!

  
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

  
No, no! Squiggly squid!

  
Etch A Sketch!

  
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

  
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!

  
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

  
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

  
Save us
We love you

  
OK.

  
OK, OK, OK.

  
- Save us
- Melman

  
- We love you
- Melman

  
Save us

  
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

  
- Melman
- We love you

  
- Melman
- Save us

  
Here we go! Here we go!

  
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?

  
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!

  
So did I. Then I realized
I'm covered in brown spots.

  
So Melman's not dying!

  
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!

  
Melman!

  
Move!

  
Don't do this! Julien,
stop this! This is crazy!

  
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

  
Yes!

  
- Please, Melman! Stop!
- Gloria?

  
- You can't do this!
- Why not?

  
Because...

  
You can't do this, Melman.

  
First, that hurts.

  
Second, I've only got
18 hours to live, anyway.

  
Melman, I gotta know...

  
...did you mean those things
you said about me?

  
Of course I did.

  
- That's crazy.
- It is?

  
It's crazy to think I had to go
halfway around the world...

  
...to find out the perfect guy for me

  
lived right next door.

  
Then it's you and me, neighbor.

  
You and me for the next 18 hours.

  
I'll take whatever you got.

  
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.

  
- What's going on here?
- Marty!

  
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!

  
- What about the plane?
- Perfect! Come on!

  
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

  
Now, maternity leave.

  
Maternity leave? You're all males.

  
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

  
There's nothing I can do
until we bust up this union.

  
I'll bust up all of you
if you don't get this plane going.

  
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied? No maternity leave.

  
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savanna.

  
All right. You get your maternity leave.

  
Finally.

  
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

  
Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No!

  
This is wrong.

  
You see? You are survivors.

  
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

  
You can't eat a lion.

  
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

  
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

  
She's out of her mind, people!

  
I'm from New York City!

  
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!

  
Dad!

  
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!

  
Stay behind me.

  
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

  
Stay back!

  
You'd let your dinner get away?

  
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.

  
What the heck?

  
Hey, I know those moves.

  
Alex?

  
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!

  
It is Alex!

  
Only one lion can move like that!

  
He's beautiful.

  
I can't believe it.

  
How does he do that?

  
What are you doing?

  
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

  
Don't think, Dad. Feel!

  
Butterfly!

  
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

  
Roar!

  
That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

  
Dad, look out!

  
What the...

  
Alex! Get in!

  
She's got a gun! Get out while we can!

  
- What?
- She's got a gun!

  
Get out while we can! Pass it on!

  
He said let's have some fun
and take out the dam. Basset hound.

  
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

  
All right! But it's his funeral.

  
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!

  
Bring it on! Bring it on!

  
Come back! That's my dinner!

  
Kowalski, full throttle.

  
Music!

  
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.

  
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

  
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!

  
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

  
Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us!

  
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!

  
They say no pull up. Kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound.

  
Are you sure?

  
Men, there is no sacrifice greater
than someone else's.

  
No! Medic!

  
Ramming speed!

  
Bring it on!

  
Bad kitties.

  
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

  
The science seemed so solid.

  
I'd jump right in that volcano
if I wasn't so good at whistling.

  
It's you! I found you!

  
Mort?

  
Bad fishy!

  
I wonder if the gods like seafood.

  
Let's find out.

  
Look, Maurice.

  
- That was quick.
- I did it!

  
I did it! I did it!

  
OK, you did it!

  
Oh, yes!!

  
Look!

  
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!

  
You did it!

  
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

  
Zuba! Alakay!

  
You're back!

  
I'm so glad you're safe!

  
Out of my way.

  
Well, well, well.

  
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly,
you quit the pride.

  
And you were kicked out.

  
So don't think that this
changes anything.

  
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation.

  
A man bag. Very popular where I'm from.

  
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.

  
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when I go out hiking.

  
But you're still banished.

  
We figured you'd say that.

  
My handbag!

  
You bad kitty!

  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

  
You deserve this, son.

  
Welcome to the pride.

  
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

  
No, son. To us!

  
My son! The King of New York!

  
That's my baby!

  
Love transcends all differences.

  
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

  
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

  
For better, please.

  
What a beautiful, weird couple!

  
That's not going to last.

  
Can I kiss the bride?

  
No! Music!

  
- Struts.
- Check.

  
- Flaps!
- Check.

  
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

  
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!

  
See you later!

  
We'll be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

  
or whenever the gold runs out.

  
Come back soon!

  
Mom, let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

  
You're right about that!

  
As long as I'm with her...

  
...and you two, I don't care
where we are.

  
She has the most amazing laugh.

  
Love has no boundaries!

  
Looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

  
Dad? What's wrong?

  
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and...

  
- You got me!
- I got you, son!

  
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

  
I got you, son!

  
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

  
- Marty? Who's Marty?
- Come on.

  
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.

  
Ain't no Marty here.

  
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and I know it's you.

  
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

  
But now that I found a home
feels like I'm in heaven

  
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

  
But now that I'm home

  
Hey! Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!

  
Shake 'em! Shake 'em! Shake 'em!

Horton hears a who

Our story begins on a leaf that has been wet by the rain. But though it may be wet, a few drops of water on the leaf have merged to one and has began its drop off from the leaf then splashed a sweetgum seed pod from a sweetgum tree. That ball fall down from the tree then rolls through a field of dandelions. The ball then rolls down through a crack and went inside a cave where in this cave was a single sunflower standing in the sunlight. The sweetgum seed rolls closer and closer to the sun till when it hits it and rolls off, the sunflower dislodges a small speck and it starts to drift off from the flower to the open crack on the wall. But when we went through it, we discover a strange jungle full of bizarre plants and beautiful trees. This is the Jungle of Nool. A vast jungle of strange and weird creatures all great and small. The speck drift over the water then drift down from a waterfall. However, we did hear some shakin goin on. We then cut to where the shaking comes from. It was coming from a grey elephant with no horns on its mouth. This is Horton. He’s an elephant. He blends down a tree to make it like an diving board and he gets on it, he stands on his two feet with pride… then sighs in relief. He made his ears into a swimmer’s net then starts to jump off the tree like a swimmer and into the water with a swan dive but splashed in the water instead. Soon, he was relaxing in the Jungle of Nool in the heat of the day in the cool of the pool.

Narrator: On the fifteenth of May in the jungle of Nool in the heat of the day in the cool of the pool. He was splashing enjoying the jungle's great joys.
The carefree elephant, Horton, was watering his back by squirting water out of his trunk.
Narrator: And Horton the elephant heard a small noise.
The speck flew by Horton, uttering a small cry for help.
Speck: Help!
The elephant looks around and he blows water out of his ear, as well as a fish.
Animal Kids: (offscreen) Horton!
He looks up to see some young animals.
Horton: Good morning, class. Are you ready?
Animal Kids: Yeah!
Horton: Jump on board!
The animals drop down onto his back.
Tommy: (offscreen) Look out below!
He lands hardly on Horton’s back.
Horton: Tommy’s on board. Katie, you there?
Katie: (lands on his back) Ha-Ah-A.
Horton: Okay.
The kind elephant escorts the kids to a lush tree.
Horton: There it is. (refers to a leaf on a twig) This is one of the jungle's most amazing creatures. The leaf bug. In order to protect itself from predators, it disguises itself as a leaf.
He pokes at it and then climbs on the tree and tries to pull it off.
Horton: This one's got quite a deep grip. Come on, little buddy! Don't be shy!
He falls back from the tree.
Horton: I guess I was mistaken, kids. (leaf bugs were all over him) There are obviously no leaf bugs in this area. Even a per... (notices the leaf bugs) Oh! They're on me! (rolls around) Look at, there are bugs! (accidentally sucks up a leaf bug) I think I swallowed it. Shoot up! Uh-ek, it's not coming. Pull it out.
Tommy: (unsure) Uh... okay.
The animal kids pull on Horton’s trunk and he swings them around. Meanwhile, a purple kangaroo and her son were hopping through the jungle of Nool.
Narrator: Then, humphing her nose was Sour Kangaroo. A type who's convinced she knows better than you.
A moose full of birds sees the Kangaroo coming as the birds on the moose’s antlers flied off while the moose hides in the water.
Narrator: She made every law and then forced every rule as self-proclaimed head of the jungle of the Nool.
The Kangaroo humphed when she sees the kids try to get the bug out of Horton. Her son, rudy, looks at them in confusion.
Rudy: Why can't I play with the other kids, Mom?
Sour Kangaroo: How many times have I told you? The jungle is no place to act like a wild animal.
The young animals then flew into the bushes and Horton spits out the leaf bug. As it tries to fly, Katie catches it with her tongue and eats it like a frog.
Antlered Mother: My, that Horton certainly is eccentric.
Mrs. Quilligan: And that children are learning so much from him.
Sour Kangaroo: Learning to be a bunch a hairbrain half-wits. And that's why my Rudy is pouch-schooled.
Narrator: So, while Kangaroo stood there sneering a sneer...
Tommy: Horton, how it's the best time of my life. What are you gonna show us then?
Soon, a speck arrived near Horton...
Narrator: Once again the speck floated right by Horton's ear.
Speck: Help!
Narrator: And he heard it again. Just a very faint yelp, as if some tiny person were calling for help.
He imagines a helpless Who hanging onto the speck in Dr. Seuss illustration.
Narrator: And you know what he thought? What he thought there must be someone on top of that small speck of dust. Or even a family. It just might be so. A family with children just starting to grow.
He then imagines a helpless Who family hanging onto the speck.
Who Child: I wanna live!
Otu of his thought, Horton decides to quickly save that speck.
Horton: Uh… i gotta go! Katie, you’re in charge! (runs off)
As he runs off, Katie opens her mouth and the bug was free was scares the kids. Soon, Horton ran pass the mothers…
Horton: Wait! Come back!

One more, one more, One more, one more.

- I hear someone coming.
- Get here those.
Horton: Wait!
- Sound the alarm!

Excuse me! On my stamp feet!

Horton: Sorry, Wickershams. I promise I'm gonna clean all this up later!
Bring the ammo!

Horton: I love the smell of the bananas in the morning.

Banana in the Hole!

Horton: Come on, guys! We're all mammals!
Whou!
I feel diplomatic process is beginning to break down.

There you are. I catch ya. I catch ya.

Horton: (while running after the speck) Hi, kids.

Horton: Wow!

There
Now you're safe.
I know I heard you say something. I just know it. Where are you?
- Horton?
- Uhoo, sorry.
I just...ah.
There was this speck.
And the... they called up for help.
- And I was...
- The speck...
called out for help?
Well not the speck. I mean
That's ridiculous.
Is what you thought I've been?
No, the speck can't call out for help.
Come on.
Get real!
No.
There's tiny person on that speck and needs my help.
Absurd.
There aren't people that small.
Whoa, maybe thay aren't small.
Maybe...
We're big.
- Horton!
- No! Really, think about it.
What if there is someone
way out there,
looking down on our world right now.
And to them, we are the speck.
And then this someone else come along,
he say, "Oh, there can't be people that small." And the first guy would say "Are you calling me a lier?" And the second guy would say "If the shoe fits wear it, and now that fits a blind." and the first guy pick supper break. And you might wanna zip up the pouch for this next part. Alright, Fat boy! You want some of there...
- Horton?
There is nothing on that speck.
But I heard.
Did you?
Really? Oh my!
Then how come I don't hear anything.
Well?
If you can't see, hear, or feel something it doesn't exist.
I'm believing in tiny imaginary people is just not something we do.
Or tolerate here in the jungle of Nool.
Really?
Cause I verified I really tried
I can find somebody who believe what I'm saying.
- You will do nothing of the sort.
You will not breathe the word of this lie to anyone else.
Expecially the children.
I do not want you poisoning their minds with this nonsense.
Our community has standards, Horton.
If you wanna remain a part of that
I recommand you follow them.
Have a nice day.
Alright then! I'll ah...take that an advisement. Certainly appreciate your input.
I don't understand. I know I heard you.
It was just clean as nose on my face.
That's it.
Maybe you can't hear me!
Of course your ears must be tiny.
I need to speak up!
H-E-L-L-O-W!

Now some people out there might think I know who they find they agreed with that Sour Kangaroo
"There can't really be people as small as a mice" Well there can. And there are. Becuase Horton was right.

That single "Hellow" traveled all the way down to the speck, to the flowers, to the fount of the small town.
The town known as Whoville for there live the Whos Really happy in safe, knowing only good news, unaware that their world was a speck on a clover, unaware the sweet life they knew might be old.
The Mayor of Whoville a man named McDodd who's devoted and faired and little bit odd.

Narrator: The Mayor and his wife they had children to spare. and some there.
But the Mayors have only few second for each.
Daddy, I do better than best on my whostory test.
Ah, whostory. I remembered well.
That's one of my girls.
Her is has been using my hairbrush?
Her is has been using my hairbrush.
Look, over there!
There, all better.
Can I please have whophone, daddy?
Everyone else in my class has one.
Oh, really? Everyone?
- Aw! I will think about it.
- Daddy, look! Daddy look!
Toos!
It's "th" sweetheart. It's "Tooth"
In Whoville tradition unlike yours or mine Mayor's oldest is the next Mayor of line. And who was the oldest lead and stand tall?
It was JoJo, his son, the smallest who all.
So, JoJo, what's what's shaking?
What's happening?
What's the world?
Now to you or to me, it's finally clear that JoJo did not want his father's career. But the Mayor pressed forward completely illuded.
And JoJo just sat there in silence and lude it.
Oh, JoJo!
- Hey! Why this he get more time?
- That's not fair!

Son! Hey!

And why didn't he speak? Well I think the lad was
frightened if he did, he might let down his dad.

You know what's awesome?
This is awesome!
Just look at the men and the women
hanging on these walls.
You, my boy, are part of family legacy that spans centuries
You know what?
Your grandfather was Mayor of Whoville.
And, your great grandmother, that's right.
All the way down to your
Great Great Great Great Not so great Great, Great Great, Great, Great Great, Great, Great Great~!
Grandfather!
Some day I hope to join them.
Be one of the Grates.
I tell you JoJo there is nothing like being Mayor.
I get to sign resolutions, approve ordinances, submit budgets.
And in the edible parade I'm the one city noun top of the giant people.
Some day
That can be you too, JoJo.
Some day you'll be the one
wearing the Mayor crest.
You just...
You just need to...
You know what I mean?
O.K. Good chat!
I'm glad that we had this talk
That I'm continuing now by myself.
Good.
Oh!

There. There are to become fit.
Nothing wrong with this Morton. Nothing wrong with this. Just you and me and the speck. Shooting the breeze. We're club. We're group. We can take a vote on issues. We can be a secret to society to control pirate's power in the world.
- Horton?
And no one else can join Unless they wear funny hats.
Listen, Horton!
The chair reconize it's brother Morton.
I am really happy you found this speck in all.
But you might wanna
think about keeping it to yourself.
Um, what, what?
Are you talking to what clover. That doesn't look good.
You know what doesn't look good?
You, talking about the speck like the speck isn't even there.
Speck never said nothing bad about you.
But hey!
Good luck with your illusional superiority.
You know the speck can think
anything you want about me you to speak.
Wow!
I see what's going on here.
Morton, no matter how tight
this speck and I get,
the speck could never replace you.
I'm only sad that I would have to
explain that at this point.
Well, that's awesome Horton.
That really helps.
Just try to keep this to yourself.
I'll see you later.
Try.
Hey, Horton?
What's you got in there?
What? Nothing.
We're not doing anything.
Who's we?
We? What we?
Did I say that?
I just... Oh, no.
I would never say that
because that would a play that
I was with someone and not alone.
O.K. There is a story
you can't talk to anybody
I mean it.
If anybody finds out about this,
it could be very very bad.
I'm not sure why.
We won't tell anyone.
And if we do, we'll tell them
not to tell anyone.
Perfect!
O.K.
I'm taking a bath, right.
Cause my skin gets kind a dry.
My roof asht
While Horton can clean about
the speck that he found
How he'd save this what at really drowned.
The Mayor set off
on his morning commute
and noticed things
not quite the same on his route.
But please don't blame Horton
for he didn't know
That a swamp pump a bub
I do it in the water like this
Was a big bub flew.
Hey, Joe! Don't work too hard!
Ah! These luxery condos
they have gone themselves.
Hey, you look at that.
I guess they do build themselves.
Oh~Kei, that happened.
Now the Mayor knew it was his job
to convey the unusual things
that he noticed that day.
There was one problem.
Though his will was strong
- You are late.
- Thank you Miss. Yelp.
Nothing in Whoville had ever gone wrong.
We have all happy be
with all the we've got.
We like it in here Whoville.
We like it a lot.
We're all very busy with
Who-Centennial's coming up. So,..
Let's break this meeting to order.
Mr. Mayor I presume you have
some good news for us.
Well, it's news. I don't know.
If we need to go label it good or bad
anything like that
The thing is I have noticed
some odd goings on in Whoville lately
Good on goings on?
Well, you know.
Tremors, clouds surly in the sky.
And it seems to me just be safe,
we might wanna consider...
Pospo nin th WhoCentenia?
Consider what?
Pospo nin th WhoCentenia?
What?!
Speak up, man!
Postponing the Who-centennial, alright?
We're about to celebrate 100 years
of Whoville happiness in harmony.
And you want to postpone the celebration?
Well, what if Whoville's not safe.
Nothing ever goes wrong in Whoville!
Never has and never will!
You bloodly boob!
Boob.
The Who-centennial will proceed as planned!
The Mayor was really being an idiot.
It will be all smile from now on.
Girl, I got 15,000 friends already.
What? What you mean it don't look like me?
That look just like me.
Ten years ago...
Wait a minute, hold on for a second.
Treats me like an idiot?
I'm not an idiot.
Do I look like an idiot?
- You don't want me to answer that.
- I'm not an idiot.
That's nerve call me a boob?
I would never call somebody a boob.
He is a boob.
Look at you, Yak.
Look at your face.
And I bet.
You don't look so good with this
staple on your head!
Wow!
Wa-ha-au!
- Thank you, Miss. Yelp.
- You're welcome.
Oh!
Hellow?
Who's you that?
I'll go out punch you.
Hellow?
Hellow?
Who's there?
I'm... This the Mayor.
The Mayor?
The Mayor?
Uh, look at this Mayor!
I knew it.
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.
There's life on this speck.
The speck?
What speck?
Well, Am...
I don't exactly know
how to tell you this. But...
You're living on a speck.
Well, I ee hate to disagree with you.
Oh, voice from the drain pipe.
But, I live in Whoville.
Well, then the Whoville is a speck.
Right. O.K. Seriously.
Who is this?
Is this Bert from accounting?
No. This is Horton.
I'm an elephant.
O.K. Horton, fake name.
Where are you?
Well, from where you standing?
I guess I'm...
in the sky.
Compare to you I'm enormous
which is saying something
because I slim down quite a bit I swim.
Your whole world fits on
a flower in my world.
Oh, man, this is even inclusion for you Bert.
Don't believe me?
Watch what happen
when I put you in the shade
- This is absolutly impossi...
- Dark.
Light.
Dark.
Light.
- Dark, light, dark, light....Dark!
- Wow!
- Light!
- Uooo
Don't you see?
We're in the middle of some kind of
amazing cosmic convergence.
Two vastly different worlds.
Miraculously crossing path!
Mine colossal!
Yours mini to cure.
Yet, somehow we've marriage to make contact.
If you think about it,
it's pretty amazing.
Is everything O.K. down there?
Oh. I.. I don't know.
You tell me...
You're the one who hold the speck.
I'm the one who's holding the speck.
I'm not holding the speck.
Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.
Am
Hold, please.
What at all this means?
The Mayor haven't the clue.
So he went to the office of Dr. Larue.
Brainest brain on the staff at Who use.
Dr. Larue!
Oh, this is crazy.
Oh, Mr. Mayor.
Ah, how may I be a assitance?
I don't know. Hey.
You know I just wondering
If our world will stay tiny speck
floating to space,
how would we know?
Oh, why would you ask something like that?
Oh, no reason, no reason at all.
I don't even remember.
Yes I do.
That you know what,
some guy was talking to me
not an elephant in the sky,
a guy on the ground
Ah, there would be several ramifications
Good ramifications?
A tiny speck.
Uh-huh, yeah, tiny speck.
Floating around...
Well, we'd have inexplicable tremors.
Dramatic changes in the weather.
And if we didn't eventually achieve
some sort of stability
our world would be destroyed
Destroyed!
Destroyed, oh destroyed.
No somehow.
Horton?
Ah, no. This is Danny.
Horton is busy right now.
You, I'm joking. That's me.
Ah, We're doomed.
Listen! Horton!
Turns out I need your help a little bit.
Apparently if that speck
keeps moving around,
our whole world
could be obliterated.
Ah-uh So,
I need you to find us Who's
safer more stable home and fast
No problem, Mr. Mayor.
Let's see...
Wow!
That's a nice view.
Hellow, is everything O.K.?
What's going on up there?
This entire jungle is a house of death!
Oh, wait.
There's good spot.
And it's then Horton saw
at the top of mountain Nool
a small cave that will peaceful and quiet and cool
where sun flower grew
proud and tall from the ground.
There he knew every Who would be safe,
would be sound.
I found it Mayor.
The perfect place.
Right up there.
- On the top of the mountain Nool
- Mr. Mayor?
- Yeah?
- I wish we could...
Oh-ho, Ah, Shiny. Ah-ha.
The Who-centennial Committee is waiting for you
to look over the giantly bar
for the edible parade.
Oh, and then you will do at the dinners
for your Whowill Canal.
You know, sticking Who in front of everything
doesn't make it hard last.
Just waste time!
I don't wanna go.
Listen, Horton. I got to go.
Apparently there's problem with the giant people.
You just take care that meatball, Sir.
And leave the freaking out to me.
So, then Horton began his long paraless track
determine to save the small world on the speck.
Horton was faithful and soul working kind.
I got ya.
He was a brave hero.
I'll protect ya.
At least in his mind.
We must become invisible.
Travel silently.
For there're forces.
They would seek to destroy us.
Hee-Ha-Ah-aaaaa-Ah!
Ah-A?!
So, you think you can stick upon me, Huh!
E-Yab! Ah-Dadada!
It's clear that you're match for my ticky kei!
Uh-uh. He-e.
I see you matered the way of snaping branch.
Watch me tumble!
Horton! Let's go!
You have asshole.
Mother Kangaroo has monkeys.
I wll make monkeys of these monkeys.
It is their destiny, Huh-Uh!
Hoi-Yat! My Tumble!
My Tumble!
- Oh~
- Horton is the Greatest Hero of them all, Ha!
Horton! Horton! Go!
Ah~~~Cho!
Oh, mountain Nool is that way!
Hahaha!
To the top of the mountain Nool.
I sensed the fighting. All way I hope.
Ha-it!
Oh, sorry little fella.
You'll be fine.
Just the killing thought.
- Horton!
- Horton!
- Look!
- Go go go!
We've all got own clovers
with flowers on them.
Yeah!
Oh!
In my world everyone's pony
and they all eat rainbows
and poop butterflies
That's beautiful, Katie.
In a really weired way.
My world is called Jessicaland
Everyone worships queen Jessica
because Jessica is that beautiful.
Jessica, that was owesome.
Rudy?
Mom, be careful!
My best friend Daddly Cons on there.
- Rudy, no one lives on this.
- What?
It's not possible.
That Horton is mean us.
Mom, Mom, please.
You're so weired.
- Don't do this to me.
- Honey, go to your room.
Horton!
It's good.
What do you think you're doing?
Ha, you got some world in trouble.
Have you forgotten what we discussed?
Oh, no. I'm elephant.
And elephants never forget.
It's a curse, really.
I remember I was on my head.
And you said and I looked up.
And you say what are you doing?
And I said the thing about the speck.
Then you pull my ears.
- And you fork in a fore head.
- Horton?
What? You did.
Give me that clover, Horton.
Now.
No!
No-oU?
Ya.
Are you sure you wanna
fight this fight, Horton?
Becuase I promise you will
get very ugly very fast.
And you need to ask yourself.
Do I really worth put myself through this?
For a clover?
Take after me, Horton?
You don't.
So, hand it over.
No! I can't give it to you.
There're people on this speck.
Granted very small people.
But a person's person.
No matter how small.
You just crossed the line, Horton.
And I'm gonna make you pay.
That Horton is threat us.
He has those kids using their imaginations.
It's sick.
Alright.
I got to get this speck
up to the top Mountain Nool ASAP.
Whatrever that means.
Probably act sweetly awesome peckidom.
I mean how hard can it be.
It's just the straight plummet to certain death.
This works...
kind a precarious.
No?
No need to worry.
Obviously when they building the bridge like this
they take into account
the elephants will be corssing here.
Alright. Feel good.
I'll just get... Woo Waaa
You'll alright!
Uh-Eee
Ah-Eee
COURAGE
Woo-uh, That's true.
Alright.
Hello and how are we today, Mr. Mayor?
Say AH-Ha~
Ah!
OHK!
Linch, please.
Eh, I think fairly this point
keep stand to be replaced.
Uh!
Uk!
I just need to think light.
I'm light as a feather.
I'm light as a feather.
Heavy feather.
O.K.
- This will just pinch little.
- Ha-Ahaa
I'm lighter than a feather.
What's lighter than a feather?
Ha-ah! Air!
There's nothing lighter.
So, it stands to reason...
get the more air I have
to lighter
on be.
Next, please.
Alright. It was absoultly terrifying.
If I just right some on
drawing not to panic.
UH-AH-AH~!
Hm.

Wow.

Oh, sorry Honey, I was just...

Nedd!
What are you doing?
Wa- What do you mean?
Well, I no detective, Nedd.
But you are hanging from the chandelier.
I just thought it might look better
somewhere it can't fall on us
and crashes our sleep.
What is going on?
Hey, Honey.
Did you ever get the feeling
that you're being watched?
Am... Ya, sure.
I suppose.
And then you get feeling that
maybe that thing watching you is...Ah...
A giant elephant?
Am..
You know, how you can that weired feeling
that your world actually a tiny speck?
And then the elephant
that I talked about earlier
he's carrying it around on flower.
And you realize then if you tell anybody
they think you're crazy.
But you still feel the responsibility
to keep everyone safe.
You know that feeling?
Am...
You know, I'm gonna have to say no.
Do you know that feeling?
No-Uh!
Yarn!
Wow! I'm meet the time
to hit the hey, I guess.
Sweetheart.
I know you're under a lot of stress.
And if your seeing elephants
and flowers, then fine.
Just don't tell anyone else that story.
O.K.? And remember.
It's not the end of the world.
The end of the world?
Horton, the Mayor. Horton, the Mayor.
Come in Mayor, over.
Horton?
I get terrible reception here.
How about this?!!!
If I get all broll course!!!
Can hear right, NOW?!!
Yeap! Roger that!
Are we get that safe place yet?
Almost.
I'm pretty sure where this parts over.
This is your elephant speaking.
Just sit back and enjoy the ride
and we all are happy to the mountain Nool in..
No, you can't have ice cream.
Go back there.
Who's there?
Is there someone else there?
Well, that's my wife and kids
You have famliy.
I do indeed.
A beautiful wife, 96 daughters,
and one son.
Hohohoho~, busy guy.
Then we all share one bathroom.
You know that is?
Ya. Don't I know it.
Bathroom.
Nedd?
- What?
- Sweetheart. You know you're on the roof, right?
What's have to know is you need to go to bed.
Daddy's having a break down.
Nedd? What are you up to now?
I was just about put the kids bed,
when I got off the roof.
And I that's the that's what happened right.
- Daddy?
- Yes?
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Of course.
- Me too, me three, me four...
- O.K.
Hey, JoJo! Wow.
I don't like what glratle liquid
just the person I wanted to see.
Yeah. I've realize that we have
not been seeing eye to eye lately
and most of it is my fault.
It's true.
You know what I've been trying to do?
I have been trying to impose
my vision of your future on you.
What me make this perfectly clear
JoJo, you can be
whatever kind of Mayor you wanna be.
Hands on, strong and silent,
outspoken, it's up to you.
Well, good
I hear so much better.
I am expecting big things
from you youngman. Make things.
Alright. Good night.
Good stop! Good talk.
Then, JoJo snuck out feeling lonely and sad
and tragedy of misunderstood by his dad.
And where was he going
in such a lay down?
Up to Whoville's abandoned star study tower.
A place with boy felt contented free.
A place he could be what wanted to be.
And what was inside there
I'd say if I could.
But above of the Kangaroo was up to no good.
Can I come out now, Mom?
No, Rudy. Stay in the room.
- But, Mom?
- Stay inside.
Mr. Vlad-I-Koff?
Eating, go.
Yes. I Irealize you're busy.
But I need your help.
It's Horton.
He's become obsess with a colver
And he get actually thinks
there are little people on it.
I want that colver destroyed.
Sure, what a big deal this is.
For you, bro.
I'd do it myself.
But being a lady
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.
But I hear you have no problem with there.
No.
No problem.
Easy busy.
But...
I will only do this for a price.
In exchange for a friend who pay up...
No.
- This
- Yes.
- little kangaroo.
- Mom?!
Quiet, Rudy.
Momy is thinking it over.
We'll thanks but, on second thought
I think I'm going to have the Wickersham Brothers
take care of this for me.
Yeah, of course, Wickersham
I mean they're quasy operation.
You know, they'd... Wait! No!
You can't go over Wickersham.
No No. No no no.
Wickershams would be perfect for this job.
But, they are monkeys.
He's not scary.
Ah, thanks anyway.
Maybe next time.
Wait!
Here is what I will do the precious clover.
I will take it.
I will crush it.
And I will devour it.
Bigger than it looked. One second.
Oly moly.
Then I will regurgitate it.
Then...
I mean I devour it second time.
So two times devour.
Sounds nice.
But I think I'll talk to the Wickershams.
Wait.
Here is best part.
I do all
Gracious.
That's free bro.
What do you think?
- Deal.
- Yes. Score. Thanking you.
You won't regret.
Mayor?
Mayor?
Open up, Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!
It's snowing in the summer!
Yes.
Yes, it is.
It's a dramatic change in the weather.
As if we're on a speck floating to space.
I don't know how you knew.
But, somehow you did.
And Whoville is headed for disaster.
- Oh, Horton.
- What?
Ah, nothing. I'm on it.
It's up to us to save the people of Whoville.
Snow is not lucky.
That's not... Stop.
O.K. Anybody else?
Good.
No no. Don't join it.
This is not fun.
Uh, this is sign of doomed.
Oh, sweety, that's.
No. No no no.
They took. they took.
Stop having fun immediately!
This is dangerous.
O.K.
Horton?
Uh? What?
Hey, there.
We're in big trouble down here.
It's happening.
It's snowing in the middle of summer.
It's end of the world!
Hold on here.
I think I know what your problem is.
There, get better?
That seems you have worked.
Eh-uh. Do I smell peanuts?
Yes, they are my favorite snack.
But they tender linger.
Ohho! K-Uh. Debrick, No.
Oh-O. Hang on Mr. Mayor.
I may have to put up a flight.
Frightened elephant can be very dangerous.
Alright!
You come down the under, buddy.
You hungry for trouble?
I don't know how you can easy self by.
Take a fight.
I hate running.
Morton!
- Don't do that!
Morton: Horton! Horton? Don't... There you are. We got trouble. Wait. Stay. Wait. Can you hear that? No I'm here. O.K. Listen. No, go. Kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas. She's telling everyone that you should be kicked out of Nool.
Horton: She said that? I thought we're friends.
Morton: Word is, she's gone to Vlad's.
Horton: Vlad. Vlad. I know two Vlads. Is it the bad Vlad or the bunny Vlad that makes the Cookies?
Morton: Yeah, Horton. She's sending you a bunny with cookies. I think we can assume it's not bad Vlad.
Horton: Yeah, that's good call.
Morton: So, unless you're cool with giant razor sharp claws ripping the flesh off of your body, I get rid of the clover.
Horton: I can't. I promised the Mayor. I meant what I said. I said what what I meant. And an elephant's faiths were 100%.
Morton: Please, for me, just this once, be faithful 99% of the time. I've never gone 99% on anything. I think I'm awesome. So come on.
Horton: I meant to what I said and I said what I meant.
Morton: I'm gonna say it. You can that all days it's not happen then. (sighs) An elephant's faithful 100%.
Horton: That's right. That's my code. My motto. But thanks for the warning.
Morton. O.K.
But watch the skies.
Keep watching the skies.

Mayor, you need to get everyone on the ground, now.
- Two, Three, four...
- I wanna sound the alarm. There's a good possibility we maybe attacked by a giant cannibalous bird.
What?
There's a small chance it could be bunny with cookies.
But, I wouldn't count on it.
- Oh, they are formidable words.
- Ya
Are you there?
Ya, no. That's a great idea.
It just...
in order to get everyone mobilized I need the O.K. of the city council.
And they never listen to me. I've been called boob. Several times. I can't do it.
- You have to talk to them, Mayor. O.K. Listen.

Bad Vlad.
Bad Vlad.
Bad Vlad!
That is definitely not a bunny.
Lost him. Mean to lose him. And I lost him.
This tree for real, come on!
Hang on, Whoville! This is gonna get rough!

Now you're going to dead-end. Get ready for the best.

Leave me alone!

No! Horton!

I just know he's gonna jump out somewhere.
- Hello?
- Ah-Ak!!

Chess mate.
Now it's time for me to take clover and crush all the little people on a two sang...
Sorry. This is where we get off.
Ah, right in the beak!
Ah. Cool line. Usually I can I think those things to later.
- Mayor?
- Ah, Horton.
Are you O.K.?
Ah. Well, more or less. What happened? The bird?
- Ya, it attacked me.
Mayor, your people are in danger.
You know what, I'm gonna do it. I'm going to go out there. And tell them what is going on.
Perfect.
Now quick. Get go on.
Hey, Mr. Mayor! Something's wrong!
My basement is in the attic.
The science museum is history.
- We're lost thousand in this messy.
- What's going on Mr. Mayor?

I'm declaring a state of emergency.
Don't worry. Don't worry. The Mayor is just being a moron.
No wait. Whoville is in terrible danger. Everyone needs get down to the underground storage area immediately.
Fine fine. Let's do this democratically. Who wants the joy and glory and festivity of the Who-centennial to proceed as planned?
- Yeah!!!
- Yeah!!!
And who, like the Mayor, thinks it would be better to spend the Who-centennial in an underground storage area?
Yeah!!!
Wait! You got to listen to me. Our whole world could explode.

Much more quickly.

And our world wouldn't be that noise.

The people have spoken Mr. Mayor. You're finished. No one believes you. No one supports you.
- Horton believes me.
- Horton? Who's Horton?
Horton is a giant elephant in the sky.
Don't bother look. He is invisible. And he is the one risking his life to get Whoville which by the way is a speck on a clover just safety.

I can prove it. Horton's voice comes out of this horn.
Horton!
I have all the Whos gathered in town square. Let them know you there.

Gee. It's a kind of high pressure situation then.

Wow. I'm really run a blank here. I know.

Horton?
Horton, We're waiting.
Time to show everyone
that you exist and...
By extension what a none boob I am.
Wait!
Everyone look at the wind.
What do you think that means?
It means, Um, it means...
obviously, uh...
Let's the Kite Flying Race begins!
What a perron on you Horton! Ha Ha Ha!
Woo, brain freeze!
Give Me Back
- My Speck!
- Not this time, guy.
I'm so sorry that I let you down, but...
this... this is bigger than me.
Get the famliy together
and get some where safe.
I will!
I believe you.
I've got you now, innocent.
No No No!
Oh, no.
Huk! Eung.
Yeah!! Hahahahaha...
AhHahahaha....
Mayor?
Anybody there?
Anyone?
But clover by clover by clover he found
But the one that he sought for
was just not around.
Mayor?
Hello?
And by noon poor Horton more dead and alive,Had picked, searched,
and filed up 9005.
Hello.
Sorry to bother you.
Nobody.
Knock knock.
This is the way you take.
Whos there?
If there were any Whos there, You get it! Whos there.
I can't give up have them with you.
All day he looked.
Looked on and on.
Till his hope was almost gone.
No. No. No. Please No!
Ah~ This is unfiar!
But wait! Could this one be the one? Was all this searching finally done? Ah~ yes, for this was the hour Horton have found from the 3 millions flowers.
Mayor?
Mayor! I found you!
Mayor?
Are you there?
Mayor.
Mayor!
Mayor, are you there?
Mayor.
Mayor.
Mayor.
MA-E-Yor!!!
Ah~t no. This is Floyd.
Can I take a message?
Mayor!
You're Okay!!
Horton! Horton! Stop! Stop it!
Sorry.
There must have been a luck down there. I can't believe I'm in front of you.
You're the heavy worried.
Say. Am Mayor was right!
Daddy, daddy, daddy.

O.K. I'm alright and so are you.

Citizens of Whoville! I'd like you to meet our friend, Horton.

He's going to help us.

He-e-v-ham I've got this. This is the chairman.
Idiot!! Your finish this town.
Is that understood? Finished. You BOOB!!
Huh-uh I'm just joking.
Good one.
Horton, this is my wife Sally.
You exist! This means my husband isn't in crazy. Hooray!
And... off you my daughters.
- Haley, Holy, Hooly, Hilder and Heddy.
- Hi!!
And here is Miss. Yelp, my royal assitant.
- And here's Dr. Larue.
- You saved us.
And Bert from accounting.
And Mrs. McQuilligan.
And Mr. Farfoogan
from the Cloogan Farfoogans.
And the oldman in bathtub.
Let's not overwhelm the poor fella.
He's never gonna remember
all these names.
Whow. I'll try my best.
Sally.
Chairman.
Haley, Hooly, Holy, Hilder, Heddy. Miss. Yelp

Dr. Larue

Bert from accounting,
Mrs. McQuilligany,
Mr. Farfoogan of the Cloogan Farfoogans. And wan't there an old guy in a shower.
- Um, bathtub.
- Oh, Yeah!
We're all here, Horton.
And, We ALL believe in you.
Wow! That's awesome.
And it's reponsibility I do not take lightly.
I promise you a future that
it's safe, sound, and stable.
We will create a world where every Who
is undoubt with 3 indelible rights
To be determined that a later date.
And we will put us back on Mountain Nool
before the end of this a decade.
Oh!
This, this is the elephant in crazy.
Oh my goodness.
I could tell anyone and it's to the kangaroo.
Quick to they find out of them.
Hoho, you should've been seeing me.
I really read the elephant habit.
I chase him like doorman and then
I break him into million little elephant pieces.
It was thing of beauty,
Really my best work.
Classic Vlad.
- And the colver?
- Clover is finished.
No vain million years Horton finds it.
Believe my beak.
Clover is gone forever.
I just saw Horton.
And he is still talking to that clover.
Idiot!
Whoa, come on.
Hang you, Bro. It's me you're talking to. We have history.
Come on. Let's don't forget I did this for Free.
What is happening to the jungle of Nool?
There once was a time when people were people. And specks were specks.
All I say it you can't see it, hear it, or feel it it doesn't exist.
Our way of life is under attack.
And who's leading that attack?
Horton!!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute! This is Horton we're talking about you'll know about him. He wouldn't hurt a fly. Except for that fly city he sat on.
He didn't that on purpose.
- Shut up, mouse.
- Oh, Yeah. That's weird. I feel my brain is burning. I got to go.
Are we going to let troublemakers like Horton poison the minds of children?
Not the children!!
When Horton tells our children about worlds beyond the jungle, it makes them question authority.
Which leads to the fires, which leads to shocking!!
Yeah!! Horton must pay!!
Eat that speck!!
We have to do something!
- For the children!
- For the children!
Are we going to let him get away with this?
No!!!

Morton! I told you 100%!
Horton.
- Morton, pick up your feet, Gee.
- It's not me.
Oh, Hoho. I see. It's an angry mob.
Sorry, Morton.
I thought it's you who's making all the...
But it's...
Hold on.

Run, Horton!!
There he is!!
Let's rope him!
Let's cage him!
Stop!
Hey, fellas.
Good to see ya.
All at once.
You're look really great as herd.
Horton, Horton, Horton look at that mess
you created for yourself.
All this holible lure over us
is silly little flower.
It's a speck.
Right.
I mean a silly really all this talk of
roping you and caging you and well
we don't need to go into the details.
The point is this angry mob
of all a trouble you're in.
It can all go away.
- Really?
- Of course.
All you have to do is admit to everyone
that there are no little people
living on that speck.
That you're wrong and I was right.
You do that,
and things can go the right
back to the way they were.
But, if you don't,
You're going to have to pay the price.
So I just have to say it isn't true?
Go ahead! Rope me! Cage me!
Do whatever you want!
But there are people on this speck.
And they have Mayor.
Who has 96 daughters
and one son name JoJo,
Who all share a bathroom
whatever that is.
And even though you can't
hear or see them at all,
Person's a person,
no matter how small.
That was beautiful, Horton.
Rope him! Cage him!
Burn that speck in a pot of
boiling beezlenut oil!
They don't believe we're here.
We've got to make some noise!
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.
Come on!
Everybody!
We are here. We are here. We are here.
That's what take you never make up stories
about people on specks!
Listen. There they are!
- Rope him!
- Cage him!
It's not working.
I can hear you.
But, their ears aren't strong enough.
We need to be louder.
Get every Who'd make noise! Everyone!
We are here. We are here. We are here.
We are here. We are here. We are here.
JoJo, where're you going?
We need every voice, JoJo!
You need to make some noise down there.
Or we all be destroyed.
The Mayor grabbed the tamtam
starting to smeck it.
And all over Whoville,
They ooped up all racket.
They rattle tin kettles,
they beat on brass pans,
On garbage fills absonal,
cran berrry cans.
They blew on byzu bilzl
brasstic big tubas.
On durming Soom-pazum,
Boom-pazum, plutes
There!
Can they hear us now?
Listen! Please!
It's the most beautiful thing ever!
I don't hear nothing!
I don't think so.
But, keep trying.
Never give...UP!!!
Are you sure who the every
Who down in the Whoville is trying?
Where's JoJo?
Probably up the old observatory.
Hey, there's our limit.
That's not supposed to
strech that far!
JoJo!
You built this!
We are here.We are here.We are here.
We are here.We are here.We are here.
You're making a mistake.
Mom!
This doesn't concern you, sweety. Back in your pouch!

Everybody, don't stop! Keep going! This gonna do it! Can they hear?

No!

No matter what happens, I couldn't ask for better, son.

Ah, hey, JoJo? Come on! Keep going!

NO!!!
We are here.We are here.We are here.
We are here.We are here.We are here.
No-oh-hoU.

Jojo: Yoop!

Rudy: I hear it! I hear it! They are there!

Narrator: And that yoop. That one small extra yoop put it over.

Narrator: And all the Who noises brusting out of the clover.
- I hear it.
- Me too.
So do I

Rudy. Give me that! Come Ru...

Rudy, get back in the pouch now.

No, Mom.

Uh, Wickersams, get that clover.

What the...E..Anybody take it from him.

Horton: You did it, Mayor. You did it.

We did it!

Yeah!!

Well done, son.

Alright, Mayor!

Jojo: Dad, you're one of the Greats.

Horton: Wow! Easy everyone. Easy! Oh hi, Vlad.

Well, I shouldn't. But, Oh man, that is nice touch.

I'm a mess of this.
I got an emotional.
Here come the water slide.
And someone if you want thank,the good people of nool who put me on a cage and fork me with sticks.
That was me!
My buddy Morton than for being the only who stood by me.
Well, not right by me he's hidden in the bushs.
Sending me good thoughts.
He's small.
Dood. You're a worrier poet.
And most of all I'd like to thank to the Mayor of Whoville.
- Who believed me from the beginning.
- On, Horton.
We're going to miss you.
Hm-um, Gee
What are we gonna do without you, Horton?
Ah, don't worry. I always be around.
- And even as I wonder,
- On~
Keeping in them sight.
You're a candle in the window.
- On a cool dark winter's night.
- Beautiful metaphor.
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might.
Uh, that's a little high funnys.
Baby, I can't fight this feeling any more.
I've forgotten what I started fighting for.
- And if I have to crawl upon the floor.
- Crawl upon the floor.
- Come crashing through your door.
- Crashing through your door.
Whos: Baby I can't fight this feeling any more.

Jojo: I can't fight this feeling any more.

Narrator: And so all ended well for those Horton and Whos.
And for all in the jungle, even Kangaroos.
So let that be a lesson to one and to all.
A person's a person.
No matter how small.
