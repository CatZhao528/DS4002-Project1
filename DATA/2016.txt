There was a time above... 
A time before... 
There were perfect things. 
Diamond absolutes. 
But things fall... 
Things on Earth, 
and what falls... 
- ...is fallen. 
- Master Wayne. Bruce! 
Bruce, are you alright. 
Martha... 
In the dream 
they took me to the light. 
A beautiful lie. 
- Jack. 
- Bruce. 
Jack, listen to me. 
I want you to get everyone 
out of the building. Right now. You understand? 
Let's go. 
Come on, start moving now, people. Let's go. 
The boss wants us out 
of the building. 
So, let's make it happen. 
Jack. 
Jack! 
We're sorry. 
All services are busy now. 
Will you please try 
you call again later. 
Heaven god. 
Creator of heaven and earth. 
Have mercy on my soul. 
JACK!!! 
Mr. Wayne! 
Mr. Wayne! 
I can't feel my legs. 
- I can't feel my legs. 
- We need help over here! 
Help me. 
I can't feel my legs. 
You're going to be okay, 
Page 2/43
you hear me? 
Wallace. 
What do they call you, Wally? 
Huh? 
You're the boss, Boss. 
Alright. 
- You're going to be okay. 
- Easy, easy. 
Come on. 
Oh my god. 
I can't feel my legs. 
I can't... 
I can't feel my legs. 
It's okay. 
You're going to be okay. 
You're okay, alright. 
Huh. 
Okay, you know what? 
We're going to find your mom. 
Where is she? 
18 MONTHS LATER 
NAIROBI, AFRICA 
Are you a terrorist, general? 
They did not tell me 
the interview was with a lady. I'm not a lady, 
I'm a journalist. 
What I am, 
is a man with nothing, 
except a love of my people. 
Uh, don't open... 
You just exposed... 
Who's paying for these 
security contractors, general? Who pays for the drones that 
passed over our heads at night? One question begs another. 
Yes? 
CIA. 
They're tracking us. 
No! 
Not her. 
We just used her credentials as cover. She doesn't know anything. 
Page 3/43
It's okay, Lois. 
I... 
I didn't know. 
Ignorance is not the same... 
as innocence. 
Miss Lane. 
Get up! 
Stand up! 
Move out! 
Take 1 step, 
you will see the inside of her head. The women in the village 
heard a noise. 
Like the sky crack open. 
He came down, so many dead. 
Even worse came after. 
The government attacked. 
No mercy in the villages. 
My parents tried to run... 
The world has been so caught up with what Superman can do, 
that... 
no one has asked what he should do. Let the record show that 
this committee holds him responsible. He'll never answer to you. 
He answers to no one. 
Not even I think, to god. 
- Hey. 
- Hey. 
I was going to cook. 
Surprise you. 
They held hearings about what happened. - They're saying that... 
- I don't care. 
I don't care 
what they're saying. 
The woman I love could have 
been blown up or shot 
- Think of what could have happened. - Well, think about what did happen. I didn't kill those men if 
that's what they think. 
If that's what you're saying? 
Page 4/43
I'm saying I want to 
understand what happened. 
I'm saying, 
thank you for saving my life. 
I'm saying there's a cost. 
I just don't know 
if it's possible. 
Don't know what's possible? 
For you to love me and be you. Clark, you're going to 
flood the apartment. 
Mmm-hmm. 
There has been a report of screaming at location 1939 Harbor Way 
Possible shots fired. 
Go. 
It saved us. 
A devil. 
It's okay. 
It's okay. 
We're-We're going to help. 
It saved us. 
Okay, we're going to 
get you out of here. 
Okay? 
It's still here. 
I - I don't understand. 
AH! 
Christ! 
I saw him. 
I never saw him before. 
I didn't know... 
You almost took my face off. 
How about you don't shoot 
the good guys, huh? 
Oh. 
Jesus Christ. 
He branded him. 
Still working. 
You're getting slow in 
your old age, Alfred. 
It comes to us all, 
master Wayne. 
Even you got too old to die young, Page 5/43
and not for lack of trying. 
Funnel, fairy, bubblebath. 
Funnel, fairy, bubblebath. 
There's nothing wrong 
with the microphone. 
It's this new layer or armor. 
I'll just have to rewire. 
So... 
last night was productive? 
Nope. He's too low level, 
he knew nothing. 
This, is a man who knows things. Anatoli Knyazev. 
He's Russian. 
Contracts all over the globe but he's base out of the port of Gotham. Weapons and human trafficking. 
So, the "White Portuguese" is a Russian, that's the theory. 
No. 
The theory is that the Russian 
lead me to the man himself. 
If he is indeed a him. 
You don't know if he exist. 
He could be a phantasm. 
One that wants to bring 
a dirty bomb into Gotham? 
Ah, high state front. 
New rules. 
We're criminals, Alfred. 
We've always been criminals, 
nothing's change. 
Oh. 
Yes it has, sir. 
Everything's change. 
Men fall from the sky. 
And gods hurl thunderbolts. 
Innocents die. 
That's how it starts. 
The fever, the rage, 
the feeling of... powerlessness that turns good men... 
cruel. 
Justice turn dark across the harbor Page 6/43
when police found an alleged sex trafficker apparently tortured and branded 
by the Gotham bat. 
The man is the second criminal 
found baring the bat brand. 
The first victim, an accused child predator later was assaulted in prison 
and remains in critical care 
from his injuries. 
One source tells Metropolis, 
that many believed 
the mark of the Bat brand in prison essentially is a death sentence. 
In other news, the mayor 
has announced that Metroplis... 
Frank, your D! 
(Defense) 
Woo. 
Ah! 
A hoi hoi. 
I didn't know you were here. 
- Man on the marquee. 
- Stop, don't believe it. 
My father named the company after himself. He was the Lex in front of the Corp. - Hi, how are you doing? 
- Oh, really great. 
Really great? 
Good. Good. 
Uh. 
Follow me. 
You know, Dad was born 
in east Germany. 
He grew up eating uh... 
stale crackers. 
And every other Saturday, 
he had to march in a parade 
and waved flowers at tyrants. 
So, I think it was providence 
that his son, 
me, would end up with this. 
One of my rebuild Metropolis crews found it. 
A little souvenir from 
Page 7/43
the Kryptonian World Engine. 
What's a rock have to do 
with Homeland Security. 
Homeland Security? 
Mmm. 
No, no, no... ma'am. 
Planetary Security. 
The fragment is of a 
radio active Xeno mineral 
We suspected it might have 
bio interactions, 
so, we took the sample 
to AMRIID. 
Where they keep the remains 
of the Kryptonian decedent. 
And, when we exposed 
general Zod to the mineral, 
this happened. 
Profound biodegradation, 
decaying Kryptonian cells. 
We concluded the mineral 
could be weaponized, 
if a large enough 
sample was found. 
And then, among the fishes, 
a whale! 
Lying at the bottom 
of the Indian Ocean 
Emerald City. 
Beautiful. 
Now, Rocky is radio active, but, what he needs from you 
is an import license. 
And why would we 
want to weaponize this material? As a deterrent. 
A silver bullet to keep in reserve to use against the Kryptonians. So, the day doesn't come, Madame. When your children are waving daisies at a reviewing stand. 
Last I looked, 
the only one of those 
flying around up here 
Page 8/43
was Superman. 
Ha. 
Yes, Superman. 
Yeah, but, there are... 
there are more of them. 
- The meta-human thesis. 
- Yes, the meta-human thesis. 
More likely than not. 
These exceptional beings live among us. The bases of our myths. 
Gods among men upon our... 
our little blue planet here. 
You don't have to use 
the silver bullet, 
but, if you forge one... 
Well, then... 
We don't have to depend 
upon the kindness of monsters. 
Sir. 
Get down. 
Sir, I said, get down, now! 
Can we get some backup here? 
Hey. Hey. 
Don't do it! 
HEY! 
Lois. 
Crime Lab, on 3. 
This is Lane. 
Kent, you're sports today. 
I want you to follow 
up on the football. 
Underdog dreams dashed 
10 yards between Gotham and glory. Hey. 
Are you guys watching this? 
Emergency responders quickly created a precautionary perimeter around Heroes Park while they brought the man down 
from this beloved monument. 
The suspect has been identified 
as Wallace Vernon Keefe. 
I work for Bruce Wayne! 
I work for Bruce Wayne! 
There'll be arraign on charges of Page 9/43
vandalism, resisting arrest 
FALSE GOD - and a felony charge of making terrorist threats 
that carries up to 
40 years in prison. 
Poor son of a bitch. 
- Jenny. 
- Mm? 
Headline. 
"End of love affair 
with man in the sky?" 
Okay. 
There're ways 
we can help each other. 
Ah. 
Could you step 
into my office here? 
Yes! 
What's your wish list? 
Uh. 
Access to the wreck of the 
crashed Kryptonian ship. 
Done. 
The complete remains 
of the dead alien for testing. You want Zod's body? 
Okay. 
It's cherry. 
- Show him what you got! 
- Dude, let's go! 
Make sure to hit his left. 
Come on. 
Throw a punch, will you? 
Let's go! 
Come on! 
Thank you. 
The house treats luck like an insult. Good luck for one has always 
gives others misfortune. 
But, eventually, 
all accounts will be settled. 
3 nights with a Bolshoi ballerina, the line was all she tell me. 
Not all I'm sure. 
Page 10/43
Good evening. 
DEVICE CLONING: 
SUCCESSFUL: 
It's like a 1 man reign of terror. This bat vigilante has been 
consistently targeting the port and the adjacent projects 
and tenements. 
And as far as I can tell 
the cops are actually helping him. Crime wave in Gotham. 
Other breaking news. 
Water, wet. 
- Did you file the football yet? - Why aren't we covering this? Poor people don't buy papers? 
People don't buy papers, 
period, Kent. 
Perry, when you assign a story, you're making a choice about who matters... - ...and who's worth it. 
- Good morning, Smallville 
The America conscious died 
with Robert, Martin and John. 
Sorry. 
Sorry. 
No match. 
My guys in the crime lab, 
never seen one before. 
It's called a bullet. 
You shoot people with it. 
Recovered from the scene 
of the fire fight in the desert. Not sold anywhere commercially in the world, even black market. So? 
So, who gave prototype military rounds to tribe fighters in the Sahara. The ass, Lois. 
Flight to DC tonight, 
a couple of days there. 
Go. 
Page 11/43
Coach. 
No extra leg room. 
Economy plus. 
Coach! 
Senator. 
My dad always said that, 
Kentucky mash 
was the secret to health. 
This was his room. 
I left it just the way it was. It's silly. 
The magical thinking of orphan boys. I'm blocking the import license for your mineral. 
The Red Capes are coming! 
The Red Capes are coming! 
You and your hearings... 
galloping through the streets 
to warn us. 
One, if by land. 
Two, if by air. 
Do you know the oldest lie 
in America, Senator? 
- Can I call you June? 
- You can call me whatever you like. Take a bucket of piss and 
call it Granny's peach tea. 
Take a weapon of assassination and call it deterrence. 
You won't fool a fly on me. 
I'm not going to drink it. 
Hey, you don't think 
Dad would mind, do you? 
If I change just... 
...just one thing in this room. Because, that should be upside down. Now, we know better now, 
don't we? 
The devils don't come from 
hell beneath us. No. 
No, they come from the sky. 
MARTHA WAYNE: 
1946 - 1981 
Page 12/43
Wrong room, miss. 
Secretary Swanwick, you haven't been returning my phone calls. 
Miss Lane, if you like an interview, Major Farris is just outside that door. You're treating me like a stranger? I'm treating you like a reporter. Alright. 
Is the US providing experimental 
military arms to rebels in Africa? You know with balls like yours. 
You belong in here. 
Who's your source on this? 
A tin foil hat? 
No, not tin, but it's metal. 
Fired in the Superman incident. 
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it. - We haven't been told the truth. - Here's the truth. 
A reporter got greedy for a scoop and went where she shouldn't have. Superman acted like some... rogue combatant to rescue her and people died. 
Don't invent a conspiracy theory 
to put back his halo. 
Or yours. 
- Major. 
- Sir. 
Oh. 
I hope the next generation of Waynes won't inherit an empty wine cellar. Don't think there's a likely 
to be a next generation. 
Thank you, sir. 
This is every call made 
from the Russian's phone. 
Two mentions of business 
with the "White Portuguese" and 
it's continuing transmitting black out data to the personal residence 
of Alexandra Luthor. 
You think Lex Luthor 
is the "White Portuguese"? 
I can't see that he needs 
Page 13/43
the income from imported arms. 
Regardless, I'll need to 
put a 'leech' in his house, 
and I'm going to need the suit. The Bat interrogated 6 people 
and came away with nothing. 
It was Bruce Wayne 
that got the information. 
Well, Bruce Wayne can't 
break into Lex Luthor's house. 
Bruce Wayne won't have to. 
He's been invited. 
HA HA HA Joke's on you BATMAN 
- That's him right there! 
- There he is! Get a shot! 
- Bruce, over here! 
- Bruce, Bruce. 
- Wayne, have a shot. 
- Mr. Wayne! 
- Right here, one second. 
- This way, Mr. Wayne! 
Who's that? 
You must be new to the 
let them eat cake beat. 
That is Bruce Wayne. 
Philanthropist. 
Bibliophile. 
True friend of the library of Metropolis. Mr. Lex Luthor. 
Nikki. 
You're embarrassing me. 
Speech. Speech. 
Uh, blah blah blah. 
Open bar. 
The word Philanthropist, 
comes from the Greek. 
Meaning a lover of humanity 
It was coined about, 
2,500 years ago... 
Alright, where am I going, Alfred? Approach the elevator, 
to your left. 
That where it must be. 
It's in the service 
Page 14/43
corridor in the basement. 
Go down the stairs. 
Prometheus went with us, 
and he ruined Zeus' plan 
to destroy man kind 
and for that, he was given a thunderbolt. Chooo! 
Hm. 
That seems unfair. 
On the serious note, 
the library of Metropolis... 
Down the stairs. 
It's the only way in, down the stairs. But, at one time, 
Dad could not either. 
No, my father could not 
afford the books, so... 
He had to root through the garbage for yesterday's newspaper. 
Now you got the kitchens 
on your right. 
To the left. 
Right in front of you, 
that's where you want to be. 
May I help you, Mr. Wayne? 
Uh, I just... 
thought the bathroom was down here. I must have... 
That last Martini was a... 
too too many, I think. 
- Men's room is upstairs. 
- Great, I'm okay. 
I like those shoes. 
I can't stay down here, Alfred. Go upstairs and socialize. 
Some young lady from Metropolis will make you honest. 
In your dreams, Alfred. 
Books are knowledge, 
and knowledge is puff worth. 
And I am... 
Heh heh heh, no. 
I, umm. 
No, what am I? 
Page 15/43
Alright, what am I suppose to say? No. 
The bitter sweet pain among man is having knowledge with no power. Because... 
Because that is paradoxical, 
and umm... 
Thank you for coming. 
Please, drink, it's free. 
Mr. Wayne. 
Mr. Wayne. 
Clark Kent, Daily Planet. 
Oh, my foundation has already issued a statement in support of the... cause. I'm sorry? 
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit. 
Don't quote me, alright? 
What's your position on the 
bat vigilante in Gotham? 
Daily Planet. 
Wait, do I own this one? 
Or was that the other guy? 
Civil liberties has been 
trampled on in your city. 
Good people living in fear. 
Don't believe everything you hear, son. I've seen it, Mr. Wayne. 
He thinks he's above the law. 
The Daily Planet criticizing those who think they're above the laws. A little hypocritical, wouldn't you say? Considering every time your hero saves a cat out of a tree, 
you write a puff piece editorial, about an alien who... 
if he wanted to, 
could burn the whole place down. There wouldn't be a damn thing 
we can do to stop him. 
Most of the world doesn't share your opinion, Mr. Wayne. 
Maybe it's the... 
Gotham City and me, we just... 
...have a bad history with 
Page 16/43
freaks dressed like clowns. 
Boys! 
Mm, Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ah, I love it! 
I love bringing people together! 
- How are we? 
- Lex. 
Hello, good. 
Hi, hello. 
Lex. It is a pleasure... Ow! 
Wow, that is a good grip! 
You should, 
not pick a fight with this person. So, after all these years, 
we've finally got you over to Metropolis. - Well, I thought I come drink you dry. - Well, you're welcome. 
You should hop the hub more often though, I love to show you my labs. 
Maybe we could, 
be partner on something. 
My R&D is up to 
all sorts of no good. 
TRANSFER COMPLETE 
- That's 7 minutes. 
Look likes the transfer's complete. - Mr. Luthor. 
- Yes. 
- The governor. 
- Governor. 
- Excuse me. 
- Next time. 
- Governor, hi. 
- Lex, it's good to see you. 
"... A deadly factory fire has interrupted the Day of the Dead celebration in Juarez." Excuse me. 
"I can't believe they're 
going to let that poor girl die." We, as a population on this planet, have been looking for a savior. 
90% of people believe 
in a higher power. 
And every religion believes 
Page 17/43
in some sort messianic figure. 
And when this savior character 
actually comes to Earth, 
we want to make him abide 
by our rules? 
We have to understand that 
this is a paradigm shift. 
We have to start thinking 
beyond politics. 
Are there any 
moral constraints on this person? We have international law. 
On this Earth, 
every act is a political act. 
Is it really surprising, 
that the most powerful man in the world should be a figure of controversy? To have an individual engaging 
in the state level interventions should give us all pause. 
Human beings have a horrible track record of following people with great power, down paths that lead to 
huge human monstrosities. 
We have always created icons 
in our own image. 
What we've done is we project 
ourselves on to him. 
The fact is, maybe he's not 
some sort of devil or Jesus character. Maybe hes just a guy 
trying to do the right thing. 
Were talking about a being 
whose very existence 
challenges our own sense of 
priority in the universe. 
If you go back to Copernicus, 
where he restored 
the sun and the center of the 
known universe, displacing Earth. And you get to Darwinian evolution and you find out, 
we're not special on this Earth we're just one among 
Page 18/43
other life forms. 
And now we learned, that we're not even special in the entire universe because there is Superman. 
There he is, an alien, among us. We're not alone. 
Are you, as a United State Senator, personally comfortable 
saying to a grieving parent, 
"Superman could've saved your child, but on principle 
we did not want him to act." 
I'm not saying he shouldn't act. I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally. What are we talking about here then? Must there be a Superman? 
There is. 
Keefe, you made bail. 
Open Two. 
Who paid? 
Who the hell are you? 
- Just a man. 
- Yeah? 
Well, what do you want? 
To help you stand for something. Your 3 o'clock's here. 
He made me half a man. 
Let me face him. 
So, I logged into your drop box to find a copy. 
There's a copy, alright. 
But, nothing about football. 
Nothing about... 
Friends of the Metropolis Library, just... 
The god damn Gotham bat thing, 
I told you not to pursue. 
The police won't help, 
the press has to do the right thing. You don't get to decide 
what the right thing is. 
When the Planet was founded, 
it stood for something, Perry. 
So could you, if it was 1938, 
Page 19/43
but it's not 1938. 
WPA aren't hiring no more. 
Apples don't cost a nickel. 
Not in here. Not out there. 
You drop this thing. 
Nobody cares about Clark Kent 
taking on the Batman. 
It's the sword of Alexander. 
It's the blade that 
cut the Gordian Knot. 
- It's a triumph. 
- Yes. 
- Enjoy. 
- Thank you. 
It's a fake. 
The real was sold in '98 
on the black market. 
- Now it hangs... 
- Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar. Excuse me. 
Excuse me, Miss. 
The other night, you took something that doesn't belong to you. 
Stealing's not polite. 
Is it stealing if you steal 
from another thief? 
Who are you? 
Someone interested in 
the same man you are. 
Is that right? 
I believe Mr. Luthor has 
a photo that belongs to me. 
Did you get it? 
As it happens, no, I didn't. 
The data you copied 
is military grade encryption. 
You know. 
I bet with that dress 
9 out of 10 men would let you 
get away with anything. 
But, you're the 10th. 
Mmm. 
I guess I am the first, 
to see through that babe 
Page 20/43
in the woods act. 
You don't know me, 
but, I've known 
a few women like you. 
Oh, I don't think you've ever 
known a woman like me. 
You know, it's true what 
they say about little boys: 
Born with no natural 
inclination to share. 
I didn't steal your drive. 
I borrowed it. 
You'll find it in the 
glove compartment of your car. Mr. Wayne.

JUSTICE? 
WHITE PORTUGUESE harbored in - Gotham WHITE PORTUGUESE 
The "WHITE PORTUGUESE" is not a man. It's a ship. 
Master Wayne. 
Since the age of 7, you have 
been to the art of deception 
as Mozart to the harpsichord. 
But you've never been 
too hot of lying to me. 
The WHITE PORTUGUESE 
isn't carrying a dirty bomb. 
What is it carrying? 
It's a weapon. 
It's a rock. 
A minerals, capable of 
weakening Kryptonian cells. 
The first sample big 
enough to mean something 
turned up in the 
Indian Ocean 3 months ago. 
It is now aboard the White Portuguese being delivered to Lex Luthor. Who I am going to steal it from. To keep it out of Luthor's hands. To destroy it. 
Page 22/43
No. 
You're going to go to war? 
That son of a bitch brought 
the war to us, 2 years ago. 
Jesus, Alfred. 
Count the dead. 
Thousands of people. 
What's next? 
Millions? 
He has the power to wipe out 
the entire human race 
and If we believe there even a 1% chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it 
as an absolute certainty. 
And we have to destroy him. 
But, he is not our enemy. 
Not today. 
20 years in Gotham, Alfred. 
We've seen what promises are worth. How many good guys are left. 
How many stay that way. 
Kent, I want to talk to you. 
Daily Planet 
Kent! 
Where does he go? 
Where does he go, Jenny? 
I don't-I don't know. 
Clicks his heels 3 times, 
goes back to Kansas I suppose. Son of a... 
I don't have a halo over me, 
Mr. secretary. 
I went into the desert, 
people died. 
It keeps me awake.

SEARCHING FOR TRANSPONDER SIGNAL LEXCORP RESEARCH PARK 
How do we determine what's good? In a democracy, good is a conversation not a unilateral decision. 
So, I urge Superman, to come to this hearth of the people tomorrow. To see those who have suffered. The world needs to know 
what happened in that desert. 
And to know what he stands for. How far will he take his power. Does he act by our will, 
or by his own. 
People hate what they don't understand But they see what you do, 
and they know who you are. 
You're not a killer. 
A threat? 
I never wanted this world 
to have you. 
Be their hero, Clark. 
Be their monument. 
Be their angel. 
Be anything they need you to be. Or be none of it. 
You don't owe this world a thing. You never did. 
CIA thinks the desert was a setup. Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty. The bullet? 
The metal was developed 
Page 24/43
by a private company. 
What company? 
LEXCORP. 
Lex Luthor? 
He also had private security contractors in the desert compound. 
Go on record. 
Not a chance. 
It's classified. 
I happen to like my job. 
It doesn't make sense. 
You said that the ambush was 
arranged to frame Superman, 
but how could they know 
that he'll show up in the... 
...in the middle of the desert. Thank you. 
Alright, come on through. 
The Senate hearing is expected 
to get under way in any minute now. Of course the big unknown 
in all of this is: 
Will Superman show up? That is 
what they're really waiting to see. Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe. 
Soledad O'Brien "In the Moment" Quick question for you. 
You're heading in to meet with the senators. What would you tell them? Um. I've come here 
to tell them to wake up. 
This is flesh and blood. 
He's delivered a war here. 
And this... 
This is what war looks like. 
I have nothing. 
There are plenty of people, sir, who would say he's their hero. 
He is not a hero! 
Grace can you get Greg 
up here please, right now. 
Senator! 
Hi, you. 
Don't go anywhere. 
Page 25/43
I want to talk to you. 
You know what, Mercy? You go in and... make sure no one takes my seat. 
So, what'd you been up to? 
I'm just here to tell my story. 
That I was willing to finance 
a Kryptonian deterrent, 
but a certain junior Senator from Kentucky decided to block it. 
Yes, the Chair of the Committee 
on Superman is soft on security. Greg, why hasn't he 
been getting our checks? 
He is, Mr. Wayne. 
He gets a check from the 
victims fund every month. 
BRUCE WAYNE, OPEN YOUR EYES 
- He returns them. 
An employee of Wayne financial 
who lost both his legs 
in those horrific events in Metropolis that happened 2 years ago. 
Bruce, NO TRUCE 
- Jesus. 
- B WAYNE, I HAUNT YOU 
- BRUCE WAYNE = BLIND 
Why haven't I seen this? 
I'm sorry. 
I'll get to the bottom of it. 
And there he is. 
Superman is here. 
He's actually at the 
United States capitol. 
This is really a historic moment. Nor we expect that Superman would give some kind of a statement to the Senate to the American people, 
and of course to the world. 
He's here. 
He came. 
- He's above the Capitol. 
- Ow. 
You are going to be on the 
hot seat in there, June bun. 
Page 26/43
I grew up on a farm. 
I know how to wrestle a pig. 
Do you know the oldest lie 
in America, Senator? 
It's that power can be innocent. Good luck.

Another one came this morning 
Mr. Wayne. 
Let me say at the outset that 
I am grateful to our witness 
for coming before us today. 
This is how a democracy works. We talk to each other. 
We act by the consent 
of the govern, sir, 
I have sat here before 
to say that shadow interventions will not tolerate by this Committee. Neither will lies. 
Because today is a day for truth. Because only by speaking... 
Only by working... 
together, can we...

can we create a free and a...

All this time. 
I've been living my life 
the way my father saw it. 
Mending wrongs for a ghost. 
Thinking I'm here to do good. 
Superman was never real. 
It's just a dream of 
a farmer from Kansas. 
That farmer's dream is 
all some people have. 
It's all that gives them hope. 
This means something.

Something, isn't it? 
We met Kansas, live on a pancake so we come to the mountains. 
All downhill from here. 
Down to the flood plain. 
The farm is at the 
bottom of the world. 
I remember one season 
water came bad. 
I couldn't been 12. 
Dad had out the shovels 
and we went at it all night. 
We worked until 
I think I fainted. 
But we managed to 
stop the water. 
We saved the farm. 
Your grandma baked me a cake. 
She said I was a hero. 
Later that day we found out. 
We blocked the water, alright, we sent it upstream. 
All alike farm washed away. 
While eating my hero cake, 
their horses were drowning. 
I used to hear them 
wailing in my sleep. 
Did the nightmares ever stop? 
Yeah. 
When I met your mother. 
She gave me faith that 
there is good in this world. 
She was my world.

I miss you, son. 
I miss you too, Dad. 
You know you can't win. 
It's suicide. 
I'm older now than 
my father ever was. 
This maybe the only thing 
I do that matters. 
20 years of fighting criminals amount to nothing? 
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred. Pull 1 up, another 
grows in it's place. 
This is about the future 
of the world. 
It's my legacy. 
You know, my father sat 
me down, right here. 
Told me what Wayne manor 
was built of. 
Railways, real estates and oil. The first generation made their fortune trading with the French. Pelts and skins. 
They were hunters. 
We got to wait for more evidence, but the question still remains, where is he? 
If Superman was not involved, 
If he's got nothing to hide, 
then why hasn't he been seen 
since the day of this tragedy? Look, you can't... 
The knight is here. 
Excuse me. 
Don't I know you... 
Plain lo, in the morning

Mmm. 
Come see the view. 
Now, the secret is the height. It's the building material. 
It's light metals, which...

sway a bit in the wind. 
And you know something about LEXCORP metals, don't you, Miss Lane? 
I've proven what you've done. 
Wow, you're feisty. 
Unfortunately, that will blow away. Like sand in the desert. 
You're psychotic. 
That is a three syllable word for any thought too big for little minds.

You came back. 
Boy, do we have problems up here! The problem of,

The problem of absolute virtue. I'll take you in without breaking you. Which is more than you deserve. The problem of you 
on top of everything else. 
You above all. 
Ah. 
'Cause that's what God is. 
Horus. Apollo.

he cannot be all good. 
And if he's all good 
then he cannot be all powerful. And neither can you be.

I think you'll fight, fight, fight for that special lady in your life. She's safe on the ground. 
How about you? 
Close, but I'm not 
talking about Lois. 
No. Every boy's special lady

must be a witch. 
The punishment for witches, what is that? That's right. 
Death by fire. 
Where is she? 
I don't know! 
I wouldn't let them tell me! 
If you kill me, Martha dies. 
And if you fly away, Martha also dies. But if you kill the Bat... 
Martha lives. 
There we go. 
There we go.

We will. 
We have to.

Why did you say 
they'll have to fight?

Good morning, Soldier. 
Ready to comply. 
I have a mission for you. 
Sanction and extract. 
No witnesses. 
Well done Soldier. 
All right, what do you see? 
Standard beat cops. 
Small station. 
Quiet street. 
It's a good target. 
There's an ATM on the 
south corner, which means? 
Cameras. 
Both cross streets are one-way. So, compromised escape routes. Means our guy doesn't 
care about being seen. 
He isn't afraid 
to make a mess on the way out. You see that Range Rover 
halfway up the block? 
Yeah, the red one? It's cute. 
It's also bulletproof, 
which means private security... which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us. You guys know 
I can move things with my mind, right? Looking over your shoulder 
needs to become second nature. Anybody ever tell you 
you're a little paranoid? 
Page 2/52
Not to my face. 
Why? Did you hear something? 
Eyes on target, folks. 
This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months. I don't want to lose him. If he sees us coming, 
that won't be a problem. 
He kind of hates us. 
Sam... 
see that garbage truck? 
Tag it. 
Give me X-ray. 
That truck's loaded for max weight. And the driver's armed. 
It's a battering ram. 
- Go now. 
- What? 
He's not hitting the police. 
Body armour, AR-15s. 
I make seven hostiles. 
I make five. 
Sam. 
Four. 
Rumlow's on the third floor. 
Wanda, just like we practised. 
What about the gas? 
Get it out. 
Pack it up. 
He's here. 
Rumlow has a biological weapon. I'm on it. 
I don't work like that no more. Fire in the hole. 
No! 
Sam. 
He's in an AFV heading north. 
Take this to the airstrip. 
We're not gonna outrun them. 
Lose the truck. 
Where are you going to meet us? I'm not. 
I've got four, they're splitting up. I got the two on the left. 
They ditched their gear. 
Page 3/52
It's a shell game now. 
One of them has the payload. 
There you are, you son of a bitch. I've been waiting for this. 
He doesn't have it. 
I'm empty! 
Out of the way! 
Drop it. 
Or I'll drop this. 
- Drop it! 
- He'll do it! 
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam. 
Don't thank me. 
I'm not thanking that thing. 
His name is Redwing. 
I'm still not thanking it. 
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him. 
Come on! 
This is for dropping 
a building on my face. 
Ahh! 
I think I look pretty good, 
all things considered. 
Who's your buyer? 
You know, he knew you. 
Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky. What did you say? 
He remembered you. 
I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me... 
"Please tell Rogers. 
"When you gotta go... 
"you gotta go." 
And you're coming with me. 
Oh, my... 
Sam... 
we need Fire and Rescue 
on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there. 
Try to remember the kind of September When grass was green 
Wake up, dear, 
Page 4/52
and say goodbye to your father. Who's the homeless person on the couch? This is why 
I love coming home for Christmas... right before you leave town. 
Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad. Really? Which broad? What's her name? Candice. 
Do me a favour? 
Try not to burn 
the house down before Monday. 
Okay, so it's Monday. 
That is good to know, 
I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going? 
Your father's flying us 
to the Bahamas for a little getaway. We might have to make a quick stop. At the Pentagon. Right? 
Don't worry, you're gonna love 
the holiday menu at the commissary. They say sarcasm 
is a metric for potential. 
If that's true, 
you'll be a great man someday. 
I'll get the bags. 
He does miss you when you're not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time 
we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. 
If you don't, you'll regret it. I love you, Dad. 
And I know you did the best you could. That's how I wish it happened. 
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing... or BARF. 
God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method 
of hijacking the hippocampus... to clear traumatic memories. 
Huh. 
It doesn't change the fact that they Page 5/52
never made it to the airport... or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but... 
Plus, $611 million for my 
little therapeutic experiment? 
No one in their right mind 
would've ever funded it. 
Help me out, 
what's the MIT mission statement? "To generate, disseminate... 
"and preserve knowledge. 
"And work with others... 
"to bring it to bear on 
the world's great challenges." 
Well, you are the others. 
And, quiet as it's kept... 
the challenges facing you 
are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke. 
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment... 
every student has been made 
an equal recipient... 
of the inaugural 
September Foundation Grant. 
As in... 
all of your projects have 
just been approved and funded. 
No strings, no taxes... 
just reframe the future! 
Starting now. 
Go break some eggs. 
Wow. Wow. 
That took my breath away. 
Oh, Tony! So generous. 
So much money! Wow! 
Out of curiosity... 
will any portion of that grant 
be made available to faculty? 
I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out. I have got this killer idea 
for a self-cooking hotdog. 
Basically, chemical detonator embedded... Restroom's this way, yeah? 
Page 6/52
Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft. Mr Stark, I am so sorry 
about the teleprompter. 
I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it. It's fine. I'll be right back. 
We'll catch up later. 
That was nice, 
what you did for those young people. Ah, they deserve it. 
Plus, it helps ease my conscience. They say there's a correlation 
between generosity and guilt. 
But if you've got the money... 
break as many eggs as you like. 
Right? 
Are you going up? 
I'm right where I want to be. 
Okay. Hey. 
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard. I work for the State Department. Human Resources. 
I know it's boring... 
but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be. His name was Charlie Spencer. 
You murdered him. 
In Sokovia. 
Not that that matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us? 
You just fight for yourself. 
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead... 
and I blame you. 
11 Wakandans were among 
those killed during a confrontation... between the Avengers 
and a group of mercenaries... 
in Lagos, Nigeria last month. 
The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission... 
in Lagos, when the attack occurred. Our people's blood is spilled 
on foreign soil... 
Page 7/52
not only because of 
the actions of criminals... 
but by the indifference 
of those pledged to stop them. 
Victory at the expense of the innocent... is no victory at all. 
The Wakandan king went on to... They are operating outside 
and above the international law. Because that's the reality, 
if we don't respond to acts like these. What legal authority does an enhanced individual like Wanda Maximoff have... to operate in Nigeri...? 
It's my fault. 
That's not true. 
Turn the TV back on. 
They're being very specific. 
I should've clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it. Rumlow said "Bucky"... 
and all of a sudden 
I was a 16-year-old kid again, 
in Brooklyn. 
And people died. 
It's on me. 
It's on both of us. 
This job... 
We try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody. But if we can't find a way 
to live with that... 
then next time... 
maybe nobody gets saved. 
Vis! We talked about this. 
Yes, but the door was open 
so I assumed that... 
Captain Rogers wished to know 
when Mr Stark was arriving. 
Thank you. We'll be right down. I'll use the door. 
Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest. We know who it is? 
The Secretary of State. 
Page 8/52
Five years ago... 
I had a heart attack... 
and dropped right in 
the middle of my backswing. 
Turned out it was the best 
round of my life... 
because after 13 hours 
of surgery and a triple bypass... I found something 40 years 
in the Army had never taught me. Perspective. 
The world owes the Avengers 
an unpayable debt. 
You have fought for us... 
protected us, risked your lives... but while a great many people 
see you as heroes... 
there are some... 
who would prefer the word "vigilantes." What word would you use, Mr Secretary? How about "dangerous"? 
What would you call a group 
of US-based, enhanced individuals... who routinely ignore sovereign borders... and inflict their will 
wherever they choose... 
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind? 
New York. 
Washington, D.C. 
Sokovia. 
Lagos. 
Okay. That's enough. 
For the past four years, 
you've operated with unlimited power... and no supervision. 
That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. 
The Sokovia Accords. 
Approved by 117 countries... 
it states that the Avengers 
shall no longer be a private organisation. Instead... 
Page 9/52
they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel... 
only when and if that panel 
deems it necessary. 
The Avengers were formed to 
make the world a safer place. 
I feel we've done that. 
Tell me, Captain, do you know 
where Thor and Banner are right now? If I misplaced a couple of 
30 megaton nukes... 
you can bet there'd be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. 
That's how the world works. 
Believe me, this is the middle ground. So, there are contingencies. 
Three days from now, 
the UN meets in Vienna... 
to ratify the Accords. 
Talk it over. 
And if we come 
to a decision you don't like? 
Then you retire. 
Hello? 
Is this your car out front? 
I jumped the kerb. 
Maybe we could... 
take care of it ourselves. 
If you wanna call the cops, 
that's okay, too... 
- I guess. 
- No. 
No cops. 
Thank you. 
You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations. 
"Mission report. December 16, 1991." Who are you? 
My name is Zemo. 
I will repeat my question. 
Mission report, December 16, 1991. How did you find me? 
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell... 
Black Widow released 
Page 10/52
HYDRA files to the public. 
Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted. Not easy to decipher. 
But, I have experience. 
And patience. 
A man can do anything if he has those. What do you want? 
Mission report. 
December 16. 
Go... to... hell! 
HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I'd have to use this book... 
and other bloodier methods 
to find what I need. 
I don't look forward to that. 
You'd only be dying for... 
your pride. 
Hail HYDRA. 
Secretary Ross has 
a Congressional Medal of Honour... which is one more than you have. 
So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals? 117 countries want to sign this. 
117, Sam, and you're just like, 
"No, that's cool. We got it." 
How long are you going to play both sides? I have an equation. 
Oh, this will clear it up. 
In the eight years since Mr Stark announced himself as Iron Man... 
the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. 
During the same period... 
the number of potentially 
world-ending events 
has risen at a commensurate rate. Are you saying it's our fault? 
I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. 
And conflict... 
Page 11/52
breeds catastrophe. 
Oversight... 
Oversight is not an idea that 
can be dismissed out of hand. 
Boom. 
Tony. 
You are being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal. 
It's because he's already 
made up his mind. 
Boy, you know me so well. 
Actually, I'm nursing 
an electromagnetic headache. 
That's what's going on, Cap. 
It's just pain. 
It's discomfort. 
Who's putting coffee grounds 
in the disposal? 
Am I running a bed and breakfast 
for a biker gang? 
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. 
Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA... had a floor-level gig 
at Intel planned for the fall. 
But first, he wanted to put 
a few miles on his soul... 
before he parked it 
behind a desk. See the world. 
Maybe be of service. 
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. 
He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. 
Guess where. Sokovia. 
He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. We won't know because we dropped 
a building on him while we were kicking ass. There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! 
Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, 
Page 12/52
if we're boundary-less... 
we're no better than the bad guys. Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up. 
Who said we're giving up? 
We are if we're not 
taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blame. I'm sorry, Steve. 
That is dangerously arrogant. 
This is the United Nations 
we're talking about. 
It's not the World Security Council, it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA. No, but it's run by people 
with agendas, and agendas change. That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realised what my weapons 
were capable of in the wrong hands... I shut it down and stopped manufacturing. Tony, you chose to do that. 
If we sign this, we surrender 
our right to choose. 
What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? 
What if there is somewhere we need to go and they don't let us? 
We may not be perfect, 
but the safest hands are still our own. If we don't do this now, 
it's gonna be done to us later. 
That's the fact. That won't be pretty. You're saying they'll come for me. We would protect you. 
Maybe Tony's right. 
If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off... Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago? I'm just reading the terrain. 
We have made some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back. 
Focus up. I'm sorry. 
Did I just mishear you... 
Page 13/52
- or did you agree with me? 
- I want to take it back now. 
No, you can't retract it. 
Thank you. Unprecedented. 
Okay. Case closed. I win. 
I have to go. 
And now, I would like 
to invite Sharon Carter 
to come up and say a few words. Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D... 
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy. She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told 
anyone we were related. 
I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage... in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. 
She said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. 
Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world 
is telling you to move... 
it is your duty to plant 
yourself like a tree... 
look them in the eye and say 
"No, you move." 
When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. 
Then I found out she was alive. I was just lucky to have her. 
She had you back, too. 
Who else signed? 
Tony, Rhodey, Vision. 
Clint? 
Says he's retired. 
- Wanda? 
- TBD. 
I'm off to Vienna 
Page 14/52
for the signing of the Accords. There's plenty of room on the jet. Just because it's the path 
of least resistance... 
doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together. 
What are we giving up to do it? I'm sorry, Nat. 
I can't sign it. 
I know. 
Then what are you doing here? 
I didn't want you to be alone. 
Come here. 
At a special United Nations conference... 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords. 
Excuse me, Ms Romanoff? 
- Yes? 
- These need your signature. 
- Thank you. 
- Thanks. 
I suppose neither of us 
is used to the spotlight. 
Oh, well, it's not always so flattering. You seem to be doing all right so far. Considering your last trip 
to Capitol Hill... 
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly comfortable in this company. 
Well, I'm not. 
And that alone makes me glad 
you are here, Ms Romanoff. 
Why? You don't approve of all this? The Accords, yes. 
The politics, not really. 
Two people in a room can get 
more done than a hundred. 
Unless you need to move a piano. Ms Romanoff. 
King T'Chaka. 
Please, allow me to apologise 
for what happened in Nigeria. 
Thank you. 
Page 15/52
Thank you for agreeing to all of this. I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today. 
Yes, so am I. 
If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session. That is the future calling. 
Such a pleasure. 
Thank you. 
For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you're getting quite good at it. I'm happy, Father. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
When stolen Wakandan vibranium 
was used to make a terrible weapon... we in Wakanda were forced 
to question our legacy. 
Those men and women killed in Nigeria... were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, 
let misfortune drive us back. 
We will fight to improve 
the world we wish to join. 
I am grateful to the Avengers 
for supporting this initiative. Wakanda is proud 
to extend its hand in peace. 
Everybody get down! 
My mom tried 
to talk me out of enlisting... 
but, um, not Aunt Peggy. 
She bought me my first thigh holster. Very practical. 
And stylish. 
CIA has you stationed over here now? Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force. Right. Right. Sounds fun. 
I know, right? 
I've been meaning to ask you. 
When you were spying on me 
from across the hall... 
You mean when I was doing my job. Page 16/52
Did Peggy know? 
She kept so many secrets. 
I didn't want her to have one from you. Thanks for walking me back. 
Sure. 
Steve. 
There's something you gotta see. A bomb hidden in a news van... Who's coordinating? 
...ripped through 
the UN building in Vienna. 
Good. They're solid. Forensics? More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead, 
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka. Officials have released 
a video of a suspect... 
who they have identified 
as James Buchanan Barnes... 
the Winter Soldier. 
The infamous HYDRA agent... 
linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations. 
I have to go to work. 
Call MI6, see if we can get 
Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here 
in two hours or it's not worth it. I'm very sorry. 
In my culture... 
death is not the end. 
It's more of a stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands... and Bast and Sekhmet, 
they lead you into the green veldt... where you can run forever. 
That sounds very peaceful. 
My father thought so. 
I am not my father. 
T'Challa... 
Task Force will decide 
who brings in Barnes. 
Don't bother, Ms Romanoff. 
I'll kill him myself. 
Page 17/52
Yeah? 
You all right? 
Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. 
I know how much Barnes 
means to you. I really do. 
Stay home. You'll only make this worse. For all of us. 
Please. 
Are you saying you'll arrest me? No. 
Someone will. 
If you interfere. That's how it works now. If he's this far gone, Nat, 
I should be the one to bring him in. Why? 
Because I'm the one 
least likely to die trying. 
Shit. 
She tell you to stay out of it? 
Might have a point. 
He'd do it for me. 
1945, maybe. 
I just want to make sure 
we consider all our options. 
The people that shoot at you 
usually wind up shooting at me. 
Tips have been pouring in 
since that footage went public. 
Everybody thinks 
the Winter Soldier goes to their gym. Most of it's noise. 
Except for this. 
My boss expects a briefing, 
pretty much now... 
so that's all the head start 
you're gonna get. 
Thank you. 
You're gonna have to hurry. 
We have orders to shoot on sight. Homecoming 
One 
One 
Freight car 
I have your breakfast. 
Page 18/52
I could smell it before I opened the door. Side of bacon and black coffee. 
Again. 
I can make you something 
different, if you like. 
This is wonderful... 
I will just put this on your... 
It's okay, I can manage! 
Heads up, Cap. 
German Special Forces, 
approaching from the south. 
Understood. 
Do you know me? 
You're Steve. 
I read about you in a museum. 
They've set the perimeter. 
I know you're nervous, 
and you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying. 
I wasn't in Vienna. 
I don't do that any more. 
They're entering the building. 
Well, the people 
who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning 
on taking you alive. 
That's smart. 
Good strategy. 
They're on the roof. I'm compromised. This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck. - It always ends in a fight. 
- Five seconds. 
You pulled me from the river. 
Why? 
- I don't know. 
- Three seconds. 
Yes, you do. 
Breach! Breach! Breach! 
Buck, stop! 
You're gonna kill someone. 
I'm not gonna kill anyone. 
Suspect has broken containment! 
...he's headed down the east stairwell! Come on, man. 
Page 19/52
Ahhh! 
Sam, southwest rooftop. 
Who the hell's the other guy? 
About to find out. 
- Sam. 
- Got him. 
Stand down! 
Stand down! 
Sam, I can't shake this guy. 
Right behind you. 
Stand down, now. 
Congratulations, Cap. 
You're a criminal. 
Your Highness. 
"A pinch of paprika." 
A pinch. 
Is that paprikash? 
I thought it might lift your spirits. Spirits lifted. 
In my defence, I haven't actually ever eaten anything before, so... May I? 
Please. 
- Wanda? 
- Hmm. 
No one dislikes you, Wanda. 
Thanks. 
Oh, you're welcome. 
No, it's a involuntary response in their amygdala. 
They can't help but be afraid of you. Are you? 
My amygdala is synthetic, so... I used to think of myself one way. But after this... 
I am something else. 
I'm still me, I think, but... 
that's not what everyone else sees. Do you know, I don't know what this is? Not really. 
I know it's not of this world... that it powered Loki's staff, 
gave you your abilities, but... its true nature is a mystery. 
Page 20/52
And yet, it is part of me. 
Are you afraid of it? 
I wish to understand it. 
The more I do, the less it controls me. One day... who knows? 
I may even control it. 
I don't know what's in this 
but it is not paprika. 
I'm gonna go to the store. 
I'll be back in 20 minutes. 
Alternatively, we could order a pizza? Vision, are you not letting me leave? It is a question of safety. 
I can protect myself. 
Not yours. 
Mr Stark would like to avoid 
the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on 
a more secure foundation. 
And what do you want? 
For people to see you... 
as I do. 
So, you like cats? 
- Sam. 
- What? 
Dude shows up dressed like a cat, you don't wanna know more? 
Your suit... it's vibranium? 
The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. 
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend 
murdered my father... 
I also wear the mantle of king. 
So, I ask you... 
as both warrior and king... 
how long do you think you can 
keep your friend safe from me? 
What's gonna happen to him? 
Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition. This is Everett Ross, 
Deputy Task Force Commander. 
What about a lawyer? 
Page 21/52
Lawyer. That's funny. 
See their weapons are placed in lockup. We'll write you a receipt. 
I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that. You'll be provided 
with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favour, stay in it? I don't intend on going anywhere. For the record, this is what 
making things worse looks like. He's alive. 
No. 
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup. Try not to break anything 
while we fix this. 
Consequences? You bet 
there'll be consequences. 
Obviously you can quote me on that, because I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir. 
"Consequences"? 
Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something. 
I'm not getting that shield back, am I? Technically, it's the 
government's property. 
Wings, too. 
That's cold. 
Warmer than jail. 
Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely. 
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill 
with these in 1941. 
Provided support to the Allies 
when they needed it most. 
Some would say it brought 
our country closer to war. 
See? If not for these, 
you wouldn't be here. 
I'm trying to... What do you call it? That's an olive branch. 
Page 22/52
Is that what you call it? 
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her. We're kinda... 
- Well, not kinda... 
- Pregnant? 
No. Definitely not. 
We're taking a break. 
It's nobody's fault. 
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know. A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. 
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA... and then Ultron. My fault. 
And then, and then, and then, 
I never stopped. 
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. 
I thought maybe the Accords 
could split the difference. 
In her defence, I'm a handful. 
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work. I'm glad Howard got married. 
I only knew him 
when he was young and single. 
Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. 
Maybe only a thousand times. 
God, I hated you. 
I don't mean to make things difficult. I know, because you're 
a very polite person. 
If I see a situation pointed south... I can't ignore it. 
Sometimes I wish I could. 
No, you don't. 
No, I don't. 
Sometimes... 
Sometimes I wanna 
punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. 
So far, nothing's happened 
that can't be undone, if you sign. Page 23/52
We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to 
an American psych-centre... 
instead of a Wakandan prison. 
I'm not saying it's impossible... but there would have to be safeguards. Sure. 
Once we put out the PR fire, 
those documents can be amended. 
I'd file a motion to have 
you and Wanda reinstated... 
Wanda? What about Wanda? 
She's fine. She's confined 
to the compound, currently. 
Vision's keeping her company. 
Oh, God, Tony. 
Every time I think you see 
things the right way... 
It's 100 acres with a lap pool. 
It's got a screening room. 
There's worse ways to protect people. Protection? 
Is that how you see this? 
This is protection? It's internment, Tony. - She's not a US citizen. 
- Oh, come on, Tony. 
And they don't grant visas 
to weapons of mass destruction. 
She's a kid! 
Give me a break! 
I'm doing what has to be done. 
To stave off something worse. 
You keep telling yourself that. 
Hate to break up the set. 
Hello, Mr Barnes. 
I've been sent by 
the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? 
Your first name is James? 
The receipt for your gear. 
"Bird costume"? Come on. 
I didn't write it. 
I'm not here to judge you. 
I just want to ask you a few questions. Page 24/52
Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you 
don't talk to me, James. 
My name is Bucky. 
Hello? 
Hey! 
Why would the Task Force 
release this photo to begin with? Get the word out, 
involve as many eyes as we can? Right. It's a good way 
to flush a guy out of hiding. 
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier. 
You're saying someone 
framed him to find him? 
Steve, we looked for the guy 
for two years and found nothing. We didn't bomb the UN. 
That turns a lot of heads. 
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would. 
Yeah. 
Tell me, Bucky. 
You've seen a great deal, haven't you? I don't wanna talk about it. 
You fear that if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. 
Don't worry. 
We only have to talk about one. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Friday, get me a source on that outage. Sub-level five, East Wing. 
What the hell is this? 
Why don't we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean your real home. 
Longing 
No.

Ready to comply. 
Mission report. December 16, 1991. Help me. 
Help. 
Get up. 
Who are you? What do you want? To see an empire fall. 
Hey. 
Evac all civilians. 
Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air. 
Please tell me you brought a suit. Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. 
I'm an active-duty non-combatant. Follow me. 
We're in position. 
You could at least recognise me. Damn it. 
He asked me again 
if you were going to be there. I said I wasn't sure. 
You should have seen his 
little face. Just try, okay? 
I'm going to bed. 
I love you. 
James Barnes the suspect 
in the UN Vienna bombing... 
...escaped custody today. 
...also missing Avenger 
Captain Steve Rogers... 
and Sam Wilson. 
Hey, Cap! 
Steve. 
Which Bucky am I talking to? 
Page 26/52
Your mom's name was Sarah. 
You used to wear newspapers in your shoes. Can't read that in a museum. 
Just like that, we're supposed to be cool? What did I do? 
Enough. 
Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA 
put inside me is still there. 
All he had to do 
was say the goddamn words. 
- Who was he? 
- I don't know. 
People are dead. The bombing, the setup... the doctor did all that just 
to get 10 minutes with you. 
I need you to do 
better than "I don't know." 
He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. 
He wanted to know exactly where. Why would he need to know that? 
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier. It hurts! 
Good work. 
Get me out of here. 
Who were they? 
Their most elite death squad. 
More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum. 
They all turn out like you? 
Worse. 
The doctor, could he control them? Enough. 
Said he wanted to see an empire fall. With these guys, he could do it. They speak 30 languages, 
can hide in plain sight... 
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilise. They can take a whole country down in one night, you'd never see them coming. This would have been 
a lot easier a week ago. 
- If we call Tony... 
Page 27/52
- No, he won't believe us. 
Even if he did... 
Who knows if the Accords 
would let him help. 
We're on our own. 
Maybe not. 
I know a guy. 
I don't suppose you have 
any idea where they are? 
We will. 
GSG 9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. 
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it. You don't get it, Stark. 
It's not yours to handle. 
It's clear you can't be objective. I'm putting Special Ops on this. What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers? If we're provoked. 
Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people 
who would be alive now. 
Feel free to check my math. 
All due respect, you're not gonna solve this with boys and bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in. How would that end 
any differently than last time? Because this time, I won't be 
wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed. 
36 hours. 
Barnes. 
Rogers. 
Wilson. 
Thank you, sir. 
My left arm is numb. Is that normal? You all right? 
Always. 
36 hours. Jeez. 
We're seriously understaffed. 
Oh, yeah. 
Page 28/52
It'd be great if we had 
a Hulk right about now. Any shot? You really think he'd be on our side? No. 
I have an idea. 
Me, too. Where's yours? 
Downstairs. 
Where's yours? 
Hey, May. 
Mmm. Hey. 
How was school today? 
It was okay. 
This crazy car parked outside. 
- Oh, Mr Parker. 
- Um... 
What are you doing... 
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter. 
Tony. 
What are you doing here? 
It's about time we met. 
You've been getting my emails, right? - Yeah. Yeah. 
- Right? 
Regarding the... 
You didn't even tell me about the grant. - About the grant. 
- The September Foundation. 
- Right. 
- Yeah. 
Remember when you applied? 
Yeah. 
I approved, so now we're in business. But you didn't tell me anything. What's up with that? 
You keeping secrets from me now? I just know how much you love surprises so I thought I would let you know... Anyway, what did I apply for? 
That's what I'm here to hash out. Okay. Hash it out, okay. 
It's so hard for me to believe 
that she's someone's aunt. 
Yeah, well, we come in 
all shapes and sizes, you know? Page 29/52
This walnut date loaf is exceptional. - Let me just stop you there. 
- Yeah. 
Is this grant got money 
involved or whatever? No? 
Yeah, it's pretty well funded. 
Yeah? Wow. 
Look who you're talking to. 
- Can I have five minutes with him? - Sure. 
As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad. Whoa, what have we here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army? 
- Uh, the garbage, actually. 
- You're a dumpster diver? 
Yeah, I was... 
Anyway, look, um, I definitely 
did not apply for your grant... 
- Ah-ah! Me first. 
- Okay. 
Quick question of the rhetorical variety. That's you, right? 
Um, no. 
- What do you mean? 
- Yeah. 
Look at you go. 
Wow! Nice catch. 
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. 
That's not easy. You got mad skills. That's all on YouTube, though, right? That's where you found that? 
Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer. 
Mmm-hmm. 
It's like that video. What is it? Yeah. Oh, you mean like 
those UFOs over Phoenix? 
Exactly. 
Oh, what have we here? 
Uh... 
You're the Spider-ling. 
Crime-fighting spider. You're Spider-Boy? Spider-Man. 
Not in that onesie, you're not. 
Page 30/52
It's not a onesie. 
I don't believe this. I was actually having a really good day today, Mr Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there... and Algebra test, nailed it. 
Who else knows? Anybody? 
Nobody. 
Not even your unusually attractive aunt? No. No. 
No! If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out. You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. 
That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that? 
I did. 
Climbing walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves? 
It's a long story. I was... 
Lordy! Can you even see in these? Yes, I can. 
I'm blind! 
I can see in those. 
Okay? 
It's just that when whatever 
happened, happened... 
it's like my senses 
have been dialled to 11. 
There's way too much input, 
so they just kinda help me focus. You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom, 
hundred-point restoration. 
That's why I'm here. 
Why you doing this? 
I gotta know, what's your MO? 
What gets you outta that 
twin bed in the morning? 
Because... 
Because I've been me my whole life, and I've had these powers for six months. Mmm-hmm. 
I read books, I build computers. Page 31/52
Yeah, I would love to play football, but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now. Sure, because you're different. 
Exactly. But I can't tell 
anybody that, so I'm not. 
When you can do the things 
that I can, but you don't... 
and then the bad things happen... they happen because of you. 
So you wanna look out for the little guy, you wanna do your part? 
Make the world 
a better place, all that, right? Yeah, just looking out for the little guy. That's what it is. 
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg. You got a passport? 
No, I don't even have a driver's licence. - You ever been to Germany? 
- No. 
Oh, you'll love it. 
- I can't go to Germany. 
- Why? 
I got homework. 
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that. No, I'm being serious. 
I can't just drop out of school. Might be a little dangerous. 
Better tell Aunt Hottie 
I'm taking you on a field trip. 
Don't tell Aunt May. 
All right, Spider-Man. 
Get me out of this. 
Sorry. I'll get the... 
What is it? 
Stay here, please. 
Guess I shoulda knocked. 
Oh, my God! What are you doing here? Disappointing my kids. 
I'm supposed to go waterskiing. 
Cap needs our help. Come on. 
Clint! 
You should not be here. 
Really? 
Page 32/52
I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit. 
Please consider 
the consequences of your actions. Okay, they're considered. 
Okay, we gotta go. 
It's this way. 
I've caused enough problems. 
You gotta help me, Wanda. 
Look, you wanna mope, 
you can go to high school. 
You wanna make amends, 
you get off your ass. 
Shit. 
I knew I should've stretched. 
Clint, you can't overpower me. 
I know I can't. 
But she can. 
Vision, that's enough. Let him go. I'm leaving. 
I can't let you. 
I'm sorry. 
If you do this... 
they will never stop being afraid of you. I can't control their fear, only my own. Oh... 
Come on. We got one more stop. 
It's just a matter of time. 
Our satellites are running 
facial, biometric, 
and behavioural pattern scans. 
Move or you will be moved. 
As entertaining as that would be... You really think you can find him? My resources are considerable. 
Yeah, it took the world 
70 years to find Barnes... 
so you could probably do that 
in about half the time. 
You know where they are. 
I know someone who does. 
Not sure you understand 
the concept of a getaway car. 
It's low profile. 
Page 33/52
Good, because this stuff 
tends to draw a crowd. 
Can you move your seat up? 
No. 
I owe you again. 
Keeping a list. 
You know, he kinda tried to kill me. Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too. They're going to come looking for you. I know. 
Thank you, Sharon. 
That was... 
Late. 
Damn right. 
I should go. 
Okay. 
Cap. 
You know I wouldn't have called if I had any other choice. 
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour. Besides, I owe a debt. 
Thanks for having my back. 
It was time to get off my ass. How about our other recruit? 
He's rarin' to go. 
Had to put a little coffee in him... but he should be good. 
What time zone is this? 
Come on. Come on. 
- Captain America! 
- Mr Lang. 
It's an honour. 
I'm shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! 
Captain America. 
I know you, too. You're great! Jeez. 
Ah, look, I wanna say, I know 
you know a lot of super people, so... thinks for thanking of me. 
- Hey, man! 
- What's up, Tic Tac? 
Uh, good to see you. 
Look, what happened last time when I... Page 34/52
It was a great audition, 
but it'll never happen again. 
They tell you what we're up against? Something about some psycho-assassins? We're outside the law on this one. So if you come with us, 
you're a wanted man. 
Yeah, well, what else is new? 
We should get moving. 
We got a chopper lined up. 
They're evacuating the airport. Stark. 
Stark? 
Suit up. 
Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. 
- Don't you think that's weird? - Definitely weird. 
Hear me out, Tony. 
That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this. 
Captain. 
Your Highness. 
Anyway... 
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. 
Can you help a brother out? 
You're after the wrong guy. 
Your judgement is askew. 
Your old war buddy killed 
innocent people yesterday. 
And there are five more 
super soldiers just like him. 
I can't let the doctor 
find them first, Tony. I can't. Steve... 
you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna 
punch your way out of this one? All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos! 
- Nice job, kid. 
- Thanks. 
I could have stuck the landing Page 35/52
a little better, it's just... 
New suit. It's nothing, Mr Stark. It's perfect. Thank you. 
Yeah, we don't really need 
to start a conversation. 
Okay. Cap. Captain. 
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man. 
Yeah, we'll talk about it later. 
- Hey, everyone. 
- Good job. 
You've been busy. 
And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint... 
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep... 
I'm trying to keep you from 
tearing the Avengers apart. 
You did that when you signed. 
All right, we're done. 
You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us, now, because it's us... or a squad of J-SOC guys... 
with no compunction about being impolite. Come on. 
We found it. 
Their Quinjet's in 
hangar five, north runway. 
All right, Lang. 
Hey, guys, something... 
Whoa. What the hell was that? 
I believe this is yours, Captain America. Oh, great. 
All right, there's two 
on the parking deck. 
One of them's Maximoff, 
I'm gonna grab her. 
Rhodey, you wanna take Cap? 
Got two in the terminal, 
Wilson and Barnes. 
Barnes is mine. 
Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do? 
What we discussed. 
Keep your distance, web them up. 
Page 36/52
Okay, copy that. 
Move, Captain. 
I won't ask a second time. 
Look, I really don't want to hurt you. I wouldn't stress about it. 
What the hell is that? 
Everyone's got a gimmick now. 
You have a metal arm? 
That is awesome, dude. 
You have the right to remain silent! Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you... but it ain't gonna tickle either. Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings. You locked me in my room. 
Okay, first, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. - Hey, Clint. 
- Hey, man. 
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf? 
Well, I played 18, shot 18. 
Just can't seem to miss. 
First time for everything. 
Made you look. 
Multiple contusions detected. 
Yeah, I detected that, too. 
Oh, God! 
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this! Ahh! 
Those wings carbon fibre? 
Is this stuff coming out of you? That would explain 
the rigidity-flexibility ratio, 
which, gotta say, that's awesome, man. I don't know if you've 
been in a fight before... 
but there's usually not this much talking. All right, sorry. My bad. 
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up, but I've only got one job here today... and I gotta impress Mr Stark, 
so, I'm really sorry. 
You couldn't have done that earlier? I hate you. 
Page 37/52
Great. 
Hey, Cap, heads-up! 
Throw it at this. 
Now! 
Oh, come on! 
Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck. Uh, sorry. 
All right, now I'm pissed. 
Is this part of the plan? 
Well, my plan was go easy on them. You wanna switch it up? 
There's our ride. 
Come on! 
Captain Rogers... 
I know you believe 
what you're doing is right. 
But for the collective good... 
you must surrender now. 
What do we do, Cap? 
We fight. 
This is gonna end well. 
They're not stopping. 
Neither are we. 
We're still friends, right? 
Depends on how hard you hit me. 
You were pulling your punches. 
I didn't kill your father. 
Then why did you run? 
That thing does not obey 
the laws of physics at all. 
Look, kid, there's a lot going on here that you don't understand. 
Mr Stark said you'd say that. Wow. He also said to go for your legs. Ahh! 
Clint, can you get him off me? 
Buckled in? 
Yeah. No, I'm good. 
I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go! 
Stark tell you anything else? 
That you're wrong. You think you're right. That makes you dangerous. 
Guess he had a point. 
You got heart, kid. Where you from? Page 38/52
Queens. 
Brooklyn. 
Friday? 
We have some weapon systems offline. What? 
Oh, you're gonna have to 
take this into the shop. 
Who's speaking? 
It's your conscience. 
We don't talk a lot these days. 
Friday? 
Deploying fire suppression system. Uh-oh. 
Oh, boy! 
Whoa! 
We gotta go. 
That guy's probably in Siberia by now. We gotta draw out the flyers. 
I'll take Vision, you get to the jet. No, you get to the jet! 
Both of you! 
The rest of us aren't getting out of here. As much as I hate to admit it... if we're gonna win this one, 
some of us might have to lose it. This isn't the real fight, Steve. All right, Sam. What's the play? We need a diversion. Something big. I got something kinda big. 
But I can't hold it very long. 
On my signal, run like hell. 
And if I tear myself in half... 
don't come back for me. 
He's gonna tear himself in half? You sure about this, Scott? 
I do it all the time. 
I mean, once. In a lab. 
Then I passed out. 
I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss. Holy shit! 
Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now. I guess that's the signal. 
Way to go, Tic Tac! 
Give me back my Rhodey. 
Page 39/52
I got him. 
Okay, anybody on our side 
hiding any shocking 
and fantastic abilities 
they'd like to disclose... 
I'm open to suggestions. 
You wanna get to them... 
you gotta go through me. 
Uh-huh. 
We haven't met yet. 
- I'm Clint. 
- I don't care. 
Whoa! 
Ahhh! 
Get off! 
Something just flew in me! 
You're not gonna stop. 
You know I can't. 
I'm gonna regret this. 
Go. 
Hey, guys, you ever see 
that really old movie, 
Empire Strikes Back? 
Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy? I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side. 
You know that part 
where they're on the snow planet... with the walking thingies? 
Maybe the kid's onto something. High now, Tony. Go high. 
Yes! 
That was awesome! 
Does anyone have any orange slices? Kid, you all right? 
Whoa! 
Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me. - Hey, man. 
- Yeah. 
- That was scary. 
- Yeah. 
You're done, all right? 
What? I'm good, I'm fine. 
You did a good job. Stay down. Page 40/52
No, it's good. I gotta get him back. You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! - Dude. 
- You're done! 
Wait. 
Mr Stark, wait. I'm not done. I'm not... Okay, I'm done. I'm done. 
I said I'd help you find him, 
not catch him. 
There's a difference. 
I'm sorry. 
Me, too. 
It's as I said. 
Catastrophe. 
Vision, I got a bandit on my six. Vision! You copy? 
Target his thruster, 
turn him into a glider. 
Rhodey! 
Tony, I'm flying dead stick. 
Rhodes! 
Read vitals. 
Heartbeat detected. 
Emergency medical is on its way. I'm sorry. 
- this is room 201... 
Bacon and black coffee again today? You know me so well... 
Hello? Your breakfast is here. 
May I let myself in? 
What's gonna happen to your friends? Whatever it is... 
I'll deal with it. 
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve. What you did all those years... 
It wasn't you. 
You didn't have a choice. 
I know. 
But I did it. 
How did this happen? 
I became distracted. 
I didn't think that was possible. Neither did I. 
The doctors say he shattered 
Page 41/52
L4 through S1. 
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord. Probably looking at 
some form of paralysis. 
Steve's not gonna stop. 
If you don't either, Rhodey's 
gonna be the best case scenario. You let them go, Nat. 
We played this wrong. 
"We"? 
Boy, it must be hard to shake 
the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA. 
Are you incapable 
of letting go of your ego... 
for one goddamn second? 
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so... they're coming for you. 
I'm not the one that needs 
to watch their back. 
What am I looking at, Friday? 
Priority upload from Berlin police. Fire up the chopper. 
The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Doctor Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. 
He was met by this man. 
Did you run facial recognition yet? What do I look like? 
Uh, I don't know. 
I've been picturing a redhead. 
You must be thinking of someone else. Must be. 
The fake doctor is actually 
Colonel Helmut Zemo. 
Sokovian Intelligence. 
Zemo ran Echo Scorpion... 
a Sokovian covert kill squad. 
What happened to the real Broussard? He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found 
a wig and facial prosthesis... 
approximating the appearance 
Page 42/52
of one James Buchanan Barnes. 
Son of a bitch. 
- Get this to Ross. 
- Yes, boss. 
This is Raft Prison Control. 
You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark. So? You got the files? 
Let's reroute the satellites, 
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy. You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not 
in one of these cells. 
The Futurist, gentlemen! 
The Futurist is here! 
He sees all! 
He knows what's best for you, 
whether you like it or not. 
Give me a break, Barton. 
I had no idea 
they'd put you here. Come on. 
Yeah, well, you knew 
they'd put us somewhere, Tony. 
Yeah, but not some 
super-max floating ocean pokey. This place is for maniacs. 
This is a place for... 
Criminals? 
Criminals, Tony. 
Think that's the word you're looking for. Right? 
That didn't used to mean me. 
Or Sam, or Wanda. 
But here we are. 
- Because you broke the law. 
- Yeah. 
I didn't make you. 
- La, la, la, la, la... 
- You read it, you broke it. 
You're all grown up, 
you got a wife and kids. 
I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before 
you chose the wrong side? 
Page 43/52
You gotta watch your back with this guy. There's a chance he's gonna break it. Hank Pym always said 
you never can trust a Stark. 
Who are you? 
Come on, man. 
How's Rhodes? 
They're flying him to 
Columbia Medical tomorrow... 
so fingers crossed. 
What do you need? They feed you yet? You're the good cop, now? 
I'm just the guy who needs 
to know where Steve went. 
Well, you better go get a bad cop... because you're gonna have to 
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass... 
to get information out of me. 
Well, I just knocked 
the A out of their AV. 
We got about 30 seconds before 
they realise it's not their equipment. What'd you do? 
Get it back up! 
Just look. 
Because that... 
is the fellow who was 
supposed to interrogate Barnes. Clearly, I made a mistake. 
Sam, I was wrong. 
That's a first. 
Cap is definitely off the reservation... but he's about to need 
all the help he can get. 
We don't know each other very well. You don't have to... 
Hey, it's all right. 
Look, I'll tell you... 
but you have to go alone and as a friend. Easy. 
Stark? 
Did he give you anything on Rogers? Nope. Told me to go to hell. 
I'm going back to the compound instead, Page 44/52
but you can call me anytime. 
I'll put you on hold. 
I like to watch the line blink. 
You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach 
in the back of that freezer truck? Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs? 
You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead. What was her name, again? 
Dolores. You called her Dot. 
She's gotta be 
a hundred years old right now. 
So are we, pal. 
He can't have been here 
more than a few hours. 
Long enough to wake them up. 
You ready? 
Yeah. 
You seem a little defensive. 
It's been a long day. 
At ease, Soldier. 
I'm not currently after you. 
Then why are you here? 
Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. 
Ross has no idea I'm here. 
I'd like to keep it that way. 
Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself. Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. It's good to see you, Tony. 
You too, Cap. 
Hey, Manchurian Candidate, 
you're killing me. 
There's a truce here. You can drop... I got heat signatures. 
How many? 
Uh, one. 
If it's any comfort, 
they died in their sleep. 
Did you really think I wanted more of you? What the hell? 
I'm grateful to them, though. 
Page 45/52
They brought you here. 
Please, Captain. 
The Soviets built 
this chamber to withstand 
the launch blast of UR-100 rockets. I'm betting I could beat that. Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr Stark. Given time. 
But then you'd never know why you came. You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here? 
I've thought about 
nothing else for over a year. 
I studied you. 
I followed you. 
But now that you're standing here... I just realised... 
there's a bit of green 
in the blue of your eyes. 
How nice to find a flaw. 
You're Sokovian. 
Is that what this is about? 
Sokovia was a failed state 
long before you blew it to hell. No. 
I'm here because I made a promise. You lost someone? 
I lost everyone. 
And so will you. 
An empire toppled 
by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumbles from within? That's dead. 
Forever. 
I know that road. 
What is this? 
Help my wife. 
Please. Help. 
Sergeant Barnes? 
Howard! 
Howard! 
No, Tony. 
Did you know? 
I didn't know it was him. 
Page 46/52
Don't bullshit me, Rogers. Did you know? Yes. 
Get out of here! 
It wasn't him, Tony. 
HYDRA had control of his mind! 
Move! 
It wasn't him! 
Left bootjet failing. 
Flight systems compromised. 
Ah, crap. 
He's not gonna stop. Go. 
Come on, come on. 
Targeting system's knackered, boss. I'm eyeballing it. 
Do you even remember them? 
I remember all of them. 
This isn't gonna change what happened. I don't care. 
He killed my mom. 
You should have seen his little face. Just try, okay? 
I'm going to bed. 
I love you. 
I almost killed the wrong man. 
Hardly an innocent one. 
This is all you wanted? 
To see them rip each other apart. My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. 
He could see the Iron Man 
from the car window. 
I told my wife, "Don't worry. 
"They're fighting in the city. 
We're miles from harm." 
When the dust cleared... 
and the screaming stopped... 
it took me two days 
until I found their bodies. 
My father... 
still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? 
They went home. 
I knew I couldn't kill them. 
Page 47/52
More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them 
to kill each other... 
I'm sorry about your father. 
He seemed a good man. 
With a dutiful son. 
Vengeance has consumed you. 
It's consuming them. 
I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough. 
Tell that to the dead. 
The living are not done with you, yet. You can't beat him hand-to-hand. Analyse his fight pattern. 
Scanning. 
Countermeasures ready. 
Let's kick his ass. 
He's my friend. 
So was I. 
Stay down. Final warning. 
I could do this all day. 
That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it. 
My father made that shield! 
Meals at 8 and 5. 
Toilet privileges twice a day. 
Raise your voice, zap. 
Touch the glass, zap. 
You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line, hmm? 
So how does it feel? 
To spend all that time, all that effort... to see it fail so spectacularly? Did it? 
- It's just the first pass. 
- Yeah. 
Give me some feedback, 
anything you think of. 
Shock absorption, lateral movement. Cup holder? 
You may wanna think about 
some AC down in... 
Ow. 
Let's go. I'll give you a hand. 
Page 48/52
No. Don't help me. 
Ah. 
138 combat missions. 
That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them 
could've been my last, but I flew them. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was 
the right thing to do. 
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh... This is a bad beat. 
But it hasn't changed my mind. 
I don't think. 
- You okay? 
- Oh, yeah. 
Are you Tony Stank? 
Yes, this is Tony Stank. 
You're in the right place. 
Thank you for that! 
Never dropping that, by the way. "Table for one, Mr Stank. 
"Please, by the bathroom." 
Tony... 
I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you 
rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. 
The Avengers are yours. 
Maybe more so than mine. 
I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, 
even in the Army. 
My faith's in people, I guess. 
Individuals. 
And I'm happy to say that, 
for the most part... 
they haven't let me down. 
Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, 
but maybe they shouldn't. 
I know I hurt you, Tony. 
I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents... 
Page 49/52
I was sparing you... 
but I can see now that 
I was really sparing myself. 
And I'm sorry. 
Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords. I really do. 
I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should. 
Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison. Yeah, put him through. 
Tony, we have a problem. 
- Uh, please hold. 
- No, don't. 
So no matter what... 
I promise you... 
if you need us... 
if you need me... 
I'll be there. 
You sure about this? 
I can't trust my own mind. 
So, until they figure out 
how to get this stuff out of my head... I think going back under 
is the best thing. 
For everybody. 
Thank you for this. 
Your friend and my father... 
they were both victims. 
If I can help one of them find peace... You know, if they find out he's here... they'll come for him. 
Let them try. 
Hey, shady baby 
I'm hot like the prodigal son

What's "some guy's" name? 
Uh, Steve. 
Steve? From 12-C? 
- With the overbite? 
- No, no, no. 
You don't know him. He's from Brooklyn. Ouch. 
Well... 
I hope you got a few good licks in. Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge. 
That's way better. Thank you. 
Okay, tough guy. 
Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door? Page 52/52

OVER BLACK. Low volume, through a tinny speaker, JUICENEWTON’S ‘ANGEL OF THE MORNING.’ 
FADE UP ON: 
1 EXT./INT. TAXI CAB - MORNING 1 
DEADPOOL, in full DRESS REDS and MASK, quietly FIDGETS in theBACK SEAT of a TAXI CAB as it proceeds along a CITY FREEWAY. 
Deadpool adjusts the two KATANAS strapped to his back. Rolls  the WINDOWS up, down, up. Tries futilely to untwist theseatbelt, then LUNGES forward, locking it up. Rifles througha tourist booklet and tears out a HAUNTED SEGWAY TOUR coupon. 
The CABBIE, young, thin, brown, glances back and forth fromthe rear view to the road to the rear view. 
DEADPOOL : 
Kinda lonesome back here. 
CUT TO: 
back seat and front. His two katanas don’t  
cooperate, catching on the Plexiglas, stalling him mid-torso. DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Little help? 
The cabbie grabs Deadpool’s hand and pulls him through to thefront. Deadpool’s head rests upside down on the bench seatas he maneuvers his legs through. The cabbie turns the  
helping hand into a HANDSHAKE, then turns down the Juice. 
CABBIE : 
Dopinder. 
DEADPOOL : 
(still upside-down) 
Pool. Deadpool. 
Dopinder is remarkably UNAFFECTED by the lunatic in his cab. 
DOPINDER : 
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool? 
DEADPOOL: 
It’s like Christmas Day, Dopinder. Been 
waiting one thousand eight hundred twenty 
two days, three hours... 
(checks ‘Adventure Time’watch) 
...and thirty-six minutes for this shit. 
Page 2/119

 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 2. 
1 CONTINUED: 
DEADPOOL turns himself RIGHT-SIDE-UP in the front seat. He  is YOKED to the gills and ARMED to the teeth. TWIN KATANAS.  TWIN DESERT EAGLE .50 CALIBER PISTOLS. 
Deadpool grabs Dopinder’s OPEN BAG of CORN NUTS. Dopinderisn’t quick enough to stop him. Deadpool gazes out thewindow onto the city - a teeming, sooty urban sprawl thatlooks almost... pre-post-apocalyptic. 
Deadpool turns up his MASK. Dopinder catches a GLIMPSE ofthe bottom of a SCARRED face. And quickly looks AWAY. 
Deadpool eats the CORN NUTS. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Points. 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Nice. 
Dopinder eyes his DAFFODIL DAYDREAM AIR FRESHENER and takes adeep breath through his nose. 
DOPINDER : 
Smells good, no? 
DEADPOOL : 
Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl. 
A PICTURE of a young INDIAN WOMAN is taped to the dash. 
DOPINDER : 
Ah yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She  
was supposed to make me a very agreeablewife. Mom and Dad chose her rather  excellently. But Gita’s heart has been  
stolen by my cousin Bandhu. Bandhu is as  
dishonorable as he is attractive. 
DEADPOOL : 
Dopinder, I’m starting to think I’m inthis cab for a reason. 
DOPINDER : 
Because you hailed it? 
DEADPOOL : 
No, my slender brown friend... to giveyou one crucial piece of advice: Love...  
is a beautiful thing. When it finds you, 
the whole world smells like Daffodil  
Daydream. 
Page 3/119
Deadpool’s own heartbreak is palpable. He takes another  
deep, cleansing BREATH. 
(CONTINUED) 
 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 3. 
1 CONTINUED: 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
So hold onto love tight. Go at Bandhu  
hard. Get Gita back. Or else... the  
whole world will taste like Mama June  
after hot yoga. 
DOPINDER : 
And how does Ms. Mama June taste? 
DEADPOOL : 
Like two hobos making love under adrizzle of Limburger- I could go all daylike this. Point is, bad. 
Deadpool chucks the bag of Corn Nuts into the back seat and  pulls out his PISTOLS. He starts CHAMBERING shells into two  magazines. 
Suddenly, he frantically pats himself down, like a Hollywoodagent who can’t find his phone. 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Shiiiit. My extra mags! I usually leavethem right by the door so I’ll trip overthem! Someone must’ve moved them... 
2 INT. DEADPOOL’S LAIR - DAY 2 
A blind late-70’s AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in a purple floraldress enters the front door, falls as she trips over an ‘I*HEART* HELLO KITTY’ DUFFEL BAG of AMMUNITION, PICKS it UP,  
and CARRIES it OFF. 
3 INT./EXT. TAXI CAB - MORNING 3 
DOPINDER : 
Shall we turn back? 
DEADPOOL : 
No time. Not today. 
(slides in last bullets) 
Ten, eleven, twelve... or bust.  
(chambers a shell into eachgun, looks up) 
Right here! 
The cab SCREECHES to a stop on the shoulder of the highest  FREEWAY in a massive INTERCHANGE of freeways. Dopinder haltsthe meter and 
Page 4/119
hands Deadpool his CARD. 
DOPINDER : 
My card. That’s $27.50. 
(CONTINUED) 
 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 4. 
3 CONTINUED: 
DEADPOOL: 
Oooo. I never carry a wallet when I'm 
working. Ruins the lines of my suit. 
How 'bout a crisp high five? 
Dopinder stares as he and Deadpool slap skin. Deadpool GETSOUT of the cab. 
DOPINDER : 
Be sure to... ask for me again? 
DEADPOOL: 
I owe you one. Merry Christmas, 
Dopinder. 
DOPINDER: 
And a convivial... Tuesday in April to 
you, Pool... Guy. 
Deadpool closes the door with a flourish. Boom. 
4 EXT./INT. ‘THE RAFT’ PRISON - MORNING 4 
A bone-white ISLAND PRISON, affectionately nicknamed ‘TheRaft,’ looms ominously in a CITY HARBOR. 
Etched in helvetica into the prison wall: ‘No punishment hasever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent thecommission of crimes.’ - Hannah Arendt. Below it, GRAFFITIED  
in RED SPRAY PAINT: ‘Until NOW’ 
The prison’s FRONT DOORS OPEN, and out steps a handcuffedPRISONER, 30’s, ORANGE JUMPSUIT, broad shoulders, whip-smart, 
tightly coiled, with cool, dead-blue eyes. BURLY GUARDS  guide him across a CAUSEWAY toward a CONVOY of Escalades andDucatis on shore. 
The middle Escalade’s door opens. The prisoner stops. The  guards unlock his CUFFS. 
GUARD : 
You’re someone else’s problem now. 
The ex-prisoner STRETCHES his arms and strides TOWARD the  Page 5/119
convoy. 
PRISONER : 
Yes. I. Am. 
CUE SALT & PEPA’S ‘SHOOP:’ 
 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 5. 
5 EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY 5 
DEADPOOL sits on the edge of the highest freeway on theoverpass, legs dangling over the side like Huck Finn. 
DEADPOOL: 
Can I get some fries with that shake 
shake boobie? If looks could kill you 
would be an uzi. 
Deadpool is using some broken CRAYONS to draw something on ascrap of paper. REVERSE ANGLE to REVEAL a childish drawingof Deadpool SHOOTING another man in the head, brains blowing  
out. 
The victim’s thought bubble reads: ‘OUCHIE!!!’ Even throughthe mask, Deadpool looks pleased by this. 
He turns to CAMERA: 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Oh, hello, Deadpool here. You may be 
wondering whose balls I had to fondle to 
get my own movie. Rhymes with 
‘Polverine.’ Couple’a smooth criminals. 
(ALT: 
In a word, gorgeous. 
(ALT: 
Surprisingly little hair down there. 
(ALT: 
It’s a jungle down there. 
(ALT: 
Thick underbrush. 
(beat) 
Anyway, I smell Oscar. The suit’s gonna 
match the carpet. Now... places to be... 
faces to fix... bad guys to kill... 
ANGLE ON a distant BIRD’S EYE VIEW of the freewayinterchange: an interwoven tangle of ramps.

6 EXT. REMOTE AIRFIELD - MORNING 6 
AJAX, 30’s, dead-blue eyes, broad shoulders, whip-smart, tightly coiled stands at ease on a cracked and blistered  tarmac. Behind him, a HEAVILY ARMED CONVOY OF DUCATIS and  ESCALADES. FOUR LARGE ALUMINUM CARGO CRATES sit beside him. Ajax squints into the sun as A BELL HELICOPTER thrashes the  air above him, kicking up dust as it lands.

A SERBIAN WARLORD, mid-50’s, sharply dressed, armoredBRIEFCASE in hand, climbs out. He is surrounded by ARMEDGUARDS. 
The Warlord places the BRIEFCASE on the FOREMOST CRATE. Ajaxpops the case... to find STACKS upon STACKS of THOUSANDDOLLAR BILLS. Satisfied, he closes the briefcase and hands  
it to one of his men. 
AJAX : 
(bangs crate) 
They won’t disappoint. 
WARLORD : 
They’d better not. And next month’s  
shipment? 
AJAX : 
There won’t be one. Demand is high. You  
aren’t the only one with a war to win. 
WARLORD : 
(steps forward) 
That won’t do. 
Both sets of armed thugs shift to ready positions. 
Ajax smiles calmly, but his free hand DARTS OUT and CASUALLYLIFTS the warlord into the air by the THROAT. Fingers findtriggers on both sides. 
AJAX : 
There’s been a small... disruption in oursupply chain. We’ll deliver in full the  
following month. Say, ten percent offfor the inconvenience? The Warlord manages to nod in acquiescence. Ajax smilesagain, lowers him gasping to the ground. 
AJAX (CONT’D) 
Page 7/119
We appreciate your business. 
Ajax spins and walks purposefully toward the line of waitingSUV’s. The warlord angrily motions for his men to begin loading thecrates into the helicopter, which they do. 
WARLORD :

Fucking mutant.

Behind him the convoy of SUV’s and motorcycles pull out, 
falling into line as they accelerate past the rows ofderelict aircraft. 7 EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY 7 
DEADPOOL watches as the convoy approaches. He CASUALLY getsup as if standing up out of an easy chair... 
DEADPOOL: 
On your mark, get set, go, let me go, let 
me shoop... 
He PIROUETTES, and DROPS an entire level DOWN... 
8 INT. ESCALADE - MORNING 8 
THROUGH the SUNROOF of an ESCALADE. SMASH! 
There are FOUR HUGE BAD-ASSES inside the S.U.V., two in  
front, two behind. Deadpool lands back-middle in a HAILSTORMof GLASS. He stuns the men to both sides with elbows to the  
face as he raises his arms in greeting. 
DEADPOOL : 
¡Hola! ¡Me llamo Piscina De La Muerte! 
(subtitled, in YELLOW:) 
Hello! My name is the Pool of Death. 
There’s no easy way to say this. I’m 
pregnant, Trevor. 
(ALT: 
Any of you seen Green Lantern? Me 
neither. 
BOOM! MAYHEM ERUPTS as the two men in back find themselves  sharing a phone booth with the TASMANIAN DEVIL: ELBOWS.  
FOREARMS. KNEES. CRACKING. CRUNCHING. SCREAMING. 
From BEHIND, the Escalade BUCKS and BOUNCES down the road on  its suspension, almost CARTOON-LIKE. 
Page 8/119
A brutal punch spins Deadpool UPSIDE-DOWN, and he rolls withit, uses his FEET to BREAK the man’s NECK. The other man  
stomps on his head, then drags him up and SMUSHES Deadpool’sface into the seat’s premium trim. 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Rich... Corinthian... Leather. 
Deadpool HURLS the man through THROUGH the TAILGATE WINDOW. The man clutches the TAILGATE, DRAGGED behind the S.U.V.  Deadpool sticks his head between the two guys in FRONT.

The DRIVER SLAMS Deadpool’s head into the console repeatedly. DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. 
Deadpool squirms away and WRESTLES VIOLENTLY with the guy inthe PASSENGER SEAT. 
He GRABS the PASSENGER SEAT-BELT, TIES it around the guy’sANKLE, and KICKS him out the PASSENGER SIDE DOOR. The guy’sHEAD and SHOULDERS SMACK pavement, where he’s DRAGGEDmercilessly by his ANKLE - a modern COWBOY whose boot justgot stuck in his horse’s STIRRUP. 
Deadpool grabs the driver by the HAIR on the BACK of his HEADand BANGS his FOREHEAD into: 
The horn. HONK. HONK. The stereo. Every time the driver’sforehead SMACKS the face of the stereo, the RADIO STATION  
CHANGES: 
MARIACHI. DR. DREW. MONSTER TRUCK COMMERCIAL (’SUNDAY, 
SUNDAY, SUNDAY!’). One more SMACK to get us back toMARIACHI. Deadpool looks in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to see the man in backCRAWL up the tailgate. 
Deadpool PUSHES in the Cadillac’s CIGARETTE LIGHTER. 
Back to the DRIVER. Deadpool BASHES his face into theDRIVER’s SIDE WINDOW. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. 
We’re now OUTSIDE the Escalade, seeing the driver’sexpression take on a ridiculous silly-putty-esque grimace ofpain every time it’s MUSHED into the glass. 
The man in back scrambles forward. The CIGARETTE LIGHTER  POPS OUT. Deadpool YANKS the EMERGENCY BRAKE. The man in  back LAUNCHES forward and SMACKS the DASHBOARD. 
Deadpool STABS the now ORANGE-HOT lighter into the man’sforehead, burning Page 9/119
the COIL PATTERN into his skin. The man

The man hollers in muffled agony. A MOTORCYCLE has pulledAHEAD of the ESCALADE and now sits, STOPPED, in its path. 
The helmeted RIDER OPENS FIRE with a SUB-MACHINE GUN. 
Deadpool has one hand grasped on the back of the driver’sneck, still mashing his face into the window glass, and theOTHER hand still clamped over the second man’s mouth. He  
plants both FEET on the steering wheel and ‘drives,’ spinningthe wheel, sending the S.U.V. into... 
...a ROLL. The Escalade goes ENDO, SOMERSAULTING WILDLY. 
Suddenly, the ACTION BEGINS TO SLOW... 
The motorcycle RIDER tries to bail out. NO LUCK. The  
tumbling Escalade PLOWS RIGHT INTO him AND his bike. 
Parts scatter off the motorcycle, including its CHAIN. The  RIDER continues to SQUEEZE off ROUNDS as he goes FLYING. 
Inside the Escalade, Deadpool goes SPIN-CYCLE. The DRIVER  flies through the sunroof, tearing out its remaining glass. BLOOD spatters. The other man spits out the glowingCIGARETTE LIGHTER. The guy whose ankle is still tangled inthe seat-belt FLAILS through the air like a rag-doll, AHABtied to MOBY DICK. 
The action CONTINUES to SLOW... until it FREEZES. 
The camera swoops in to Deadpool’s face, upside down. 
HE TURNS HIS HEAD TO CAMERA FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREAKING THE  FOURTH WALL, THE ONLY THING IN THE SCENE THAT’S MOVING: 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Shit. Did I leave the stove on? 
We RAMP back UP to FULL SPEED. The S.U.V. CARTWHEELS. The  guy’s ankle untangles from the seat-belt. He FLIES hightoward a big HIGHWAY EXIT SIGN and... SPLAT... out of frame. 
The RIDER’s NECK is SLICED by the flying MOTORCYCLE CHAIN. The DRIVER is half-way out the SUNROOF when the S.U.V. rollsover him. SQUISH. 
The man who ate the CIGARETTE LIGHTER now eats pavement.

With an audible CRACK, the pencil in Colossus’ thick fingers  snaps. He rises, muttering Russian curses and stalks fromthe kitchen. VC8 INT. HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER VC8 
Massive STEEL BLAST DOORS emblazoned with a huge “X” slideopen to reveal COLOSSUS. He walks quickly and purposefullytowards a big plane in the center of the huge space: the

A BUNCH of MEN PILE OUT, each one carrying a BEASTLY GUN andPOINTING it STRAIGHT at the disabled S.U.V. 
The last noise is made by one final dislodged HUBCAP, whichrattles in little circles until it lies FLAT on the freeway. 
TWO SILENT BEATS. Then we hear the soft, ELECTRIC BUZZ of  the Escalade’s middle passenger window ROLLING DOWN. Up popsthe HEAD of DEADPOOL, like the GOPHER in Caddyshack. 
BANG BANG BANG BANG. 
DEADPOOL : 
Wait, wait... 
The head drops, the hands come up. BANG.

Wait! You’re probably wondering. Why the

the brown pants. 
(to camera) 
All together now... 
The THUGS immediately OPEN FIRE. 
Deadpool is already leaping upward, flipping backwards, bullets tearing the air beneath him as he pulls out those TWOMASSIVE .50 CAL PISTOLS... and in slo-mo, RETURNS FIRE.

Deadpool keeps count of every bullet he fires:

A SHELL-CASING is EJECTED. We enter EXTREME SLO-MO and SWOOP  IN on the shell as it TUMBLES through the air... 
...revealing the number ‘00012’ ETCHED in a semi-circle onits butt end. Deadpool FIRES the second pistol. We move  
instantly to the second shell: ‘00011’

FULL SPEED. The first TWO THUGS get a MOUTHFUL of BULLET. DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Ten... 
ANOTHER SHOT. A THUG takes one in the HEART. The other  
thugs POUR LEAD into the disabled S.U.V. 
Deadpool LEAPS UP and OUT of the window, rising ABOVE theincoming shots, then LANDING SAFELY BEHIND the Escalade. 
Deadpool TURNS to SPY a MOTORCYCLE RIDER BEARING DOWN ON HIM. This rider wears a distinctive SILVER HELMET. 
Deadpool raises BOTH pistols. This RIDER LEANS away, dodgingeach slug. First left, then right, then left. 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Nine. Shit! Eight. Fuck! Seven. Shit 
fuck! 
The bike WHIZZES PAST safely, firing bullets, DEADPOOLfollows, leaping high, flipping over the S.U.V. 
He lands smoothly the other side, right BEHIND a thug who’slooking in the other direction as he sneaks around the car. 
Deadpool SHRUGS and SHOOTS him in the BACK of the HEAD atPOINT BLANK RANGE. DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Six. 
The shell tumbles to the ground, falls still. ‘00006’ 
Deadpool opens the Escalade. His target is NOT THERE. 
BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. Deadpool is nearly BROUGHT DOWN bya particularly big thug with a particularly big AK-47. 
He dives behind another Escalade, takes a moment to search  the interior through the windows... and then flinches as AK47  bullets pass THROUGH the skin of the S.U.V. around him.

One of the bullets lands in DEADPOOL’S BICEP. Deadpoolyelps, in pain... then stuffs some of his torn red suitfabric into the hole to staunch the bleeding. 
Then he scrambles AROUND the S.U.V., trying to close thedistance to this guy through a WITHERING BARRAGE of fire. 
Another of the AK’s slugs SLICES a swath out of the mask onDeadpool’s head, SINGING his hair. 
DEADPOOL.  
Fuck. You. 
Deadpool lands in FRONT of the thug. The thug pulls histrigger again, only to - CLICK - realize he’s OUT of BULLETS. 
DEADPOOL : 
Someone’s not counting. Cinco. 
The bullet HITS the thug in the throat. ‘00005’ 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Me gusta cinco. 
Deadpool STRIDES past the fallen thug, pawing at his singedhair - ow - and then out of sheer, pumped-up ANGER... 
...turns and PUMPS TWO MORE SUPERFLUOUS BULLETS into him. DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Four. Three. Stupid. Worth it. 
The SILVER-HELMETED MOTORCYCLE RIDER makes another pass, 
FIRING. Deadpool ducks behind the S.U.V. again. 
20 yards away, a GROUP of thugs TAKE COVER behind the final S.U.V. One pulls out a HAND-GRENADE, RAISES HIS ARM tothrow.  DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
(chuckles) 
Number two... 
Deadpool FIRES, SHOOTING the GRENADE in the thug’s FIST. 
BOOM! The whole CLUSTER of THUGS drops. 
Deadpool emerges from behind the S.U.V., feeling victorious. He approaches the final S.U.V. and throws open the doors to  search, expecting to find his target at last. 
Inside is a rumpled orange prison coverall, but NOT the  
PRISONER. Deadpool gets childishly angry.

Worse, CLICK-CLACK. The distinctive COCKING of SHOTGUNS.  3 final THUGS stand on the freeway, lined up perpendicular to Deadpool, SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER, FIRING BENELLI COMBATSHOTGUNS. BAM! BAM! BAM!  
Deadpool ducks behind the S.U.V. and raises a PISTOL. We ZOOM IN through the CHAMBER to spy the last BULLET, POISED infront of the FIRING PIN: 
‘00001’  
Deadpool thinks, then LEAPS from behind the ‘SCLADE, TWISTSforward and right. 
All 3 THUGS FIRE again. BUCKSHOT rips into DEADPOOL’s BACK.  But he LANDS so that all 3 men are now parallel to him...  ...in A SINGLE-FILE LINE. 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
One.  
BOOM! We’re with the FINAL BULLET as it HURTLES from the gunand passes THROUGH the first man’s head... then the SECOND  
man’s head... and SMACKS the third man in the forehead. This third man, the BIGGEST THUG YET, HITS the DECK.  
Deadpool puts his mouth to his pistol barrel, INHALES... andthen EXHALES smoke through the pores of his mask.  
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
I’m touching myself tonight.  
But then, as if by magic, the third thug STIRS... and STANDS.  The SLUG has LODGED partway in his FOREHEAD, having lost just enough momentum that it didn’t make it all the way through.  The thug sneers, plucks out the slug, wipes away some blood, and rolls up his SLEEVES.  
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?  
Deadpool reaches back. We hear the THRILLING SOUND...

DEADPOOL (V.O.) 
I know what you’re thinking... 
The action SLOWS again to a FREEZE. Deadpool is in mid slice, muscles bulging.

WADE (CONT’D) 
Sweet and salty. 
MERCHANT :

Without even turning toward Merchant, Wade PULLS OUT A .50CALIBER DESERT EAGLE PISTOL and nonchalantly AIMS it at him. 
Merchant and Jeremy both go pale. 
WADE :

Burnt crust? 
JEREMY :

MERCHANT:

This is about the poker game, right? I  
told Howie... Listen, take whatever youwant! 
Merchant fumbles with his wallet and starts to hand Wade the  bills inside. Wade takes the ENTIRE WALLET instead.

Jeremy, that’s a no go on the tiperoo. 
I’m not here for him.

I’m here for you. 
Jeremy’s eyes widen. Wade holds up a YELLOW CARD, featuringan embedded SIM. Below the logo of a CYPRESS TREE is thename of Wade’s intended target: ‘GARRETT, JEREMY.’ 
Merchant breathes a sigh of relief. 
MERCHANT : 
Dodged a big time bullet on that o 
Wade PISTOL-PUNCHES/POKES Merchant in the forehead. Merchant  howls. 
WADE:

And the Axe body spray.

That’s unfortunately me. 
WADE :

Anyhoo, you by chance know a MeghanOrlovsky? Getting that right? Orlovsky? Orloskvy? Do you? 
Jeremy manages a timid little NOD. 
WADE (CONT’D) 
Good. ‘Cause she knows you. 
Wade holsters the pistol and WHIPS out a HUNTING KNIFE. He  twirls it adeptly... but instead of holding it to Jeremy’sneck... CUTS himself a SLICE of PIZZA. 
WADE (CONT’D) 
What situation isn’t improved by pizza? 
Wade shovels half the slice into his mouth, revealing an ArmySPECIAL FORCES TATTOO on his forearm: A SKULL WEARING A  
GREEN BERET, BACKED BY A BLADE, AND THE WORDS ‘DE OPPRESSO  LIBER’ (official motto of the U.S. Army Special Forces). 
WADE (CONT’D) 
(through chews) 
Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys who  
take a dime to beat a fella down. 
(cuts another pizza slice) 
Little Meghan’s not made of money, butlucky her, I’ve got a soft spot. Wade brings the next pizza slice over to Merchant. Wade  
nearly hands it to him but lets go too soon. The slice falls  flat - pineapple down - onto the floor at Merchant’s feet. 
JEREMY : 
B-but I’m 
WADE: 
(returns to Jeremy) 
A stalker. Threats hurt, Jer. Thoughnot nearly as bad as serrated steel. Wade pokes the end of his knife into Jeremy’s chest, pinninghim against the

WADE : 
Then we’re done. 
JEREMY : 
W-we are? 
WADE: 
Soft spot, remember? But even look in 
her general direction again? You’ll 
learn in the worst of ways.

I’ve got some hard spots too.

That came out wrong. Or did it? 
11 EXT. SKATE PARK - NIGHT - PAST 11 
SKATE PUNKS carve on ramps built into the sides of a highwayunderpass. A group of TEEN GIRLS are perched at the bottomof the nearby stairs, texting each other from inches away. 
An old-fashioned GHETTO BLASTER bangs ‘SHOOP.’ 
SALT & PEPA  
I love you in your big jeans. 
GIRLS :

How ‘bout Vice Principal Renwiki?

Suspended me for smoking. 
WADE:

Good for him! Sorry, ladies. Me no digcigs. And I may look mean. But if I  give a guy a pavement facial? He earned  
it. 
Wade gives Meghan a smile, turns to leave. 
MEGHAN : 
Hey. Thanks. You’re my hero. 
The word catches Wade like a punch to the gut. Hero?

Heya, Wade! 
We hear a STAB and a SCREAM. 
Wade winces as he continues on to the BAR, claims a STOOL and  waves over the lone bartender - WEASEL, early 20’s, geeky, glasses. Think Tom Cruise in ‘Cocktail.’ Then think the  
opposite. 
WEASEL : 
Wade Wilson, Patron Saint of the Pitiful.  
What can I get you? 
WADE : 
I’d love a blow-job. 
WEASEL : 
We got that in common. 
WADE : 
The drink, moose-knuckle. But first... 
Wade digs in a pocket, slaps the YELLOW ‘HIT’ CARD, the onewith the CYPRESS TREE, on the bar. 
Weasel goes to the register. Scans the card. Peels off  
three ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. Lays them out like a bankteller. Wade PUSHES the MONEY AWAY... 
WADE (CONT’D) 
I ain’t taking allowance money. Make  
sure it gets back to Ms. Osflorsky?

Weasel puts the finishing touches on the drink, pushes itacross the bar to Wade. 
WEASEL : 
Kahlua, Bailey’s, whip cream. Fellatio  
in a glass. 
A burst of laughter turns Wade’s attention to BUCK, a BAD-ASSin a snakeskin jacket, has a crowd gathered round him, mid 
story. He too is holding a YELLOW CARD with SIM and CYPRESSTREE. 
BUCK : 
So he’s staring at my Glock in his mouth, 
like...

‘I thought you guys had a code!’ And I’m

Wade pulls out Gavin Merchant’s wallet and teases out aTWENTY. He grabs a passing waitress, tucks the bill in hershirt pocket and sets the blowjob on her tray. 
WADE : 
Kelly, you mind taking this over to Buck? 
Tell him it’s from Boothe.

WADE:

It's a dirty job... but someone's gotta 
take out the garbage. 
Wade finally turns around to watch. BUCK finishes off  
Boothe... then pours the BLOW-JOB on top of him. 
WEASEL grabs a hand mirror, hops over the bar, and crosses toBoothe. All the PATRONS fall HUSH as WEASEL holds the mirror  
to Boothe’s mouth. Boothe’s BREATH FOGS it up. 
WEASEL : 
Still kicking. 
The place ‘oooooohs.’ Near miss. Weasel returns to his  
place behind the bar, looking disappointed.

WEASEL : 
Wait, who did you pick? 
Weasel looks up a the board, where ‘WADE’ has claimed: 
‘BIEBER, J.’ 
WADE :

Nothing bad ever happens to teen starswho make 80 mil a year and think they’reimmune to the pitfalls of addiction and

Holy fucking shit. 
It’s the nickel-silver-plated Voltron RING, all three hundred  thousand tickets worth.

WADE (O.S.) 
This is my most prized possession. 
Wade looks like he’s reaching into the drawer for the actionfigure, but instead, reaches just UNDER it to grasp Wham!’s‘Make it Big’ album on Vinyl. He pulls out the album. 
VANESSA : 
Wham? 
WADE :

Wade pulls out the action figure.

A sickly-looking WADE is on the final stop in his futile  quest to find a cure. DESPERATE. Among the MOST DESPERATE. He sits in a pathetic muzak-filled WAITING ROOM. Wearing aSOMBRERO and clutching VANESSA’s hand. Her fingers areinterlaced in his, once perfectly manicured nails chewed tothe quick. 
Vanessa is also wearing a SOMBRERO, and ANXIETY on her face. Wade COUGHS SEVERELY, REPEATEDLY into a HANDKERCHIEF.

Abe drops his WORRY BEADS. Wade bends to retrieve them, then  stands with effort and gently hands them to Abe. 
WADE : 
Good luck to you, Pops. 
Wade sits back down, and his eyes find the LITTLE BOY: his  SUNKEN EYES. His MISSING HAIR. His LOLLIPOP, CLUTCHED like  the richest treasure. 
Wade turns to look at Vanessa, who’s also staring at the boy. Even though Vanessa is healthy, she, too, looks sick. No  makeup. Dirty hair. Dark circles under her eyes. When she  looks at Wade, it’s clear she, not he, most needs comfort. Wade pulls Vanessa close and strokes her hair with atrembling hand. Abe disappears. Wade watches with a newlydark look of suspicion.  Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 46.

smearing the CHICKEN BLOOD across Abe’s flesh. 
DOCTOR :

De que se cure! Señor Abe, you arecured. 
The doctor holds SMELLING SALTS under Abe’s nose. His closed  eyes jerk open to see the doctor’s gloved hand CLUTCHING ahuge, bloody ‘TUMOR.’ 
Abe pushes himself up, peers down at his bloody abdomen with  awe. The doctor wipes the blood away and helps him up. 
ABE :

Thank you. I owe you my life. 
As Abe shuffles out, the doctor turns away to dump the‘tumor’ in the trash and wash his bloody hands in a basin.

...and uses it to SLIDE something out from underneath thetable: a BUCKET of BLOODY CHICKEN GIZZARDS that double as  
removed ‘tumors.’ Wade’s RAGE seems to grow by the INSTANT. 
WADE : 
Long enough... 
Delgado senses he is suddenly in danger, picks up a rustySCALPEL from his tray. Wade moves toward him. DelgadoLUNGES, He STABS WADE in the shoulder, then RUNS. 
Wade TACKLES him. In Wade’s weakened state, the fightbecomes an intense STRUGGLE. The two FALL and WRESTLE. The  
BUCKET of GIZZARDS overturns. They roll around in slop.

At last, WADE’s fury has overcome his physical weakness. He  straddles the DOCTOR’s CHEST. His expression is that of aman who’s LOSING his SHIT. 
Wade RAISES THE SCALPEL, SLASHES at the doctor’s throat, then  STABS him in the heart. The doctor writhes, spasms, gurgles, and falls still. 
Chest heaving, Wade raises his head to see... at the FAR ENDof the HALL: VANESSA - frozen, TERRIFIED. A blood-soaked Wade locks eyeswith her and swims back up into SANITY... ‘What have I done?’ 
This is a horrific glimpse into Wade’s murderous past... 
...and the look on Vanessa’s face is one of HORROR and PAIN. (CONTINUED)

27 CONTINUED: 
Awash in shame, Wade staggers to his feet, slips on chickenblood, and LUNGES in the other direction. He hits the door  
at the end of the hall at a RUN. 
28 STAB! 28 
The sword, covered in BLOOD, penetrates the crayon drawing ofthe recruiter on DEADPOOL’s CORKBOARD. 
DEADPOOL : 
Thank you, Agent Smith. 
Deadpool lasers in on AJAX’s picture at the top of thepyramid. 29 EXT. GUADALAJARA STREET - SUNSET - PAST 29 
WADE leans against a wall, gasping for breath. He looks back  toward her voice, face a mask of pain. Instead of seekingher... he melts into the busy street. 
30 EXT. DEADPOOL’S LAIR - DAY 30 
DEADPOOL trudges to his FRONT DOOR. He speaks to theAUDIENCE: 
DEADPOOL: 
Some kind of anger can’t be managed. 
Like the kind where your year-long plan 
ends with the wrong guy getting 
dismembered! That said... when it comes 
Page 50/119
time to licking wounds... there’s no 
place like home, and I share that home 
with someone you met, the old blind lady 
from the laundromat, Al. She’s like 
Robin to my Batman. Except she’s old. 
And black. And blind. 
POPS INSIDE: 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) 
And I think she loves me. Wait... pretty 
sure Robin loves Batman, too. 
31 INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT - PAST 31 
WADE, ghastly, nearing death, lies BACK onto a STRETCHER, covered only by a FLIMSY HOSPITAL GOWN. He’s being wheeleddown a dim corridor by two tough-looking ORDERLIES. 
In one hand, he holds the recruiter’s crumpled BUSINESS CARD. In the other, he clutches the limited edition VOLTRON RING,  as tight as his shaky hand allows. 
(CONTINUED) 
 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 49. 
31 CONTINUED: 
They turn a corner and push through a pair of double doorsinto a cavernous room. Wade looks around, full of hope for anew life. Immediately, every single thing he sees/hearsbegins to erode his confidence. The RECRUITER stands justinside the doors, smiling. 
RECRUITER (O.S.) 
Mr. Wilson! Nothing warms my heart like 
a change of someone else’s. 
Walking into Wade’s P.O.V. is the creepy RECRUITER. He beams  down on Wade. 
RECRUITER (CONT’D) 
You finally hit ‘fuck-it.’ 
WADE: 
Worse. Just promise you’ll do right by 
me. So I can do right by someone else. 
RECRUITER : 
Of course. 
WADE: 
Oh, and please don't make my super suit 
green. Or animated. 
Page 51/119
RECRUITER : 
I hope you enjoy your stay. 
The ‘Workshop,’ as this old warehouse is affectionatelycalled, has been converted into a working LABORATORY. 
Wade is wheeled through a vast room containing rows ofindividual ‘tents,’ each containing a SUBJECT. Wade’s eyesDART to helpless SILHOUETTES. We hear WHISPERS, WHIMPERS, MOANS. 
A FELLOW PATIENT, a pathetic, terrified little man namedCUNNINGHAM, is wheeled past Wade, restrained on anotherSTRETCHER. Cunningham briefly locks eyes with Wade, but  
quickly moves on by. 
Wade can’t help but be alarmed by the TERROR in Cunningham’s  eyes. 
The tents are illuminated by BLINDING overhead lights. Wade  spies GRUESOMELY INTIMIDATING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. 
Wade is wheeled into the tent that’s his new home. The  
FIGURE who was pushing Wade DUMPS him onto a CHROME OPERATINGTABLE and roughly STRAPS him down. 
(CONTINUED) 
 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 50. 
31 CONTINUED: 
WADE : 
Um. My first request? A warmer table.  
(shivers) 
And warmer hands. 
Wade DOUBLE-TAKES at the sight of the figure above him: 
ANGEL DUST - thirties, female, tall, sexy, athletic - anAmazonian warrior in another age. 
Angel Dust wheels over a high-tech I.V. DRIP, complete withglass cylindrical tanks housing a glowing, viscous LIQUID. 
Then she roughly straps Wade’s NECK to the table. Wade  
nearly GASPS, the color now officially drained from his face. WADE (CONT’D) 
Easy! Aren’t you a little strong for alady? I’m calling wang. 
ANGEL DUST : 
You’d like that, huh. Welcome to our  
little hospital. 
WADE : 
It doesn’t look like a hospital. It  
Page 52/119
looks like Chlamydia holding still. 
An UNLIT MATCHSTICK protrudes from Angel Dust’s teeth - heridea of a TOOTHPICK. 
WADE (CONT’D) 
Oral fixation? 
ANGEL DUST : 
Shut. The fuck. Up. 
Angel Dust places a FINGER on Wade’s FOREHEAD and SHOVES hishead back against the table - BANG - pinning it there. 
AJAX (O.S.) 
Patience, Angel. All in good time. 
Enter AJAX, whom we know as the PRISONER from the RAFT with  whom we’ve seen Deadpool tangle in the PRESENT. This is the  first Ajax and Wade have met. 
WADE : 
Can I expect turndown serv-? 
Ajax nods to Angel Dust. BOOM! She GAGS Wade with SURGICAL  TUBING, then wraps it around the TABLE, immobilizing hishead. (CONTINUED) 
 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 51. 
31 CONTINUED: 
AJAX : 
You’re a talker. 
Wade’s eyes are wider than ever. WTF? 
AJAX (CONT’D) 
(disarmingly matter-of-fact) 
Mr. Wilson, my name is Ajax. I managethe Workshop. My ‘welcome’ speech usedto be full of euphemisms like ‘You mayfeel some discomfort.’ But I’ve grownblunt. 
Ajax unsheathes an I.V. NEEDLE. Angel Dust up-tilts thetable 45 degrees, then readies a holographic monitor. 
AJAX (CONT’D) 
The Workshop is not a government program. 
It’s a private institution tasked withturning reclamation projects likeyourself into men of extraordinaryabilities. I’m about to remake yourlife. But if you think cancer curespainlessly, you’re wrong. If you thinksuper-human powers are acquiredpainlessly, you’re wrong. Ajax touches Wade with the I.V. NEEDLE, pressing here andthere, not QUITE hard enough to break skin. At last, he  
locates the subclavian vein. Wade flinches. 
Page 53/119
AJAX (CONT’D) 
We’re injecting you with a serum thatactivates mutant genes. For it to work,  
we need to subject you to extreme stress. 
The liquid glows FLUORESCENT through Wade’s white skin as itpumps into the pulmonary highway. 
AJAX (CONT’D) 
You’ve heard the whole make-an-omelette,  
break-some-eggs bit? 
(Wade blinks) 
I’m about to hurt you, Wade. The kind of  
hurt I can’t describe and you can’tprepare for. It’s cruel stuff. And  there’s no way out for you. No secret  
you can tell me. No soft spot in me toappeal to. 
Wade stares at them in shock. 
(CONTINUED) 
 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 52. 
31 CONTINUED: 
ANGEL DUST : 
What, you expected Weapon X? 
Ajax starts to TURN AWAY, but stops. 
AJAX : 
One more thing. What’s the ad? ‘I’m not  
just the president. I’m a client?’ I’ve  
been through this procedure myself. It  
made me stronger. It also scorched mynerve endings. So I no longer feel pain. 
In fact... 
(smiles) 
I no longer feel anything. 
Wade reacts by SAYING something - made UNINTELLIGIBLE by thesurgical tubing. Ajax nods to Angel Dust, who slices theSURGICAL TUBING, SNAPPING it away and FREEING Wade to TALK. 
WADE : 
Something in your teeth. 
Ajax smiles WITHOUT opening his mouth, signals Angel Dust. She slams Wade’s head back again as he turns to leave. 
Before he exits, Ajax hesitates, can’t help but check histeeth in one of the surgical mirrors. 
WADE (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
Page 54/119
Made you look! Hey, is Ajax your realname? ‘Cause it sounds suspiciously made  
up. What’s it really? Steve? Mark?  
Trevor? Kyle? 
(E.T. voice) 
Elliot?  
We hear LAUGHS from nearby tents. Wade is now playing for anaudience. 
AJAX : 
Joke away. The one thing that neversurvives this place is a sense of humor. 
WADE : 
We’ll see! 
AJAX : 
(to Angel Dust) 
All yours. 
We re-take WADE’S P.O.V. as Angel Dust, chewing her  
matchstick, re-enters frame above him, smiles, then puncheshim in the face. Black.

32 INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT/DAY - MONTAGE - PAST 32  
A MONTAGE of Wade’s treatments in the Workshop, set to thenotes of JOHN DENVER’s inspirational classic, ‘I WANT TO 
LIVE.’ Juxtaposed with HARROWING VIGNETTES of Angel Dust andAJAX experimenting on WADE...  
...as he GASPS, CLAWS, SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER.  
Wade is DUNKED into thick, molasses-like LIQUID. PULLED and YANKED, POKED and PRODDED by contraptions that would haveshamed the Spanish Inquisition.  
SAWED. COMPRESSED. SLICED. DICED. SLAP-CHOPPED. BLED.  
LONG SYRINGES PLUNGE DEEP INTO SOFT TISSUE. 
SCALPELS MAKE LONG INCISIONS.  
ENDOSCOPIC CAMERAS TRAVEL THROUGH THE BODY, REVEALING THE  DIRTY WORK OF INVASIVE SURGICAL EQUIPMENT. 
STAPLE-GUNS DRIVE STAPLES INTO SLICED SKIN TO PULL IT BACK  TOGETHER.  
MINIATURE CIRCULAR SAWS SLICE THROUGH BONE.

33 INT. WORKSHOP - WADE’S TENT / WORM’S TENT - NIGHT 33 At last, Wade is laid back down on his table, only now inQUIET DARKNESS, MEEK, WITHOUT ANY RESISTANCE whatever. 
CUNNINGHAM (O.S.) 
Puppies. 
In the tent NEXT to Wade, CUNNINGHAM holds up his FIST to the  fabric. Wade can see it through the cloth in SILHOUETTE. CUNNINGHAM (CONT’D) 
It helps picturing puppies. 
Wade gives Cunningham a KNUCKLE BUMP through the fabric. 
WADE : 
Puppies. 
Page 56/119
CUNNINGHAM : 
Or kittens. If you swing that way. 
WADE : 
(chuckles) 
I swing both ways. 
Wade swallows hard, grows serious: 
WADE (CONT’D) 
But me, I’ve been making a list of thingsI still plan to do. 
CUNNINGHAM : 
A bucket list?

WADE : 
I prefer fuck-it list: Naked tandem base

CUNNINGHAM : 
Finishing my Lego Millenium Falcon... 
WADE : 
Giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch  
oven... 
CUNNINGHAM : 
Making my kids banana pancakes... 
AJAX (O.S.) 
With the mouse ears? Creative, and  
delicious. 
AJAX and ANGEL DUST enter CUNNINGHAM’s tent and beginprepping him for a fresh round of torture. 
AJAX (CONT’D) 
It’s OK, I encourage distractions. Can’t  
have you giving up on us, can we now, youlittle worm? 
Suddenly, a VOICE calls out from the adjacent tent: 
WADE (O.S.) 
Don’t take that shit, Cunningham! How  
tough can he be? Name like Francis. 
Ajax is very subtly SURPRISED. WHAT did Wade just say? WADE  Page 57/119
is still strapped down inside. Talking nice and LOUD: 
WADE (CONT’D) 
That’s right! He got ‘Ajax’ off a dish 
washing liquid! 
(laughs from nearby tents) 
Legal name’s Francis. F-R-A-N-C-I-oops. 
Ajax has ENTERED Wade’s tent. Ajax’s expression tells us allwe need to know about the validity of Wade’s claim. 
With as much freedom of motion as he has in one hand, Wade  WAVES a STUB of PAPER at Francis. 
WADE (CONT’D) 
Dry-cleaning tag, Francis. Snagged itoff your lab coat.

Ajax stares hard at Wade with menacing eyes. 
AJAX : 
You are so relentlessly annoying. Shut  
the fuck up, or I’ll sew that prettymouth shut. 
WADE : 
Uh, I wouldn’t do that. Here’s the  
problem with round-the-clock torture. 
You can’t really step it up from there. 
AJAX : 
Is that what you think? 
WADE : 
Yeah. Francis. That’s what I think.

Two ORDERLIES and ANGEL DUST finish strapping Wade down andattaching ELECTRODES to his head and chest. Wade is BOUND to  
a HOSPITAL BED that’s ENCASED in a large CAPSULE ofPLEXIGLAS. Page 58/119
The top half of the capsule is hinged to one side, OPEN, allowing Angel Dust access to Wade. 
Ajax sits eating a meal from some Tupperware in a nearbychair. 
AJAX : 
Seems your genes are as stubborn as you. 
But we can still increase your suffering. 
We don’t even have a name for this next  
toy. 
Various WIRES and TUBES run out of the capsule, connected toOXYGEN TANKS, DIALS, and a MONITOR tracking BRAIN and HEART. 
AJAX (CONT’D) 
We reduce the oxygen in the air to theexact point you feel like you’re  suffocating.

If you start to pass out, and your brainwaves slow, we turn up the O2. If youcatch your breath, and your heart rateslows, we turn it back down. And we  
leave you. Right. There. 
WADE : 
Um. What? 
AJAX : 
Waterboarding is the most severe stressknown to man. This device prolongs that  
stress. For hours, days, weeks... 
Angel Dust chews her match and TAPS the capsule with aFINGER. 
ANGEL DUST : 
Or if you keep yapping, years... 
WADE : 
And I thought you were dicks beforethis. 
AJAX : 
The saddest part? You still think we’re  
making you a super-hero. You.  
Dishonorable discharge. Beating up pizza  
Page 59/119
guys. Hip deep in hookers. You’re  
nothing. I’d call you an asshole, butI’d have to answer to assholes. Little 
secret, Wade. The Workshop doesn’t makesuper-heroes. It makes super-slaves. We’re gonna fit you for a control collarand auction you to the highest bidder. 
(finishes meal, gets up) 
Who knows what they’ll force you to do. 
Put down freedom fighters. Murder  
innocents. Or maybe just mow a lawn or  
two. 
ANGEL DUST : 
There’s a brave face. 
Ajax goes to close the lid. 
WADE : 
Seriously. Now you do have something inyour teeth. 
AJAX : 
Enjoy the weekend!

35 CONTINUED: 
Ajax swings the capsule CLOSED and LOCKS it. The sound leaks  away until all that’s left is a HISSING SOUND as AJAX hitsBUTTONS to lower O2 LEVELS. 
Wade’s voice drops out as his breathing suddenly grows SHORTand SHALLOW. The oxygen dials fall. His HEART-RATE SOARS. 
ANGEL DUST : 
(chuckles) 
He looks like a turd in a punch-bowl. 
AJAX : 
(bright idea) 
The ‘Punch-Bowl!’ 
Wade fights off panic. His breaths become desperate GASPS. There’s not enough air to talk, or even SCREAM. 
DISSOLVE TO:

Night. Eerily DARK, SILENT. 
Page 60/119
An extreme CLOSE-UP of Wade’s hand, nails clenched into the  surface of whatever he’s lying on. Is his skin... actuallyBUBBLING? Two MEN enter the tent and stand over the PUNCH-BOWL. 
CLICK. One of the men turns on a surgical light overhead, revealing himself to be a KINDLY-looking DOCTOR, avuncular, thick glasses. Next to him is an ORDERLY. The doctor peersthrough the Punch-Bowl’s lid. He is SURPRISED by what he  
sees. He nods to the orderly: ‘Go on, hurry.’ 
The orderly quickly unlocks and unlatches the lid, thenswings it OPEN. Air RUSHES INTO the PUNCH-BOWL. The orderlysteps away, leaving the doctor alone in the room. 
WADE, hidden in darkness, gasps as though surfacing afterbeing held underwater. 
The doctor casts a SHADOW over WADE’s face inside. The  
doctor is FASCINATED, ENLIVENED. 
DOCTOR: 
Mr. Wilson... these results are 
remarkable. 
Wade takes deep LUNGS-FUL of AIR.

Your cancer cells are more aggressivethan ever. Dividing and metastasizing ata fantastic rate. 
WADE : 
(broken, breathless) 
Yippee. 
DOCTOR : 
But... the cells have inalterablychanged. They’re no longer destructive, but productive, selectively targeting andreplacing damaged tissue. 
WADE : 
That was a lot of... what’s the word...  
syllables. Are you saying I’m better? 
DOCTOR : 
Better than better. A miracle. 
WADE :

(weak smile) 
My Mom used to call me that. 
(ALT: 
Me and Jesus.  
(beat, to doctor) 
Thank you. I owe you my life. 
Wade grows choked up. The doctor is taken with empathy andaffection. He tenderly brushes the hair off Wade’s forehead, 
of which the camera catches the tiniest glimpse. Wade’s skin  is not RIGHT somehow. 
DOCTOR : 
There. There. Your journey’s been longand difficult. But you’ve becomesomething extraordinary. Just rest now.  
Rest. 
The doctor slowly exits. Wade lies there. Actually relaxes. DEADPOOL (V.O.)

No. Not fair. Everything I’ve done toyou has been in your best interest. Even  
this next bit. You may be cured, but youstill need to learn to be a better man.  
Polite. Respectful. What better way toteach you than to close this lid... andkeep torturing you stupid. 
Ajax SLAMS the lid shut, LATCHES and LOCKS it. The hissing  resumes. Wade’s eyes grow wide. He starts to slip-slidetoward absolute ANGUISH. 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) 
Page 62/119
If you think I’m losing my marbles ‘causeI can’t breathe. You’re only half right. 
Ajax appears to be looking in at Wade. But we RACK FOCUS to  reveal he’s looking at his REFLECTION in the Plexiglas lid, checking for stuff between his teeth. 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) 
See, if Francis was able to see his  
reflection... 
The camera SWINGS around to Wade’s POINT-OF-VIEW of Ajaxthrough the glass lid, which has been newly ILLUMINATED bythe surgical light above... ...and then RACKS FOCUS to WADE’s REFLECTED FACE. Covered  with HORRIFIC SCARS. Wade is no longer a handsome young man. You know what they say. You always 
He is a monster. Which is perfectly visible to him one foot  away.

Back in the PRESENT, we find ourselves in a huge SCRAP-YARD, where various ships, planes, etc. are sold for scrap iron. Among various vehicles is an OLD, BATTERED COMBAT CARRIER, long given up for dead. 
A heavy truck navigates through the heaps of scrap-metal andgrinds to a stop in front of the carrier. 
Two heavyset MEN climb down and head toward the back of thetruck, heave the heavy door open. 
AJAX and ANGEL DUST stand just inside, boxes and gear piledup behind them. They hop down as four more rough-looking menpile out behind them. Angel Dust drags out a WOODEN CRATE. The planks crunch asshe digs her fingers into the wood and heaves it up on oneburly shoulder as if it weighed no more than a sack of flour. 
Heavy AMMO peeks through. 
ANGEL DUST : 
Better to be the hunter than the hunted. 
Ajax and Angel Dust walk across the muddy yard toward aservice elevator bolted to the rusting hulk of the carrier.

Stained carpet, currently being swept by a roaming ROOMBA. IKEA... everywhere. 
The same old AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN we glimpsed early in themovie - late 70’s - purple floral dress - sits on a rattycouch, where the typical old woman might KNIT. 
Instead, this old woman uses a BOX-CUTTER to lay waste to aBIG CARDBOARD BOX from IKEA - the ‘IVAR SHELVING UNIT.’ 
She lays out its components and tools on a wobbly IKEA NORNASCOFFEE TABLE... 
...made more difficult by the fact that she is completelyBLIND. This is Deadpool’s roommate, BLIND AL. 
Suddenly, Blind Al’s KEEN EAR picks up a faint, distantKNOCKING. She cocks her head to LISTEN.

Blind Al struggles to a sitting position. Deadpool walkspast her in his socks, drops his muddy BOOTS to the floor andslips into a pair of POWDER-BLUE CROCS parked just inside thedoor. 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
So comfy. 
BLIND AL : 
Upside of being blind: I’ve never seen  
you in Crocs. 
DEADPOOL : 
You mean my big rubber masturbatin’shoes? 
BLIND AL : 
Yes I know. Downside of being blind: I  
hear everything in this duplex. 
Deadpool walks bitterly past one wall of the DUPLEX, which is  COVERED - WALL-to-WALL, FLOOR-to-CEILING, with CHRISTMAS  ADVENT CALENDARS.

Tons of ornaments/candies/etc. adorn the calendars. There’s  not ONE CALENDAR left uncovered.

Blind Al sits back on the ratty couch and begins applying thefinishing touches to the shelving unit. 
BLIND AL : 
You’re telling me. I don’t mind the  
Kullen. It’s an improvement on theHurdal. 
DEADPOOL : 
Anything’s an improvement on the Hurdal. 
I’d have taken a Hemnes... or even a  
Trysil... over the Hurdal. But I didn’t  
get excited ‘til I saw the Kullen.

Blind Al turns the final screw, beyond unenthusiastic.

BLIND AL : 
Why such a douche this morning? 
DEADPOOL : 
Let’s recap. That cock-thistle who  
turned me into this freak... the one I’ve  
been waiting five years for... slippedthrough my arms today. Arm. Deadpool holds up his previously severed arm, which now hasa little tweenage ARM emerging off it. Yes. Deadpool canGROW BACK LIMBS. DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Catching him was my only chance to be hotagain. Get my super-sexy ex back. And  
stop the same shit from happening toanyone else. So yeah, things are prettyfucking scrumptious. 
Deadpool stands. Walks behind the couch, and as he passesthe back of Blind Page 67/119
Al’s head... FARTS. 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) 
Hash-tag Drive-by. 
BLIND AL: 
(to herself) 
I’m gonna find this ‘Craig.’ And I’m  
gonna kill him. 
DEADPOOL : 
Once I’ve got the cure, I’m gonna do thesame to Francis... RS40 INT. WORKSHOP TENT - LATER RS40 
WADE, newly scarred, hidden in darkness, continues to GASP asthough being held underwater. Then the lid on the punch-bowlSLIDES BACK, revealing AJAX. Wade takes deep LUNGS-FUL ofAIR. Ajax leans in for a closer look. 
AJAX : 
Bloody hell. Someone lost his shot at  
homecoming king. 
WADE : 
(can barely speak) 
What have you done to me?! 
AJAX : 
You give me too much credit. This...  
this is the result of your genes.

RS40 CONTINUED: 
AJAX (CONT'D) 
The punch bowl merely raised your stressto trigger the mutation. 
WADE : 
You... sadistic... fuck! 
AJAX : 
Where's the gratitude?! You’re cured!  
Your mutated cells can heal anything. 
They’re attacking the cancer as fast asit can form. Your insides are a war  zone. Not to mention your outsides! 
Wade looks stunned as he struggles to process all thisinformation. Ajax Page 68/119
smiles down. 
AJAX (CONT’D) 
I’ve seen similar side-effects before. I  
could cure them for you. But really, 
where’s the fun in that? 
Wade says nothing, hating him but wanting to believe. 
AJAX (CONT’D) 
I’m going to close this lid again. Maybe  
you no longer need it. But I do. 
For a long moment, Wade stares intensely at Ajax and sees... nothing, a black hole of empathy. And he knows this is a man  who will never stop hurting him. 
***NOTE: 
the exception of the final shot.**** 
So he turns his gaze to the ceiling and WITHDRAWS intohimself... the one place the cruelty can no longer reach him. 
Angel Dust enters, chewing on her usual matchstick. 
AJAX : 
He’s all yours. 
Angel leans over the Punch-bowl, starts to undo Wade’srestraints. 
ANGEL : 
You smell like shit. 
When Angel Dust leans close to Wade’s head he suddenly comesalive and uses the strength he has left to HEAD-BUTT her inthe FOREHEAD. (CONTINUED) 
 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 67. 
CONTINUED: 
AJAX : 
(impressed) 
Whoa. 
Angel advances toward Wade. Ajax stops her. 
AJAX (CONT’D) 
Hey, hey, alright. It’s alright. I 
think he earned that one, yeah? You take 
off. Go on... off you go. 
As Angel Dust EXITS the tent, she reaches to her mouth forher matchstick... only it’s not there. She frowns, fishes  
another match from her pocket, and tucks it between her lips. Ajax finishes strapping Wade back down and goes to close thelid. 
Page 69/119
AJAX (CONT’D) 
One question. What’s my name? 
Wade remains listless, mouth SHUT. BLINKS. 
AJAX (CONT’D) 
Didn’t think so. 
Ajax CLOSES and LOCKS the lid. HISS. The oxygen DIALS FALL. DEADPOOL (V.O.) 
Sorry, Francis. But my lips are sealed. 
And then we’re inside the punch bowl with Wade as the oxygenlevels drop and the suffering rises. Through a fog of miseryWade sees Ajax staring down, watching him, drinking in hispain. 
41 INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT - PAST 41 
Back in the Punch-Bowl, Wade OPENS his MOUTH... within which  he was HIDING a SINGLE MATCHSTICK, clenched carefully - dryly -between his teeth.  
He inhales... then SPITS OUT the match into his waiting PALM. Finally, he STRIKES it against the side of the Punch Bowl. Wade aims the now FLAMING match toward the tiny HOLE throughwhich OXYGEN flows. The match is quickly burning down. Will  
it reach the hole before it snuffs out? 
At the last possible moment... 
...the flame COMBUSTS the stream of oxygen, IGNITING it... (CONTINUED) 
 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 68. 
41 CONTINUED: 
...back through the TRANSPARENT PLASTIC TUBE that trails 
outside the Punch-Bowl.  
The flame SNAKES through the tube, this way and that, untilit reaches the OXYGEN TANK standing next to the Punch-Bowl. 
A beat. Then the TANK EXPLODES. 
The BLOWS APART. The hospital bed SNAPS in TWO. 
Out in the ward, the FIREBALL curls outward, spreading fromTENT to TENT. BOOM! BOOM! Other flammable tanks DETONATE.  
The tents GO UP like ROMAN CANDLES. It’s now MASS CHAOS.  ALARMS BLARE. Flames LEAP. Smoke BILLOWS. Patients FLEE.  A CURTAIN of FIRE suddenly DISPERSES, replaced by billowy WHITE SMOKE from an OVER-SIZED CHROME FIRE EXTINGUISHER... 
...held by AJAX, who STRIDES grimly toward Wade’s tent. He  throws back the burning fabric...  
...and nearly EATS an OXYGEN TANK. He BLOCKS it at the last moment with his FIRE EXTINGUISHER. CLANG. 
On the other end of the oxygen tank, WIND-MILLING it withunbridled FEROCITY, is WADE.  
Page 70/119
WADE and AJAX SWING the oxygen tank and fire extinguisher like modern day CLUBS, trying to take off each other’s heads.  CLANG! BANG! BAM! The tanks COLLIDE in mid-air.  
Ajax’s fingers CRUNCH between metal. He doesn’t even feel it. 
Wade grabs the HOSE of Ajax’s fire extinguisher, angles itup, and gets his finger on the TRIGGER.  
The extinguisher BLASTS. Ajax is momentarily BLINDED.  
Wade brings the oxygen tank down like a LUMBERJACK’S AXE. Ajax BLOCKS it, but is driven to his KNEES.  
Wade’s eyes are lit with fire. DOWN the tank COMES, again and AGAIN. Ajax takes his own fire extinguisher to the CHIN. Then catches a BLOW from the oxygen TANK to his TEMPLE.  
The extinguisher goes FLYING. Wade swings the OXYGEN TANK AGAIN, but against all odds, AJAX CATCHES it and SLAMS itback into Wade’s NOSE. CRUNCH. 
(CONTINUED) 
 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 69. 
41 CONTINUED: 
Ajax rises to his feet, and the two grip OPPOSITE SIDES ofthe OXYGEN TANK, GRAPPLING with every ounce of strength. 
Wade sweeps Ajax’s feet and he topples over backwards, Wadeon top of him. Wade lifts the heavy tank and slams it intohis face. Once. Twice. Three times. CRACK. 
As he’s about to finish the job Ajax smiles, blood bubblingfrom his smashed lips. 
AJAX : 
You can’t kill me, Wade. I’m the onlyone who can fix that ugly mug. Wade looks torn as his rage gives way to something like hope. He tosses the tank away. 
WADE : 
Then time to make me me again. 
A scream of terror behind Wade makes Wade turn. 
CUNNINGHAM (O.S.)  
Wade! Help! Wade! 
Wade looks through the smoke and flame and spies a helplessCunningham lying in the flaming wreckage. 
WADE : 
Fuck! 
Wade drops Ajax and SPRINTS to Cunningham, starts dragging atthe WRECKAGE Page 71/119
trapping him, when... SLICE! A long piece ofsheared REBAR THRUSTS CLEAN THROUGH his CHEST from BEHIND.  
The force sends the spear DEEP into the wooden floor beams, pinning Wade like an insect in an entomologist’s display. In a grand display of strength, AJAX BENDS the end of therebar to keep Wade pinned... then walks around and squatsdown into Wade’s eye line, wearing a triumphant sneer. 
AJAX : 
Say it. ‘Francis.’ 
Blood dribbles from Wade’s mouth as he tries in vain to pushhimself off the bloody spike of metal. Ajax rises, scans theburning workshop with a scowl - clearly a lost cause - andturns to leave. 
Cunningham screams again as the flames near him. Gruntingwith the pain and effort Wade tries to push himself off thespike. 
(CONTINUED) 
 Deadpool Final Shooting Script 11/16/15 70. 
41 CONTINUED: 
His hands slip on the blood-slick metal, and he cannot freehimself. His VOLTRON RING lies on the floor next to him. 
Wade and Cunningham share a last look. Cunningham clamps his  jaws shut, fighting the agony. 
CREAK... CRACKLE... the ROOF COLLAPSES, BURYING BOTH OF THEM.  And we... CUT TO BLACK. 
FADE UP ON: 
42 INT. WORKSHOP - DAY 42 
Morning’s first sunlight. WADE’s VOLTRON RING lies  
COMPLETELY MELTED in the DEBRIS. The camera follows it to  Wade’s hand... then up his arm to his FACE. 
WADE’s eyelids flutter, and he COMES TO. He is naked, his  hospital gown burned away. We see BLACKENED SLUDGE, SOOT,  charred remains. The melted and scorched metal rod next to  him. 
Wade slowly realizes where he is and what happened. He  
reaches down to his stomach wound... WHICH HAS MIRACULOUSLY  HEALED. Wade sits up, stunned. 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) 
I didn’t just get the cure to El Cáncer. 
I got the cure to everything. 
V43 EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING - PAST V43 
VANESSA, tired, broken, mind seemingly elsewhere, walkstowards her apartment. She passes a loving young COUPLE, arm

in-arm. 
Vanessa clocks this sadly, continues on. 
Behind her, PEOPLE walk to and fro. Among them, we REVEAL: WADE, dressed in ill-fitting pants and a hoodie. He is a  TRAIN-WRECK, scarred face on display to the world for thefirst time. He looks purposeful, but tentative, walking behind Vanessa, GAINING on her. 
ANGLE ON: 
A BOY goes by on his bike, trying hard not to gape. A  
TODDLER in a STROLLER looks up and BURSTS INTO TEARS. The  toddler’s MOTHER hustles past. 
(CONTINUED)

V43 CONTINUED: 
MOTHER : 
Alex, don’t stare. 
VANESSA stops and rifles through her purse for keys. 
STILL on Wade’s P.O.V. Wade stops, too, suddenly paralyzed, as the moment to face Vanessa arrives. 
As he hesitates, torn with anguish, the WHISPERS seem togrow, rising in volume until they become deafening: 
WHISPER 2 (O.S.) 
Oh, my, god, that is so fucking gnarly. 
WHISPER 3 (O.S.) 
I just lost my appetite. 
Wade spins, trying to see where the voices are coming from. Nowhere... everywhere. The WHISPERS crescendo, now more in  Wade’s mind than in reality. 
He turns back to Vanessa, his face a mask of fear and pain... just as she disappears into her apartment building. The  closing glass door reveals his own HIDEOUS REFLECTION STARINGBACK AT HIM. 
DEADPOOL: 
In the whole wide world, there’s nothing 
as ugly... 
(beat) 
...as fear. 
He gives up on his mission, backing away from his reflection, Vanessa, his old life. He stumbles off the curb and into the  street, when... BAM! 
He is CRUSHED OUT OF FRAME by a SPEEDING BUS.

B44 INT. DEADPOOL’S LAIR - NIGHT B44  
An FBI-STYLE ‘ORGANIZATIONAL CHART’ has been pinned on Wade’sCORKBOARD in the lair. A ‘pyramid’ of baddies are linked bystrings. Each baddie is depicted not by a photograph, but a  
child-like CRAYON DRAWING. 
Second from the top is the RECRUITER.  
At the APEX of the pyramid is AJAX HIMSELF.  
DEADPOOL, in his LAIR, sews together an early ‘proto 
costume.’  
We see quick cuts of pieces of it going on:  
White Adidas track suit. White gloves. White boots. And 
some sort of white mask...  
A single gun, underarm holster, boot knife but no swords.  VC44 INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT VC44  
DEADPOOL : 
Don’t make me ask twice. Where’s  
Francis?! 
DEADPOOL questions a bleeding thug, more bodies scatteredacross a floor littered with broken furniture behind him.  
Another thug rushes in and smashes a pool cue over Deadpool’s skull. Deadpool snatches the broken shaft of wood and PUNCHES it into the thugs belly.  
A third thug staggers to his feet, pulls a pistol, firesmultiple shots point blank. Deadpool staggers back, bloodblossoming across his white suit. “CLICK”  
The thug stares in disbelief that Deadpool’s still standing.  Deadpool looks down at the shaft of wood in his hand.

Fuck. Me. 
D44 INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY D44 
DEADPOOL, TIDE STAIN-STICK in hand, tries unsuccessfully toget the blood out of his white suit. 
We get our first glimpse of BLIND AL, who’s sitting next toDeadpool at the laundromat, completely unfazed by the  
bloodbath: 
BLIND AL : 
Seltzer water and lemon for blood.

Deadpool’s eyes light up. He crumples this suit into a balland tosses it into a trash bin.

In a BOXING RING at the center of the room two WOMEN poundeach other surrounded by a scrum of a CROWD. Deadpool spieshis mark in a dirty white suit pressed in tight ringside. 
Deadpool pulls his mask down, wades into the crowd, throwingmen aside, PLOWING toward his target. 
The mark sees Deadpool at the last second, turns as a KATANAflashes out and skewers his hand, pinning it to the wall. 
Deadpool fires a couple shots into the ceiling, sending therest of the crowd rushing for the exit.

A wretched room, dirty mattresses covering the floor. Dim light scatters through a tangle of IV bags hastily strung up  over MEN too poor to have anywhere else to go and die.  
The RECRUITER kneels, speaking quietly to a particularly 
hardened patient. He places a card in the man’s emaciated hand, then stands and walks toward a low doorway.  
The recruiter enters a brightly lit room stacked high withbags of rice. Two heavily armed THUGS fall in beside him. 
The men scan the aisles as they move toward a door leadingout into an alley. 
DEADPOOL :

And we're up. That's it. 
Ready to start the day. 
-And we were looking for something. -Nemo. 
Right. I remember it 
like it was yesterday. 
Of course, I don't really remember yesterday all that well. 
(NEMO LAUGHING) 
Anyway, I would say the scariest moment of the trip was the 4 sharks. 
NEMO: 
there were 3 sharks. 
MARLIN: 
there were definitely four. 
But last time you told it, 
there were three. 
Son, which one of us traveled 
across the entire ocean? 
-Nemo did. 
Page 6/67
-(YELPS) 
Obviously we had to cross the ocean... to find him, so you know... He went first. I guess that's true, isn't it? 
Well, you made it! 
You almost missed the field trip. A field trip? Ooh, I love field trips! Where are we going? 
-I thought you told her. 
-I did tell her! 
-Uh... Dory. 
-Yeah. 
Mr. Ray has too many fish 
to keep an eye on today. 
Uh-huh. 
So it would be best if today 
you weren't exactly with the class. Oh. Why not? 
Well, you know, you have problems remembering things sometimes. 
That's the one thing I can remember. Yes. 
Okay. And sometimes it's not your fault, but it can cause you to wander. 
And Mr. Ray doesn't really have time to worry about fish who wander. 
In other words, 
he doesn't have enough help. 
Poor guy. 
You know, he's so overworked. 
-You understand. 
-I totally understand now. 
-Okay. 
-Mm-hmm. 
He wants me 
to be the teacher's assistant. 
Uh... No, not exactly. 
I am so honored. I have never been a teaching assistant before. 
Mr. Ray! You got help. 
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY) 
Oh. Okey dokey. 
(STUDENTS LAUGHING) 
-All right, kids. 
Page 7/67
-All right, kids. 
-Today's the day! 
-Today's the day! 
Our field trip to the sting ray migration. Sting ray migration. 
Now, does anyone know 
why we migrate? 
(COUGHS) 
Come on. You gotta know this stuff. Migration is about going back to... -Bed! 
-Yes! 
-No. 
-No. 
-The sand! 
-No! Migration is about going home. -Home. 
-Which is where you're from. 
Where you're from. 
Can someone tell me 
where they're from? 
-I live by a giant rock! 
-I live 3 coral caves away from here! My house is covered in algae! 
Where'd you grow up, Dory? 
Me? Um, I don't know. 
My family. Where are they? 
-Can I help you? 
-(STUDENTS LAUGHING) 
I'm sorry. Did I forget again? 
You see, I suffer from-- 
STUDENTS: 
How can you remember your family if you have short-term memory loss? Good question. See, I can remember some things because, well... 
They make sense. 
Like, um, I have a family. 
I know because I've-- I must've 
come from somewhere. Right? 
Everyone has a family. 
I may not remember their names 
and what they look like. 
Page 8/67
And I may not even be able to 
ever find them again, but um... -What were we talkin' about? 
-Mommies and daddies. 
Mommies and daddies. Right. 
Why are we talkin' about 
mommies and daddies? Oh. Oh! 
That class. Uh-oh. Why me? Okay? You guys seem a little young, 
but, um, okay. 
You see, kids, 
when two fish love each other-- And we'll stop right there. 
Climb aboard, explorers! 
I feel a migration song comin' on! Oh... 
Oh, kids, stay away from the edge. Okay, you hear that? Okay, everybody, stay back from the edge. Come on. -Okay, that's too far. 
-That's too far. 
Come on. Come on. 
Get back over here. Back this way. -Now, I need everyone to listen to me. -All right, listen up! 
-When the rays pass through here-- -The rays, they're gonna pass through. What do we have to be careful of? Everybody has to be careful of what? Hmm? 
ALL: 
MR. RAY: 
Page 9/67
That's right. The under-- The undertow? 
MR. RAY: 
by all the flapping is very strong. And if you're not careful, 
you can get pulled into-- 
Mr. Ray! So how do the stingrays all know where to go? 
That's what an instinct is, Nemo. Something deep inside you that feels so familiar that you have to listen to it. Like a song you've always known. And I can hear mine now! 
-(STUDENTS GASPING) 
-Wow! 
We see the undertow 
and we say-- (SCREAMS) 
-ALL: 
-(SCREAMING) 
Dory! 
MR. RAY: 
-(GASPS) Is she dead? 
-MR. RAY: 
-STUDENTS: 
-Give her some space, everybody. The Jewel of Morro Bay, California. 
Page 10/67
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California? I remembered something, so I-- 
(GASPS) I remembered something! 
I actually remembered something! Something important! 
Something important? 
What? What was it? 
Uh... I'm not sure anymore, 
but I can still feel it. It's right there. All right, thank you, Mr. Ray. 
Okay, come on. Try to remember better. Don't be such a Dory, Dory. 
Hmm. I don't know. I-- Hold on. Hold on. -Uh... Oh. Oh! 
-What? Did you remember? 
Ugh, I don't remember. 
It was something-- It was-- 
Oh, oh, oh! It was something about the-- -The Jewel of Morro Bay, California. -(GASPS) 
My family! 
(GASPS) I remember my family! 
They're out there somewhere! 
I have to find them! 
Guys, you gotta help me. 
Guys! Guys! Hello? 
Guys! Where are you? 
-MARLIN: 
-Hello? 
-Dory! 
-Where did you go? 
You were the one to go! 
-My parents! I remembered them! 
What? What did you remember? 
I remembered them! My mom, my dad! I have a family! 
Oh, they don't know where I am. 
Let's go! We have to go! 
Dory, no. No! This is crazy! 
Where exactly are you trying to go? To the Gem of the Baltic? 
-The Jewel of Morro Bay, California. -Yes! 
Page 11/67
No, Dory. California's all the way 
across the ocean. 
Then we'd better get going! 
How come every time we're on the edge of this reef, one of us is trying to leave? For once, can't we just enjoy the view? How can you be talking about the view when I remembered my family? 
No! We've done our ocean travels. 
That part of our lives is over. 
The only reason to travel in the first place is so you don't have to travel ever again. Yeah, but I wanna-- 
(MARLIN GROANS AND COUGHS) 
-Dory, look... 
-Please. 
All I know... is that I miss 'em. 
I really, really miss 'em. 
I don't know that felt like. 
Do you know what that feels like? 
(SIGHS) 
Yes, I know what that feels like. 
I don't wanna forget this. 
Somewhere out there is my family. 
Please, Marlin, 
I can't find them on my own. 
I'll forget. 
Please help me find my family. 
Yeah, Dad! You can get us all the way across the ocean. Right? 
No... (SIGHS) 
But I know a guy. 
-Whoo-hoo! 
-(MARLIN SCREAMING) 
Righteous, righteous, righteous! 
(LAUGHTER) 
Totally sick! Totally sick! 
I know. Isn't it great? 
No! I'm gonna be totally sick! 
It's the California current, dude. 
It's got some gnarly chop. 
-(GROANING) 
-Surf's up, dude! 
(MARLIN SCREAMS AND GAGS) 
Page 12/67
Hey, dude, if you're gonna hurl, 
just do me a solid, 
head to the back of the shell 
lean out and go for distance. 
We call that "feeding the fishes." Correctamundo, Squirt! 
And now we're lookin' for my parents at the Brooch of the Atlantic? Or the-- -The Jewel of Morro Bay, California. -Exactly! 
How are you gonna find your parents? Do you remember what they look like? I'm a bit new to the memory thing, so I can't say for sure, 
but somethin' tells me they were 
mostly blue, with s-- Maybe yellow. That sounds right. 
Also, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna know them when I see them. We're family. By the way, crossing the ocean 
is the kind of thing you should only do once! -One time! 
-Morro Bay, California's coming up, dudes! 
DORY: 
Let's find my family! 
CRUSH: 
-NEMO: 
-MARLIN: 
(MARLIN SCREAMING) 
-(MARLING GROANS) 
-(NEMO LAUGHING) 
Whoo-hoo! (LAUGHS) 
SQUIRT: 
Hope you find your parents! 
CRUSH: 
"feeding the fishes!" 
(TURTLES LAUGHING) 
Too late. Already fed. 
Page 13/67
Oh. 
This feels familiar. Mom! Dad! 
MARLIN: 
DORY: 
MARLIN: 
Do you really think your parents are just gonna be floating around here waiting for you? 
Well, I don't know, but there's only 
one way to find out. 
Mom! Dad! 
-Yell louder, Dory! 
-Mom! Dad! 
-Shh! 
-(GASPS) What was that? 
Wait. I've heard that before. 
I remember someone saying, "Shh." 
Yes, well done. That was me. 
One minute ago. 
ALL: 
(GASPS) 
Please. Have you seen 
my mommy and daddy? 
Their names are Jenny and Charlie. 
ALL: 
(GASPS) Jenny and Charlie. 
MARLIN: 
Those are their names! 
My parents are Jenny and Charlie! 
-Dory, wait! 
-Jenny! 
MARLIN: 
a moment to come up with a plan? 
-Jenny! Charlie! 
-Shh! 
-Are you crazy? 
-Sorry, she's a little excited. 
-Jenny! Charlie! 
Page 14/67
-Dory, stop yelling for a second. It's not a good idea 
to come into a new neighborhood... and call this much attention to yourself. You don't understand. I remembered my parent's names! Jenny! Charlie! These crabs are locals and I 
get the feelin' they're shushin'... us for a reason. You might wake up something dangerous. 
Are you talking about like 
something with one big eye... 
tentacles, and a snappy thing? 
Well, that's very specific, 
but something like that, yes. 
You just in general don't want to-- (CRABS GASP) 
Oh, my goodness. Okay. 
There's a mistake. We're backing away. Let us and we will-- 
We'll worship you. We'll build a-- Do you like a monument? 
(ALL SCREAMING) 
(SCREAMING) 
MARLIN: 
Swim for your life! 
(ALL SCREAMING) 
(SCREAMING CONTINUES) 
(NEMO SCREAMS) 
-Nemo! 
-Nemo! 
(SCREAMING) 
-Nemo! 
-Dad! 
No! 
Nemo, hold on to me and don't let go! Dad! 
No, no! No! 
(MARLIN GRUNTS) 
(DORY PANTING) 
Dory! Dory, slow down! 
We're not being chased anymore! Are you sure? (SCREAMS) 
Page 15/67
(DORY GRUNTS) 
Jenny and Charlie! Jenny and Charlie! I just remembered their names! 
We have to keep goin'. We're so close. (NEMO CRYING) 
-Huh? 
-Nemo, are you hurt? 
(GASPS) Oh, my goodness! Nemo! 
Are you okay? What happened? 
-Not now, Dory. Please! 
-Oh, no. 
-Nemo. Oh, no. Oh, no. 
-I'm okay. 
Oh, Nemo. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. (CRYING) 
(GASPS) 
Oh, my goodness! Nemo, are you okay? I said, "Not now." You've done enough. I have? Oh, no. But I can fix it. I can. I'll go get help. 
You know what you can do, Dory? You can go wait over there. 
Go wait over there and forget. 
It's what you do best. 
You're right. I don't know what I thought I could do this. 
Find my family. I can't do it. 
I'm so sorry. I'll fix it. 
-NEMO: 
-Well, I'm gonna get help. Okay? Okay? I can do that. I'll be-- 
It'll be alright, Nemo. 
Hello? Someone? Hello? 
Anyone? Hello? Anyone? 
SIGOURNEY ON SPEAKER: Hello. 
-Hello? 
-I'm Sigourney Weaver. 
Oh. Hi, Sigourney. I need your help. Won't you please join us... 
Oh. Great, great, great. 
As we explore the wonders 
of the Pacific Ocean... 
and the amazing life it holds within. Page 16/67
Witness the majesty 
of the Beluga Whale. 
Sigourney Weaver, where are you? Dory! There you are! 
Guys! I found help. Sigourney Weaver's gonna tell us where we are. 
-Look out! 
-(SCREAMS) 
-Oh, look at this! 
-No respect for ocean life. 
-Marlin! Nemo! 
-NEMO: 
No, no, no. Not again! Not again! Let's take the inside 
and see how she does. 
(DORY SCREAMS) 
NEMO: 
MARLIN: 
We'll come find you! 
SIGOURNEY: 
the Marine Life Institute, 
where we believe in Rescue, 
Rehabilitation and Release. 
DORY: 
(DORY PANTING) 
Hello? Hello? Can you help me? 
Me help you? (SNEEZES) 
Ugh. (SCREAMS) 
Oh. (GASPS) 
Huh? What's happenin'? Help? 
MAN: 
WOMAN: 
You're a scientist. We talked about this. 
MAN: 
(DOOR CLOSES) 
Page 17/67
DORY: 
I'll be fine, I just need to find a way out and... 
If I could just-- Get a hold of yourself. -Get a hold of yourself. 
-(YELPS) 
You'll be fine, everything's fine, think positively. 
-Hey, you. 
-Oh. 
Spinner. 
Oh, my goodness. Hi, I'm Dory. I'm-- Name's Hank. How sick are you? 
Sick? I'm sick? 
Why else would you be in quarantine? Oh, no! How long do I have? 
I have to find my family. 
All right. Now, don't get hysterical-- Uh-oh. Not good. 
What? What is it? What happened? (GASPS) What's that? 
That there is bad news. 
It's a transport tag for fish. 
who can't cut it inside the institute. They get transferred to permanent digs. An aquarium. 
In Cleveland. 
Fish in here, go here in the ocean. Cleveland fish, stay there forever. (GASPS) Cleveland? No! 
I can't go to the Cleveland. 
I have to get to the Jewel of Morro Bay, California and find my family. 
That's this place. 
The Marine Life Institute. 
The Jewel of Morro Bay, California. You're here. 
You mean, I'm from here? 
(GASPS) My parents are here. 
I have to get to them. 
So what exhibit are you from? 
Wait. I'm from an exhibit? 
Which one? I have to get there. Hmm. That's a hard one, kid. 
Page 18/67
Unless... Nah. 
Never work. It's too crazy. 
What do you mean? Just tell me. I'm okay with crazy. 
Ya know, I could see that? 
Well, there's one thing I can think of... to help you get to your family. If I just take-- 
Yes! Great idea. 
You take me to find them. 
Why didn't I think of that? 
Uh, no, no, no. 
If I just take your tag... 
I can take your place on the transport truck then you can go back inside... and find your family. 
All you have to do is give me the tag. What tag? 
(GASPS) There's a tag on my fin! How could you forget 
you have a tag on your fin? 
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I-- 
I suffer from short-term memory loss. You don't remember 
what we were talking about? 
Mm-mm. Not a clue. 
What were we talkin' about? 
Um, you were about to give me your tag. Well, I kind of like my tag. 
Why do you want it? 
So I can go to-- 
So I can go to Cleveland. 
Cleveland? Mmm. 
I hear good things 
about Cleveland. 
Why do you wanna do? 
Because if stay here I'm gonna get released back to the ocean. 
And I have extremely 
unpleasant memories of that place. (EXHALES) 
I just wanna live in glass box alone. That's all I want. So gimme your tag! Hey, man, don't touch my tag! 
Page 19/67
(SIGHS) 
Look... 
(SLURPS) 
I don't work here. 
It's not like I have a map of this place. (GASPS) A map! Good idea. 
You take me to the map, I figure out where my parents are. Oh, boy. 
All right. If I get you to your family will you give me-- 
I don't have much. Um, I-- 
How 'bout if I give you this tag? Great idea. 
(INDISTINCT CHATTER) 
MARLIN: 
sure that's what I said? 
"Go wait over there and forget. 
That's what you do best. 
-Yeah, Dad. 
-I said that? 
You said that, Dory swam to the surface, and got taken by some-- 
All right, I don't wanna hear 
the whole story again. 
I was just askin' about the one part because, look, if I said that-- I'm not positive I did. 
It's actually a compliment because... I asked her to wait and I said, "It's what you do best." 
So I-- Oh, it's my fault! 
It's all my fault she got kidnapped and taken into whatever this place is. What if it's a restaurant? 
Oy! You two! Shut it! 
Yeah, we're trying to sleep! 
You interrupted my favorite dream! Is that the one about you 
laying on this rock? 
-Yeah. 
-Oh, that is a good one. 
-Oh, yeah, isn't it? Yeah. 
-It's one of my favorites. 
Page 20/67
NEMO: 
-Son! Son. 
-We're tryin' to-- 
Those are sea lions. 
They are natural predators. 
They could pounce at any moment. (YAWNING) 
Uh, they don't look very pouncy. That's what they want you to think. Just get behind me 
and let me do the talking. 
Excuse me, we're worried 
about our friend. Is that a restaurant? (LAUGHING) 
Mate, it's not a restaurant. 
Your friend is okay. 
-She is? 
-It's a fish hospital. 
Sigourney Weaver says she'll be rescued, rehabilitated, and released. She'll be in and out in a jiff. We should know. 
-Nasal parasite. 
-Anemia. 
All fixed up and sent on our way. Oh, thank goodness. 
Sure, that's all right. 
Don't you worry ab-- 
-BOTH: 
-Shove off, Gerald! Come on. Off! Off! -Get off! Now you know better! Off! -Off! Off! Off! Off! 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing. 
That place is the Marine Life Institute. The Jewel of Morro Bay, California. (GASPS) She was right. 
It looks like Dory 
can do something besides forget. Thank you, Nemo. Thank you for that. So how are we gonna get inside? Wait. You wanna get inside MLI? Desperately. Our friend is there. 
Page 21/67
Lost, alone. 
She's scared. 
She'll have no idea what to do. Oh, we know a way. 
You do? 
BOTH: 
Ooo-roo-roo. Ooo-roo. 
-What are they doin'? 
-I don't know. It sounds. 
DORY: 
HANK: 
Hank, I'm so glad I found you. 
It feels like-- I-- Destiny. 
For what must be the millionth time, it's not destiny. 
Oh, oh. Have I said "destiny" before? I'm sorry. 
I'm just so nervous 
'cause I'm gonna meet my parents. I haven't seen them in I don't even know how long because... 
-you see I suffer from short-term-- 
-HANK: 
Look, no more talking. Okay? 
I don't like talking. 
I don't like chatter and questions. And, "How are you? Oh, I'm fine." (PHONE RINGING) 
"How are you? I'm fine, too." 
News flash -nobody's fine. 
Oh, I'm fine. How are you? 
(SIGHS) 
-Hank, look, there's a map! 
-Shh! 
The plan is you're gonna read that and figure out where your parents live. Then I'm on the truck to Cleveland. You got it? 
Got it. What was the first part again? Ugh. 
Page 22/67
What? The octopus escaped again? Wow. Look at all the exhibits. How can you do this park in one day? Seriously. 
-Pick one! 
-Okay. Um... 
(GROANS) Well, 
tell everyone to keep an eye out. We're supposed to be releasing the octopus back to the ocean today. Well, of course I haven't seen him. If I was looking, I'd find him. Hank! There you are. 
-Hurry up! 
-Okay. Okay. 
K. It starts with a "k." 
Kid z-own-y. Kid zone! 
No! No kids. Kids grab things. And I'm not losing 
another tentacle for you. 
You lost a tentacle? 
Well, then you're not an octopus. You're a septopus. 
I may not remember, but I can count. -Hurry up! 
-Okay. 
Journey to the-- Hey, look. Shells. (GASPS) 
Hey, look. Shells! 
(CHARLIE CHUCKLING) 
Daddy, here's a shell for you. That's great, Dory. 
You found another one. 
-I did? 
-Oh, yes, you did. 
You're getting good at this, Dory. (FISH LAUGHING) 
Hey, look. Shells! 
(JENNY CHUCKLES) 
-Hey, I live there. 
-Yes! Yes, indeed. 
-I like shells. 
-(LAUGHS) That's right, dear. 
Do you think you could find me Page 23/67
another shell? 
(WHISPERS) Purple ones 
are my favorite. 
Okay, Mommy. 
Mommy. Purple shell. Purple shell! Hey, my home had a purple shell. 
So what? Half the exhibits here 
have purple shells in them. 
No, no, no. You don't understand. 
I remember her now. 
Purple shells were her favorite 
and she had this adorable giggle. 
And then my dad was really friendly. And now your wacky memory's 
gonna get us caught. 
Still think this is destiny? 
-Hank, we have to find my folks! 
-Quiet! 
Ugh. Base, this is Carol. 
Uh, I think I might have found 
that missing octopus. Over. 
-See what you did? 
-Sorry. 
This could not be worse. 
Hmm. "Destiny." (GASPS) Destiny. 
-Hank. I got a feelin'. 
-Sh! 
I think we should get in the bucket. -No. Stop. 
-Seriously. It says "destiny" and it is-- -No, no, no, no, no. 
-We've gotta get in that bucket. 
-I'm not going with you in the bucket. -Here... I... go... in... the... bucket. Bye. (GASPS) 
Hey, guys, I'm lookin' for my family. Oh, good idea. Play dead. 
(HANK GASPS) 
I'm sorry. I gotta blink. How do you hold your eyes open that long? 
(GRUNTING) 
(GROANS) 
Hey, guys. Wait a second. 
(SCREAMS) 
Page 24/67
(PANTING) 
(SCREAMS) 
Our next guest 
has been here a very long time. She's a whale shark. 
Her name is Destiny. 
Destiny? Really? 
You'll notice she's extremely 
nearsighted and has trouble... 
navigating her environment. 
Oh! And here she comes now. 
Ooh! Destiny. (GASPS) You're a fish? (DESTINY GROANS) 
Wait. What? 
-Hi! Hello there. 
-Whoa! Oh. Whoa. 
All right, I'll go with you. 
-Excuse me. Hi. 
-Who is that? Is that blue blob talkin'? -Can you help me? I lost my family. -You lost your family? 
Well, it's a long story, 
and truth be told, 
I don't remember most of it. 
Aw, that is so sad. 
You poor thi-- (SCREAMS) 
(DESTINY PANTING) 
Sorry. Not a great swimmer. 
I can't see very well. 
Oh, I think you swim beautifully. In fact, I've never seen a fish swim like that before. 
(VOCALIZING) Thank you. 
(VOCALIZING) You're welcome. 
Wait. Say that again. 
Um, you're (VOCALIZING) welcome. -Dory? 
-Yes. 
-Dory? 
-Yes. 
-Dory? 
-Yes. 
-(GASPS) Dory! 
-Yes. 
Page 25/67
-You and I were friends! 
-No! 
-Dory, it's me! Destiny! 
-You know me? 
Of course! We talked through the pipes 
when we were little. 
-We were pipe pals! 
-We were? 
-(GASPS) Aw, you're so pretty. 
-So you know where I'm from? 
Yep, you are from 
the Open Ocean exhibit. 
I'm from the Open Ocean exhibit? 
(GASPS) Then that's 
where my parents are. 
We gotta go. Can you take me there? 
Uh... Kind of tough for whale 
to travel around here. 
Can you please keep it down 
over there? My head hurts. 
-(DESTINY GROANS) 
-Who's that? 
(WHISPERING) 
That's my neighbor, Bailey. 
He was brought in with a head injury. 
I know you're talkin' about me, Destiny. He thinks he can't use his echolocation, but I've overheard... 
the doctors talking. 
There's not a thing wrong with him. 
Hear every word 
you're sayin' about me. 
What's echolocation? 
Bailey's head is supposed to put out 
a call and the echo helps him find objects far away. Oh, but apparently, he's still "healin'." Now I know you're talkin' about me. 
-I really can't echolocate. 
-Oh. 
I cannot have this conversation again. 
I just can't. 
I hit head very hard out there. 
See how swollen it is! 
Your head is supposed to be big! 
Page 26/67
You're a beluga! 
Echolocation. 
Oh, like the world's 
most powerful pair of glasses? 
-What 
-What are glasses? 
It's sorta like you go, "hoo" 
and then you see things. 
Why do I know that? 
Oh. That's interesting. 
There ya are! 
Listen up, you and I are square. I took you to the map, 
now gimme that tag! 
Wait, no. I know where my parents are. They're in the. 
What's it called? The place-- 
The soap and lotion? 
-BOTH: 
-Open Ocean. 
(GASPS) Open Ocean! 
I know where that is. 
That's the exhibit located right next to-- I don't care. 
-Easy! 
-(DESTINY GASPS) 
If you're tryin' to get to the Open Ocean exhibit go through the pipes. 
-HANK: 
-Through the pipes? 
Yep. Take two lefts, swim straight and you'll hit it. 
Oh, that's a lot of directions. That's-- Did you get that, Hank? All that? -Uh, yeah. 
-Great! Let's go. 
I'm not going with you. I won't fit. You have to go by yourself. 
Um... 
That's-- I'm-- I-- See, I can't because I'm not so good with directions. Well, that's too bad. A deal's a deal. 
Page 27/67
You wanted to find your parents? That's how you get to 'em. 
Now gimme your tag. 
But, Hank, I can't go in the pipes alone. I'll forget where I'm goin'. 
-Not my problem. Tag! 
-But I can't get in that way. 
-I'm sorry, but there's no other way. -There's no other way. (GASPS) 
(GRUNTS) 
-There's no other way. 
-Now, now. Don't panic. 
It's okay. Not everything in life is easy to do. Isn't that right, Charlie? She's right. When something's 
too hard, you should just give up. -Charlie! 
-A joke. I'm kidding! 
Just a joke. A joke. 
Caution, joker at work. 
-Joke. I got it. 
-(YOUNG DORY LAUGHS) 
You see, kelpcake? 
There's always another way. 
Thank you, Daddy. 
Thank you, Daddy. 
(GASPS) Nope. My father said 
there's always another way. 
-What? There is no other way. 
-Open Ocean. Open Ocean. Hmm... Open Ocean. I'm pretty sure 
it's the building over there. 
That's ill-defined and roundish. Like Bailey's head. 
-Wait, what? 
-Always another way. There's-- 
There! Guys, follow me. 
I know how we can get to locomotion. BOTH: 
DORY: 
Um, guys. 
You know I can't swim over there, right? Page 28/67
BOTH: 
MARLIN: 
is gonna get us inside. 
What are you even doing? 
We're calling her over, of course. Calling her over? Callin' who over? (BIRDS WARBLING) 
Lads, meet Becky. 
(SQUAWKS) 
Flying? No, no, no new information. Listen, tell her thank you. 
You guys have gone 
above and beyond. Really. 
But is there a way to get in 
that involves, like, swimming? Because that's really our strength. Look, your friend is going to be in quarantine. 
That's where they take sick fish. And the one and only one way 
into that place is Becky. 
-(SQUAWKS) 
-(MARLIN SCREAMS) 
(MARLIN CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) 
Hi, Becky. 
Ow! Stop. Let's call 
her Pecky 'cause this is hurtin' on. (CHUCKLES) I think she likes you, Dad. Becky, love? These two nice fish need to get into quarantine. 
Are you free today, Rebecca darlin'? Becky, is-- Would that work 
with your schedule? Ow! 
She doesn't understand 
what I'm sayin'. 
All you have to do 
is imprint with her, mate. 
-Imp-- What? 
-BOTH: 
Look her in the eye and say, "ooo-roo" and she'll be in sync with you. 
Page 29/67
-Now look her in the eye. 
-Yeah. 
(GROANS) Nemo, I think we should devise an alternate plan. 
One that involves stayin' be in the water and someone sane. 
Because this bird, this bird... This ain't the bird! 
That's fine, Dad. And in the meantime, Dory will just forget us. 
Like you said, it's what she does best. (SIGHS) Fine. 
Uh... 
Okay, look her in the eye. Which eye? FLUKE: 
MARLIN: 
Uh... 
(ECHOING) Ooh. Ooo-roo. 
Roo-roo, Becky. 
(SQUAWKS) 
(NEMO LAUGHING) 
Okay, this is all great. 
How exactly is Becky 
supposed to carry us? 
Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. Gerald! -Hmm? 
-RUBBER: 
-FLUKE: 
-Hmm? 
Come on, Gerald. Give us your pail, we'll let you sit on the rock. 
-Yeah, Gerald. We swear it. 
-Hmm. 
(LAUGHS) 
That's right. Shimmy on over here. -(LAUGHING) 
-Come on. You can do it. 
-That's right. 
-(GRUNTING) 
Mind you don't scuff your bum. 
Page 30/67
(GRUNTING) 
-Thank you so much, Gerald. 
-(LAUGHING) 
Welcome to your time on this rock. -Comfortable, isn't it? 
-(CHUCKLES) 
BOTH: 
-Off! Off! Off! Off! 
-Time's up! Now get off, Gerald! Off! No, this is nuts! Why do I keep getting talked into insane choices? 
-(BECKY SQUAWKS) 
-Good luck! 
(SCREAMING) 
Okay, when I tell you you're gonna-- Yeah. I know. I'm gonna signal 
with a big splash. 
On my mark. Not clear yet. 
Not clear yet. 
-Now? 
-Not 'til Destiny gives the signal. (HANK CHEWING LOUDLY) 
You know something? I have no idea why you're even doing this. 
What do you mean? 
It seems like a lotta trouble 
just to find some more fish. 
If I had short-term memory loss... I'd just swim off into the blue and forget everything. 
Well, I don't wanna do that. 
I want my family. 
Not me, kid. I don't want anyone to worry about. 
You're lucky. No memories. 
No problems. 
Huh. No memories. No problems. 
Still not clear. Still not clear. You don't have to say when it's not time. -Not-- 
-Just tell me when it is time. 
Okay, here we go. And-- Wait! 
(INHALES) "Here we go. Wait." 
Page 31/67
Are you serious? 
-Okay, on the count of three. 
-Don't count. Just say, "Go." 
-Go! Now, now. Do it! Do it! 
-What? Okay, okay. (GRUNTS) 
-Wow. Look at that! I mean-- 
-That's the signal. 
-Go, go, go! That's the signal! -(GRUNTING) 
HANK: 
Destiny said follow the signs 
-to the Open Ocean exhibit. 
-DORY: 
HANK: 
so it's your job to look for it. Got it. Follow the signs to Open Ocean. I'm just gonna repeat it, okay? That should work. 
Follow the signs to Open Ocean. Follow the signs to Open Ocean. Mm. Go right! Follow the signs to Open Ocean. 
Follow the signs to Open Ocean. Follow the signs to Open Ocean. Left! -Follow the signs to Open Ocean. -And steer clear of people, will ya? Especially kids. 
I don't wanna be touched. 
Shh! Do not mess me up! 
(BOTH SCREAM) 
Oh, poor baby. 
Let me get that for you. Here you-- Oh! Oh, my. Ugh. 
-Where do we go? Where do we go? -(GIRL CRYING) 
Oh, sorry! 
Okay, I was lookin', lookin'... 
MARLIN: 
Drop us anywhere. We're okay. 
Just wait, Dad! I think she's lookin' Page 32/67
for a place to land! 
She's confused, Nemo! She doesn't even know which way to look! 
(GIRL CRYING) 
(SQUAWKS) 
(MARLIN SCREAMING) 
Wait, Becky. What are you doin'? Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo-roo-roo-roo. 
(SQUAWKS) 
Okay. I was going somewhere. 
The question is where. 
Which way? Do you see the sign? I'm lookin'. I'm lookin'. Something to something gets me to my family! "The world's most powerful pair of--" I know that. Who do I know that? It's another memory. 
Hank, we need to go that way! 
Left. Go left. 
MARLIN: 
She can't hear you, Dad. 
All right. New plan. We have to get closer to Becky so she can hear us. -(GRUNTING) 
-I don't think we should move the pail. Nemo. Without me Becky's lost. Dad, just trust her. 
Trust her? She can forget us 
all together? 
-I trust Becky. 
-You trust her? Becky's eating a cup! (SQUAWKS) 
Becky! Becky! Ooo-roo! Whoa! 
Ahh. (GROANS) 
Well, at least we're not stuck in the bucket anymore. 
-(MARLIN GROANS) 
-(NEMO SIGHS) 
Or on top of quarantine.

-Welcome, it's a huge cuddle party! -Cuddle party! I'm in! 
Where are we? 
Are we close at Open Ocean? 
Uh, yes. I think-- Well, I don't know. But I saw that other sign so-- 
What? What other sign? 
The world's most powerful 
pair of glasses. 
What? What are you talking about? Why would we follow that sign? 
Well, because I remembered it. 
No. That wasn't the plan. Ow! 
All right, that's it! 
You have wasted my time! 
-Wait. No. 
-That transport truck leaves at dawn... and I'm not missing it, 
so gimme your tag. 
Wait. No, I remembered that sign. -So? 
-So, I'm remembering more... 
and more and I feel like my memory's gettin' better. I think we should-- No! Your memory is not working. You can't remember anything. 
It's probably how you lost your family in the first place! 
(GASPS) 
All right, look, let's just take it down a notch. Just give me the tag and-- You know something, for a guy 
with three hearts you're not very nice. Three hearts? What are you talking about? I don't have three hearts. -Yes, you do. 
-I don't! 
-You do! 
Page 34/67
-Don't! 
-Do! 
-Stop saying that! 
Fun fact: 
Two pump blood to the gills 
while the third pumps... 
-blood throughout the body. 
-Wait! 
Whoa! (SCREAMING) 
You know, some with three hearts shouldn't be so mean. 
And it's mean to say that 
I would lose someone I love! 
I did not lose them! Hank? 
Hank? Hank? 
-Han-s 
-No. Not Hans. I'm looking for Hank. -Han-s 
-Hank. With a "k." Hank.

What's the plan? 
The plan is I'm gonna stay here forever. Okay. Good plan. 
(SCREAMING) 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hank. I'm sorry. I can't remember right. (GASPS) -Sweetie. Sweetie. 
-Oh, watch out, kelpcake. 
Oh, watch where you're going. 
I'm sorry, Daddy. 
I'm sorry I can't remember right. Oh, sweetie. 
Sweetie, you don't need to be sorry. You know what you need to do? 
Just keep swimming. 
Yeah. 
And I bet you can remember 
that because we're just-- 
Um... 
We're gonna sing a song about it. Just keep swimming 
Swimming, swimming 
We swim 
We swim 
(LAUGHS) 
(LAUGHING) 
(GASPS) My parents 
taught me that song! 
We sang it as a family. 
All this time I thought I made it up! -What song? 
-Just keep swimming. 
Hank, we've just gotta keep swimming. What? No way! Listen to me, 
Page 36/67
it's too dangerous to move. 
No, you listen to me. I know 
you're scared, but you can't give up. Follow me. 
Just keep swimming

(BOTH SCREAM) 
Sing with me, Hank. Come on.

Huh. I did. 
I got us out us there. 
I mean, technically 
you also got us in there. 
But if you hadn't, I'm not sure we would've gotten here.

SIGOURNEY ON SPEAKER: 
Welcome to the Open Ocean. 
Home. 
MARLIN: 
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo. 
Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo! Dad, stop. She's not coming back. She might. Ooo-roo, ooo-roo! 
Dad, you made her feel like 
she couldn't do it! 
You're not talkin' about Becky, are you? (SIGHS) 
I miss Dory. 
Me too. 
(GRUNTING) 
(SIGHS) 
The truth is, 
I'm just so worried about her. 
She's the one who should be worried about us. 
Well, she would definitely have an idea of what to do if she were here. I don't know how she does that. I don't think she knows, Dad. 
She just does. 
Well, then we'll just have to think. -What would Dory do? 
-What would Dory do? 
Yeah! What would Dory do? 
She would assess her situation, and then she'd evaluate... 
then she would analyze her options-- Dad, that's "what would Marlin do." Right, that's what I would do. 
She wouldn't even think twice. 
She would just look at the first thing she sees and-- 
-(GASPS) 
Page 38/67
-(CHILDREN LAUGHING) 
(SIGHS) 
Dory would do it. 
Mmm. 
-Nemo, hold on to me.

-Yeah! What would Dory do now? 
Who's Dory? 
Oh, boy. Are we happy to see you? Happy to see me? I'm happy to see you! I haven't had anyone to talk to in years! Years? Wow. 
Unfortunately, we can't stay long. We have to go because-- 
Now why would you wanna go? 
You just landed! 
Stay a while. Tell me all about yourself. I would love to, but my son and I have to get to quarantine, so-- -Wonderful thing to have a son. -Yeah, it is. 
'Course I don't have a family. 
I dated a nice scallop for a while. -That's fascinating, but-- 
-But scallops have eyes. 
And she was looking for something different. I'm kidding! 
Well, not about scallops having eyes. They do. 
And they see into your soul 
and they break your heart. 
Oh, Shelley! Why?! Why?! 
Now what would Dory do? 
SIGOURNEY ON SPEAKER:

are back in quarantine? 
They're being shipped to Cleveland? But I just got here! 
I've gotta get to them. 
They don't know I'm here. 
Don't worry,

Oh. Oh, I can't do that. 
-Why not? 
-I'll forget what I'm goin'. 
And I can't be anywhere

(BOTH CRYING) 
-You're okay! 
-You found me! How did you find me? There was a crazy clam! 
He wouldn't stop talking! 
We just slowly backed away from him and into these pipes, 
and then we just started looking! 
DESTINY: 
Okay, what was that? 
Hang on, I gotta take this. 
It's okay! Sorry for what? 
What? You're okay? 
-Yes! 
-DORY: 
(LAUGHS) 
Dad, did you hear that? 
Dory really does speak whale! 
I heard. 
It's bringing some very bad 
memories so let's get outta here. I say we got this way. 
Follow me. It's time to head home! Wait, wait, wait! Um... 
My parents are here. 
-They are? 
-You found your parents? 
Well, not exactly. No. I mean not yet, but, um, I know where they are. 
I don't know exactly how to get there, but I don't that-- I'm getting help-- 
-DESTINY: 
-Quarantine. 
That's it! Oh, and I met 
this septopus, super cranky... 
but secretly kinda sweet, and he got me into the exhibit... The exhibit. Dory? 
Do you think my parents will wanna see me? What? Why wouldn't they wanna see you? Because... I lost them? 
Page 46/67
Dory, your parents are gonna be 
overjoyed to see you. 
They're gonna have missed... 
everything about you. 
-Really? 
-Do you know how we found you? 
-Something about a clam? Or... 
-No. 
-No, an oyster. 
-No. 
-Mollusk? 
-No. 
-Something? 
-No. 
-I don't... No? 
-No clam. 
We were having a very hard time 
until Nemo thought... 
"What would Dory do?" 
Why would you say that? 
Because ever since I've met you, 
you've shown me show to do stuff I never dreamed of doing. Crazy things! 
Outsmarting sharks 
and jumping jellyfish. 
And finding my son. 
You made all that happen. 
Really? I didn't know thought that. 
Unless I forgot. 
No, you didn't forget. I never told ya. 
And I'm sorry about that. 
But Dory, because of who you are, 
you are about to find your parents. 
And when you do that... you'll... you'll be home. Dad... 
Does this mean we have to say goodbye to Dory? Yes, Nemo. We do.

-Uh-huh? 
-Come on, come on, come on. 
And so they came here to look for you. They're here! (GASPS) Where are they? Dory, that was years ago. 
-Huh? 
-They never came back. 
Oh, no. 
You see, Dory, when fish

What was I forgetting? Something. Something important. What was it? I-- What was it? It's goin' away. 
It's goin' away. It's going 'cause all I can do is forget. I just forget. And I forget. 
That's what I do best. That's what I do. What do I do? What do I do? 
What do I do? What do I do? 
(GASPS) 
What would Dory do? 
I would look around. 
And, um, there's just water over there. And a lotta kelp over here. 
Kelp is better. Okay. 
(PANTING) 
Okay. Now what? Lots of kelp. 
It looks the same. 
It all looks the same, 
except there's a rock... over there. And some sand this way. 
I like sand. Sand is squishy. 
(PANTING) 
Oh, this isn't going anywhere. 
There's nothing here. 
Nothin' but kelp. Lots of kelp. Page 51/67

Right here, kelpcake. 
(CRYING) I'm so sorry. 
Oh, honey. Oh, honey, no. Kelpcake. I know I've got a problem. I know I'm-- And I'm so sorry. 
And all this time I've wanted to fix it and I can't, and I try. I try. But my thoughts... they leave my head and ideas change. 
And I'd forgotten you and I'm so sorry. Dory. Don't you dare be sorry. Look what you did! 
-(SNIFFLES) What? 
-You found us! 
That's right! You found us! 
Honey, why do you think 
we stayed put here all these years? Because we believed one day 
you'd find us again. 
Exactly! 
But I thought you were gone. 
How did you--? 
We went into quarantine 
to look for you, but you weren't there. And we knew you must've 
Page 52/67
gotten out through the pipes. 
Through the pipes. That's right, sweetie. And so we did, too. 
And we've stayed in this spot for ya ever since. 
-We thought you might come back. -We stayed and waited for you. 
So every day, we go out and lay out... Shells. 
And you found out. 
Oh, honey, you found us. 
And you know why you found us? 
Because you remembered. 
You remembered 
in your own, amazing, Dory way. (SNIFFLES) 
I did. All by myself. 
Oh, honey. Really? Have you been by yourself all these years? 
Oh, my poor little girl. 
Oh, I haven't been all by myself-- (GASPS) Marlin and Nemo! 
-Nobody saw where Dory went?

NEMO: 
Oh, thank goodness. See, Nemo, 
I knew she'd find a way-- What? Hey, where's Dory? Is she with you? (GASPS) I'm sorry. 
I tried to hold on, 
but I couldn't, and I lost her. -What? 
-WOMAN: 
No!

DORY:

JENNY: 
CHARLIE:

DORY: 
I even know how to speak whale... but you know what, he always kinda trusts me anyway. 
You know, I like this Marlin already. Yeah. And then somehow 
we found Nemo. Or did he find me? I don't know. But you know what, Nemo is the sweetest. 
He just never gives up on me 
no matter what. 
Um, what would Dory do? 
Well, we'll certainly have to thank Marlin and Nemo when we meet them. (GRUNTS) 
Wait. Wait, I know this place. 
SIGOURNEY ON SPEAKER:

(GASPS) A truck. They're in the truck! That mean I could-- 
Never see them again!

All I know is that miss them. I-- I... I really miss them. 
I've said that before. 
Page 54/67
Um... 
Dory? 
Mom, Marlin and Nemo are more

By Chris Weitz 
Page 1/56
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.... 
Opens on a shot of a planet which pans up to a view of planetary rings with a small ship flying through them. Switches to a shot of the planet Lah’mu and the ship flying through the rings. A shot of the planet closer up with the ship flying towards the surface. The ship flies down across a farm and passes by a white worker droid, who watches the ship. Cuts to a young Jyn Erso running across the rocky plain with the ship following behind her. INT. ERSO HOMESTEAD (Inside the Erso homestead) 
YOUNG JYN ERSO: 
LYRA ERSO: 
The ship lands near the Erso homestead. Lyra contacts Saw Gerrera. SAW GERRERA:

LYRA ERSO: 
Lyra takes off a pendant and hands it over to her daughter, fastening it around her neck. 
In front of the Erso home stands Director Orson Krennic flanked by Deathtroopers. Galen confronts Krennic. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: You’re a hard man to find, Galen. But farming? Really, a man of your talents? 
GALEN ERSO: 
Page 2/56
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: It’s lonely, I imagine. 
GALEN ERSO: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Oh. Oh. My condolences. Search the house! DEATHTROOPER: 
GALEN ERSO: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: The work has stalled, I need you to come back. 
GALEN ERSO: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: We’re on the verge of greatness. We were this close to providing peace, security for the galaxy. 
GALEN ERSO: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Do I, huh? You have to start somewhere. 
GALEN ERSO: 
was. I have trouble remembering, even simple things. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Galen, you’re an inspired scientist but you’re a terrible liar. Now I admire the effort, I really do. 
Lyra emerges from the grass, holding a blaster. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Oh look, here’s Lyra back from the dead. It’s a miracle. 
Lyra aims her blaster at Krennic. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Stop! 
Deathtroopers aim their weapons at Lyra as she approaches. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Oh, Lyra. Troublesome as ever. 
LYRA ERSO: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: No, of course I’m not. I’m taking you all. You’ll all come. You, your child, You’ll all live in comfort. 
LYRA ERSO: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: As ‘heroes of the Empire.’ 
GALEN ERSO:

DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: They have a child. Find it! 
Deathtroopers march off to find Jyn. One of them picks up a stormtrooper toy that she had dropped. Jyn hides in a cave and climbs into a secret hatch. Deathtroopers walk by but don't see the hatch and leave. Later, the hatch is opened. Jyn sees the face of Saw Gerrera peering down at her. 
SAW GERRERA: 
Theme song plays as the camera slowly reveals the title. 
ROGUE ONE: 
Jyn wakes up in an Imperial prison cell. Her cellmate snores loudly on the bunk opposite. She wipes her face with a cloth and stares through the bars. 
STORMTROOPER: 
A stormtrooper walks past, checking on the cell. Cuts to a large asteroid with a trading outpost built on top of it. 
RING OF KAFRENE: 
A busy street is full of people and aliens. Cassian Andor pushes through the crowd and then ducks into an alleyway where he meets Tivik, an informant.

INT. TRANSPORT (Inside a transport) 
Jyn, in restraints, is sitting amongst other prisoners in a transport guarded by stormtroopers. The transport suddenly stops. 
STORMTROOPER:

STORMTROOPER 1: 
The door to the transport bursts open and Rebel Alliance soldiers file in, killing the stormtroopers. 
SOLDIER: 
SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Hallik! Liana Hallik! 
SOLDIER: 
SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: You want to get out of here? 
Jyn nods as she is freed from her restraints. 
PRISONER: 
Jyn kicks the Rebel, grabbing a shovel, and hits the other soldiers out of the way before jumping out of the transport. However, at the exit she is grabbed and chokeslammed to the ground by a tall Imperial droid, K-2SO. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Congratulations.You are being rescued. Please do not

YAVIN 4: 
The camera shifts from the gas giant Yavin to its small satellite Yavin 4. 
PA: 
INT. MASSASSII REBEL BASE (Inside the temple) 
Jyn is led to a table where members of the Rebel council are assembled. She sits down, uncomfortable. 
GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: You’re currently calling yourself Liana Hallik. Is that correct? Possession of unsanctioned weapons, forgery of Imperial documents, aggravated assault,escape from custody, resisting arrest. Imagine if the Imperial authorities had found out who you really were. Jyn Erso? That’s your given name, is it not? Jyn Erso? Daughter of Galen Erso. A known Imperial collaborator in weapons development. 
JYN ERSO: 
SENATOR MON MOTHMA: It’s a chance for you to make a fresh start. Cassian Andor appears from behind a wall and approaches the meeting. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
SENATOR MON MOTHMA: This is Captain Cassian Andor, Rebel Intelligence.

GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: We’re up against the clock here, girl, so if there’s Page 7/56
nothing to talk about, we’ll just put you back where we found you. 
JYN ERSO: 
But I’ve no idea where he is. I haven’t seen him in years. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
we need is someone who gets us through the door without being killed. 
JYN ERSO: 
SENATOR MON MOTHMA: Yes, but Saw Gerrera’s an extremist. He’s been fighting on his own since he broke with the Rebellion. His militancy has caused the Alliance a great many problems. We have no choice now but to try to mend that broken trust. 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
being held by Saw Gerrera. He’s claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon with the power to destroy entire planets. The pilot says he was sent by your father. 
SENATOR MON MOTHMA: We need to stop this weapon before it is finished. GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Captain Andor’s mission is to authenticate the pilot’s story and then, if possible, find your father. 
SENATOR MON MOTHMA: It appears he is critical to the development of this superweapon. Given the gravity of the situation and your history with Saw,we’re hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the Senate for testimony. 
JYN ERSO: 
SENATOR MON MOTHMA: We’ll make sure you go free. 
EXT. MASSASSII REBEL BASE (Outside the temple) 
Jyn and Cassian approach a vessel stationed on a landing pad. General Draven calls out to Cassian from a distance. 
GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Captain Andor! 
Cassian approaches him, leaving Jyn behind. She climbs into a U-Wing sitting on the landing pad and sees the droid she's been rescued by. INT. U-WING (Inside a U-Wing) 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I’m K-2SO. I’m a reprogrammed Imperial droid. 
JYN ERSO: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I see the Council is sending you with us to Jedha. 
JYN ERSO: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: That is a bad idea. I think so, and so does Cassian. Page 8/56
What do I know? My specialty is just strategic analysis. 
Outside the ship, Draven confronts Cassian while Jyn isn't there. GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Galen Erso is vital to the Empire’s weapon program. Forget what you heard in there, there will be no extraction. You find him, you kill him. Then and there. 
INT. U-WING (Inside the U-Wing) 
Cassian climbs inside the U-Wing and looks at its passengers. CASSIAN ANDOR: 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
It’s a by-product of the reprogram. 
Jyn loads a blaster and spins it in her hands. K-2SO looks at her, alarmed. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Why does she get a blaster, and I don’t? Cassian turns around sharply. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
JYN ERSO: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I find that answer vague and unconvincing. 
JYN ERSO: 
Cassian sighs and hops into the pilot seat. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: You’re letting her keep it? Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you? It’s high. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: It’s very high. 
The U-Wing takes off and leaves Yavin 4. 
PARTISAN BASE ON JEDHA 
The camera slowly moves up to reveal Saw Gerrera, a man-machine with a respirator and a prosthetic leg. Bodhi is brought before him and he still has the sack on his head.

BODHI ROOK:

SAW GERRERA: 
Saw nods to Edrio and Bodhi visibly begins panicking, 
BODHI ROOK: 
His voice is muffled and confused as the sack is pulled over his head again and he is dragged away. 
STAR DESTROYER "EXECUTRIX" (A Star Destroyer overlooking the construction of the Death Star) 
A TIE fighter flies towards what looks like the stars but reveals itself as an Imperial Star Destroyer. Behind the ISD, an even more massive structure emerges from the darkness - the Death Star. 
Imperial officers sit in command pits on both sides of the bridge. Director Krennic approaches Grand Moff Tarkin who is standing with his back to the camera as he watches the construction of the Death Star. Tarkin turns around to face the camera. 
GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedha, Director Krennic. After so many setbacks and delays, and now this. We’ve heard word of rumors circulating through the city. Apparently you’ve lost a rather talkative cargo pilot. If the Senate gets wind of our project, countless systems will flock to the Rebellion. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: When the battle station is finished, Governor Tarkin, the Senate will be of little concern. 
Page 10/56
GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: When has become now, Director Krennic. The Emperor will tolerate no further delay, you have made time an ally of the Rebellion. I suggest, we solve both problems simultaneously with an immediate test of the weapon. Failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: I will not fail. 
Krennic turns around and signals to his bodyguards to flank him as he leaves. Tarkin watches the superlaser being set into place, completing the Death Star. 
Inside Jyn’s dream, she sees herself as a little girl. Her father is still an Imperial officer on Coruscant. He is drinking and laughing together with a younger Krennic. She is peering into the room and her father walks over to her and picks her up, placing her in bed. There are blurred visions of her mother, Lyra. 
GALEN ERSO:

Jyn wakes up inside the U-Wing and blinks as Cassian speaks up. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
The U-Wing lands in front of a view of the Holy City of Jedha with a Star Destroyer hovering in the sky just above it. Multiple smaller shuttles and TIE fighters are going back and forth between the destroyer and the city. The two rebels and the droid disembark and get on the ground to look at the city through binoculars.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I’m surprised you’re so concerned with my safety. Jyn walks past him, slamming a bag into his hands as she walks by. 
JYN ERSO: 
K-2SO drops the bag on the ground as they leave. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Doesn’t sound so bad to me. 
INT. PARTISAN BASE (In the Partisan base.) 
Bodhi is strapped to a chair. A strange bloblike alien with long tentacles emerges from the darkness. Bodhi shivers and tries moving back, but fails. He watches in horror as the alien approaches. 
SAW GERRERA: 
have you really brought me, cargo pilot? Bor Gullet will know the truth. The unfortunate side effect, is that one tends to lose one’s mind. Bor Gullet’s tentacles begin to wrap around Bodhi and stroke his head, reaching into his thoughts. 
BODHI ROOK: 
(In the Holy City of Jedha) 
Cassian and Jyn walk through a crowd in a narrow street. Jyn accidentally bumps into Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba, who turn to them, annoyed. DR. CORNELIUS EVAZAN: Hey, you just watch yourself. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Come on. Come on. 
A squad of stormtroopers is seen distributing holopads with the face of Bodhi Rook on them and questioning citizens. 
STORMTROOPER:

She notices Chirrut Imwe, blind and dressed in monk-like robes, sitting beside the street.

Cassian and Jyn push quickly throught the crowd when they notice a heavily guarded Imperial transport move along the street. Jyn looks up to see armed people waiting on the roofs and several more hiding in the pathways next to the main street. She looks at Cassian nervously. 
STORMTROOPER 1: 
A partisan throws a thermal detonator underneath the tank accompanying the transport. The tank explodes and Partisans begin fighting the stormtroopers. Chaos begins as people run away and firing begins. Jyn and Cassian hide behind a wall, blasters ready.

CASSIAN ANDOR: 
They are surprised by an Imperial droid that looks exactly like K-2SO. Jyn shoots it and it falls to the ground. K-2SO walks out from behind it. K-2SO looks startled. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Did you know that wasn’t me? 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: You did, but I thought it was boring, and you were in trouble. There are a lot of explosions for two people blending in. A grenade sails towards K-2SO, but he catches it without looking and throws it backwards towards a group of stormtroopers. 
STORMTROOPER: 
The grenade explodes, killing the entire squad of stormtroopers. Jyn and Cassian exchange looks. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: You’re right, I should just wait on the ship. Cassian, Jyn and K-2SO walk into a clearing with multiple stormtroopers. 
STORMTROOPER: 
STORMTROOPER: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: These are prisoners. 
STORMTROOPER: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I am taking them... to imprison them. In prison. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO slaps Cassian. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Quiet! And there’s a fresh one if you mouth off again! 
STORMTROOPER: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: That’s okay. If you could just point me in the right direction, I can take them, I’m sure. I’ve taken them this far… The stormtroopers grab Jyn and Cassian and cuff them to take them away. The two struggle to break free. 
CASSIAN ANDOR:

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Wait! 
STORMTROOPER:

Chirrut emerges from a doorway, drawing the attention of stormtroopers, and walks towards them, tapping his staff on the ground.

CHIRRUT ÎMWE: 
Chirrut knocks down the last stormtrooper, but many more surround him. Suddenly, rapid blaster fire kills all the stormtroopers. It has come from Chirrut’s friend, Baze Malbus.

BAZE MALBUS: 
Cassian, Jyn and K-2SO emerge from a hiding spot.

chance to save the Alliance. Perhaps there’s a chance to explain myself and, though I don’t dare hope for too much, a chance for Jyn, if she’s alive, if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately I’ve missed her. Jyn, my Stardust, I can’t imagine what you think of me. When I was taken, I faced some bitter truths. I was told that, soon enough, Krennic would have you as well. As time went by, I knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you. I knew if I refused to work, if I took my own life, it would only be a matter of time before Krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project. So I did the one thing that nobody expected: I lied. I learned to lie. I played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work. I made myself indispensable, and all the while I laid the groundwork of my revenge. We call it the Death Star. There is no better name. And the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed. I’ve placed a weakness deep within the system. A flaw so small and powerful, they’ll never find it. But, Jyn. Jyn, if you’re listening My beloved, so much of my life has been wasted. I try to think of you only in the moments when I’m strong, because the pain of not having you with me Your mother. Our family. The pain of that loss is so overwhelming I risk failing even now. It’s just so hard not to think of you. Think of where you are. My Stardust. Saw, the reactor module, that’s the key. That’s the place I’ve laid my trap. It’s well hidden and unstable, one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station.

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I haven’t completed my calculations. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Cassian grabs the hyperdrive lever and pulls it sharply. The U-Wing shifts into hyperspace and zips away from Jedha seconds before the rubble from the shockwave destroys the mountain. 
INT. DEATH STAR (On the Death Star) 
The officers talk quietly amongst themselves. Krennic walks by Tarkin, intentionally shoving him in the shoulder. 
Page 23/56
GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I believe I owe you an apology, Director Krennic. Your work exceeds all expectations. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: And you’ll tell the Emperor as much? GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: That was only an inkling of its destructive potential. 
GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I will tell him that I will be taking control over the weapon I first spoke of years ago, effective immediately. Krennic's face turns into a grimace. He starts yelling at Tarkin. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: We stand here amid my achievement, not yours! GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I’m afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: The breaches have been filled, Jedha has been silenced. 
GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: You think this pilot acted alone? He was dispatched from the installation on Eadu. Galen Erso’s facility. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: We’ll see about this. 
Krennic walks off angrily, flanked by his death troopers. Tarkin turns away and pulls a smile. 
INT. MASSASSII REBEL BASE (In the Rebel base on Yavin 4) 
Rebel communication experts sit at a control panel when one of them receives a message. He turns to General Draven. 
REBEL: 
Jedha destroyed. Mission target located on Eadu. Please advise. GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Destroyed? Proceed. Tell him my orders still stand. Tell him to proceed with haste and keep to the plan. We have no idea what he is building for the Empire. We have to kill Galen Erso while we have the chance. 
INT. U-WING (In hyperspace, in the U-Wing.) 
The group sits solemnly in the U-Wing. 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE:

JYN ERSO: 
They have to go to Scarif to get the plans. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Imperial territory. 
JYN ERSO:

INT. DEATH STAR (On the Death Star) 
Krennic stands next to Pterro, visibly nervous. 
CAPTAIN DUNSTIG PTERRO: Course set for Eadu, sir. 
EADU: 
The U-Wing flies carefully through the rainy, dark canyons of Eadu. Cassian and K-2SO pilot the ship, dodging constantly to avoid crashing. 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: 20 degrees to the right. 10 degrees up. 
BODHI ROOK: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Are you sure this is the way? 
BODHI ROOK: 
You’ve got to stay in the canyon, keep it low. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
The U-Wing manoeuvres carefully between the canyons, barely avoiding a collision with a cliff. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: There’s a 26% chance of failure. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
BODHI ROOK: 
way, but we’re close, we’re close. I know that. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well, now there’s a 35% chance of failure. Page 26/56
BODHI ROOK: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I understand. 
BODHI ROOK: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: The wind... 
BODHI ROOK: 
depot. Watch out! 
The U-Wing hits its engine on a rock and the ship begins to fall. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Hey! 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
The U-Wing lands roughly in a dark canyon. A ridge separates them from the bright lights of the Imperial facility. 
INT. MASSASSII REBEL BASE (On Yavin 4) 
Draven and a rebel try to contact Cassian, but there's no signal. Draven slaps his hand on the table impatiently. 
GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Try them again. 
REBEL: 
GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Squadron up, target Eadu. 
EADU (On Eadu) 
The group is trying to fix the U-WIng and get it back in the air, but nothing seems to work. 
BODHI ROOK: 
CASSIAN ANDOR:

the ridge and check it out. 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
the messenger. 
JYN ERSO: 
knows it. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: One blast to the reactor module and the whole system goes down. That’s how you said it. The whole system goes down. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
now is get a handle on what we’re up against.So, we’re going to go very small and very carefully up the rise and see what’s what. Let’s get out of here. 
Cassian pulls up his hood and disappears in the rain. 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE: 
BAZE MALBUS: 
JYN ERSO: 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE: 
JYN ERSO:

CHIRRUT ÎMWE:

K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: His weapon was in the sniper configuration. Jyn goes pale and dashes off into the rain. 
EXT. ROCKY RIDGE (On a rocky ridge.) 
BODHI ROOK: 
down there. This way. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
The two go over the ridge overlooking the Imperial facility and Cassian looks for a good spot. 
INT. U-WING (In the crashed U-Wing.) 
Chirrut is about to climb out of the craft when Baze stops him. Page 28/56
BAZE MALBUS: 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE: 
BAZE MALBUS: 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: What are they doing? If Cassian comes back, we’re leaving without them. 
EXT. IMPERIAL RESEARCH FACILITY - RIDGE OVERLOOK (On a ridge overlooking the Imperial Research Facility.) 
Cassian and Bodhi finally settle on the ridge and look at the facility through binoculars. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Switches to Baze and Chirrut climbing the rocks somewhere in the area. BAZE MALBUS: 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE: 
Bodhi spots 
BODHI ROOK: 
A shuttle zooms overhead, showering water over the two. They duck to avoid being caught in its headlights.

EXT. IMPERIAL RESEARCH FACILITY - LANDING PLATFORM (On the landing platform in front of the research facility.) 
Krennic’s shuttle lands and he walks out, flanked by deathtroopers, heading towards a group of stormtroopers and engineers. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Excellent news, Galen. The battle station is complete. You must be very proud. 
GALEN ERSO: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Gather your engineers, I have an announcement. Page 29/56
Switches to a shot of Jyn running across the ridge to the giant staircase that goes up to the facility. Back on top, a group of engineers steps forward nervously. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Is that all of them? 
GALEN ERSO: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Gentlemen. One of you betrayed the Empire. One of you has conspired with a pilot to send messages to the Rebellion. And I urge that traitor step forward. 
The engineers whisper and murmur amongst themselves. Krennic waits. Seeing that no one replies, he gestures to his troopers. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Very well, I’ll consider it a group effort, then. Ready! 
The deathtroopers raise their blasters. 
ENGINEER 1: 
ENGINEER 2: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Aim... and... 
The troopers stand with their rifles aimed. 
ENGINEER: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Fire! 
Just before the shooting begins, Galen jumps in front of his engineers to stop him. Cassian watches through the scope, aiming at Galen's head, but doesn't shoot. 
GALEN ERSO: 
have nothing to do with it. Spare them. 
Krennic pauses, looking at him, then turns to his troopers. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Fire! 
The engineers scream and fall under the fire. Krennic slaps Galen across the face and he falls to the ground. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: How do I know the weapon is complete? 
GALEN ERSO: 
Jyn climbs the onto the platform using the ladder and throws a stormtrooper down into the abyss. Cassian watches the scene through his scope and notices her when K-2SO comes in over the comlink. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Cassian. Cassian, can you hear me? 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Affirmative yes, although we have a problem! There’s an Alliance squadron approaching. 
Page 30/56
Switches to a shot of the canyon, then pans to show an X-WIng squadron approaching the facility. 
REBEL PILOT: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
platform! 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Jedha. Saw Gerrera. His band of fanatics. Their Holy City. The last reminder of the Jedi. Gone. 
GALEN ERSO: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Now where have I heard that before? K-2SO attempts to reach the rebel base to delay the attack. On Yavin 4, a rebel comms expert calls General Draven to come over. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Relay from Captain Andor. 
REBEL: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Captain Andor requesting a delay on squadron support. Alliance forces onsite. Please confirm. 
GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: Get the squadron leader on, get him on now! REBEL: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
The rebel squadron begins shooting at the platform and there are several explosions. Baze stares at the attack in horror. On the platform, Krennic and his troops take cover. Jyn sneaks by, unnoticed, and hides behind a container. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Return fire! To your stations! Get our fighters in the air now! 
In the chaos, Galen gets up and Jyn runs out towards him. 
JYN ERSO: 
Krennic and Galen hear her at the same time and turn around. Krennic pulls out his blaster but before he can shoot, an explosion rocks the platform, knocking all three to the ground. TIE fighters burst out of hangars and engage the X-Wings. There are instantly several casualties on both sides. A few Imperial gunners are seen in an ion cannon as they shoot down a rebel craft. 
STORMTROOPER 1: 
STORMTROOPER 2: 
Captain Pterro runs up to Krennic and helps him up. They begin hurrying to Page 31/56
the shuttle, guarded by death troopers. Switches to Chirrut Îmwe, who breathes in his hand, then pulls a bow off his shoulder, aims and fires blindly at a TIE fighter, shooting it down and directing the falling fighter at the ion cannon, which explodes in flames. 
CAPTAIN DUNSTIG PTERRO: Director, we need to evacuate. 
Jyn gets up slowly and runs across the burning platform to her father, who has been wounded in the explosion. She kneels by his side, but Krennic's shuttle takes off and pours water all over her. She loses her balance and slides across the platform, almost falling into a hole made by the explosions. She crawls back up and runs to her father, kneeling by his side. 
JYN ERSO:

Stormtroopers emerge from the facility and are about to begin shooting. 
STORMTROOPER: 
Cassian's shots take the troopers down and he runs over to Jyn to take her away. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Come on. 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
More stormtroopers appear and the pair ducks into cover as the Page 32/56
stormtroopers are mowed down by Baze. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Cassian and Jyn make their way to the stolen Imperial cargo shuttle that hovers in the air, taking down the stormtroopers chasing them. In the cabin, K-2SO and Bodhi pilot the shuttle. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well done. You’re a Rebel now. 
All the rebels get into the shuttle and Bodhi helps them up the ramp. 
BODHI ROOK: 
get out of here. Move, move, move. Okay, K-2, let’s go. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Copy that. 
The shuttles takes off as the Imperial facility bursts into flames in the background. It shakes violently in the storm raging over Eadu. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Understood. 
Jyn walks over to Cassian inside the shuttle and confronts him. JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
I’ve seen it before. 
JYN ERSO:

CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Did I? 
JYN ERSO:

Page 33/56
wouldn’t understand that. 
JYN ERSO:

CASSIAN ANDOR: 
deciding when and where we want to care about something. Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you? Some of us live it. I’ve been in this fight since I was 6 years old. You’re not the only one who lost everything. Some of us just decided to do something about it. 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
we’re coming in with a stolen ship. Anybody else? 
Switches to a shot of the planet Mustafar, following Krennic's shuttle that is heading to a pyramid-shaped building standing on the edge of a cliff with lava streaming down it. The shuttle lands on a landing platform and the camera switches to a blast door in front of which a hooded man stands. The door slides open and the man walks in to a dark room with Royal Guards by the door and a bacta tank in the center. The man, who is Vader's servant Vanee, kneels down in front of the tank. 
VANEE: 
The bacta fluid level drops and the camera reveals Vader's body suspended in the tank. Vanee turns away as Vader begins breathing. Switches to a grand hallway in the castle. Krennic waits anxiously as the sliding door opens and Vader walks out to meet him. 
DARTH VADER: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Lord Vader. 
DARTH VADER: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: No. Just pressed for time. There’re a great many things to attend to. 
DARTH VADER: 
explain. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: I’ve delivered the weapon the Emperor requested. I deserve an audience to make certain he understands its remarkable… potential. 
DARTH VADER: 
confirmed. A city destroyed. An Imperial facility openly attacked. Page 34/56
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: It was Governor Tarkin that suggested the test. 
DARTH VADER: 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: No, it’s... 
DARTH VADER: 
that Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Yes, my lord. 
DARTH VADER: 
Emperor that Galen Erso has not compromised this weapon in any way. Vader starts walking away. Krennic takes a small pause. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: So I’m still in command? You’ll speak to the Emperor about… 
He stops abruptly, grabs himself by the collar and falls to his knees, choking. Vader extends a hand and turns around. 
DARTH VADER: 
YAVIN 4 
The Rebellion's war council is gathered at a large table in the command centre. Rebel senators and leaders argue while pilot squads and technicians crowd around, murmuring nervously. 
SENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: We must scatter the fleet. We have no recourse but to surrender. 
BAIL ORGANA: 
we’ve worked so hard to create? 
ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
SENATOR VASP VASPAR: We joined an Alliance, not a suicide pact! 
BAIL ORGANA: 
SENATOR NOWER JEBEL: Gather our forces? General Draven’s already blown up an Imperial base! 
GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: A decision needed to be made. 
SENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: If it’s war you want, you’ll fight alone! SENATOR VASP VASPAR: If that’s the way it’s going, why have an Alliance at all? 
ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
SENATOR MON MOTHMA: Councilors, please! 
ANTOC MERRICK:

Page 35/56
SENATOR NOWER JEBEL: A Death Star, this is nonsense. 
JYN ERSO: 
would it bring him? 
GENERAL DAVITS DRAVEN: To lure our forces into a final battle. To destroy us once and for all. 
SENATOR VASP VASPAR: To risk everything, based on what? The testimony of a criminal? The dying words of her father, an Imperial scientist? SENATOR NOWER JEBEL: Don’t forget the Imperial pilot. 
JYN ERSO: 
defeat this. 
GENERAL JAN DODONNA: So you’ve told us. 
SENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: If the Empire has this kind of power, what chance do we have? 
JYN ERSO: 
Run? Hide? Plead for mercy? Scatter your forces? You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission. The time to fight is now! 
REBEL 1: 
JYN ERSO:

REBEL 1: 
REBEL 2: 
JYN ERSO: 
fleet if you have to. We need to capture the Death Star plans if there is any hope of destroying it. 
SENATOR TYNNRA PAMLO: You’re asking us to invade an Imperial installation based on nothing but hope? 
Jyn's voice trembles and she looks like she's about to shed a tear. 
JYN ERSO: 
SENATOR VASP VASPAR: There is no hope! 
ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
SENATOR NOWER JEBEL: I say the Rebellion is finished! 
SENATOR MON MOTHMA: I’m sorry, Jyn. Without the full support of the council, the odds are too great. 
Page 36/56
The councilors whisper inaudibly. Bail Organa looks defeated. Jyn pushes through the crowd and leaves, followed by glances. After a momentary pause, Bodhi rushes after her. The meeting scatters, murmuring in disapproval. In the main hangar, Jyn makes her way to Baze and Chirrut, looking angry.

JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
of us... ... most of us, we’ve done terrible things on behalf of the Rebellion. We’re spies. Saboteurs. Assassins. Everything I did, I did for the Rebellion. And every time I walked away from something I wanted to forget I told myself it was for a cause that I believed in. A cause that was worth it. Without that, we’re lost. Everything we’ve done would have been for nothing. I couldn’t face myself if I gave up now. None of us could. It won’t be comfortable. 
BODHI ROOK: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Go, go, go! 
The rebels scatter to gather weapons and supplies. Jyn stands still with a Page 37/56
weak smile on her face. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Jyn. I’ll be there for you. 
She smiles at him. K-2SO looks as displeased as a droid can be. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Cassian said I had to. 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Jyn and Cassian return to the Imperial shuttle they had arrived on. 
DISTANT PA: 
mission report. 
Once they're inside, the assembled rebel screw stands up to greet them 
JYN ERSO: 
There are several cheers and small applause from the team. The shuttle door closes. 
FLIGHT CONTROLLER: Cargo shuttle, read back, please. What’s going on out there? That ship’s off limits. No one is suppose to be on board until farther instructions. 
Jyn sits next to Bodhi, concerned and nudging him to talk to the controller. 
BODHI ROOK: 
FLIGHT CONTROLLER: That’s an impounded Imperial ship. What’s your call sign, pilot? 
BODHI ROOK: 
Jyn looks up at him and mouths,

CAPTAIN RAYMUS ANTILLES: Senator. 
The shuttle sails through hyperspace with engines whooshing loudly. It jumps out of hyperspace and the camera pans to follow it across the surface of the large tropical planet of Scarif. A blockade of two Star Destroyers and a defensive shield hangs above the surface. 
BODHI ROOK:

He contacts the shield gate via comms. 
BODHI ROOK:

Flight Station. Transmitting clearance code now. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Transmitting. 
There is a tense silence as they wait for clearance. Jyn pulls out the necklace her mother gave her, smiles and closes her eyes. Cassian climbs up the ladder and looks anxiously at Bodhi. 
SHIELD GATE OFFICER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608? You are cleared for entry. Bodhi immediately lets out a relieved cry. 
BODHI ROOK: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Impressive. 
JYN ERSO: 
BODHI ROOK: 
She goes down the ladder as Bodhi pilots the shuttle through the shield gate. There is an announcement of a tractor beam test in the background as they descend. 
FLIGHT CONTROLLER: SW-0608 clear for landing pad 9. Acknowledge, please. 
BODHI ROOK: 
The shuttle gets closer to the surface and a tall pyramidal tower with a dish at the top comes into view.

Downstairs, Jyn notices the rebels silently sitting in the hold of the shuttle, all looking tense and worried. She catches Baze's eye as Cassian climbs down to make an announcement. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Jyn gets up, swallows, and starts speaking to lift the morale. As she begins, rebels lift their heads to listen. 
JYN ERSO: 
Page 40/56
and nothing left to lose can take the day. They have no idea we’re coming. They have no reason to expect us. If we can make it to the ground, we’ll take the next chance. And the next. On and on until we win... or the chances are spent. The Death Star plans are down there. Cassian, K2, and I will find them. We’ll find a way to find them. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
move east and get wide of the ship. Find a position between here and the tower. Once you get to the best spot, light the place up. Make ten men feel like a hundred. 
BAZE MALBUS: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
BODHI ROOK: 
CASSIAN ANDOR:

The shuttle finally lands on LP 9 and an inspection team of an officer, flight controller and two stormtroopers walks out to meet them. LANDING PAD OFFICER: Cargo shuttle SW-0608, be prepared to receive inspection team. 
JYN ERSO: 
Bodhi opens the door to the shuttle and the inspection team sees nothing but an empty cargo hold. 
LANDING PAD OFFICER: Hello. 
BODHI ROOK: 
LANDING PAD OFFICER: That would be helpful. 
BODHI ROOK: 
Bodhi smiles and points to the ladder leading downstairs. At the same time, Krennic's shuttle emerges from hyperspace and descends into the shield gate. Krennic is on board with his bodyguards. 
PILOT: 
General Ramda has been informed of your arrival. 
On Scarif, two rebels are seen dragging the body of a stormtrooper into the shuttle. Jyn and Cassian are putting on their disguise uniforms. Once they're done, Jyn walks out to say goodbye to the crew. She holds Chirrut's hands and he smiles. Baze puts a gentle hand on her shoulder. 
Page 41/56
BAZE MALBUS: 
They both smile softly. Cuts to Bodhi watching a few Imperials outside the shuttle. Once they turn away, he yells downstairs to the rebel crew. 
BODHI ROOK: 
SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: All right, let’s go! Come on. Move, move, move! The rebels open a hatch at the bottom of the shuttle and jump onto the ground, scattering in their assigned positions. In turn, Jyn and Cassian in Imperial disguise and K-2SO walk out of the shuttle and head towards the elevator that will take them to the facility. As the rebels disappear into the tropical forest, K-2SO, Jyn and Cassian walk into the elevator and watch the doors close. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: I have a bad feeling about… 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
JYN ERSO: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: What? 
The doors close, cutting them off. The elevator slides towards the tower at the same time as Krennic's shuttle lands right next to it. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well, I’m sure there’s one just lying about. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
The elevator door opens and they walk out into a hallway of the facility, full of Imperial officers and stormtroopers. On their way they pass a droid identical to K-2SO and exchange glances when he walks by. Meanwhile, the rebel assault team is giving out thermal detonators as they watch an Imperial hangar in the distance. 
SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: One per pad. Pick your spot. We want to draw them out. I’ll call the timing. Go! 
Stormtroopers walk across the hangar, chatting peacefully. STORMTROOPER 1: 
STORMTROOPER 2: 
STORMTROOPER 1: 
STORMTROOPER 2: 
They don't even have time to react when Chirrut jumps out of the bushes and knocks them out with his staff, then disappears just as quickly. The rebel forces run by, unnoticed. Another stormtrooper hears someone coughing 
Page 42/56
behind him and turns around to see Baze just before he is dropped to the ground. Rebels plant their detonators on the landing pads and scatter. 
STORMTROOPER 1: 
STORMTROOPER 2: 
The stormtrooper is electrocuted to the neck by Baze. Cuts to Krennic walking across the command centre of the tower followed by General Ramda. GENERAL SOTORUS RAMDA: Director, what brings you to Scarif? DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Galen Erso, I want every dispatch, every transmission he has ever sent called up for inspection. 
GENERAL SOTORUS RAMDA: All of them? 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Yes. All of them. Get started. 
In the hallways of the facility, Jyn, Cassian and K-2SO are hiding in a small nook while K-2SO hacks into the Imperial droid they had noticed before. Both the droids' eyes start blinking. Cuts to the rebel group taking positions in front of the elevator entrance. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Our optimal route to the data vault places only 89 stormtroopers in our path. We will make it no more than 33% of the way before we are killed. 
Jyn looks up at Cassian, worried. He pulls out a comlink and contacts Melshi. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Ready, ready. Standing by. 
Cassian looks at Jyn and she nods from behind her helmet. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
The rebels set off their detonators and a chain reaction of explosions goes off. Stormtroopers walking by are killed instantly. Krennic, standing in the command centre, overhears the blasts and looks out the window. The officers gather around to look. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Are we blind?! Deploy the garrison! Move! Krennic swallows nervously. Cuts to Jyn, Cassian and K-2 walk across a corridor when a battallion of stormtroopers runs past them and they move aside, realising the distraction worked. Inside the Rogue One shuttle, rebels spot the stormtroopers. 
CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: Troopers! Troopers! Troopers on the left. Get in! Get in! 
The rebels hide in the depths of the shuttle and stay hidden. The ones in cover emerge from behind the containers and start shooting the stormtroopers.

Int. DEATH STAR - Control Room 
Grand Moff Tarkin stands in front of the large screen when General Romodi walks up. 
GENERAL HURST ROMODI: Sir? Scarif base, they’re reporting a rebel incursion. 
GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: I want to speak to Director Krennic. GENERAL HURST ROMODI: He’s there, sir. On Scarif. 
GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: The original plans for this station are kept there, are they not? 
GENERAL HURST ROMODI: They are. 
GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: Prepare for the jump to hyperspace and inform Lord Vader. 
Tarkin pulls a smirk. 
Back in the facility, the trio walks into a room where an officer is at a control panel next to the archives entrance. 
OFFICER: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: That won’t be necessary. 
K-2SO slams the officer on the head and takes control of the panel. On Yavin 4, a rebel private runs across the whole HQ to reach Mon Mothma, Merrick and Draven, yelling. 
REBEL: 
Merrick grabs the soldier and stops him from reaching Mon. GENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Stop right there, Private! 
SENATOR MON MOTHMA: Let him speak. 
REBEL: 
SENATOR MON MOTHMA: I need to speak to Admiral Raddus. 
REBEL: 
Back on Scarif, the rebels are engaging Imperial forces in a fierce battle. It is unclear who's winning. A rebel screams as he gets shot. 
REBEL: 
On Yavin 4, rebel crews are hurrying to their ships as an announcement rings across the PA. R2D2 and C3PO watch from the shadows of the hangar. 
PA: 
immediately. Attention all flight personnel, please report to your commanders immediately. We have been redirected to Scarif. Pilots, you’ll be briefed by your squadron leaders on route. May the Force be with you. C-3PO [SEE-THREEPIO]: Scarif? They’re going to Scarif? Why does nobody ever tell me anything, Artoo? 
Page 44/56
R2-D2 [ARTOO-DETOO]: [beeps] 
Melshi and his crew are still engaged in the battle. 
Move, move, move! 
SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Forward! Forward! 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE: 
In the control room in the tower, Imperials are panicking as they contact their landing pads. Krennic looks desperate. 
IMPERIAL 1: 
outnumbered. 
IMPERIAL 2: 
All Pads report in immediately. 
IMPERIAL 1: 
IMPERIAL 2: 
Bodhi takes the opportunity and directs the Imperials away with an announcement of his own. 
BODHI ROOK: 
Pad 2. Get on there, tell him pinned down by rebels on Pad 5. CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: This is Pad 5, we’re being overrun. Help us! 
IMPERIAL: 
Get reinforcements down to Pad 5 immediately! 
Cassian, Jyn and K-2SO are busy trying to open the archive door. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Right hand. 
Jyn grabs Cassian's hand and presses it to the scanner. Immediately the door slides open. Back on the beach, Chirrut overhears a thumping noise and feels the ground shaking. He yells at Baze to turn around and he sees a massive AT-ACT emerging from the jungle and shooting at the rebel forces. 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE:

REBEL: 
The rebels scatter, may falling under fire. At the same time the Rebel fleet emerges out of space over the defensive shield. 
ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
Squadron leaders report in. 
GENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Admiral, this is Blue Leader standing by. JON VANDER (GOLD LEADER): This is Gold Leader, standing by. GARVEN DREIS (RED LEADER): This is Red Leader, standing by. An Imperial shield crew member alerts his commander of the rebel fleet. IMPERIAL CREW MEMBER: Sir, those are rebel ships. 
IMPERIAL LIEUTENANT: Get Admiral Gorin, immediately! 
Down on Scarif, Krennic has been alerted too. 
LIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: Director, the rebel fleet, it’s amassing outside the shield. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Lock down the base. Lock down. 
LIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: And close the shield? 
LIEUTENANT ORSON KRENNIC: Do it! 
In the air, the rebels are getting into formations to attack the shield and get past the blockade. 
ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
fleet. Blue squadron, get to the surface before they closed that gate. GENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Copy, your Admiral. Blue squadron, on me. BARION RANER (BLUE FOUR): Copy, Blue Leader. 
FARNS MONSBEE (BLUE FIVE): Copy, Blue Leader. 
HEFF TOBBER (BLUE EIGHT): We won’t have long. 
Aboard the shield gate, officers are hurrying to lock down the base. An officer pushes a button and the gate slowly closes. 
SHIELD GATE OFFICER: Close the field aperture now. Close it! Rebel pilots racing towards the shield pull up in panic, but not all of them manage to. A few ships crash onto the surface of the shield and explode. 
VANGOS GREK (BLUE SIX): Come on, come on, come on! 
BARION RANER (BLUE FOUR): Pull up! 
Back on Scarif, K-2SO calls out to Jyn as he intercepts transmissions. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Rebel fleet has arrived. 
JYN ERSO: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: There’s fighting on the beach, they’ve locked down the base, they’ve closed the shield gate. 
Jyn runs over to him and Cassian. 
JYN ERSO: 
Page 46/56
Cassian gives her a grim look, and she nods solemnly. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: We could transmit the plans to the rebel fleet. We’d have to get a signal out to tell them it’s coming. It’s the size of the data files. That’s the problem.They’ll never get through. Someone has to take that shield gate down. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
out there. Bodhi! 
BODHI ROOK: 
fighting, the base is on lockdown! 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
You’ve got to tell them to blow a hole in the shield gate so we can transmit the plans. 
BODHI ROOK: 
not tied in. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Find a way! Cover our backs. 
JYN ERSO: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Your behavior, Jyn Erso, is continually unexpected. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
The AT-ACT is preparing to fire at the remaining few rebels. 
AT-AT PILOT: 
Baze loads a rocket launcher and fires at the neck of the AT-ACT, but the walker only flinches and lifts its head back up. However, it's instantly shot by an X-Wing coming out of nowhere with a few more following it. The rebels erupt in cheers. 
BAZE MALBUS: 
Inside the shuttle, Bodhi prepares to make a run for it. Another rebel stops him. 
BODHI ROOK: 
REBEL: 
BODHI ROOK: 
rebel fleet is pulling in.We just have to get a signal strong enough to get Page 47/56
through to them and let them know we’re trapped down here. For that, we have to connect to the communications tower. Now, I can patch us in over here, the landing pad but you have to get on the radio, get one of the guys out there to find a master switch. Get them to activate the connection between us and that comm tower. 
REBEL: 
BODHI ROOK: 
Raddus and his crew sit aboard the Mon Calamari cruiser bridge. ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
LIEUTENANT: 
are blocked. 
ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
start probing that shield. 
LIEUTENANT: 
The Red squadron pilots are busy shooting at the shield gate and dodging shots from cannons built on top of it. An X-Wing is hit and goes down in flames. 
GARVEN DREIS (RED LEADER): We’re going in! Stay with me. 
Jyn and Cassian are in a small control room in the archive tower, searching for the location of the plans. K-2SO is outside by the control panel. K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Schematics bank, Data tower two. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Searching. I can locate the tape, but you’ll need the handles for extraction. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
They turn around to see the vault door closing. K-2SO is surrounded by stormtroopers and tries to point them away. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Well, finally. 
STORMTROOPER: 
The trooper notices the officer on the floor. 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: The rebels! They went over there. 
Cassian speaks into the comlink, revealing himself. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Before the stormtroopers can shoot, K-2 reacts. 
Page 48/56
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: There’s one. Oh well. 
He beats up the troopers easily. Up in the sky, the bombers are preparing to attack. Just as they start the attack run, TIE fighters come in from the shield and swarm the rebel fleet. 
JON VANDER (GOLD LEADER): Red Leader, this is Gold Leader, we’re starting our attack run on the shield gate. Keep it tight and watch out for those towers. 
GOLD PILOT: 
REBEL LIEUTENANT: Sir, enemy fighters coming in. 
The TIEs zoom past the Mon Cala cruiser bridge. 
CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: Melshi. Melshi, come in, are you there? Bodhi will send a signal from here. He’s patching us in. But you guys have to open up a line for the tower. 
SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: How? Please advise. 
CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: There’s a master switch to the base of the Comm tower. 
SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: Master switch, describe, what are we looking for? CORPORAL STORDAN TONC: What does it look like? The master switch? Where is it? 
Merrick leads his Blue Squadron into attack, covering the rebels on the beach. 
GENERAL ANTOC MERRICK: Two wings, reinforce those troops on the beach. All fighters, on me. We have to shield them from air attack. 
LAREN JOMA (BLUE ELEVEN): Troop reinforcements. Here we go! A craft full of reinforcements lands and disembarks on the beach with a war cry, attacking the stormtroopers. 
REBEL MARINE: 
MARINE: 
The rebels attempting to take down the shield are having no effect on it and are still pressed by TIE fighters. 
RED PILOT: 
BLUE PILOT: 
GARVEN DREIS (RED LEADER): Stick close, Red 5, where are you going? PEDRIN GUAL (RED FIVE): I’m trying to lose them. This is Red 5, I need help! 
Red Five is caught in the scopes of a TIE pilot and goes down in flames. Up in the tower, Jyn and Cassian are going through archive after archive. 
JYN ERSO: 
Page 49/56
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Two screens down. Structural engineering, open that one! 
A stormtrooper walks in and K-2 shoots him without even looking his way. Up in the air, the battle rages on. The more advanced TIE Strikers are now chasing down the rebels. 
BLUE PILOT: 
BLUE TWO: 
Bodhi connects the cable to the radio while Jyn keeps rummaging through Engineering files. 
JYN ERSO: 
War-Mantle. Cluster-Prism. Black-Saber. 
She stops dead in her tracks. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
JYN ERSO: 
Bodhi is fiddling with wires when he is surprised by a stormtrooper aiming at him. 
STORMTROOPER: 
BODHI ROOK: 
STORMTROOPER: 
The trooper yells at his colleague but is shot down instantly by the rebels. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Stardust. 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Climb. Climb. You can still send the plans to the fleet. If they open the shield gate, you can broadcast from the tower! Locking the vault door now. 
His voice gets high-pitched and he starts closing the door hurriedly as a Page 50/56
squad of stormtroopers bursts into the room shooting at him. With his last effort he punches the vault door shut. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
K-2SO [KAY-TUESSO]: Good bye. 
K-2SO's eyes go dark. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Krennic is standing at the window nervously when news arrives. LIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: Sir, unauthorized access at the data vault. DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: What?  
LIEUTENANT MYTUS ADEMA: It’s just come in, sir. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Send my guard squadron into battle! Two men with me now! Get that beach under control! 
Cassian calls out to Bodhi via comlink. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
BODHI ROOK: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
shield’s open, we can send the plans! 
Merrick is hit by a TIE Striker shot and goes down just as a Blue pilot warns him. 
BLUE: 
JYN ERSO: 
Jyn shoots a hole through the glass in the control room, opening up an alternative exit. A TIE fighter hits the wing of Blue Eleven and the pilot screams. 
BLUE ELEVEN: 
The beach battle rages on. No side seems to be winning so far, but a squad of death troopers arrives. Inside the tower, Jyn takes off her uniform jacket and climbs out the window. They jump over from the wall to the archives at a dazzling height. 
REBEL: 
BODHI ROOK: 
SERGEANT RUESCOTT MELSHI: I’m tied in at my end, I just need an open line. Hang on. The master switch, it’s over at that console. 
Page 51/56
REBEL: 
He peeks out, but is instantly shot by a sniper death trooper. Jyn, in turn, almost drops the data disc, but grabs it in the last moment and straps it onto her belt. Krennic is seen walking rapidly towards an elevator. 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
The master switch remains untouched. Chirrut emerges from his cover and walks across the battlefield, immune to all shots, as he mumbles his words like a mantra. 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE: 
one with the Force and the Force is with me. 
BAZE MALBUS: 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE: 
one with the Force and the Force is with me. I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me. I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me. I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me. I’m one with the Force and the Force is with me. 
BAZE MALBUS: 
Chirrut ignores it and pulls the master switch blindly. 
BODHI ROOK: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
Jyn keeps climbing up to the exit hatch. Krennic emerges from an elevator door and, after a brief exchange, shoots Cassian and he falls off the tower onto one of the bars below. 
JYN ERSO: 
BAZE MALBUS: 
Chirrut is hit by an explosion, and Baze runs to him in slow motion. BAZE MALBUS: 
BAZE MALBUS:

BAZE MALBUS: 
CHIRRUT ÎMWE:

The rebel cruiser is taking heavy damage. 
LIEUTENTANT:

ADMIRAL RADDUS:

GOLD LEADER: 
GOLD NINE: 
The Gold squadron launches torpedoes at the ISD and power goes out on the massive vessel. 
STAR DESTROYER CAPTAIN: What’s happening? 
IMPERIAL CREW MEMBER: We’ve lost engine power, sir. 
ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
BODHI ROOK: 
hear me! Is there anybody up there? This is Rogue One! Come in, over. ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
BODHI ROOK: 
have to transmit them from the communications tower! You have to take down the shield gate. It’s the only way to going to get them through! 
ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
Standby, Rogue One, we’re on it. 
BODHI ROOK: 
BAZE MALBUS: 
A Hammerhead corvette is seen speeding towards the disabled ISD at full power. The crew braces for impact. 
HAMMERHEAD CAPTAIN: Corvette 5, locked on target. Prepare for impact. Page 53/56
HAMMERHEAD CAPTAIN: Sublight thrusters, full power! 
The corvette crashes into the side of the disabled ISD, bringing it towards the second Destroyer. A horrible collision forces the Destroyers to fall slowly towards the shield gate, breaking it in half. Imperial crew members scream in pain as the ships go down, exploding. Jyn climbs out of the hatch, avoiding its sharp edges, and races to the antenna to send off the plans, but encounters a problem. 
COMPUTER: 
antenna alignment. Reset antenna alignment. 
Jyn looks over to the side of the tower where there is another control panel, but a TIE Striker almost shoots her off the edge. She barely makes it up and fixes the antenna. 
ADMIRAL GORIN: 
COMPUTER: 
Jyn turns away to hear the click of a blaster and Krennic aiming said blaster at her. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Who are you? 
JYN ERSO: 
Lyra. You’ve lost. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: Oh, I have, have I? 
JYN ERSO: 
put a fuse in the middle of your machine and I’ve just told the entire galaxy how to light it. 
DIRECTOR ORSON KRENNIC: The shield is up, your signal will never reach the rebel base. All the ships in here will be destroyed. I lose nothing but time. YOU, on the other hand die with the Rebellion. 
He never finishes, as Cassian shoots him in the shoulder and Jyn sends off the plans in a hurry. 
COMPUTER: 
REBEL LIEUTENANT: Admiral, receiving transmission from Scarif. Jyn rushed to the unconscious Krennic to kill him, but Cassian drags her away. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
go. 
COMPUTER: 
Page 54/56
LIEUTENANT: 
ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
In the elevator back to the landing pad, Cassian and Jyn smile at each other weakly. 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
JYN ERSO: 
The Mon Cala cruiser has received the transmissions, but someone catches a massive object on the horizon. It's the Death Star. Krennic opens his eyes, and a look of horror flashes on his face as he sees it too. 
LIEUTENANT: 
hyperspace. 
Aboard the Death Sta stand Tarkin and Romodi, ready to give the command to fire. 
GENERAL HURST ROMODI: Sir, shall I begin targeting their fleet? GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: Lord Vader will handle the fleet. Target the base at Scarif. Single reactor ignition. 
GENERAL HURST ROMODI: Yes, sir. 
GRAND MOFF WILHUFF TARKIN: You may fire when ready. 
GENERAL HURST ROMODI: Commence primary ignition. 
The Death Star control panels are ignited and the same green ray emerges from the reactor. Krennic watches silently as it fires, destroying the antenna and hitting the ocean, where a giant wave rises from the impact. Raddus watches the destruction from above. 
ADMIRAL RADDUS: 
prepare for jump to hyperspace! 
Just before the fleet can make the jump, The Devastator jumps out of hyperspace, and Darth Vader stands on the bridge as his ISD destroys the remnants of the rebel fleet. On the beach, Jyn and Cassian hug as they fall ont othe sand and watch the wave come toward them. 
JYN ERSO: 
CASSIAN ANDOR: 
The music intensifies and the two watch the wave with tears in their eyes as it engulfs them. Everything goes silent. On board the Devastator, Vader is preparing to board the cruiser. 
CAPTAIN SHAEF CORSSIN: The rebel flag ship is disabled, my lord, but has received transmission from the surface. 
Page 55/56
DARTH VADER: 
CAPTAIN SHAEF CORSSIN: Yes, my lord. 
On the cruiser, the rebels barely get the plans onto a hard drive and race to the escape pods, but some of them are cut off by a locked door. 
REBEL: 
REBEL 2: 
REBEL 1: 
REBEL: 
REBEL: 
REBEL: 
The music stops, and only the sirens blare in the darkness. Then someone starts breathing, and a crimson lightsaber ignites, revealing Darth Vader himself. 
REBEL: 
REBEL: 
REBEL: 
Vader slaughters the rebels easily and cold bloodedly, despite all their efforts. Someone manages to pass on the plans to the outside before being impaled by his saber. The survivors run to the Tantive IV that's docked to the cruiser. 
REBEL: 
REBEL: 
REBEL: 
The smaller ship launches the second Vader makes his way to it. He stands on the side of the cruiser, watching the Tantive leave. On board the smaller ship, captain Antilles finds Princess Leia of Alderaan. CAPTAIN RAYMUS ANTILLES: Make sure you secure the airlock. And prepare the escape pods. 
CAPTAIN RAYMUS ANTILLES: Your Highness. The transmission we received. What is it they’ve sent us? 
Leia smiles. 
PRINCESS LEIA ORGANA: Hope.

Whoops. 
Places, everyone. 
This was it. 
The moment it all began. 
The moment an ordinary 
little guy 
fell in love with the theater. Everything about it. 
The lights, 
the way the scenery moved, 
even the smell. 
He was only six years old, 
but his plans to become 
the first koala bear in space 
were suddenly toast. 
- -Some folks may have said 
he grew up to be the greatest 
showman the city has ever seen. -Some called him a visionary, 
a Maverick. - 
sure, some folks said he was 
as crazy as he was stubborn, 
but I say wonder and magic 
don't come easy, pal. 
And, oh, there would never 
be any doubt, 
the name buster moon 
would go down 
in entertainment history. 
And I should know, 
- because I am buster... 
- Moon! 
- Open this door! 
- Good morning, Mr. moon. 
Miss crawly. What, uh... 
What's going on? 
You got a lot of animals 
waiting to see you, Mr. moon. 
I do? 
Holy moly, I really do. 
Yeah, it's the 
stage crew from your last show. They say their 
Page 2/52
paychecks bounced. 
Tell 'em I'll call up the bank and make sure 
they're paid tout de suite. 
Oh, I got Judith from the bank holding on line two 
right now, sir. 
-Um, actually, I'm gonna have 
to call her back. -Oh. 
What should I tell her 
this time? 
Tell her buster moon 
is out to lunch. 
Moon! Open this door! 
Come on, moon! 
I know you're in there! 
Moon! Open this door! 
Aah! 
Hmm, thought I heard 
someone singing there. 
Ah, whatever. 
Guys, listen. 
Stay where you are. 
The cops are here in... 
What are you...? 
-Hold it right there! 
-Yeah, I'll get him! 
- Go, go, go! 
Whoa! 
Whoa! 
Johnny, you were supposed 
to be keeping a lookout! 
Sorry, dad. 
And where's your mask? 
Look at me. I'm mommy! 
Caspar, get off the table. 
Rosita, have you seen 
my car keys? 
Norman, would you please 
tell them 
what a good singer I am? 
Oh, yeah, you were great, honey. By the way, the bathroom sink 
is blocked again. 
Page 3/52
Bye, honey! 
One, two, 
one, two, three, four! 
Oh, my gosh. 
I thought you guys said 
you were musicians. 
Ash, babe, 
I'm the lead singer, okay? 
Just stick 
to the backing vocals. 
Sorry, I... I get carried away. Yeah, I know, right? 
It just kind of ruins my song, you know? 
Aw. 
What? 
- Come on, make your wish. 
I wish you'd join a choir. 
A local band or something. 
-I tried. 
-Bah! 
Hey, hey, dad, 
we've been over this. 
So she's a little shy. 
So what? 
If I had a voice like meena's, I'd be a superstar by now! 
- Now blow out your candles. 
A penny? 
How dare you! 
I happen to have studied 
at the Lincoln school of music. Sorry, it's-it's all 
i got right now. 
--Oh, is that so? 
-All right, prove it, pal. 
-What? 
- Empty your pockets right now. -Trying to find... 
-Wh-what is this you got here? -Just trying to find... 
What do you smoke out of this? That's my inhaler. 
Aha! I knew it! 
Page 4/52
You all saw it. 
You all saw it right here. 
- The monkey lied. 
I forgot I had that. 
And next time, pick on someone your own size! 
Bully! 
Take care of her, will you? 
She may look old and rusty, 
but she is a classic. 
Okay, listen. 
We both know that my theater 
has been going through 
some pretty rough times lately, but as the saying goes, 
"for every cloud, 
a silver lining." 
-Hup-hup-hup-hup-hup-hup. 
-We've got... 
Hold on right there, buster. 
My dad, he heard I was 
gonna see you today, 
and he was all like, 
"Eddie, you tell that koala 
"I'm not funding any more 
of those shows, 
and that's final." 
Those were his words. 
Well, your dad's right. 
Those shows were the problem. 
War of attrition. 
Rosie takes a bow. 
I mean, nobody wants to see 
that stuff anymore. 
So, what do I do? 
-Quit? 
-No. 
I give 'em a show they cannot 
resist, which is gonna be... 
J-just one more minute, 
s'il vous plat. 
- -Merci. 
Don't speak French. 
They speak English here. 
Page 5/52
Now, my next show is gonna be-- drumroll, please... 
...a singing competition. 
A singing competition? 
Who wants to see 
another one of those? 
Everyone! 
J-j-just think. 
Your neighbor, the-the-the 
grocery store manager, 
that-that-that chicken-- 
right there! 
Everyone in this city 
gets a shot 
at being a star 
live on my stage. 
Buster, 
this is a terrible idea. 
Oh, no, it's not. 
Real talent from real life. 
That's what audiences want, 
and I'm gonna give it to 'em! 
All right, well... 
C-can we please just 
get out of here? 
Don't you want to eat? 
Yeah, but we can't afford 
any of this. 
Yes, I know, and that's why... I brought sandwiches. 
Uh... 
That's not allowed. 
Ugh. 
What, you don't like 
peanut butter and jelly? 
- Excuse me, sir. 
- Okay, look. 
I got cream cheese, 
i got banana... 
-You okay? 
-Yep. Never better. 
Miss crawly? 
Hello? 
Uh, who is it? 
Page 6/52
It's me. 
Your boss, Mr. moon. 
-Oh, hello, Mr. moon. 
-There we go. 
Now, I need you to add 
the following information 
-to our publicity flyers. 
-Yes, sir. 
The winner 
of the singing contest 
will receive a grand prize of... $935. 
Hmm. Gonna need more than that. Just a second. 
There. 
There! 
$1,000. 
- You got that? 
- -Uh, $1,000... 
Oh! Oh! 
Print 'em up 
on every single sheet 
of paper we have left 
and let's spread the word 
right away, okay? 
Yes, uh, yes, sir. 
Oh, okay. 
Come on out of there. 
Ah, the winds of change. 
Yep, when this show's a hit, 
I'm gonna get you 
a fresh coat of paint. 
How are we doing 
with those flyers, miss crawly? Oh, yes, sir. 
We're all good to go here. 
Miss crawly, no! 
No, no, no, no, no, no! 
Oopsie-Daisy. 
Oh, well, I guess that's 
one way to spread the word. 
Hey, Lance, look at this. 
Ash, babe, hey! 
-You make a withdrawal! 
Page 7/52
-Yeah. 
Meena! 
--Hey, hey, hey! 
What do you think you...? 
Uh-huh. Yeah. 
Ow. Mmm. 
Ah. 
Let's go to work. 
And cue the crazy old lizard. 
Good morning, Mr. moon. 
Indeed it is, miss crawly. 
Top of the morning to you. 
I made you some coffee. 
You did? Where is it? 
Oh, I got a little thirsty 
on the way up those stairs. 
-Shall I go open the doors now? -The doors? 
Well, you've got a lot 
of animals waiting in line 
to audition, Mr. moon. 
I do? 
Holy moly, I really do. 
I swear to you, Eddie, 
this is no joke. 
Look, just get down here 
and see for yourself. 
I gotta go. 
This is it, miss crawly. 
Get your scaly tail downstairs and throw those doors open wide. Okay, uh, one at a time, please. Calm down. 
- Bye, iggy. Bye, Perry. 
Bye, Carla. - 
bye, Gail. 
Bye, Rory. Bye, Mickey. 
Bye, moe. Bye, Nelson. 
Bye, Hannah. 
Bye, Tess. 
Bye-bye, caspar. 
Phew! 
Uh, let's hear from a few more of the folks in line. 
Page 8/52
-What about you, sir? 
-Well, Bob, I'm a lab technician for a leading 
pharmaceutical company, 
but I was born with a gift. 
And that gift is to sing. 
Oi, dad. Just going out. 
Well, don't be long. 
I got the gang coming over. 
Well, look, I mean, 
I'm sure you're gonna get a lot of namby-pamby animals in here saying things like, 
"oh, it's not winning. 
It's the taking part 
that counts." 
Yeah, yeah. Not me, pal. 
I'm here to win. 
That prize, it's mine. 
Wow! Thank you, Johnny. 
Okay, next up, 
-we have meena. 
-Good luck out there. 
All right, come on. Here we go. Come on, you can do it. 
You can do it. Okay... 
Oh, I'm s... 
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh... 
Okay. Hey, it's all right. 
You know, it's all right. 
Take it away, meena. 
Uh... okay. Uh... 
-Mmm... um... 
-Anytime, now. 
Uh... 
Do you want to start over? 
-Um... uh... 
-All right, enough of that. 
That's quite enough of that. 
That's it. Come on. 
Off the stage, Helga. 
Go on. You're useless. 
Thanks. 
Right. Here we go. 
Page 9/52
Hit it! 
Okay, that's everyone, Mr. moon. Whew! 
All right, call everyone 
back to stage, miss crawly, 
and let's get... 
--Hello! -Ooh. 
Uh, can I have everybody back 
to stage, please? 
Everyone come back to stage 
for selection. 
Okay. 
Thank you, miss crawly. 
- You're welcome, Mr. moon. 
All right. 
- Let's see, now. 
Hmm. 
I'll take... 
-You guys. 
-Yes! 
And which one of you 
is the girl? 
Ha ha. Very funny. 
"Loud and horrible, 
but shows promise." 
Welcome to the show. 
Cool. 
I guess we could hang. 
No, no. 
I just want her, not you. 
What? 
All right, the rest 
of the group acts, 
thank you so much. 
Oh, don't feel bad, folks. 
There will be 
a ten percent discount 
on tickets for everyone. 
Yeah, sure, thanks a lot. 
Let's get out of here, ash. 
Ash? 
Uh, yeah... 
Yeah, let's go. 
Okay, soloists. 
Page 10/52
Johnny, Mike, Pete, Richard, 
Daniel and ray. 
Mike! 
Ooh-hoo-hoo! Wowza! 
I've gotta have you in my show. Oh, I... if you insist. 
And I'll take Pete... 
Ooh, yeah! 
And one more. 
- Let me see, now. 
--Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry. 
--Oh, what is wrong with me? 
Um, thanks for coming, Richard. Oh... 
- Oh, my... ray! 
- Are you all right? 
- -Uh-huh. 
Just hang in there, ray. 
I got you. 
--Ooh. Oh. Whoopsie. Oh. 
Okay, then I'll take... 
Daniel. 
Thank you, Johnny. 
--Daniel, can you hear me? 
You're in the show! 
What? 
Are you talking to me? 
- Yes. 
I was saying that you are in... Oh, geez, this is 
gonna drive me nuts. 
Johnny, get back here. 
You're in. 
- Thank you, Daniel. Good-bye. Yes! 
Okay. That's everyone 
on my list. 
Um, wait a second. 
Rosita. 
-Is Rosita still here? 
-Oh, yes. 
Yes, I'm here. 
Rosita, Rosita, Rosita. 
Great set of pipes, 
Page 11/52
but boring to watch. 
I knew it. 
So, what should I do? 
I could partner you up 
with gunter. 
Gunter! Where are you? 
Ja! Ja! This is me. 
Ja! 
It's gonna spice things up 
on stage. 
Wait. You want us 
to sing together? 
Ja! The two of us together, 
you joking me? 
We're going to be spicy, no? 
That koala's a fool, 
Sherry-Anne. 
You are going to be 
a star one day! 
Auditions are over, pal. 
- Show's already been cast. 
- Okay... 
You are my chosen few. 
- Yes! 
This is it, folks. 
A defining moment 
in all of our lives. 
Um, no. 
No, no, no, not you guys. 
I dismissed all 
of the group acts already. 
You... you can go home. 
Look, look, look, 
i-I'm really sorry, 
but all of the slots are filled. --No, no, no, no, listen. 
No in show. 
- Good-bye-bye. 
- Miss crawly! 
Come on, you guys, 
out... out of here. 
Come on, off the stage. 
- Thank you so much. 
- Hey, moon. 
Page 12/52
What's the story? Is the prize really inside this thing? 
The prize? Oh, sure. 
Yes, it's all... 
It's all in there. 
Well, open it, will you? 
I want to see 
what $100,000 looks like. 
-Yeah, come on. -Me, too. 
-Let's have a look. -Open it. 
Yeah, yeah, go on. 
Open it, Mr. moon. 
For sure, I'll open it. 
Wait. What did you say? 
He said $100,000. 
A hundr... 
Uh... 
I forgot my keys. 
Koala be right back. 
For the last time, miss crawly, I'm not going to fire you. 
Now, would you pull 
yourself together, 
and please blow 
that nose of yours. 
--No, no, no, not in here. 
-Blow it outside. 
-I'm sorry, Mr. moon. 
-Thank you. 
-Buster, what do you expect? 
-She's like 200 years old. 
-Eddie, please, look. 
If-if your folks could just 
loan me the money until... 
$100,000? 
Buster, come on. 
Hoo! I gotta think. 
I've gotta think. 
I've gotta think. 
I've got to come up 
- with a solution... 
-Look, maybe it's time 
to stop thinking 
and it's time to just move on. Page 13/52
I mean, this theater of yours, you could get some decent money for it and... 
I don't know, maybe we could 
do something together. 
What? What, sit around 
playing video games? 
Do you know what that is? 
Uh, it's a bucket? 
Yes, and do you know why 
i have this bucket? 
'Cause the roof is leaking? 
No, that's the bucket 
for the leak. 
I have this one 'cause it 
belonged to my father. 
Every day for 30 years, 
he worked his tail off 
washing cars 
just so I could buy this place. Every day, Eddie. 
Just for me. 
--Wow. 
Sounds like a great dad. 
So, how do you want 
to handle this? 
Oh, Mr. moon, 
i got Judith from the bank 
holding on line two again. 
Well, there's only 
one thing I can do. 
Okay, everybody, listen up. 
-Shh, shh, shh. 
-I gotta send you all home. 
Right now. 
-What? -Huh? 
-Yep. 
'Cause, like my dad used to say, "get a good night's sleep 
and do a great day's work." 
That's right. 
Rehearsals begin first thing 
tomorrow morning. 
And if you want to become stars Page 14/52
and win 100 grand, 
then you better be ready 
to work harder 
than you've ever worked 
in your lives. 
So get some sleep 
and dream big dreams. 
Miss crawly! 
Okay, come on. 
That's enough now. 
Come on, off the stage. 
Please. 
-Dream big dreams? 
-I know, it's good, right? 
What about the 100 grand? 
Don't you worry, Eddie. 
There's got to be 
a way to get it. 
What? Buster, no, listen to me! This show is not gonna 
save your theater. 
You're at rock bottom, pal. 
Yep, and you know what's great about hitting rock bottom, 
Eddie? 
There's only one way 
left to go, 
and that's up. 
And you can see the lucky few 
leaving the theater behind me. Now back to you 
in the studio, John. 
--Oh, honey, please don't cry. You are not a failure. 
There'll be other chances. 
-You just... 
-Bah! The heck there will! 
Dad, please. 
Come on! 
Don't you want this? 
Well, sure, but I messed it up. Then you gotta go back there 
tomorrow and say, 
"Mr. moon, I demand you let me 
Page 15/52
re-audition!" 
Be confident! Show 'em you 
ain't gonna be pushed around! 
You got that, meena? 
-Um... 
-Good! 
Now, go get my cocoa. 
Would you stop? 
I'd only be doing it for us. 
Oh, really? 
Yes, really. 
If I won that money, 
we could build 
our own recording studio, 
start our own label. 
I mean, the whole world 
would get to hear your songs. 
Oh... 
Hey! Uh, just a min... 
Oh, oh, wait. W-wait! 
Oh, look at... 
I know Derek, the manager. 
He'll vouch for me. 
Come on! 
Hey, Mario. 
How's it going? 
Oh, for crying out loud. 
Oh, yeah, oh, let the bears in. Let the bears in. Fine. 
There he is! 
I got a surprise for you, 
my son. 
--What's that? 
-Tell him the plan. 
-Right. 
We've been told there's a ship carrying 25 million in gold, 
gonna dock at night right here. With the usual guards 
here and here. 
But, lucky for us, there's 
a sewer right under here. 
So the getaway driver 
meets us here. 
Page 16/52
And that is gonna be you 
this time, Johnny. 
-What? You want... 
You want me to drive? -Yeah. 
It's time my boy had 
a proper role in the gang, eh? Hang on, hang on, dad. 
Barry's always been our driver. Barry don't mind. 
Do you, Barry? 
-No. No, that's fine. 
-Yeah. 
So... so, when exactly 
is this ship coming in, then? 
We ain't got a date yet. 
Probably won't be 
for a while, though, will it? 
What do you care? It's the last job we ever need to do. 
When it comes in, we go. 
Right? 
Great. 
Can't wait. 
- Um, hi. 
I saw your ad in the paper. 
Yes, I need a nanny 
just for a couple of weeks. 
You can? Great. 
Oh, the kids? 
Yes, they're wonderful. 
They... yeah, I have 25. 
No, I'm... I'm not joking. 
- Um, but they're really 
no problem... - 
- hello? Hello? 
Good night, mommy. 
Hey. How was the big meeting? 
That bad, really? 
Well, I have something 
really exciting to tell you. 
Mmm. 
You make the best pie, honey. 
Listen, Norman, 
i know it's short notice, 
Page 17/52
but I could really use some help with the kids tomorrow 
because... well, you are not 
gonna believe what I did today. Norman, are you listening to me? Rehearsals begin 
first thing tomorrow morning, 
so get some sleep 
and dream big dreams. 
Hmm. 
Good morning, everybody. 
Now, I want you all dressed 
before breakfast. 
Breakfast! 
Rosita, have you seen 
my car keys? 
Don't forget, your keys 
are in your coat pocket. 
Oh, I found 'em. 
- Bye, honey. 
- -Bye, Norman. 
Time for school. 
Bye, iggy. 
Bye, Perry. Bye, Carla. 
Bye, Gail. Bye, Rory. 
Bye, Mickey. Bye, moe. 
Bye, Nelson. Bye, Hannah. 
Bye, Tess. Bye, Kelly. 
Bye, George. Bye, Andy. 
Bye, Freddy. 
Bye-bye, caspar. 
This contest is war. 
This stage is the battlefield. Your song is your weapon. 
Now, you only get one shot 
to blow that audience away, 
so choose carefully 
from the list of songs 
I've selected for each of you. Ah, talked some sense 
into that boyfriend of yours. 
Lance is an artist, 
but I wouldn't expect you 
to understand that. 
Page 18/52
You're right. 
I don't understand that at all. Now, you'll notice each list 
also includes my costume 
- and performance suggestions. Okay? Miss crawly will show you to your rehearsal spaces. 
Now, let's get to work. 
Excuse me, Mr. moon? 
For some reason, it says here 
that I should be playing 
the piano? 
Yes, just imagine-- 
big, soulful guy like you 
tenderly playing the keys. 
There'll be goose bumps 
everywhere. 
Well, I haven't played piano 
since I was a kid. 
Miss crawly, we're gonna need 
some piano lessons over here. 
Yes, sir! Up the stairs. 
I'll be right along. 
And, Pete, you're in here. 
- You got it, Mr. moon. 
-Check your ego, man. 
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
-Break it up, break it up, 
break it up. -Oh, yeah? 
Tell ricki. He started it. 
That's right. 
Just like I started this band. My band, Howie. 
Oh, forgive me, your highness. - Guys, come on. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
Hey, hey. Out. Get out of here. --Look, just calm down 
and pick a song. 
-Wow! 
-I think we'll probably have 
a better chance of winning 
if I do the singing part 
and leave the dancing part 
Page 19/52
to you. 
Bah! Are you joking me? 
You are just in need of, like, a super cool warm-up. 
--Come on, let's take off 
- these clothes. 
That... that is not necessary. Oh! 
That is a lot of skin. 
Ah, don't you look 
so worried face. 
I've got one for you, too. 
Hey, porky! 
-Keep it down, will you? 
-Sorry. 
Hey, moon, you gave me 
the wrong list. 
Cheesy pop's 
not exactly my style. 
Style. 
I'm glad you brought that up. 
Now, let's see. 
- There. 
Isn't this a great color 
for you? 
I can't tell. 
It's melting my eyes. 
-You got anything in black? 
-Black? 
What, you want everyone to think you're going to a funeral? 
You think you're some kind 
of artsy-fartsy type? 
No, no, no, no, no. 
Bingo! Pop star Princess! 
Is this part of the competition? Okay, everybody, don't panic. 
- Don't panic. 
- What's going on? 
Talk to me, crawly. 
When did we last pay 
the power company, Mr. moon? 
Oh, for Pete's sake. 
Okay, don't worry, everybody. 
Page 20/52
I will take care of this. 
In the meantime, 
you will continue 
to rehearse in the dark. 
-What? 
-But I can't see anything. 
- Don't you worry, Rosita. 
I have glow sticks. 
Great. 
Use this time to shake off 
those first-day inhibitions, 
and I'll be right back. 
-You gotta be kidding me. 
-Okay, you heard him. 
- Back to work now. 
Come on, everybody. 
Whoa! 
Sorry, old girl. 
I'll fix that. 
- Mr. moon? 
You-you probably 
don't remember me, 
but i-i auditioned yesterday, 
and I... 
Hey, listen. 
Do you think maybe you could 
reach the ledge? 
Th-that ledge? 
Whoa! 
Whoa, that's a heck of a trunk you've got there. 
Thanks a lot, kid. 
Uh, Mr. moon? 
M-my name is meena, 
and I baked a cake for you, 
and, uh... uh, I was wondering if you'd maybe give me 
-a second chance to... 
-Just a moment, please. 
Be right with you. 
Hmm. 
Yay! It's about time. 
Johnny... 
Yep, mind your head here. 
Page 21/52
Hey, can you pull up 
that scenic cable? 
-You mean this? 
-Yes, that's it. 
Great! 
And the house lights? 
Wow. 
Ah, I know. 
Beautiful, isn't she? 
You know what, kid? 
How would you like to be 
a part of this show? 
Really? Wait. 
Oh, my gosh, I was just 
gonna ask about that. 
Great. 'Cause I could 
really use a stagehand. 
Stagehand? 
-But... 
-Ah, don't worry about it. 
You're gonna pick it up 
in no time. 
I'll teach you everything 
i know. Follow me. 
These are the rehearsal spaces and dressing rooms, 
and up here we got workshops 
and the main office. 
Up in the air! 
Touch your toes! 
Awesome. 
Awesome? 
Yeah, I think the word 
you're after is "awful." 
And that's me 
restraining myself. 
There's not an ounce of talent between 'em. 
Not an ounce. 
In fact, you know what? 
I think that prize 
is as good as mine already. 
Yes, indeed, uh, 
i am about to come 
Page 22/52
into a very, very large 
sum of money. 
$100,000, to be precise. 
Well, is that so? 
In that case, sir, you'll be 
wanting our platinum card. 
Well, well, well, hello again. Oh, man, these are, like, 
the cheesiest songs 
of all time. 
I know, right? 
I mean, I was even thinking 
of writing my own song instead. Wait, what? 
-Your own song? 
-Well, yeah. 
Look, if you want 
to win that money, 
just do what the koala says. 
Why? You think I can't 
write my own song? 
Whoa, whoa. I'm just saying, 
not everyone 
can write songs, okay? 
I know I make it 
look easy, babe, 
but it's not. 
Oh, here she is. 
- Quiet down, everybody. 
So, meena, are you in the show? Uh... well, yeah, kind of, 
but... 
She did it! 
Oh, I'm so proud of you, 
i could pop! 
That's my birthday wish 
coming true right there! 
-Way to go, meena! 
-Oh, meena, we love you! 
Mom... 
-What the heck? 
-Wait a minute, wait a minute. Don't be mad, okay? 
It was your grandma. 
Page 23/52
She told the whole street 
about your audition. 
-Mom, no, wait. 
-Shh, shh. Shush, baby. 
You need to save 
that singing voice of yours. 
So, from now on, 
just nod 
or shake your head, okay? 
How was that, dad? 
You're still too soft 
on them corners, Johnny. 
You got to attack 'em. 
And you're crunching the gears. I told you, you got 
to be gentle with the... 
Look, turn that down. 
Oi! 
Listen to your father! 
"Too soft on the corners, 
Johnny." 
"You're not doing it right, 
Johnny." 
"Speed up, Johnny." 
"Do it like I showed you." 
Whoa! 
Dad? 
Oh, no. 
I've run over my dad. 
Now, that is more like it. 
And the three little pigs 
- lived happily ever after. 
Good night, my dears. 
Norman, are you awake? 
How was your day, honey? 
Same as always. 
-It was? 
-Mm-hmm. 
I don't know 
how you do it all, honey. 
-Good night. 
-Good night. 
All creatures great and small, - welcome to the moon theater! 
Page 24/52
Mr. moon? 
-I have Judith from the bank. 
-What? 
Whoa, no, no, no. Tell her I'll call her back in the morning. 
Oh, I can't. 
She's right here. 
Judith! Hello. 
I work for a bank, 
not a charity, 
and if your accounts 
are not settled 
-by the end of the month... 
-Okay, Judith... 
I personally guarantee, 
by the end of this month, 
this show is going to be 
the biggest hit 
this city has ever seen. 
Mr. moon, none of your shows 
have ever worked. 
None of them! 
You've had your chances. 
Now, settle your accounts, 
or we will repossess 
this property. 
Okay. Toodle-oo. 
What are you going to do, 
Mr. moon? 
Honestly, uh... 
I have no idea. 
Mmm. Are you wearing 
a speedo, Eddie? 
What... what are you...? 
Eddie? 
Is everything all right? 
Yeah, uh, 
just doing my laps, ma! 
So, what, you live 
in the pool house now? 
Yeah, my folks want me 
to be more, 
you know, independent, I guess. They even hooked me up 
Page 25/52
with this life coach dude. 
-Life coach? 
-Yeah. 
I guess he's gonna help me 
find my purpose in life. 
I thought I had one, 
but it turns out 
it wasn't the right one 
or something. 
I don't know. 
Anyway, he's got me 
on this whole schedule thing. 
It's, like, mondays, 
take out the recycling; 
Tuesdays, mow the lawn; 
Wednesdays, go visit Nana; 
Thursdays, clean the pool. 
It's like, don't we have people to do all of this stuff? 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, 
whoa, whoa. Back up. 
Your Nana is still alive? 
Oh, yeah. 
Wow. 
And she's rich, right? 
She's loaded. 
But trust me, you don't want 
to go near my Nana. 
She is one mean sheep. 
Good. Lower the moon. 
-Coffee? 
-Thank you, miss crawly. 
Okay, that's normal. 
Just needs a knock. 
--See? You're getting it. 
Anyone seen my glass eye? 
The darn thing 
keeps popping out. 
Whoa! 
You almost killed me, jumbo! 
-It wasn't me. 
-Oh, is that so? 
- Pete? 
Pete! 
Page 26/52
- You're gonna be all right. 
- Okay, just... - 
- just hang in there, buddy. 
- Ricki? Kai? 
Why aren't you guys rehearsing? We're through. 
They said I'm 
an intolerable egomaniac. 
I don't even know 
what that means. 
All right. 
We're two acts down. 
Give me some good news, 
miss crawly. 
Oh, it's not as bad as it looks. Uh... 
- Oopsie-Daisy. 
Meena, how would you like 
to re-audition for the show? 
Really? Well, yeah. 
-Great. 
-I mean, no. 
What? 
I-i mean, yes, I can sing. 
But no, i-i get so nervous, 
and... i-i can't do it. 
I mean, I would totally do it, but... no, I... no. 
I'm gonna take that as a maybe. Great! Look, they're back. 
Uh, we're gonna come back 
to this, meena. 
Listen, guys, 
forget what I said before. 
You are very talented. 
Please, join the show, okay? 
Yes? No? 
Oh, um... here. 
What? Hey, no, no, no. 
Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
D-don't go, don't go! 
Oh, what is this for? 
Now, we use this 
to follow the steps. 
Page 27/52
Caspar! Caspar, no! 
How about this? Ha-ha! 
- Come on. What did I tell you? I'm so sorry. 
He had a fever, 
and it was too late 
to get a sitter, so... 
--Well, you seem fine now. 
Wow! 
--I am not singing this. 
What's not to like? 
You're a female, 
and you're a teenager. 
This song was made for you. 
Wow. It's like you can 
see inside my tiny 
teenage mind. 
I know, right? 
You just gotta add some moves 
and a little bit of... 
-Go for it! 
-Oh, you mean like this? 
There you go. 
You're a natural. 
Yes, that was very bad. 
Johnny. 
Come in. Over. 
Oh, Johnny, 
your jacket's talking. 
Johnny, where are you? 
Dad, what's going on? Over. 
What do you mean, 
you gotta leave now? 
I know. 
I'm... I'm so sorry. 
It's just, I've got 
this family business thing. 
Do I need to start worrying 
about your commitment here, 
Johnny? 
-Tell me no. 
-No. Absolutely not. 
I promise it won't happen again. -It better not. 
Page 28/52
-Thank you, Mr. moon. 
Hi. I'm Becky. 
Becky? 
Hey, what did you expect? 
You're never around anymore. 
I did it for us, Lance! 
You and me! 
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. 
I think I left 
my sunglasses in there. 
Come on, Becky. 
Let's get out of here. 
Jackpot, baby! 
-Whoo-hoo! 
-Ooh! 
Well, I say we call it 
a night there, fellas. 
Hey, uh, put the cash 
in my car, will you, Derek? 
Well, you're one great 
card player, Mike. 
- Not so bad yourself. 
-Ooh... 
Except I still can't tell 
how you cheated. 
Cheated? Cheated? 
Oh, I am offended. 
Come on, baby, 
let's cut some rug. 
Oh! 
Wh-what the...? 
Oh. 
How did that get there? 
-Run for it, baby! 
-Hey! 
Whoo! 
Get him! 
Excuse me. 
Don't let him get away! 
-Thanks, Derek. 
-Out of the way. 
So long, suckers! 
Good morning, buster. 
-Hey, Eddie. How are you? 
Page 29/52
-Good. 
-How's the show going? 
-Ah, it's going great. 
Hey, that's a sharp jacket 
you've got on today. 
Oh, thanks. 
Wait. 
What are you doing here? 
Eddie, you can't come 
visit your Nana 
without bringing her 
some flowers. 
-Here. 
-What? No! 
Buster, no! Don't go in there! Yes, can I help...? 
-Buster! 
-Ah, Nana! 
Just look at you, dear. 
Wow! 
You don't look a day over 90. 
Oh, my gosh. 
Buster moon. 
We met at Eddie's graduation. 
Oh, lucky me. 
A visit from my useless grandson and his ghastly little 
theater friend. 
Look at that-- she remembers me. Okay, Nana... 
How would you like 
to be the sponsor 
for a very prestigious prize? 
Not for that singing contest 
i saw on the news. 
That's the one. 
Oh, I see. 
You don't have the money, 
do you? 
Well, we don't quite have it 
all locked in... 
Well, you'll not get 
a cent out of me. 
Nana, please, just listen to me Page 30/52
-for one second, okay? 
-No, absolutely not. 
-Don't listen to him, Nana. 
-I'm not listening 
-to either of you. 
-Just wait one second. 
Lapsang souchong, no sugar, 
and be quick about it. 
Uh, Nana, i-i don't know 
how to make tea. 
Wow. I saw this show 
when I was a kid. 
Nana, you were 
absolutely amazing. 
Please, this flattery is futile. I have no intention 
of bailing you out. 
Your pathetic shows 
are the reason 
that theater 
no longer has an audience. 
Oh, but this show is gonna... 
Gonna pack 'em in 
like it did 
in the good old days. 
They were not "good old days," Mr. moon. 
They were magnificent. 
And that theater of yours, 
it was a palace 
of wonder and magic. 
But, Nana, it still is. 
-Yeah, right. 
-Ow! 
I can recall the ushers 
in their velvet suits. 
Queues a mile long 
just to get a ticket. 
The curtain rising 
over that glorious stage. 
Music and light 
bringing dreams to life? 
Precisely. 
Well, it's just like 
Page 31/52
you remember it. 
In fact, I've made it 
even more spectacular. 
No, you haven't. 
-Shh. 
Come see for yourself. 
Uh, a special performance 
just for you. 
What do you say, Nana? 
I say... 
You are a liar, Mr. moon. 
Okay, well, we're done now. 
Thank you, Nana. 
But anything's better 
than spending another evening 
playing checkers 
with this old fart. 
What? 
Great. 
It's gonna blow you away, Nana. And that is no lie. 
Now, listen up. 
Tomorrow we are going to have 
a full preview of the show, 
and our audience will be none 
other than miss Nana noodleman. - Nana noodleman? 
- Wow, Nana noodleman. 
She's still alive? 
Oh, yes, and believe me, 
she's got some 
pretty high standards. 
All right? So, today, 
we're going to have 
a full dress rehearsal, 
and I want to see you 
light up the stage, folks. 
Well, that's cool. 
-Meena? Miss crawly? 
What do you think? 
Wow, it's so ambitious. 
Yeah, are you sure about this? I promised Nana 
something spectacular, 
Page 32/52
and this-- ha!-- 
It's gonna blow her away. 
-Oh, yes. 
-Two minutes, everybody. 
Johnny. 
Johnny, where are you? 
Johnny, 
answer the walkie-talkie. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, dad. 
I'm here. I'm here. 
-What's wrong? 
-We got the call. 
Shipment's coming in. 
-Tonight? 
-Not tonight. Now. 
Meet us on the corner 
of Hector street in two minutes. Stay here. 
We'll be back in exactly 37... Yeah, 37 minutes. Yep. 
- You've told me repeatedly. 
I can make it. 
Bravo, Mike. 
Nana is gonna love that. 
Oh, you're... 
You're too kind, Mr. moon. 
And I myself am loving 
the new suit, sir. 
Okay, can we see ash next, 
please? 
Ash, let's get you out here. 
Oh, stand back. 
Moody teenager coming through. Good luck, ash. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, 
whoa. Okay, enough of that. 
- Cut it, cut it, cut it, 
cut it. - 
--i don't think anyone's 
gonna call her after that. 
Okay, ash, um... 
Hey, come on, ash. 
What is it? Do you... 
Do you not like the dress? 
Page 33/52
Ow. 
Ow. 
Ash, what's wrong? 
Well, it sounds to me like you are way better off 
without that... that... 
That total super-jerk 
dinkleschplatt! 
Exactly. 
Total super-jerk dinkleschplatt. Rosita! Gunter! 
-You're on next. 
-Yeah, okay, here. 
There should be some gum or 
some candy in there somewhere. Just help yourself. 
Rosita, Rosita, Rosita. 
Wait, wait, wait, 
wait, wait, wait. 
Can I take your place, please? - Sure, Johnny. Go ahead. 
- Okay, get ready, 
'cause I'm warning you... 
This stage is about to explode with major piggy power. 
I am so sorry. 
I have no control. 
Yeah! 
Okay, come on, you can do this. Are you okay? 
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thank you. 
- How are you? 
- Okay. 
Johnny, let's get you out here! And, you guys, you've gotta 
work on that routine. 
Take it away, Johnny! 
You can't just sing it. 
You've got to show 
the fire und desire. 
The fire went out 
a long time ago. 
What? 
Look, I can't even 
Page 34/52
keep count of the steps. 
Ugh! Counting schmounting! 
She sings too much 
with her head, right? 
Ja, ja, see? 
Forget the steps and just, like, let the music take control 
of your body parts. 
My body parts 
are not responding, okay? 
It's never gonna happen. 
I should just be 
getting groceries. 
-Rosita, no. -Rosita, come on. -What? Rosita, please. 
Like, don't go. 
Psst! Hey! Hey! 
Down here. 
Have you seen three 
nasty-looking bears out there? Uh... no. 
Oh, great. Hey, by the way, 
i love your act. 
Seriously, the... the part where you fall flat on your face? 
Oh, that... 
That cracks me up, every time. See you around, porky. 
Ah, man. 
Johnny, uh, I know 
I'm asking a lot of you... 
Mr. moon, I'm really trying, 
i promise. 
What about your backup song? 
Have you practiced that? 
Uh, well, not yet. 
Well, why don't we go back 
and work on that one, okay? 
I mean, look, 
if you play like that 
- in front of Nana noodleman... Johnny? 
--Hey! 
We are set for life now, boys! Page 35/52
What's going on? 
Where's Johnny? 
He's not here. 
Run! 
Oh, I'm dead. 
Okay, wait, let me see. 
No, mom, I have not made 
any friends. 
What do you think this is, 
kindergarten? 
If you hadn't squealed 
to the cops, 
I wouldn't be in here right now. Honey, when are you getting out? I'm only gonna be in here 
for a few years. 
Well, where'd you 
hide the money? 
Where were you? 
Um, well, thing is, i-i went 
-to get gas, and, um... 
-Don't lie to me! 
Um, I was at a rehearsal. 
Rehearsal? For what? 
I was at a singing contest. 
Look, dad, I'm... I'm sorry. 
I just don't want 
to be in your gang. 
-I want to be a singer. 
-Singer? 
Look, dad, no, it's okay, 
it's okay. 
I can get the bail money. 
There's a prize-- 
it's $100,000... 
How did I end up 
with a son like you, eh? 
You're nothing like me. 
You never were, 
and you never will be. 
I'll get you out! 
Dad, wait! 
I'll get the money! 
I promise! 
Page 36/52
Johnny! Oh! 
You... you gave me 
a fright there. 
Sorry. I didn't mean to. 
I just... 
Well, I know it's late, 
but I could really use 
some extra piano lessons. 
Uh-huh. 
Mmm. That's it. 
That's good. 
You're getting it. 
Shoppers are reminded the store will close in 15 minutes. 
Thank you. 
The lady in aisle six... 
That was awesome. 
- All right. 
Mr. moon, are you sure 
this is legal? 
Uh... I don't know. 
All right, but if you keep 
asking questions, 
we'll never get this done. 
Now, hit it! 
A little higher. 
Just a little bit. 
There it is. Thank you. 
Hey! 
Posters up. 
-You! 
-Now, run away! 
Come back here, you vandals! 
Rosita, have you seen my car? 
Whoa! 
Rosita, what the...? 
What's going on? 
Rosita! 
Whoa! 
Kids, where's mommy? 
Whew. 
How's that, miss crawly? 
- Hey. 
Sorry. 
Page 37/52
Mr. moon would like everyone 
to meet backstage 
before she arrives. 
Wow. 
You wrote that? 
Uh... yeah. 
Do you like it? 
Are you kidding? 
It's fantastic. 
You've gotta sing that today. 
Mike, you're on first. 
- Sure. 
Uh, just a second here. 
Honey, I'm busy. 
What? I can't hear you. 
Rosita and gunter, 
you're on after Mike. 
You got it, boss. 
Rosita! 
Super cool! 
You've, like, totally come back. Okay, Johnny, you follow them... What? 
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm ready. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
-Ash, you're... 
After Johnny. I got it. 
And, meena, last chance, kid. 
You want to... you want to join these guys out there today? 
I-i would. 
I-i just get so scared. 
Sure, you do. 
All right, but-but... 
You know how 
to get over that, right? 
Uh, no. 
You just start singing. 
Do what you love, 
then you'll be great 
'cause you won't 
be afraid anymore 
because you'll actually 
be doing it, right? 
Page 38/52
- Uh... 
Look, do you love to sing? 
I mean, do you really love it? Of course I do. 
Then you face this head-on, 
meena. 
Because, 
like my dad always said, 
"don't let fear stop you 
from doing the thing you love." Uh... 
Okay, I'll do it. 
- Great. 
- Mr. moon! 
She's here. 
Nana...! 
Oh! Do not even think 
of embracing me. 
You got it. 
Eddie, please show your Nana 
to the royal box. 
Oh, for heaven sakes, 
I'm perfectly capable 
of walking. 
You nervous? 
Are you kidding? 
I'm absolutely terrified. 
Boss. 
That's his car, isn't it? 
Right there. 
Pull over. 
Lapsang souchong, 
courtesy of Mr. moo... moo... 
Wonderful. 
H-honey, honey, the show 
is starting, all right? 
I-i can't talk now. 
I gotta go. 
Of course I love you. 
You think I'd buy you 
diamond earrings if I didn't... --Where is my money? 
Okay, okay, listen, listen, 
i just, uh... 
Page 39/52
I just maybe kind of, uh, 
spent it all. 
You know? 
No, no, no, please, 
please, wait! 
I'll give you the money. 
I'll-I'll get you... 
I'll get you $100,000! 
- Where are you 
going to get that kind of money? Moon! Okay? 
Moon's got my money. 
Who is this "moon"? 
All creatures great and small, welcome to the moon theater. 
I am your host, 
buster moon, and... 
Okay. 
Behold! 
The very first stage 
lit entirely by... 
Squid power. 
Yeah! 
Beautiful work, guys. 
Now just follow me on the beat. And as you can see, 
this is no ordinary theater. 
This is a palace 
of wonder and magic. 
He's done it! 
He's really done it, Nana! 
Oh, goodness. 
Now welcome 
our first contestant. 
Whoa. 
Which one of you is moon? 
Hey, hey, hey, 
you can't just barge in here. 
You know this guy? 
-Mike? 
-Right. 
Mike here says 
you got his money 
and it's in that box. 
Page 40/52
No, no, no, no, no, 
just hold on a moment here. 
That's prize money, 
and it's not Mike's 
unless he wins it fair and... 
-Give him the money! 
-Okay, okay. 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, take it. 
The whole chest. 
It's yours, okay? 
All right here. 
Open it. 
Open it? I-i... no. Me? 
Open it! 
Okay, no, i-i... 
I just don't... 
I don't have the keys, 
so maybe you can 
come back later? 
- Get out of the way! 
No, no, no, no, 
no, no, no, no. 
- Wait! 
Hey, hey, there you go. 
Big guy with a bat. 
Who needs keys, right? 
All right, well, let... 
Let's get this thing 
squared up now. 
What the...? 
That's it? 
That's all there is? 
He lied. 
-Moon lied to us all. 
-Well, wait a second. 
-I can explain. Okay? 
-He's your problem, not me. 
This is just a prop. 
So, where's the $100,000? 
- Hmm? 
- You're kidding. 
What's the big idea? 
What a huge waste 
of everyone's... 
Page 41/52
This... this was just... 
Buster, look out! 
I'm stuck! 
Buster, it's falling! 
Let go! 
Whoa, whoa! 
Hey! 
Okay, okay, okay, steady, girl. Steady... 
No, no, no, no...! 
Is everyone okay? 
Nana! 
I-i-I'm so sorry. I-i just... 
No, no, no, no, no, don't... 
Don't go! 
Has anyone seen my glass eye? 
Oh, it-it... 
It's right here, miss crawly. 
I've got it. 
Look out! 
No. 
Oh, dad. 
I'm so sorry. 
--He must be dead. 
--Oh, my gosh. 
Mommy's here! 
I'm standing 
at the scene right now, Judy, 
and I can tell you 
it is a miracle 
anyone survived 
this unbelievable disaster. 
Um, yeah, 
buster moon certainly 
brought down the house 
once and for all today. 
And, although Mr. moon has not been available for questions, 
unconfirmed reports suggest 
- he was responsible 
for building a water tank 
that exploded 
and flooded the building. 
I've been told the 250 squid 
Page 42/52
who had been part 
of moon's display 
- are, in fact, employees... 
-Eddie? -...Of three-star 
restaurant les calmars... 
- There's someone at the door. ...and that none of them 
were harmed 
- during the incident. 
Whether they will be returning to their usual work 
is not yet... 
Oh, no. 
Mr. moon? 
Come on, moon, 
you can't just hide out 
in your buddy's pool house. 
Yeah, we just want to make sure you're all right, that's all. 
-Hey, Mr. moon. 
-You okay? 
Guys, look, i-i-I'm sorry 
about what happened, 
and-and the prize money and... Oh, it's okay. 
No, none of this is okay. 
At least we're all in one piece. Yeah, and you know what, 
i bet we can find 
some other place 
to put the show on. 
- Right? 
- Yeah. 
The show? 
Guys, I'm done. 
-Are you serious? 
-What do you mean, done? 
Come on! 
Didn't you see this? Huh? 
Look, it says 
I'm a danger to society. 
- What? 
- Gah! 
"A deluded, washed-up charlatan Page 43/52
who never had a hit 
in his career." 
Oh, come on, 
you don't believe all that. 
Yeah, I do. 
Listen, you're not the only one who lost something here. 
- We all did. 
- Ja! 
I mean, I lost any chance 
of ever speaking 
to my dad again over this show. - Sorry. 
- Oh, Mr. moon, don't... 
Ah, forget about it. 
What is this? 
I don't understand. 
Come on, 
let's get out of here. 
Mr. moon? 
Meena, please. 
Um, i-i baked a cake for you 
'cause, well, 
i know you're sad right now 
and probably afraid 
to try again and... 
Yeah, I am afraid. 
I'm afraid that this... 
This, me, right now, 
this is who I am. 
This is... 
This is my lot for life-- 
that I'm not the guy 
that my dad wanted me to be, 
not by a million miles. 
But-but you told me... 
What? What? What did I say? 
Well, you know, 
"don't let fear stop you 
from doing the thing you love." Ah, come... th-that's just 
a bunch of stupid, corny... 
-No, it's not. 
-What, y-you really believe 
Page 44/52
that you're gonna be a singer? Well, yeah, maybe. 
Well, then you're just 
as big a fool as I am! 
Look, kid. 
You and me, we-we're both afraid for good reason. 
Right, 'cause deep down 
we know... 
...we just don't have 
what it takes. 
-Hey, buster. 
-Hey, Eddie. 
Man, where'd you go? 
Are you okay? 
Listen, could you meet me 
at the corner 
of dinsdale and lemington? 
Now? 
Yeah, please. 
And could you, uh... 
Could you bring me 
a spare speedo? 
Speedo? 
Hey, miss crawly. 
Oh, hello, Eddie. 
Hey. Did you bring the speedo? -The... oh, yeah, uh, here. 
-Great. 
- You're a real pal, Eddie. 
Oh, our first customer. 
Miss crawly, fill the bucket. 
Be right with you, sir. 
--Wait. 
What are you doing? 
The only other job I know. 
Just glad my dad 
isn't here to see this. 
Miss crawly, if you would... 
Thanks. 
Well, gotta go to work. 
Uh... 
I'll see you around, Eddie. 
Come on! 
Page 45/52
I ain't got all day! 
Yeah, yeah... 
- Ah, forget it. 
Too slow, dude. 
Whoa! 
One moment, please, sir. 
Well, you know the good thing 
about hitting rock bottom? 
There's only one way left to go, and that's up. 
Come on. 
You wash, I'll dry. 
Thank you, miss crawly. 
Buster, where are you going? 
I, uh... 
Do you think you could sing 
like that 
in front of a real audience? 
I don't know, but I want to try. Good. 
'Cause I want to see it. 
We are? Seriously? 
--Oh, my gosh! Okay. 
Okay, yes, I'll be right over. Hello? 
Oh, hello, Mr. moon. 
Some say 
he's the worst showman 
this city's ever seen. 
Some say he's 
a walking disaster. 
A loose Cannon. 
Well, tomorrow night, 
the name buster moon 
will go down 
-in entertainment history 
once and for all, - 
as he and this bunch 
of bumbling amateurs 
attempt to restage the show 
that brought down his theater. Ah, don't you worry, Mike. 
All is forgiven. 
Just glad you're back 
Page 46/52
in one piece. 
Oh, yeah, you're too kind, 
Mr. moon. 
And, uh, the... the prize money? It's, uh... I mean, it's... 
It's real this time, right? 
There is no prize money, 
'cause there's no competition. 
Tonight you're singing 
for yourselves. 
Two minutes, everybody. 
Final checks. 
Singing for ourselves? 
Unbelievable. 
What-what-what is...? 
Who's he...? 
This is crazy. 
I'm out of here. 
- Hello! - 
uh, we-we're... 
We're putting on a show here. 
-Hey! -Come on. 
-You all should come and see it. You! Come on! 
Come on, fella! 
It's going to be really good. 
Hey. How's our new 
stagehand getting on? 
-He's learning fast. 
-All set and standing by! 
I love this headset! 
The audience 
are in their seats, Mr. moon. 
Great! 
--Hmm. 
- Caspar! 
- That's all? 
Get your pants back on, 
young man! 
Please, you guys, please. 
Please sit down! 
Hey, put your shoes back on 
right now! 
Zoe, I saw that! Stop it! 
Page 47/52
And, Leo, 
that is disgusting! 
Well, John, I've covered 
many disasters 
for this network, 
but this is sure to... 
Oh, oh, they're about to start. Okay, guys, listen up. 
Look, I gotta tell you, um, 
there's not much of an audience out there tonight. 
But you know what? 
It doesn't matter. 
It really doesn't. 
'Cause tonight is our night. 
And whatever happens, 
i just want you all to know 
how proud I am to be 
a part of this with you. 
Good luck, Mr. moon. 
Good luck, every... whoa! 
Whoop. Uh... sorry. 
Just jumped the cue there. 
Don't worry. 
I... i-I'm gonna get 
the hang of this. 
Here we go. 
All creatures great and small, - welcome to... 
Oh, hello there. 
Great. 
Welcome to our newly 
refurbished, open-air theater. Yes, I am your host, 
buster moon... 
-You ready, big guy? 
-Ja! 
I'm, like, totally ready. 
All right. 
Let's do this. 
Gunter and Rosita! 
Aren't they great? 
What, are you kidding me? 
It's like watching jell-o 
Page 48/52
dancing around. 
Like you could do 
any better, pip-squeak. 
All right, all right, all right. Hey! You want to see 
something great? 
I'll show you great. 
Yeah, mommy! 
-Gunter and Rosita! 
Kids, no. 
Back to your seats. 
-The show's still... 
-Okay, okay. Aah! 
- Norman! 
All right! Piggy power! 
- That was great! 
Well, it seems I'm not 
the only one who actually 
enjoyed that. 
Crowds are beginning 
to arrive at the scene. 
--Help! 
I'm so sorry, Mr. moon. 
Johnny, you're on next. 
What is that? 
Turn it down, will you? 
Oi, didn't you hear me? 
I said turn it... 
-What the...? 
-Hey, hey! 
What about that, huh? 
Give it up for Johnny, folks. 
--Yeah! 
Johnny! Johnny! 
What's with the face? 
You were great. 
They loved you. 
Yeah, thanks, Rosita. 
All right. 
Welcome to all you newcomers. 
You are just in time 
to meet a teenager 
who was recently dumped 
by her boyfriend. 
Page 49/52
- Aw... 
- I know, right? 
But she's gonna chase 
those blues away 
with a song of her very own. 
Allow me to introduce 
the singing sensation, ash. 
--Judith? 
You are all trespassing 
on private property. 
-What?! 
-And you will leave right now. I didn't... no, no, no, 
no, no, no, Judith... 
All of you. 
Ugh. Seriously? 
She's not even that good. 
Yeah, yeah, totally. 
Uh, you guys okay? 
Ash! Ash! Ash! Ash! 
Ash! Ash! Ash! 
What about that? 
We just witnessed the birth 
of a genuine rock star! 
Moon, you... 
You've got some stuck here. 
Ow! 
He may be tiny, 
but there is no denying 
his enormous talent. 
Would you please welcome 
to the stage Mike. 
What are you doing back here? 
Relax, sweetheart. 
Just came back 
to show you bozos 
how it's really done. 
Now, watch this. 
That is Mike! 
I'm so proud of you. 
Uh-oh. 
You gotta be kidding me. 
Negative. 
I've lost sight of the suspect Page 50/52
and am terminating pursuit. 
That pip-squeak 
really was great. 
Thank you. 
Thank you so much. 
Oh, please. 
You're too kind, really. 
Look at me. 
I'm turning red. 
Stop. I can't take it. 
Keep... keep it coming. 
Well, I better get back. 
They'll be wondering 
what happened to me. 
You'll visit me, though, yeah? Yeah, course I will. 
See you, son. 
We have one final act 
for you tonight. 
Would you please welcome 
to the stage 
for her first ever 
live appearance... 
Meena. 
Meena? 
Is she coming out? 
Meena, what's wrong? 
Are you okay? 
Uh, I can't move. 
I'm... I'm terrified. 
Give me your hand, kid. 
Okay, deep breaths. 
Deep breaths. 
And remember what I told you. 
You will not 
feel afraid anymore 
if you just start singing. 
- Meena! Meena! 
I can do it... okay. 
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. Um... 
Uh, okay. 
Uh... uh... 
Sing. 
Okay. 
Page 51/52
Whoo-hoo! 
Guys, guys, wait. 
We can talk this over, right? 
We're all reasonable 
individuals here. 
Get in! Quick! 
Oh, thank you, sweetheart. 
Whew! That was close. 
Yeah. 
Come on! 
-Meena! You did it! -That's my granddaughter! -She did it! 
Go, go! 
Oh, dad, 
i wish you could see this. 
Everybody ready? 
All creatures great and small, welcome to the new moon theater.

Chow time! 
It's time! 
Floyd, step up to the door. 
Dinner time. 
Only my friends call me Floyd. 
You ain't got no friends, Floyd. What's that? 
That is called loaf. 
A loaf. 
It's got a little bit 
of pasghetti in there. 
Toenails. 
Rat shit. 
Everything a growing fella needs, like you. 
Come here. Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret? 
Yeah. 
One day... 
Somehow, some way, 
I'm gonna get outta here. 
And I'm gonna rain down on you 
like the holy ghost. 
Man, you just threatened 
a staff member. 
Yeah? 
Yeah, you have. 
Do something. 
Let's have some fun. 
Whoop his ass! 
Open the goddamn gate! 
Come on, guys. 
Don't waste my time. 
Sector C! Pull your heads out of your ass! The boss is on deck! 
Open it! 
Bravo 14 open perimeter fence. 
Stay back. 
If she moves, 
fire her up, all right? 
You gonna come down 
from there or what? 
Yeah. 
Look at you. 
Page 2/51
You know the rules, hotness. 
You gotta keep off these bars. 
- What, these bars? 
- Yeah. Those bars. 
Oh, my god. 
You are really in bad shape upstairs, lady! Gonna come in here 
and tell me that? 
Or are you too scared? 
Come on, I'm bored. 
I'm bored. 
Play with me. 
You put five of my guards 
in the hospital, honey. 
No one's gonna play with you. 
You sleep on the ground. 
I sleep where I want, 
when I want, with who I want. 
Oh, man. 
I love you. 
Alpha one. 
Hit her. 
Come on, man. You're six foot four. She's a tiny little girl. 
You got a choice tonight. 
What we got here? 
We got chocolates, 
strawberry or vanilla. 
My job is to keep you alive until you die. Do you understand that? 
Spring break! 
That is just a whole lot of pretty in a whole lot of crazy. 
The world changed 
when Superman flew across the sky. And then it changed again 
when he didn't. 
Remember. 
And that is why I'm here. 
Suicide squad 
Hello, Amanda. 
We lose a national hero... 
But you sit there looking like 
the cat that ate the canary. 
Page 3/51
I've eaten a lot of canaries. 
It's taken some work. 
But I finally have them. 
The worst of the worst. 
There's rumors, Amanda that... 
Some of them have abilities. 
The rumors are right. 
You know what the problem 
with a metahuman is? 
The human part. 
We got lucky with Superman. 
He shared our values. 
The next Superman might not. 
You're playing with fire, Amanda. I'm fighting fire with fire. 
You are not going to pitch us that task force x project of yours again, are you? Yes 
but this time, you're gonna listen. Floyd lawton, aka Deadshot. 
Deadshot 
family: 
he's the most wanted hitman 
in the world. 
Let's say he has an elite clientele. What? 
Hey, Angelo. 
This is the exterminator you called for your rat problem. 
My account's looking a little thin. No one gets paid until 
what needs to get done gets done. Nope. That's not the rules. 
No money, no honey. 
Whoa, here is your boy right now. With about 20 of his 
new best friends. 
I'm still seeing zeroes over here, Angie. Listen. 
Stop being cute and do your job! Oh. 
They're taking him outta the car now. In about 30 seconds, 
Page 4/51
your window is gonna close forever. Okayay, okay, okay. 
Relax. 
There was an accounting error. 
We sent it. 
Now double it for being a dickhead. You got 10 seconds. 
We're not the kind of people 
you play with. 
Did you just... 
Did you threaten me? 
This dude's gonna get a sore throat from all the singing he's about to do. You son of a bitch. 
Pleasure doing business with you, Angie. But everyone has a weakness. 
And a weakness can be leveraged. His is an 11-year-old 
honor student in Gotham city. 
His daughter. 
So we watched her and waited. 
You should talk to mama more. 
Yeah, yeah, I know. 
Mama stays in bed a lot. 
Yeah. 
She's still going out at night? Dad, it's okay. 
I can take care of her. 
I know how to make pancakes now. Hey babe, that's beautiful. 
She's supposed to be taking 
care of you, you know. 
That's how that's 
supposed to work. 
I want you to come live with me. All right? I came into some resources. I'm gonna get us spot. 
It's gonna be nice, all right? 
Mama says I can't live with you because you kill people. 
That's not true. That's a lie. 
She's lying to you. 
Daddy... 
I know you do bad things. 
Page 5/51
Don't worry. 
I still love you. 
Come on. 
And you caught him? 
Not me. 
I just gave an anonymous tip 
to the right guy in Gotham city. I'mma figure this out. 
All right? 
It's over, Deadshot. 
I don't want to do this 
in front of your daughter. 
Daddy, please. 
Zoe, move! 
Please Daddy. 
Don't do it. 
Please. 
Don't do it. 
All right. 
I love you, Daddy. 
So now we have the man 
who never misses. 
Where'd you put him? 
Let's just say. I put him in a hole and threw away the hole. 
Harley Quinn. 
Accomplice to the murder of Robin 
ARKHAM: 
Before she ran off 
and joined the circus... 
She was known as Dr. Harleen Quinzel. A psychiatrist at Arkham asylum. She was assigned to the clown himself. Dr. Quinzel. 
You know, 
I live for these moments with you. What do you got? 
I got you a kitty. 
So thoughtful. 
She thought she was curing him... But she was falling in love. 
There is something you 
could do for me, doctor 
Page 6/51
Anything. 
I mean, yeah. 
I need a machine gun. 
A machine gun? 
Talk about a workplace romance gone wrong. Get off me! 
Get...! 
What do we have here? 
I did everything you said. 
I helped you. 
You helped me by erasing my mind what in memories I had! 
Now, 
you left me in a black hole 
of rage and confusion. 
Am I not the medicine you practice, Dr. Quinzel? 
What are you gonna do? 
You gonna kill me, Mr. J? 
What? 
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you. 
I'm just gonna hurt ya... 
really, really bad. 
You think so? 
Well, I can take it. 
I wouldn't want you to break those perfect porcelain cap teeth 
when the juice hits your brain. 
La la. 
La la la. 
They became the king and 
queen of Gotham city. 
And god help anyone 
who disrespected the queen. 
We finally meet. 
He don't shake hands. 
But sit down and have a drink. 
Hey, J. 
On behalf of everybody, 
welcome back. 
I wanted to come by and 
personally say thank you. 
You making me good money. 
I'm making you good money. 
Page 7/51
Are you sweet talking me? 
Ha. Ha. Ha. 
I love this guy. 
He's so intense! 
You're lucky man. 
You got a bad bitch. 
Oh, that she is. 
The fire in my loins. 
The itch in my crotch. 
The one, the only, 
the infamous Harley Quinn! 
Oh, come to Daddy. 
- Puddin'! 
- Oh yeah. 
Listen.. 
You are my gift to this 
handsome hunka hunka! 
You belong to him now. 
Well. 
You're cute! 
You want me? 
I'm all yours. 
I don't want no beef. 
You don't want no beef? 
You don't want no beef? 
- Why, what's wrong? You don't like me? - You don't want no beef? 
Fine. 
Don't waste my time then. 
This is your lady. 
Look... 
Are you enjoying yourself? 
No. 
That's your lady, joker. 
- That's right. 
- Yeah. 
Yo, J. 
And that was just the beginning. Come on, puddin'. 
Do it! 
Oh... 
We have got company. 
Batsy, Batsy, Batsy. 
She's crazier than him. 
Page 8/51
And more fearless. 
Stupid bat, you're ruining date night! Puddin'. 
Puddin', I can't swim! 
But the bat got her, too. 
She's in the same hole as Deadshot. And then there's the aussie. 
Digger Harkness. 
Or as the tabloids call him. 
Capitan Boomerang. 
Captain boomerang 
fetishes: 
We're gonna be rich. 
Yeah, you and me, mate. 
Go and get the car. 
He robbed every bank in Australia at least once. 
Then he came to America 
for a fresh target set. 
Doesn't work well with others. No honor among thieves, eh? 
But he tangled with a metahuman and lived to tell about it. 
And have you heard of 
the pyro kinetic homeboy? 
How'd you catch him? 
We didn't. 
He surrendered. 
Chato Santana. 
On the streets they call him El diablo. This LA gangbanger thought 
he was the king of the world... Until he lost his queen. 
Gets jumped in a prison riot 
and incinerates half the yard. The security video is incredible. Oh, Jesus. 
- What the hell is that? 
- His name is Waylon Jones. 
Evolution took a step backwards with this one. 
Yo, K.C! 
It's supper. 
Page 9/51
Go ahead, 
open that up, B. 
Got something real nice 
for you today, boy. 
Hey boss, is it true he chewed 
the dude's hand off? 
Look at that, right there, 
vulcanized rubber 
Give me that, Smitty. 
Where you at? 
Don't make me get you. 
They call him Killer Croc. 
There you are, are you hungry? 
You want some food? 
Go ahead, feed the man. 
What are you 
in the mood for tonight? 
I got a double cheese burger, 
onion rings, a little coleslaw. 
Or a giant skinless goat? 
He looked like a monster. 
So they treated him 
like a monster. 
Then he became a monster. 
He was chased out 
of Gotham by the Bat. 
Went searching for sanctuary elsewhere. He never found it. 
I saved the best for last. 
The Witch. 
A witch? 
I'm talking a flying, spell-casting, making-shit-disappear witch. 
A sorceress from another dimension. Another world. 
Archaeologist Dr. June Moone... 
Wondered into the wrong cave. 
June... 
She opened something she shouldn't have... releasing a metahuman more powerful than any we've encountered. 
The enchantress. 
Enchantress aka dr June Moone 
she inhabits Dr. Moone's body now. Page 10/51
Where is this witch? 
In my pocket. 
Now tell him why she won't 
turn you into a frog. 
Some say the witch has 
a secret buried heart... 
And whoever finds it 
can control the witch. 
So we searched the cave 
where she turned up... 
And we found her heart. 
- That thing's her heart? 
- Mmm. 
She's vulnerable without it. 
You want to put our 
national security in the hands of... Witches, gangbangers, and crocodiles? Don't forget about 
the joker's girlfriend. 
These are villains, Amanda. 
What makes you think 
you can control them? 
Because getting people to act 
against their own self-interests... For the national security of the United States is what I do for a living. You take the finest special forces officer this nation has ever produced... Colonel Rick Flag. 
Colonel Rick Flag. 
Help me. 
I assigned him to watch Dr. Moone, and just as I hoped... 
It got personal. 
Are you gonna 
kiss me or not? 
I have the witch's heart. 
And Dr. Moone has his. 
Now he'll follow my orders 
as holy writ. 
In a world of flying men and monsters... This is the only way 
to protect our country. 
The Pentagon Washington DC 
Page 11/51
what if Superman had decided to fly down, rip off the roof of the white house... And grab the President of the United States right out of the overall office? 
Who would've stopped him? 
We got contingency plans 
for nukes in north Korea... 
Anthrax in our mail. 
We got fluoride in our water. 
But what happens 
if the next Superman... 
Becomes a terrorist? 
Amanda Waller has a plan. 
Amanda. 
I wanna build a team of some very bad people who I think can do some good. Like fight the next war, 
defeat the next Superman. 
Not on my watch. 
You're not putting those monsters back out on the street in our name. General, we run them covertly 
non-attributed. Strictly need to know. And if they get caught, 
we throw them under the bus. 
The next war will be fought 
with these metahumans. 
Ours, or theirs. 
We're not the only ones 
kicking up rocks looking for them. You know we can't 
control these people. 
June, be strong. 
Dr. Moone. 
Enchantress. 
Meet the enchantress. 
Everything we know about her, 
is in your briefing packs. 
She's walked this earth 
for a very long time 
and will likely be here 
when we're long gone. 
This meeting is 
is now a magic show? 
Page 12/51
Magic or not, this girl can do some pretty incredible things. Go get it, girl. 
How about a little something from the Weapons ministry vault in Tehran? We've been chasing 
these plans for years. 
Please don't touch me. 
Please don't touch me. 
Thank you. 
We'd like Dr. Moone back. 
Enchantress. 
Please. 
Please. 
I'm sorry. 
I can't-I can't do that again. Flag, get her out of here. 
I move to... 
Authorize Amanda Waller to establish Task force X under the Argus program. All right. 
Thank you, Mr. chairman. 
I know you do bad things. 
Don't worry. 
I still love you. 
Welcome to Belle Reve, 
special security barracks. 
How you doing, man? 
Why don't you kiss her ass? 
She's in charge. 
Welcome, ma'am. 
How are you? 
I'm here to assist you in anyway. Where are they? 
Are you the devil? 
Maybe. 
Ain't you scared? 
Why'd they put you down here? 
I asked. 
Open that gate. 
Yo, ese 
Hola, amigo. 
Put that burrito down. 
You got visitors, man. 
Page 13/51
What's up? 
Hey, you want some of this? 
Come down here. 
That ain't me. 
That wasn't you? 
Nah, they say it's me, 
but that ain't me. 
That guy's gone. 
He's dead. 
And yet, here you are. 
Ma'am. 
Let me try to talk to him. 
You wanna die in here, buddy? 
You got a real shot at 
walking at the block again. 
Have a nice cold beer, a nice meal. A women. 
Look, man... 
You ain't the first to ask, 
and you ain't gonna be the last. Ask what? 
I'm a man, okay? 
I ain't no weapon. 
I'mmna die in peace before 
I raise my fists again. 
I've caused enough harm. 
Bye 
All right, unlock him. 
What? 
You heard me. 
You know what this man can do? I'm here to find out. 
Lose the restraints. 
Thank you. 
What? 
This uh... 
Cheerleading tryouts? 
Let's go. 
Let's see what you can do. 
They say you never missed a shot. Prove it. 
Now you got one in the chamber. What cha' gonna do with it? 
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Page 14/51
- Hey! 
- Shit! 
- Drop it. 
Give me the word, boss. 
I'll drop him. 
Everybody calm down. 
Griggs, tell your men to stand down. Tell them to put it down. 
Stand down! 
Colonel, for the record, this is exactly what I was concerned about! 
What's for dinner? 
Ames, if this man shoots me... 
I want you to kill him... 
And I want you to go 
clear my browser history. 
See... 
The firing pin is filed down, right? Mag full of dummy rounds. 
If I pull the trigger, nothing happens. You're absolutely right. 
Why would we give a loaded weapon to an infamous hitman? 
Go ahead, pull the trigger. 
Empty it. 
Don't empty nothing. 
You don't even know this lady. 
I've known you, 
like, nine months. 
Remember when I brought you that cookie? That was a real cookie. 
Aw, shit. 
What? 
Shit. 
Oops 
Oh... 
Y'all jokers must be crazy. 
All right. 
Now you know what you're buying. Let me tell you the price. 
First... 
I want outta here. 
Second, I want full custody 
of my daughter. 
Page 15/51
All right? 
And her mom can have like... 
Supervised visits. 
But her stank ass boyfriend can't come. Darnell can't come. 
- Darnell's out. 
- He's out. 
Third, y'all gonna pay for 
my daughter's whole education. 
Best schools. 
And then I want her 
to go to college 
like Harvard or Yale. 
- Ivy league. 
- Ivy league, yeah. 
- One of them big joints, you know? - Mm-hm. 
And if she can't cut it, 
and her grades start slipping, 
- I need you to white-people that thing. - Mm-hm. 
- You know how y'all do. 
- Oh yeah. 
You know, right? 
Okay. 
Now that's my price. 
But I'm concerned, 'cause I don't see nobody writing shit down. 
You're in no position 
to make any demands. 
Oh. 
I'm sorry. 
You thought I was talking to you. No, errand boy. 
I'm talking to your boss. 
That's my price, sweetie. 
You know what it is. 
You notice these are criminals? Mm. 
They're psychotic antisocial freaks. It makes no sense. 
Let me hit the tier one units 
and I'll build you 
a team of pipe hitters who'll do Page 16/51
anything you can dream up. 
I mean, you need real soldiers. Not these scumbags. 
In World War 2, the US Navy 
made a deal with the mafia 
to protect it's ships 
on the waterfront. 
This ain't World War 2. 
It's World War 3. 
What are you really up to? 
It's a "need to know", and, all you need to know is you work for me. That can change with a phone call. I have friends too, you know. 
There you go. 
Call'em. 
But without you minding her, 
your lady friend stays here 
strapped to a board 
in a drug-induced coma. 
They warned me about you. 
My dumbass didn't believe the stories. Nobody does. 
Where is she? 
It's complex. 
This is not just her. 
Everybody's disappeared. 
There's this new law, 
where if you're a bad enough bad guy, they stamp "terrorist" on your jacket. They send you to 
this swamp in Louisiana. 
A black site. 
That's where she is. 
So what do we do? 
Bring the car around. 
We're going for a drive. 
Lester. Lester. 
Hit me one more time! 
And... 
Come on, man! 
You gotta call upstairs and tell them to float me another 10k. 
- You got it? 
Page 17/51
- Hey. 
- Boss wants to see you. 
- You know who I am? 
Good job, man. 
He's killing it. 
Come on, man. 
Why am I here? 
All right! Yeah! I'm down. 
I get it, all right? 
I've had a run of bad decks. 
Not my fault. 
All right? 
Dude, this is real. 
I had to stop these guys 
from burning down your house 
with your kids in it. 
But, you're lucky. 
Yeah, maybe. 
Why-why do you think so? 
Yo, slick. 
What's up? 
Griggs. 
You are? 
You might wanna keep your mouth shut. Can I go, man? 
What the hell's going on, man? This is crazy. 
Blah, blah-blah, blah-blah, 
blah-blah, blah-blah. 
All of that chitchat 
is gonna get you hurt. 
Oh! 
My god. 
I could tell you meant that. 
Yeah. 
You're gonna be my friend. 
Enchantress. 
Log time of death, 16:20 
June? 
- Let's get her down to the morgue. - June? 
June? 
June. 
June. 
Page 18/51
What did you do? 
Shhh. 
Okay. 
Sister. 
Brother. 
Plus, it could be the routing number. Wanna go for drinks? 
I got this. 
Enchantress. 
God damn it! 
June... June! 
June, I'm sorry. 
June. 
She... 
She went somewhere. 
If you have to choose 
between her or me... 
Stop her. 
Promise me you'll stop her. 
Even if it kills me. 
Sir? 
Sir, you okay? 
Can you breathe? 
Did you take anything? 
This is 21. 
Send medical to my location. 
I'm a physician. 
Roger. 
Bringing medical to your location. No pulse. 
Starting compressions. 
Sir. 
Midway city is under attack. 
It's a non-human entity. 
I think you know what to do, sir. Activate Task force X 
and get Amanda Waller 
and her whole circus 
on scene asap. 
Yes, sir. 
We're gonna live with Task force X. Pull 'em. 
Prisoners, get down on your knees. Now! 
Page 19/51
Down on your knees! Hands in the air! Turn around. 
Hands up high! 
Hey, I'm cooperating. 
All right? 
- This is me being cool. 
- Take her. 
Do not fire that goddamn weapon! Damn it! 
Open the gate! 
Everybody, line up for extraction. Let's go! 
Let's move, move! 
Yeah! 
Open the door! Let's go! 
- Alright. Go! Go! 
- Move it! Move it! 
Hit him! 
Hurry up, before he smokes us! Where you at? 
Whoa! 
Is that the new guy? 
What is that? 
What is that? 
- Who are you? 
- Standby, arming device. 
Who are you? 
I don't know who you are. 
- Device armed. 
- Hey. 
Hey, I'm talking to you. 
Hey, I'm talking to you. 
Injection successful. 
Location verified. 
Anybody who touches me is dead. Anybody who tou... 
Ahh! 
Lady. 
- Injection successful. 
- Hey. 
- Hey! Miss? What was that? 
- Location verified. 
- Oh. 
- Next! 
Page 20/51
Oh, you deaf. 
You one of them deaf hoes. 
- Oh. 
- All right, all right. Come on. Shut up, and get it done. 
Weeee. 
Listen, you're being transferred. I don't know where you're going. It's from Mr. J. 
You gonna tell him 
I took care of you? 
You're so screwed. 
What do you mean by that? 
What do you mean by that? 
Get off me! 
Get off me! 
Harley, what do you mean by that? Harley! 
Hey, I got a delivery. 
I have a gift basket for Dr. Van Criss. You're not on the access list. I can't let you in. Sorry. 
Hey, cool. 
Can I leave it with you? 
I'm way behind today. 
Thank you. 
You're a good man. 
Open up. 
Just please, do whatever they say. Do whatever they say. 
Just do it. 
This look neat. 
Light it up! Light it up! 
Light it up! 
He's right above us. 
This is a mistake. 
Rick, I can't do this. 
- I can't... 
- Listen. Listen. 
There's no other way. 
Just get it done. 
Just get it done. 
Enchantress. 
Flag, talk to me. 
Page 21/51
What' going on down there? 
Amanda, she bolted. 
Say it again? 
She bolted! 
Shit! 
Go! 
Worldwide military is on alert. 
Our weapons are ineffective. 
- I thought this was contained! 
- Pull everyone back to the evacuation zone. Guys, I need all three of you, 
follow me please. 
Anybody a universal donor? 
Anybody with blood. 
Bring those two over here. 
Blunt trauma, right forehead! 
This is the worst day of my life. 
All evacuees must report 
to a fema representative. 
What's going on in that city? 
Those assholes here yet? 
Yeah, they're here. 
Alpha, bravo team, on me. 
What the hell, Flag? 
Unlock 'em. 
Hi, boys! 
Harley Quinn. 
How do you do? 
Huh? 
What was that? 
I should kill everyone and escape? Sorry. 
The voices. 
I'm kidding. 
Jeez. 
That's not what they really said. 
What do we got here? 
12 pounds of shit 
in a 10-pound sack. 
Welcome to the party, capitan boomerang. Hey! 
Hey, hey, hey... 
What's going on, man? 
Calm down. 
Page 22/51
Hey, one minute I'm playing mahjong with me Nanna... 
Then this red streak 
hits me outta nowhere. 
Shut up! 
You were caught robbing a diamond exchange. I was not. 
Here comes slipknot... 
The man who coould climb anything. Wonderful. 
Have a good time, scumbag. 
Straighten up. 
She had a mouth. 
Listen up! 
In your necks... 
Injection you got, 
it's a nanite explosive. 
It's the size of a rice grain 
but it's powerful as a hand grenade. You disobey me, you die. 
You try to escape, you die. 
You otherwise irritate or vex me, and guess what? 
You die. 
I'm known to be quite vexing. 
I'm just forewarning you. 
Lady, shut up! 
This is the deal. 
You're going somewhere very bad... To do something that'll get you killed. But until that happens... 
You're my problem. 
So was that like a pep talk? 
Yeah. 
That was a pep talk. 
There's your shit. 
Grab what you need for a fight. 
We're wheels up in 10. 
You might wanna work on 
your team motivation thing. 
- You heard of Phil Jackson? 
- Yeah. 
He's like the gold standard, okay? Triangle, bitch. 
Page 23/51
Study 
what? 
Yo, get out of here. 
Won't fit anymore? 
Too much junk in the trunk? 
Nah. 
Every time I put this on, 
somebody dies. 
And? 
I like putting it on. 
Goody. 
Something tells me a whole lotta people are about to die. 
Yeah, it's us. 
We're being led to our deaths. 
Speak for yourself, mate. 
Hey, what's that crop on your face? Does it wash off? 
Hey, if you like a girl, can you light her cigarette with your pinkie? Because that would be real classy. Hey, y'all might wanna 
leave old boy alone. 
He could torch this whole joint. Ain't that right, ese? 
Ain't got nothing to worry 
about from me. 
I'm cool, homie. 
Behold the voice of god. 
For those of you who 
don't know me officially... 
My name is Amanda Waller. 
There's an active terrorist event in midway city. 
I want you to enter the city, 
rescue hvt-1 and get them to safety. I'm sorry. 
For those of us who don't speak good guy, what is HVT-1? 
The only person that 
matters in the city, 
the one person you can't kill. 
Complete the mission, you get 
time off your prison sentence. 
Page 24/51
Fail the mission, you die. 
Anything happens to colonel Flag, I'll kill every single one of you. Remember, I'm watching. 
I see everything. 
There's your pep talk. 
Compared to your shit, she killed it. So that's it? 
What, we some kind of suicide squad? I'll notify your next of kin. 
Alpha, bravo team. 
Mount up! 
Your' late. 
I was busy. 
I beg you. 
Please have mercy. 
This is katana. 
She's got my back. 
She can cut all of you in half with one sword stroke... 
Just like mowing the lawn. 
I would advise 
not getting killed by her. 
Her sword traps 
the souls of its victims. 
Harley Quinn. 
Nice to meet you. 
Love your perfume. 
What is that? 
The stench of death? 
Whoa. 
Easy, cowgirl. 
Ain't that kind of mission. 
Have a seat. 
She seems nice. 
I'm coming for you 
Shhh... 
Hey. 
Is he suppose 
to be green like that? 
Oh. 
Party foul. 
Not cool. 
Ooo. 
Page 25/51
Look at that pretty lights! 
Are you guys seeing this? 
What happened? 
Terror attack. 
Dirty bombs, bad guys 
shooting up the place with AKs. You know, usual shit. 
Right. 
Yeah, you're a bad liar. 
I don't know if they told you... But I'm a hitman. 
I'm not a fireman. 
I don't save people. 
Anything for a dollar, right? 
You know the dark places, too. Don't act like you don't. 
I'm a soldier. 
And you're a serial killer 
who takes credit cards. 
When the shooting starts, 
and it will, 
you'll cut and run. 
6-1 is going down. 
6-1 is going down hard. 
Stand by. Drop the ramp. 
Drop the ramp. 
Come on! 
Let's go! Let's go! 
Go, go! 
Come on! 
All right. All right. All right. Relax. 
What a ride! 
We're okay. We're okay. 
Assets are undamaged. 
Mind games. 
- What's that? 
- All this bomb in the neck crap. That ain't real, mate 
see, they're trying to trap us with our own minds, right? 
But you look around, 
we're free, brah. 
How do you know this? 
Page 26/51
Just trust me. 
I know, all right? It's a con. Now I'm going, 
because I got a life to live. 
Question is, are you coming? 
- Yeah. 
- Smart. 
Where're you going? 
Hold your fire. 
Sorry. 
It's what I do. 
Nanite detonation control armed damn it. 
Now that's killer app. 
Okay. 
You wanna keep playing 
the Hollywood squares version of "I'll blow your freaking head off?" Are you next? 
You tripping, homie. 
You next, Deadshot? 
Did you just threatened me? 
Oh, yeah. 
He just threatened me. 
Move. 
You have a boyfriend? 
All right, I'm gonna kill him. Well, you better make it quick 'cause he's gonna kill all of us one by one. I'm gonna drop him, the sword lady. 5 or 7 of these seals. 
After that, I'm gonna need some help, you down? 
Always. 
What about the shit in our necks? Your friend's gonna 
help us out with that, right? 
You're my friend, too. 
Stay evil, doll face. 
Spread the word. 
So, I'm thinking if we move together we can kill all of these guys 
and go our separate ways, yeah? Sounds good. 
Page 27/51
Spread the word. 
Psst, hoy. 
Hoy. 
We need your help, man. 
When the time is right, 
you hit Flag with a fireball, 
he'll be too busy burning to death to have a go at us with his final doom. Then what? 
Then we get out of here. 
And do what? 
What are you, a bloody socker? Ease with all the questions. 
Freedom, man. 
Freedom, you remember that, don't you? We're criminals, you know that, right? Yeah, it's great. 
Come on, do the bastard. 
Hey, becareful. 
- He eats people. 
- Solemn mother superia, what? He eats people for reals, homie. He's a cannibal. 
Ah. 
No. 
What did you say to him? 
Nothing. 
Just having a laugh. 
No worries. 
I'm standing by 
for follow on tasking. 
C2, what is the 
operational load of the PLS? 
Boss, we got people up here. 
I'm on my way. 
Shit! 
Amanda, we have hostiles up ahead. Flag, get out of there. 
We're not here to fight them. 
We know that doesn't work. 
Copy that. 
We're diverting. 
Bump out second squad 
two blocks east. 
Page 28/51
We'll pass through you, 
continue north. 
Take bravo two blocks east. 
We'll leapfrog through you 
once you're in position. 
Copy that. 
Hey. 
I like these odds, mate. 
You just say the word. 
Yeah. 
Come on. 
Yeah. 
Uh. 
Hold that thought. 
Rick, why do they look like that? Stay cool. 
What the hell are they? 
You cut and run. 
I'll blow your head off. 
Damn it. 
Hit 'em! 
Huh. 
Hey. 
Get off me! 
Get off me, you son of a... 
Flag! 
- Good riddance. 
- Harley! 
He dies, we die. 
- Thanks. 
- Shut up. 
Backblast, clear! 
Pinky. 
That's how I cut and run. 
Hey. 
Hey, come on. 
What? 
I saw it move. 
See? It flinched. 
I think. 
Hey. 
You were some help, Princess. 
It's better this way. 
Trust me. 
Page 29/51
Oh, yeah. 
You're the fire bloke. Eh? 
- Yeah, I was. Yeah. 
- Right, yeah. Hey. 
Well, look at here. 
It's fire! 
The brief said terrorist. 
- You want to start explaining this? - If I told you, would you believe me? - What are they? 
- I don't know. 
That's bullshit. 
Thing is, he owned a $3000 watch. Is that a person? 
It was. 
Now it's not. 
Hey, don't! 
What? 
We got a job to do. 
We're moving. 
Get your boys moving. 
Let's go. 
Waller, we are moving on the objective. We lost contact with bravo, 
you got a visual? 
Stand by. 
Anything on the other squad? 
No, ma'am. 
Go-7, I need your sensors 
in those coordinates. 
Flag, it's a negative. 
They were engaged when you were, but we lost them. 
Seriously? 
What the hell is wrong 
with you people? 
We're bad guys. 
It's what we do. 
Hey, Deadshot, 
I've been thinking. 
We don't come together, 
no one walking out of here alive. Mm. 
And? 
Page 30/51
These people respect you, 
you got influence. 
- What's your threat right now? 
- You're a man of your word, right? I want my mission. 
And you want your life 
and your kid back. 
You help me keep this 
motley corporate in line, 
I'll hook you up. 
While there is the puppet master, - you ain't got shit to hook me up with. - I got plenty of my own strings to pull. You just get me to the top 
of that target building 
and get my rescuee 
on that extraction helo... 
- And you're going to make sure I get paid? - Yeah, you get paid. 
You get paid and 
you get your fresh start. 
Take a knee. 
Our body's at the top of that building. We get up there... 
Pull them out of the vault 
they're hiding in. 
Helos extract us off the roof. 
- It's Miller time. 
- Check 
Flag, who's up there? 
I'ts none of your concern. 
- Do you know who's up there? 
- Nope. 
You... 
You're not leaving me. 
You're not leaving me! 
You, you, you 
are a pain in the ass. 
I have done everything your said, every test, every trial, every initiation. I have proved I love you, 
just accept it. 
Gada gada gada ga... 
I am not someone who is... 
Page 31/51
loved. 
I'm an idea, 
state of mind. 
I excute my will 
according to my plan and you... 
Doctor, are not part of my plans. 
Please let me in. 
I promise... 
Let me in. 
I promise I won't hurt you. 
Promise? 
Promise? 
Hey, dickface! 
Mind screaming at your bitch 
somewhere else. 
I was going to say, 
"I wouldn't do that if I were you." Don't hurt me. 
I'll be your friend. 
Do it. 
Do, do, do, do, do it. 
My heart scares you 
and a gun doesn't? 
DO IT! 
If you weren't so crazy, 
I'd think you're insane. 
Go... away. 
Harlet, you coming? 
Why do you eat people? 
Give me power. 
Would you like to eat me? 
- Hell, no. 
- Aw, why not? 
I don't want your crazy. 
Says the guys 
who lives in a sewer. 
At least I know it's a sewer. 
Oh, I get it 
Because it's like, 
this is a sewer too. 
Only with nice shops and restaurants, right? You hate mankind much? 
Let me guess. 
Mommy didn't take you to 
Page 32/51
Chuck E. Cheese on your 6th birthday. I can recommend a good therapist. Why? 
Because I'm bored. 
I need a victim, a mind to 
pry apart and spit in. 
You just leave it, mate. 
She's a rabbit hole, don't fall in. And here's one now. 
Japanese, female, mid-twenties, 5 foot 5, good health, 
athletic and... 
an only child, 
with deep seeded father issues. Daddy wanted a son, 
so she has to hide behind a mask. I am not... hiding. 
Yeah, that was gangster. 
Harley, why don't you stop 
acting like a drunken stripper. You want to tell me 
what the hell is going on then? Because... 
I smell a rat. 
If they don't blow our heads off, we'll have to fight our way 
out of this city. 
I need you to play nice 
with the other children. 
And quietly return to my cage. Sure. 
Okay. 
Hey, that's okay. 
Sellout, I get it. 
Like you. 
I know how the world works, okay? And when it comes to the heart, everyone for themselves, right? Waller? 
We're about to enter the building. Get that chopper ready. 
What you say 
we get this over with? 
What the hell? 
Page 33/51
Deadshot. 
Fall back. 
You mind if we tag along? 
Looks like we have 
a spot of luck, eh? 
Be a walk in the park. 
Easy peasy. 
Don't make me shoot you. 
God damn it. 
Harley! 
Go. Go. Go. 
Go. Go. 
I am close be ready... 
Hey, guys! 
Come on. 
Let's go. 
Ma'am. 
I got motion detectors going off on the secure floors. 
Flag. 
- They're all around you. 
- Hold. 
Use extreme caution. 
I don't like this, Flag. 
I don't like it either. 
Pussy. 
I will knock your ass out. 
I do not care 
that you're a girl. 
They're after Flag again! 
Son of a bitch! 
Get off me! 
Circle up! 
Circle around him! 
Let me fight! 
You die, we die. 
Clear! 
Everyone move out. 
- Where've you been, homie? 
- This ain't my fight! 
You know what? 
You don't stand for shit. 
You ain't about shit! 
Don't touch me, man! 
Page 34/51
- Don't touch you? 
- Don't touch me! 
What you gonna do? 
I'm touching you! I'm touching you! - Do something. 
- Don't touch me! 
Do something! 
- You wanna see something? 
- Yeah, I wanna see... 
- You wanna see something? 
- Yes, I wanna see something! 
I was just trying 
to get you there. 
Phil Jackson, we good, right? 
I knew you'd come through. 
That's shit crazy. 
Clear. 
I gotta work on my cardio. 
Question. 
Would you die for me? 
Yes. 
That's too easy. 
Would you... 
Would you live for me? 
Hm? 
Yes 
Careful. 
Do not say this oath thoughtlessly. Desire becomes surrender. 
Surrender becomes power. 
You want this? 
I do. 
Say it. 
Say it. 
Say it. 
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty... Please. 
God, you're so... 
Good. 
Oh, relax. 
It's just me. 
You ever been in love? 
Nah, never. 
Page 35/51
Bullshit. 
You don't kill as many people as I've killed and still sleep like a kitten if you feel shit like love. 
Another textbook sociopath. 
Clear. 
Clear. 
- Nice. 
- Clear the roof. 
Sweep for shooters so we can 
bring in our aviation assets. 
Go to the roof. 
Just oh... 
Wait here. 
Please. 
I don't wanna gave this dude 
a heart attack, okay? 
Aww. 
He's embarrassed of us. 
Hey, Flag. 
This dude better cure cancer 
after all of this shit. 
You ready? 
Let's go. 
You wouldn't have made it 
without them. 
We got lucky. I don't do luck. 
I do planning and precision. 
Admit it, Rick. 
I was right. 
Yeah, I told you to get on 
the damn truck. 
Why did you stay? 
I was studying your girlfriend. She takes an average person... 
A yoga mom, an elderly retiree 
and she turns them into a soldier who can take a headshot 
and still fight. 
It's an instant army. 
How'd she do it, Flag? 
How'd she game the system 
with you watching her every move? I'll accept the consequences 
Page 36/51
I am your consequence. 
You might need to be careful. 
They think we're rescuing Nelson mandela. I can take care of myself. 
- Shut it down, wipe the drivers. - Yes, ma'am. 
Copy that. 
Hey man, 
I know you can't hear me 
'cause you're trapped in your 
temple of soldierly self-righteousness. But a two-faced dude like you 
wouldn't survive a second on the street. Oh, says the guy 
who shoots people for money. 
My cards is on the table, man. 
It got done, didn't it? 
Damn. 
That is just... 
A mean lady. 
Yeah, you'll get used to it. 
And I'm the bad guy? 
That's gangsta. 
What? 
They weren't cleared 
for any of this, any of it. 
I'm not judging. 
I've buried a lot of mistakes too. No way. 
Let's go home. 
Yeah, let's go home. 
That sounds good. 
You guys wanna go home? 
Or you wanna go back to prison? I'm not going back to prison. 
What I'm saying is... 
We kill the pair of 'em now 
before they kill us. 
I got this. 
You all made it this far. 
Don't get high-spirited on me 
and ruin a good thing. 
I like her. 
Savior 1-0, this is ground element. Page 37/51
Savior 1-0, 
how copy? 
Savior 1-0, the LZ's clear. 
Boss, they're not talking to me. Our bird's been jacked. 
Light it up! 
What? 
I got a hickey or something? 
Professor, could you pick up the pace? Disarmed 
Now! 
Harley! 
Hello, baby. 
Kill her! 
Fail - safe mode 
Her nanite's disarmed! 
Come on, baby. 
Deadshot... 
Shoot that woman, right now! 
She ain't do shit to me. 
You're a hitman, right? 
I got a contract. 
Kill Harley Quinn. 
Do it your freedom and your kid. Now she dead. 
I missed. 
Good one, mate. 
It's Waller. 
Savior 1-0's been hijaked. 
Shoot it down. 
Rager that, ma'am. 
Going hot. 
Puddin'! 
You got all dressed up for me? Oh, you know I'd do 
anything for you. 
By the way... 
I've got some grape soda on ice, and a bear skin rug waiting. 
Yeah? 
Boss, we got a problem! 
- This bird is baked. 
- No. 
Okay, honey. 
Page 38/51
It's me and you. 
Let's do it. 
Target destroyed, ma'am 
thank you. 
Now get me off this roof. 
Yes, ma'am. 
We're inbound. 
The joker and Harley Quinn are no more. You couldn't save her. 
Roger, I see you. 
Watch your step, ma'am. 
Standby, I'll send another helo! Waller's down. 
It's over. 
Ops just confirmed. 
She's down, 1k west. 
Let's go get her. 
The mission's not over. 
Nah, it is for me. 
We had a deal. 
Without Waller, you got nothing. Hey, guys. 
I'm back! 
I missed you all so much. 
We're glad you could make it. 
Hey, craziness. 
With my heart returned, 
I can finish my weapon. 
Now tell me how to 
destroy your armies. 
Do your worst, bitch! 
So, let me guess. 
We're going to the swirling 
ring of trash in the sky. 
You know, 'cause why wouldn't we? When does this end, Flag? 
Load up. 
We're in for a fight. 
Top secret 
You tell everybody, everything. Or me and you are 
gonna go right now. 
3 days ago, 
a non-human entity 
Page 39/51
appeared in the subway station. Waller, we're almost there. 
So Waller sent me and 
a woman with incredibles abilities. Enchantress 
a witch. 
See, nobody could get near this thing, but... 
The witch could. 
Bomb's ready. 
Set for two seconds. 
You just press the 
button and drop it. 
Needless to say 
the whole thing was a bad idea. She bolted! 
Shit! 
And that's how 
she escaped from Waller. 
So now you know. 
You can just kill me right now but... 
I'm going to have a drink. 
Hey, Deadshot, 
I need your help. 
No, sir. 
You need a miracle. 
What's you having, KC? 
Bloody mary, right? 
Rick goes to mind. 
KC, it's the end of the world. Have a drink with us. 
Beer. 
There he is. 
Give the man a "B". 
How about you, hot stuff? 
Water. 
That's a good idea, honey. 
Ninja, you want some sake? 
Whisky. 
What am I, twelve? 
Here's to honor among thieves 
I'm not a thief. 
Oh. 
Page 40/51
She's not a thief. 
I actually prefer to think of myself as an asset relocation specialist. Well, we almost pulled it off. Despite what everybody thought. We weren't picked to succeed, 
you know that, right? 
We were all chosen to fail. 
Yeah, I know that. 
Worst part of it is, they're gonna blame us for the whole thing. 
And they can't have people 
knowing the truth. 
We're the patsies. 
The cover-up. 
Don't forget, we're the bad guys. So, you're going to tell us now what your big deal with Flag was. Same thing Waller offered me, 
to kill you. 
Chance to be a father. 
Chance to have a life 
outside the shadows. 
I trusted Flag. 
Flag had you chasing 
a carrot on a stick, homie, 
you don't know that? 
I love this guy. 
You played yourself, dog. 
Bitch, I'm having a drink. 
I'm... breathing fresh air. 
For 2 sweet seconds... 
I had hope. 
You had hope, huh? 
Hope don't stop the wheel 
from turning, my brother. 
You preaching? 
It's coming back around for you. How many people you killed, man? You don't ask nobody 
no question like that, ese. 
You ain't ever 
whacked down no women. 
No kids. 
Page 41/51
I don't kill women or children. I do. 
See, I was born with the devil's gift. I kept it hidden most of my life, but... The older I got, 
the stronger I got. 
So I started using it. 
For business, you know, 
the more power 
on the street I got, 
the more firepower I got. 
Like that shit 
went hand in hand. 
You know, one was feeding the other. Ain't nobody tell me no. 
Except my old lady. 
You know, she used to pray for me. You're welcome. 
Even when I didn't want it. 
Six die in arson fire. 
God didn't give me this. 
Why should he take it away? 
Hey. 
This is our home. 
You put that back 
where you found it. 
I'm taking my kids to mom's. 
You ain't taking my kids nowhere! See, when I get mad, 
I lose control. 
You know, I just... 
I don't know what I do... 
Till it's done. 
And the kids? 
He killed them. 
Didn't you? 
Own that shit. 
Own it! 
What'd you think was 
gonna happen, huh? 
Hey, Harley. 
Come on. 
What you were just... 
Thinking you can have a happy family... Page 42/51
And coach little leagues 
and make car payments? 
Normal is a setting on the dryer. People like us, we don't get normal! Why is it always a knife fight every single time 
you open your mouth? 
You know, outside you're amazing. But inside, you're ugly. 
We all are. 
We all are! 
Except for him. 
He's ugly on the outside, too. Not me, shorty. 
I'm beautiful. 
Yeah, you are. 
We don't want you here. 
You get to the part in that binder saying I was sleeping with her? Yeah. 
I never been with a witch before. What's that like? 
Apparently that's why the creatures chase him all the time. 
'Cause the witch is scared of him. The only woman I ever cared about... Is trapped inside that monster. If I don't stop the witch, it's over. Everything is over. 
Everything. 
You're free to go. 
Your daughter writes you everyday. Every single day. 
You had these the whole time? 
You had letters from my daughter the whole time? 
I'm gonna get you there. 
And you're gonna end this. 
I'm gonna carry your ass 
if I have to. 
'Cause this shit is gonna be 
like a chapter in the Bible. 
Everybody's gonna know what we did. And my daughter is gonna know 
Page 43/51
that her Daddy 
is not a piece of shit. 
I'll come. 
What? 
You got something better to do? Come on! 
Pussies. 
We think that thing's a weapon. Here, lower. 
We gotta take out the big one. I left a big ass demo charge 
down there in that subway. 
There's a flooded tunnel... 
Leads right underneath that building. Seals, they can recover the charge, swim underneath that thing's feet. We get in it's face and distract the hell out of that son of a bitch so the swimmers can blow the bomb. That's how we take it out. 
I'm going with you. 
We got this. 
I'm not asking, bro. 
I live underground. 
Y'all are just tourists. 
The man who killed her husband used that sword. 
His soul's trapped inside of it. She talks to him. 
Hey. 
Well... 
You know what they say 
about the crazy ones. 
Huh? 
Let's do this. 
You must really love this girl. And I thought love was bullshit, getting serious. 
Desire, mutual benefit whatever. I mean, I get that, 
but... actual love? 
I mean, I rated that with UFOs. A lot of believers, no proof. 
And then I met June. 
Page 44/51
Do what you got to do. 
I got your back. 
You gonna fight with us? 
What if I lose control? 
Then maybe we'll have a chance. Duck in. 
Hey, everyone can see 
all this trippy magic stuff right? Yeah, why? 
I'm off my meds. 
That's your old lady, huh? 
Yeah. 
Well, you need to handle 
this shit, alll right? 
Get up there, smack on her ass, tell her knock this shit off. 
I do not think that'd be wise. I'm gonna draw out the big one. My boys will detonate 
the bomb underneath him. 
You know, we should 
get a drink sometime. 
I've been waiting for you all night. Step out of the shadows. 
I won't bite. 
What the hell? 
Grab her. 
Why are you here? 
Because the soldier led you? 
And all for Waller? 
Why do you serve those who cage you? I am your ally. 
And I know what you want. 
Exactly what you want. 
Normal 
normal 
Baby. 
Baby. 
It's just a nightmare. 
It's just a bad dream. 
I'm here. 
Miss me? 
I'll put the kids to sleep and then... Maybe we can kick it? 
Page 45/51
Yeah? 
I can't change what I did. 
And neither can you! 
He married me. 
It's not real. 
I killed the bat. 
No, homie, you don't want that. What? 
I want that. 
She's trying to play games with you, man. It's not real! 
He's right. 
It's not real. 
How long have you been 
able to see? 
My whole life. 
You can't have them. 
These are my people right here. But it is our time. 
The sun is setting 
and the magic rises. 
The metahumans are a sign of change. Lady... 
You are evil! 
Oh, wow! 
Uh-oh. 
Who is this? 
It's gonna be bad! 
We should run. 
Gq, come in. 
We're in position. 
We gotta get him in that corner. That's where the bomb will be. 
I'll do it! 
I'll get him there! 
I lost one family. 
I ain't gonaa lose one another. Look, think it through. 
I got this. 
Let me show you 
what I really am. 
Over here! 
Go! 
Rick, in position. 
Page 46/51
Standing by. 
Diablo, drive him into the corner! - Get him mate. 
- Come on. 
Yeah, do it! 
Diablo, get clear! 
Get out of there! 
Blow it! 
Blow it. 
Now GQ, now. 
No! 
Everybody down! 
You next. 
My spell is complete. 
Once you and armies are gone, 
my darkness will spread across this world. And it would be mine to rule. 
That was our main satellite uplink. How did this witch even know 
how to target this thing? 
It's a secret facility. 
You got a move here, Flag? 
We gotta cut her heart out! 
Where is she? 
I can't see her! 
While we're fighting, 
that thing is laying waste 
to the whole damn world. 
Where is she? 
I don't know. 
Hey. 
Oh shit. 
Look out, look out! 
Uh-oh. 
Sorry. 
Flag! 
Enough! 
Of all who have faced me... 
You have earned mercy. 
For the last time... 
Join me... 
Or die. 
I'm not much of a joiner but... 
Maybe we should. 
Page 47/51
Hey. 
She's trying to take over the world. So? 
What's the world ever 
done for us anyway? 
It hates us. 
Hey. 
Harley. 
Hey, lady? 
I lost my puddin'. 
But you can get him back, right? I can, my dear. 
Anything you want. 
You promise? 
Yes, child. 
You need only bow... 
And serve beneath my feet. 
I like what you're selling, lady. There's only one teeny problem. You messed with my friends. 
Her heart's out! 
We can ends this. 
Hey, Croc! 
Harley! 
Please, Daddy. 
Don't do it. 
The only way for us to be together is if you don't pull the trigger. Daddy, I love you. 
Please, don't do this. 
That was a great shot, man. 
Hey, I don't do hugs. 
I'm not a hugger. 
I'm not a hugger. 
All right? 
Let me join my brother. 
Katana, no! 
Give me that. 
You bring June back. 
You bring her back. 
She's not coming back. 
I'll crush this. 
Do you hear me? 
You bring June back 
Page 48/51
or I'll crush this! 
Go ahead. 
You don't have the balls. 
Hey, Flag. 
June. 
She's gone. 
I thought I killed you. 
I thought I killed you. 
Y'all don't mind. 
I got me a sewer to crawl back into. Yeah, and I got some business 
to handle back in Gotham. 
I'm going to hotwire a car, 
need a ride? 
Your ass is not driving. 
Why not? 
How are you not dead? 
We-we just saved the world. 
A "thank you" would be nice. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
So, we did all of this 
and we don't get shit? 
10 years off you prison sentences. Nah, that's not enough. 
I'm seeing my daughter. 
That can be arranged. 
An other requests? 
An Espresso machine. 
BET. 
10 years off a triple life sentence? Darling, I'm walking out of here a free man. 
Or we're to start having 
some real fun. 
Why don't have some fun? 
You're trying to figure out this length. That's the hypotenuse. 
So you have to know this angle. Okay. 
So, if you're up here... 
- Like an a building. 
- Mm. 
And you shoot a man down here 
Page 49/51
on the street... 
That's how far 
the bullet actually goes? 
Yeah. 
That's-that's right! 
You are so smart. 
Right. 
The hypotenuse, good one. 
So that would make you 
have to know the angle 
between the building 
and the sidewalk. 
You got to know that angle. 
You know, I mean, in real life 
you got-you got variables. 
You know, you got rifling twist. You got chamber pressure. 
You got bullet weight. 
Some shots you'll even have to take the curvature of the earth in with the... It's time. 
Wind effect. 
You know, 
there's a lot-a lot variables... In the street. 
I gotta go. 
Are you coming back? 
Yeah. 
I'm working it out. 
All right? 
You know, I promised my friends 
that I would just, you know, go without... Without killing them all. 
Bring in it. 
I love you, Daddy. 
I love you. 
Hey! 
Let me out! 
Let me out of here right now! 
Hey! 
You feel that? Yeah. 
Let me out of here, darling, please. Please, I'm begging you, seriously. Listen to me. Have you got a car? 
Page 50/51
Because I'm a brilliant driver. Come on! 
Joker 
Puddin'! 
Let's go home.

my legal exposure. 
If anyone knew what 
I've procured for you... 
Listen, I can keep a secret, okay? What do you want? 
People are asking questions 
about Midway city. 
The kind of people 
who can get the answers. 
And if they can get those answers, my head will be on a pike. 
Consider yourself under my protection, if you deliver.

Why, Mr. Wayne? 
I just like to make friends. 
That's the difference between us. You believe in friendship. 
I believe in leverage. 
Goodnight. 
You look tired. 
You should stop working nights. You should shut it down, 
or my friends and I 
will do it for you.

The Jungle Book By Justin Marks 
Page 1/36
1 
Many strange tales 
are told of this jungle. 
But none so strange... 
As the tale of the cub we call mowgli. You must be the very 
worst wolf I've ever seen. 
Yeah, but if that branch didn't break, i would've made it. 
Crossing upwind, 
breaking from your numbers. 
If you can't learn to run with the pack... One of these days, 
you'll be someone's dinner. 
- How'd we do? 
- Not mowgli, again. 
- He's never gonna make the council. - Let's go! 
Race you to the top! 
It was higher ground. 
Wolves don't hide in trees. 
I can't keep up with them, bagheera. I tried. I just picked the wrong tree. It was a dead tree. 
How was I supposed to know 
it was dead? 
It had a fig vine. 
Any tree girdled by a creeper 
is either dead or close to it. 
- These are things a wolf must know. - Yeah. 
But if the branch didn't break, 
i would've made it. 
I realise you weren't born a wolf... But couldn't you at least act like one? Bagheera'. When I found him... 
Many years ago... 
He was just an infant, 
abandoned in the woods. 
Get the deer! 
If he 
was going to survive... 
I knew he needed a people. 
A people to protect him. 
Page 2/36
That's why I entrusted him 
to the wolves. 
Look well, wolves. 
Akela was 
a just and noble leader. 
He allowed mowgli to dwell 
among them, all those years. 
The trouble was, wolves grew so fast... And mowgli... 
Let's just say he liked to take his time. Mowgli, pick me up high! 
- My turn! 
- Stop. Not now. 
It was raksha 
who raised him. 
She was the only mother he ever knew. - Come on, let's play! 
- I don't feel like playing, gray. Come on, you're my brother. 
You have to play with me. 
Let's go chase some mice. 
How did it go? 
Caught me again. 
If it's meant to be... 
It will be. 
Let me hear the law. 
"This is the law of the jungle... "As old and as true as the sky. 
"The wolf that keeps it will prosper... "But the wolf that breaks it will die. "Like the creeper that girdles 
the tree trunk... 
"The law runneth over and back. 
"For the strength of the pack 
is the wolf... 
"And the strength of the wolf 
is the pack." 
Soon, 
the rain ceased to fall 
and the dry season arrived. 
Heat crept through the jungle... Turning it yellow... 
Then brown... 
Then black. 
Page 3/36
But that year... 
Was the driest season 
that anyone could remember. 
Even the mohwa didn't flower. 
My leaf. 
This is mine. Mine, mine, mine. There's a rock. That's mud. That's mud. There's a rock. That's my rock. That's my rock. 
Nobody touches my rock. 
There's another rock. 
Two rocks. Three rocks. 
Peace rock? Peace rock! 
It's the truce! The water truce! It's the water truce! 
It had been 
many, many years 
since the peace rock was revealed... And the water truce was called. Hunting at the riverbank 
- was now forbidden... 
Because, by law of the jungle, drinking comes before eating. 
So, you could come to the peace rock, on a day like this... 
And find all people side-by-side. Don't forget. 
No hunting. 
Playing ony 
playing, only. I got it, ami. 
And remember... 
Not everyone here has seen 
a man-cub in the jungle before. So, behave yourself. 
Okay, can I go now? 
Take the pups with you. 
Wait for me! 
Come on, gray! 
Oh, take a look at this guy. 
Excuse me. 
Sorry. 
- He's walking on two legs. 
- Don't stare. 
Hey, look. A wild boar. 
Page 4/36
- And a rhino. 
- And a mongoose. 
Everybody's here. 
Ls that a peacock? 
- Ooh, a stick! 
-Lkkl: 
- I like this stick. 
- Seriously, that's my stick. 
- This is my stick. 
- No, that's my stick! 
- Let go of my stick! 
-Lt's a water truce! 
It's a water truce! 
Sorry. 
My bad! It's involuntary. 
Lkkl: 
Watch yourself, please. 
Dad, what is that? 
I think that's a man-cub. 
What's a man-cub doing here? 
Whoa. Don't forget the truce. 
I know the law, bucks. 
What is that? 
- Weird. 
- That's weird. 
Akelai mowgli. 
What was the rule about your tricks? It's not the wolf way. 
No more tricks. 
Chin up, little one. 
We'll make you a fine wolf, yet. What about me? 
Am I gonna be a fine wolf? 
Look at me howl! 
In some packs, the runt gets eaten. Oh... 
Mowgli, behind me. 
Don't leave my side. 
Everyone comes to peace rock. 
So many smells to catch up on. But, um... 
I can't help but notice... 
Page 5/36
There's this strange odour today. What is it, this scent that I'm on? I almost... 
I almost think it was some kind of... Man-cub. 
Mowgli belongs 
to my pack, shere Khan. 
Mowgli? 
They've given it a name. 
When was it we came to adopt 
man into the jungle? 
He's just a cub. 
Does my face not remind you 
of what a grown man can do? 
Shift your hunting ground 
for a few years... 
And everyone forgets 
how the law works. 
Well, let me remind you. 
A man-cub becomes man... 
And man is forbidden! 
- What do you know about law? 
- Raksha. 
Hunting for pleasure. Killing for power. You've never known law. 
The cub is mine! 
Mine to me. 
So, go back to where you came from, you burned beast! 
The tiger knows who rules 
this part of the jungle. 
I'm sure he doesn't mean to come here and make threats. 
Especially during a water truce. No, I'm deeply respectful of these laws that keep us safe. 
So, here's my promise. 
Nothing lasts forever. 
The rains will return 
and the river will rise. 
And when this rock disappears, 
that truce will end. 
You want to protect him, fine. 
But ask yourselves, 
Page 6/36
how many lives is a man-cub worth? Bagheera". How many lives? 
Who could answer that question? - The rain! 
- Rain! 
- Rain! 
- The rain! 
Keep it dry, keep it dry, keep it dry. These quills 
get stuck on everything! 
Bagheera". When the rains returned... It was a question 
the council had to face. 
They deliberated and they argued... For many days. 
What do you think they're talking about? No one had ever 
come between the pack before. 
But shere Khan's threat... 
Was not to be ignored. 
Mowgli, you're not supposed 
to go up there! 
He's got to go. 
Look at the skies. 
Shere Khan may be heading here 
as we speak. 
Please! 
I'm leaving. 
I don't want to see anyone get hurt. Mowgli, go back to the den! 
A man-cub belongs with man. 
We raised him as one of our own! - He'll have the boy, either way. - Akela. 
Maybe I can be of help. 
The boy's right. 
Maybe it's time he found another people. - No. 
-L'm the one who brought him to you. And now I'll return him 
to where he belongs. 
I won't let you. 
He's my cub! 
We knew this day would come. 
Page 7/36
We are the only family he's ever known! Raksha. 
It's the only place he'll be safe. It's okay, ami. 
I won't go far. 
I'll come back and visit. 
Never forget this... 
You're mine. 
Mine to me. 
No matter where you go, 
or what they may call you... 
You will always be... 
My son. 
I wish I could tell you... 
That the wolves 
could've fought shere Khan. 
But this is not that kind of a tale. The turtles like me. 
Maybe the crocodiles. 
What about the rhinos? 
They always let me hang around. 
Of course, the rhinos sleep standing up. I don't think I'd be very good at that. It's either the turtles or the crocodiles. Which one do you think is better? Bagheerai neither. 
What do you mean? 
I'm bringing you to the man village. What? 
Bagheera, I don't know man. 
You will. 
You always said 
we're not supposed 
to go near a man village. 
That was different. 
Why is it different? 
You always said, "stay away 
from the man village... 
"Because you might fall in a trap... "Or get eaten, 
or get hurt by flying rocks." 
I know what I said. 
Whoa. Elephants. 
- Bow your head. 
Page 8/36
- Why? 
Show them respect. 
The elephants 
created this jungle. 
Where they made furrows 
with their tusks, 
the rivers ran. 
Where they blew with 
their trunks, the leaves fell. They made all that belongs. 
The mountains, the trees... 
The birds in the trees. 
But they did not make you. 
That is why you must go. 
What if I live with the nilgai? No. 
Or the mongoose? 
This is not a discussion. 
But this is my home! 
I don't even know what man's like. You'll learn. 
But I wanna stay in the jungle. Why do I have to go there? 
Because the jungle 
is no longer safe for you. 
You're being hunted... 
B'! 8 get. 
Only man can protect you now. 
Whoa! 
This isn't fair. 
You're not giving me a choice. There's a lot of stuff 
you're not telling me, too. 
Don't think I didn't notice. 
You say you're taking me 
where I came from... 
But you found me in the jungle. Are you bringing me back 
to the jungle? No. 
Why are you bringing me 
to the man village 
if you found me in the jungle? And why does the tiger 
hate me so much? 
Page 9/36
Does he know me? 
Sure seems like he knows me. 
Down. 
What? Now we have to bow 
to the buffalo, too? 
Listen to me. This is not a game. You're gonna run to that ravine. What are you talking about? 
Go to the north, 
where the sky glows at night. 
I'll find you on that path. 
Bagheera, I'm not taking one 
more step until you tell me... Bagheerai run, mowgli! 
Run! 
Gray, what's wrong? 
Why don't you come outside and play? What is that? 
Why did he have to leave? 
Gray. 
We could've protected him. 
We shouldn't have let him go. 
I miss him, too. 
What's important is, he's safe now. Get inside. 
I suppose you know why I've come. The man-cub has left the jungle. I thought I made myself clear. I wanted him turned over to me. We no longer harbour him. 
He has left the pack. 
And where, may I ask, has he gone? He's with his own kind now. 
So, the man-cub has left the jungle. Akelai that's right. 
You and I no longer have a quarrel. And, most importantly... 
We have peace. 
I guess it's done, then. 
Unless I can draw him... 
Back out! 
Akela! 
Have I got your attention now? I didn't want it to be this way. 
Page 10/36
I made it so simple. 
All I asked for was one thing, and you denied me! 
That ends now. 
Spread the word. 
Until I have the man-cub, 
these hills are my hills. 
You did not respond to reason! So now, you will know fear. 
Bagheera? 
Hmm? 
Hey, there. 
Do you have a language? 
You're kind of cute, I guess. 
You want a bite? 
Come on. 
Come here. Come on, it's all right. Don't be afraid. 
Come on. 
Hey, those are mine! 
Hey, come back! 
Those are mine! 
Drop it! 
Hello? 
Who's out there? 
Kaai hi, little cub. 
Oh, no. Don't be scared. 
I'm not gonna hurt you. 
I was just passing through. 
I don't want any trouble. 
There's no trouble. 
Are you alone out here? 
Mmm. That's not good. 
We should never be alone. 
I'm waiting for a friend. 
He should be here soon. 
I can stay with you, 
until he gets here. 
Would that be all right? 
I'll keep you safe. 
Just you and me, sweet thing. 
Who are you? 
Kaa. 
Poor, sweet little cub. 
Page 11/36
What are you doing 
so deep in the jungle? 
This is my home. 
Don't you know what you are? 
I know what you are. 
I know where you came from. 
You do? 
Yes. 
Would you like to see? 
Yeah. 
Kaa". Mostly, men stay in their village... Far from the dark of the jungle. But sometimes... 
They travel. 
And when they do... 
Their caves breathe in the dark. They call it... 
The red flower. 
Man's creation. 
It brings warmth and light... 
And destruction to all that it touches. Who is that? 
The traveller, protecting his cub. Shere Khan ended 
the man's life that night. 
But not before he was burned 
by the red flower's touch. 
He ran so fast, he didn't 
notice the cub he left behind. 
And that cub... 
Was you. 
The panther found you. 
Oh, you poor, sweet thing. 
You want to stay in the jungle? 
You can be with me, if you want. I'll keep you close. 
Let go of your fear, now. 
Trust... 
In me. 
Relax, kid. 
No need to get worked up. Okay? 
- Where am I? 
- Uh... 
This is a cave. It's my cave. 
Page 12/36
You don't remember 
what happened, do you? 
- No. 
- I saved your life. 
Yeah, I snatched you 
from the jaws of death. 
The coils of death, if you will. And lucky for you... 
Your new favourite hero, 
old baloo, here... 
Just happened to be passing by. Uh, no big deal. 
Just tell me this. 
Can you... 
Climb? 
Yeah. 
Then let's quit wasting time 
and get on with it. 
Get on with what? 
Payback, kid. Payback. 
What do you mean "payback"? 
Payback for what? 
You owe me, kid. 
You owe me. You owe me. 
Slow down. 
- And you're gonna pay back. 
- But, but... 
Because that's right. 
You're gonna do the right thing. That's the right thing to do. 
You're gonna pay me back, 
because you owe me. 
You got it? 
Okay, here's our little task. 
You see that golden stuff, 
dripping down there? 
That's called "honey." 
All you need to do, little one... For payback purposes... 
Is to just shimmy on up there... And get me that thing up there that's making that funny noise... And bring it back down. 
You're kidding me, right? 
Page 13/36
No, not really. 
I can get killed 
going up there. 
Kid! 
Kid, kid, kid. Try to understand this. I'm a bear. 
It means that I have to eat my weight... Every day... 
For hibernation purposes. 
I know I'm asking for a lot... 
But I don't climb and you do. 
Look, I really need your help. 
Winter's coming. 
You don't want me to go to sleep... And never wake up. 
There are a lot of bees up here. Yeah, some. 
But don't worry. These ones don't sting. Attaboy! 
Ow! I'm getting stung! 
Okay 
I would've done this myself, 
but I'm afraid of heights. 
Oh, boy. Here we go again. 
Why don't you mind your own business? You can do it! 
- He's just gonna run away. 
- Not this one. 
As soon as the monkeys get 
stung, they always run away. 
- He's not a monkey. A man-cub. - What is he? 
A man-cub? 
Yeah! Could you keep your voice down? I'm trying to concentrate. 
- Everything going a-okay up there? - Ow! 
Oh, boy. Looks like you got another one. - Buzz off. 
-Lt's a man-cub. 
- A man-cub? 
- Yeah, it's a man-cub. 
- It's not a monkey? 
- No, it's a man-cub! 
Page 14/36
You have never been 
a more endangered species... 
Than you are at this moment. 
You're doing an amazing job! 
I'm getting stung! 
Oh, boy. Here we go again. 
-It's not a monkey, Fred. 
-Lt's a man-cub. 
- A man-cub? 
- Yeah, it's a man-cub. 
- Can you believe it? 
- Are you sure? 
Would you please shut up? 
He)', up there! 
Everything is 
going fantastically, I see. 
Ow! 
You got it! 
Believe in yourself! 
-There you go! 
- Ow! 
Come on! Almost! 
Yeah! 
Yeah! 
Oh. Yeah! 
Uh-oh. 
Fred? 
Oh, yeah, exfoliate me. 
You said they didn't sting. 
What do you call this? 
How the heck did you do that? 
Oh, those must have been females! They look like males 
from down here. 
Females do sting. 
Just put some honey on those. 
- Honey? Really? 
- Yeah. 
You put it on, you lick it off. You feel much better. 
It's nature's ointment. 
I put it everywhere. 
Thanks. 
Okay, so, we're even now! 
Page 15/36
Hold on a minute. 
What's your name anyway? 
We were never properly introduced. - Mowgli. 
- Mowgli? 
Mowgli is a terrific name. 
I bet you got that one 
all to yourself, too. 
Hey! 
Mowgli, look... 
I got a lot of gathering to do 
these next couple of weeks... 
On account of the hibernation. 
I could really use your help. 
You know, if you stuck around... I can't. I have to go to the man village. Uh... 
For what reason, man village? 
I don't have a choice. 
There's a tiger hunting me. 
Really? Why a tiger? 
Because I'm a man-cub, all right? Just leave me alone. 
Hey! Mowgli, my friend, 
my buddy, my pal. 
Slow down a second, handsome. 
Bagheera said I have to go 
to the man village. 
Oh, bagheera! I know him. Sure. You know what his problem is? 
He always plays by the rules. 
And, sometimes rules 
were meant to be... 
Well, not necessarily broken, 
but certainly bent. 
And definitely reinterpreted. 
Don't you think? 
He told me to go to the man village, so, that's where I'm gonna go! 
Okay, fine. 
You wanna go to the man village, have it your way. 
In fact, I'll do you one better. I'll take you there myself. 
Page 16/36
Come on, let's go. It's getting late. Bare necessities 
forget about 
your worries and your strife 
I mean the bare necessities 
what's that? 
That's a song about the good life. What's a song? 
You never 
heard a song before? 
Everyone's got a song. 
Didn't the wolves ever sing? 
I don't know. 
Uh... oh... 
We recited the law of the jungle. "This is the law of the jungle... "As old and as true as the sky. 
"The wolf that keeps it may prosper... "But the wolf that breaks it will die." Kid, that's not a song. 
That's propaganda. 
What's propaganda? 
Just a little farther. 
That's the man village? 
Yep. You can always 
tell by the red flower. 
They do love their red flower. 
The red flower doesn't seem so bad. Yeah. 
Let it loose, and it destroys 
everything it touches. 
Don't ever play with it. 
You got that? 
Yeah, I got it. 
Good. 
Do you think that's where I'm from? Could be. 
I don't know, kid. Does it look familiar? I don't remember it. 
All I remember is living with the wolves. Why do you wanna go there? 
Bagheera said I need a people. 
Again, with the listening to bagheera. Hey, he's my friend, okay? 
Page 17/36
Now I don't even know where he is. I can't believe I'm leaving 
the jungle for good. 
May I say just one thing? 
What I saw you do today, 
I've never seen anything like it. I've been trying to get 
that honey for years. 
But I used my tricks. 
What tricks? 
You know... 
Everything that I built. 
It's not the wolf way. 
Who cares? "The wolf way." 
That's the mowgli way. 
That's the baloo way. 
That's our way. 
That's how we get things done. 
I can't even imagine what kind 
of potential you'd have... 
If you had somebody like me 
helping you out. 
You say you want to go 
to the man village. 
I say, you could be a man right here. I'll tell you what. 
Now you know where the man village is. You can always go down there, 
whenever you want. 
But I would personally appreciate it... As a personal favour to me, personally... If we just worked together, 
just us, tricks and all. 
I think it would be interesting to see... Just how much honey 
we could accumulate... 
Before winter. 
Whatever I could do to make 
your trickiness happen... 
L will do. 
And if it turns out to 
not be fun for you... 
I will walk you right down 
to that man village myself. 
Page 18/36
Is that a deal? 
Just till winter. 
Just till winter. 
Ami, wake up. 
Pups? 
They're up there. 
The deer, of course, 
take comfort in numbers. 
They lack defences 
most animals will have. 
And if we're being honest... 
They're not very smart either. 
Unlike the mother crocodile, 
who is a good deal more clever. But the one you have to watch out for... Is the cuckoo bird. 
Do you know 
how the cuckoo bird survives? 
By preying on a mother's weakness. The cuckoo bird is too clever 
to raise its young. 
Instead, it sneaks... 
Its eggs into the nests of simpler birds. So, when they hatch... 
The mother bird is fooled. 
She feeds them, nurtures them. 
And do you know what happens 
to her own chicks? 
They starve... 
And die... 
From neglect. 
All because a mother loved a chick... That wasn't her own. 
Come now, time for sleep. 
I think they like me. 
Why are you doing this? 
He's gone. 
Isn't that what you wanted? 
I want him dead. 
Once he gets word 
of what happened here... 
He'll come back. 
And I'll be waiting. 
- That's the first mark. 
Page 19/36
- Got it. 
- That's the first mark! 
- Got it! 
That's the first mark! 
Mowglii got it! 
Whoo! 
Yeah, I got it! 
- Tell him to go to the second mark! - Got it! 
- Go to the second mark! 
- Got it. 
Got it. 
Look for the 
bare necessities 
the simple bare necessities 
forget about your worries 
and your strife 
I mean the bare necessities 
old mother nature's recipes 
that bring the bare 
necessities of life 
wherever I wander 
wherever I roam 
I couldn't be fonder 
of my big home 
the bees are buzzing 
in the tree 
to make some honey just for me when you look under 
the rocks and plants 
and take a glance at them fancy ants and then maybe try a few 
the bare necessities of life 
they'll come to you! 
Wherever! Wander 
wherever I roam 
I couldn't be fonder 
of my big home 
the bees are buzzing in the tree to make some honey just for me when you look 
under the rocks and plants 
and then take a glance 
at them fancy ants 
Page 20/36
and then maybe try a few 
mmm! Mmm! 
The bare necessities of life 
they'll come to you 
they will come to you 
yeah, they'll come to you! 
Come to you! 
Baloo, baloo, baloo... look. 
Stay low on my back. 
Come on out and show yourself. Bagheera! Ah! 
Bagheerai mowgli. 
Oh, I was looking everywhere for you! I thought you were gone! 
- Are you all right? 
- Yeah! 
I can't believe you found me! 
I was so worried about you. 
I was lost, and I didn't know 
what happened... 
But then I met baloo. 
And then he saved me 
from a giant snake! 
And now we're working together! Really? 
That's a new wrinkle. 
I didn't know sloth bears worked. Come on, mowgli, let's be on our way. Wait! 
Yeah, go on ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be mad, okay? 
Why would I be mad? 
Because you're always mad 
when I do stuff. 
You gotta promise 
not to be mad this time. 
Show me, then I'll decide. 
Come on, check it out! 
These are vines I use on the cliff. I twirl them together to make 
them longer and stronger. 
See how strong they are? 
You wanna see the really cool part? It's inside. Come on, let's go! 
Page 21/36
Come on! 
It's the honey stash for winter! Have you lost your mind? 
You said you wouldn't get mad. Did you listen to anything 
akela taught you? 
There's no place... 
In the jungle for these... 
Tricks! 
You want to do this, 
you do this in the man village. But I'm helping baloo 
get ready for hibernation. 
Bears don't hibernate in a jungle. What are you teaching him? 
Not full hibernation, but I nap a lot. Listen to me, you con artist! 
He may not know your game, but I do. - He's leaving now. 
- But I don't wanna leave! 
You don't have a choice! 
Why don't we all just 
settle down for a minute. 
Look, it's gotten late. 
Too late to travel. 
So, why don't we all 
just have a little honey... 
I don't eat honey. 
No problem. I'll eat the honey. Let's all get a good night's sleep... And we can talk about this 
in the morning. 
Fine. But we're leaving, first thing. Bagheerai mowgli. 
Where is he? 
- In the pit. 
- In the what? 
- Is this your teaching? 
- Oh, come on! 
You know I'd never teach him 
to mess around with elephants. Hey, guys. 
What'd I tell you? He's special. I know he's special. 
Page 22/36
I raised him. 
Then don't make him leave, bagheera! You gotta let him be what he is. You don't understand. 
The boy's in danger. 
I know, he told me. 
He's being hunted by a tiger. 
Not any get. Share Khan. 
Shere Khan's hunting him? 
Oh. 
But if you send him back 
to the man village, 
they'll ruin him. 
They'll make a man out of him. We should send him back 
to the wolf pack. 
Who's their Alpha? 
Akela, he can protect him. 
Akela is dead. 
- What? 
- Shere Khan killed him. 
He will stop at nothing 
until he has this boy. 
Nothing. 
The only way we can save him... Is if he goes to that man village. Please, baloo. 
You're the only one he'll listen to. Hey, kid. 
Hey. 
That was pretty cool, 
what you did back there. 
Bagheera didn't think so. 
Oh, no, I talked to him. 
He was very impressed. 
He was? 
We both were. Yeah. 
I've never seen anyone get 
that close to an elephant before. So, listen, kid. 
I gotta talk to you about something. What do you wanna talk about? 
I've been thinking. 
Now that your friend has shown up... Page 23/36
Maybe it's time... 
For you two to just mosey along. Now it's winter... 
And it's really time for you to go. But I wanna stay here with you. We're buddies, aren't we? 
Huh? No, we were never friends. I certainly never thought 
of you as my friend. 
You helped me get honey 
and I don't really need you any more... Do I have to spell this out? 
I don't want you around any more. I did it. 
And that's about the hardest thing I've ever done. 
I know. 
Go away. 
Get away from me. 
Stop it. 
Get away from me! 
Bagheera! 
Mowgli! 
Mowgli, hold on! 
Bagheera! 
What was that? 
Where are they taking him? 
Bagheerai this way. 
Mowglii ahh! Ah! 
Whoa! 
We see you! We see you! 
Come on, jump! 
And watch the claws. 
Gah! 
Uh... 
I'll take it from here. 
No, I'm coming. 
It's doable... 
If I don't have to go too high. Good. Let's get going. 
All right. 
A bird. That can't be a good sign. Baloo. 
Look at me. Look at nothing but me. Page 24/36
- Hmm? 
- You're doing fine. 
Just keep your eyes up high. 
All right. I'm coming. I'm coming. What part of the jungle you from? You, man-cub. 
You come from the south, the north? What part of the jungle? 
The south, I guess. 
Southern jungle, the seeonee. 
Beautiful, I hear. 
I never been there myself. 
So, tell me, you ever had 
a taste of the pawpaw fruit... Down there in the seeonee? 
Some people call it the... 
What's the word? 
Papaya. Stolen words. 
I say pawpaw. 
Goes to the sound it makes 
when it tumbles to the jungle floor. Try it. 
Go ahead. 
It's good. 
You know who I am? 
No. 
I am the king of the bandar-log. Call me Louie. 
I did it! 
Well done, old chap. 
He must be in there. 
Follow me. 
No, no. 
We're on level ground here. 
I'm in charge. 
And I've got a plan. 
You are a man-cub 
who wants to live in the jungle. How do you know that? 
Kid... 
I got ears. My ears got ears. 
You wanna live here? 
You need a people to protect you. Only I can protect you... 
Page 25/36
And I will, for a price. 
I don't have anything to give you. I think you do. 
What? 
Look around, man-cub. 
I got everything. 
I have plentiful food... 
Endless treasure... 
Command vast legions. 
But there's one thing I don't have... And that's the one thing... 
You can give me. 
The red flower. 
I don't have that! 
You're a man, aren't you? 
That's what makes you a man. 
You can summon the red flower... And control it. 
They told me not to go near 
the red flower. 
You know why they tell you that? Because once you have it, 
you rise to the top of the food chain. Nothing in this jungle can stand up... To the red flower. 
Please, I just wanna go. 
Now, don't try to kid me, man-cub I'll make a deal with you 
what I desire is man's red fire to make my dream come true 
now give me the secret, man-cub come on! 
Clue me what to do 
give me the power 
of man's red flower 
so I can be like you 
oh, ooo-be do 
I wanna be like you-oo-oo 
I wanna walk like you, 
talk like you too-oo-oo 
you'll see it's true-oo-oo, 
someone like me-ee-ee 
can learn to be 
like someone like you-oo-oo 
Page 26/36
now you might think 
it's ridiculous that me 
a gigantopithecus, 
would ever dream 
I'd like to team with 
the likes of you, man-cub 
but together we'd have powers 
all the jungle's treasures, ours I got desire, you got the fire but the dream I dream takes two so, 00-00-00 
I wanna be like you-oo-oo 
I wanna use that flame 
just the same as you can do 
oh, how magnificus it would be a gigantopithecus like me 
could learn to do 
like you humans do-oo-oo 
just one thing we need... 
To reach our full potential. 
Bring me that red flower... 
And we will rule this jungle. 
I will protect you. 
And you will want for nothing, ever again. 
I can't! 
You can't or you won't? 
I can't! 
You will! 
Excuse me! 
Anybody? 
Excuse me... 
Am I in the right monkey temple? Oh, my gosh. 
Is that king Louie? 
This is so exciting. 
The legends do you no justice, sir. You are truly enormous. 
In the best way. 
Look at all of that flesh... 
Just squatting there... 
On an ancient throne. 
How majestic. 
Seize him. 
Page 27/36
Hey, hang on. 
Can you just hang on? 
I climbed a mountain to see you, and I'm not a climber. 
Just to be in your presence. 
For me, this is a dream come true. Oh... Throw him off the cliff. 
Wait, wait, wait. 
I have no problem with that. 
I don't have any problem with that. I came up here without an invitation. It was extremely presumptuous of me. Let me interrupt myself. 
I just gotta say... 
You guys are so much handsomer 
in person than anyone knows. 
No one ever gets up close to you. Why? 
Because of the smell. 
The smell is rough. 
But it's not just, "oh, look at me." It's, "i got the brains." 
You guys got the know-how. 
You got the noggin. 
You came up with this stuff, 
with the thumb. 
Come on, show me. 
How do you do that? I can't do that. Look, I scratch, I rub, I can grab a fish. But I was hoping, and you may 
not be open to this at all... 
But I was hoping, 
and once again, it's a dream... 
But I was hoping that I might become... A bandar-log myself. 
Gosh, I wanna be like you. 
I am hitching my wagon to your star. No one leaves! 
I can show myself out. Thanks. Bye-bye! We'll try to hold them off. 
Where you going, man-cub? 
Stay away from me! 
You don't have anyone now. 
I'm your only hope. 
Page 28/36
I can make it real good for you here. Where else you gonna go? 
I'll go back to the pack! 
I'll go back to akela! 
Akela? 
Oh. 
You didn't hear? 
Shere Khan killed him. 
Must've been on account of you. No! You're lying! 
Don't run away... 
From who you are! 
You hear me? 
Think about it, man-cub. 
We can rule this jungle. 
No... 
Listen to reason. 
Gotcha! 
Mowgli! 
If anything happens to that kid... I'll never forgive myself. 
- Bagheera! 
- Mowgli? 
Stay there. 
We'll come around to you. 
Is it true? 
What? 
Is akela dead? 
We were going to tell you. 
You knew! 
You both knew! 
And nobody did anything about it! Kid, just hold on. 
Someone's gotta do something! 
Wlowgn! 
There's no trace of him. 
Where could he have gone? 
Come on! 
It's man. 
He's come to the jungle. 
Ami, what's happening? 
The red flower. 
Everybody, get to the river! 
Red flower. 
Page 29/36
Pups, come on. Stay close. 
Ls that mowgli? 
Shere Khan! 
Shere Khan! 
I'm not afraid of you! 
No one has to be afraid of you any more! No... 
I think they're afraid 
of something else now. 
The man-cub is now a man. 
Gray... 
Always a proud day... 
When they come of age. 
You can fool them, but you can't fool me. I'm the one who saw your future. I saw what you'd become. 
Come now, use the red flower. 
Use it on me like your father did. Show everyone what you really are! I'm mowgli of the seeonee 
and this is my home! 
That was the stupidest thing 
you could've done. 
Now you have nothing. 
No claws, no fur, no teeth... 
And no friends. 
"This is the law of the jungle... "As old and as true as the sky." What is this? 
"The wolf that keeps it may prosper... "But the wolf 
that breaks it will die." 
You fools. 
"Like the creeper 
that girdles the tree trunk... 
"The law runneth over and back." Fine! Rise up, all of you! 
You want to put yourselves 
between me and the man-cub? 
"...and the strength 
of the wolf is the pack." 
I will have you all 
in my teeth! 
- No! 
Page 30/36
- Wolves, attack! 
Stay here! 
But I wanna fight with the wolves! - You can't fight him like a wolf. - You're not a wolf! 
Fight him like a man. 
Now, go! 
Okay. 
We'll hold him off. 
It's time 
we put an end to this. 
Rakshai no! 
Dead tree. 
It's just you and me now! 
Break, break! 
You've got nowhere to go, man-cub! Did you think I would let you grow old? Either I'll devour you 
or the red flower will. 
It's just a matter of time. 
How long did you really think 
you'd survive against me? 
Longer than your father did? 
Longer than... akela? 
I'm not afraid of you! 
Do you hear me? 
I'm done running from you! 
You stood your ground, old boy. You stood your ground. 
Ami, ami! 
My son. 
Mowgli! 
- Lt's mowgli! 
Mowgli. 
Will you look at that? 
And where they made 
furrows in the ground with their tusks... There the rivers ran. 
In my years, I've seen 
a lot in this jungle. 
But that night... 
I saw something I'll never forget. I saw a little boy... 
Without a people... 
Page 31/36
Bring all the jungle together 
for the very first time. 
Just a few more turns. 
"M going high! 
Stay low. 
He never listens. 
Gotcha! 
- Come on, mowgli. 
- You went in the tree. 
- That wasn't fair. 
- We almost made it. 
You guys... 
Are going too fast. 
Anybody ever teach you how to jog? You went high when everyone else stayed on the trail. 
- But that's what you do. 
- Maybe, but I'm not a wolf. 
- Next time, stay together. 
- Come on, guys. 
"For the strength of the pack is the..." - Wolf. 
-"Wolf... 
"And the strength of the wolf 
is the pack." 
Mowgli's back! 
Hey, mowgli! Wait for us. 
Hurry up, guys. 
Hi, gray. 
Look well, wolves. 
"This is the law of the jungle... "As old and as true as the sky. "The wolf that keeps it may prosper... "But the wolf that breaks it will die. "Like the creeper that girdles 
the tree trunk... 
"The law runneth over and back. "For the strength of the pack..." This is nice up here. 
Now he can climb. 
Please don't tell me 
you're about to head down. 
I could get used to this. 
Now I'm the king of the swingers Page 32/36
oh, the jungle vip 
I've reached the top and had to stop and that's what's botherin' me I wanna be a man, man-cub 
and stroll right into town 
and be just like the other men I'm tired of monkeyin' around 
oh, ooo-be do 
I wanna be like you-oo-oo

The Secret Life of Pets By Cinco Paul 
Page 1/45
Illumination! 
Illumination! 
I've lived in this city 
all my life. 
I'm Max. 
And I'm the luckiest dog 
in New York 
because of her. 
That's Katie. 
Katie and I... 
Well, we have 
the perfect relationship. 
We met a few years ago. 
And, boy, let me tell ya, 
we got along right away. 
It was one of those 
relationships 
where you just know. 
And get this! 
She was looking for a roommate. And so was I! 
So I just moved 
in that same day. 
It was perfect. 
We've been 
together ever since... 
Katie would do 
anything for me. 
And I'm her loyal protector. 
Our love is... 
How do I put this? 
Our love is 
stronger than words. 
Or shoes. 
It's me and Katie. 
Katie and me. 
Us against the world. 
I wouldn't go so far as 
to call us soul mates, 
even though any sane person 
who saw us would. 
There's just one 
little problem. 
Pretty much every day... 
Page 2/45
Come on, Max. 
...she leaves. 
I'll see you tonight. 
Sometimes I try stuff 
to get her to stay. 
Okay. 
Sit. 
Spin. 
Speak. 
Okay. 
That's a good boy. 
But it never works. 
Where is she going? 
What could she 
possibly be doing? 
Oh, I miss her so much. 
Oh my! 
She's back! 
Forgot my phone. 
What took so long? 
Why did you... 
Oh, come on! 
Oh! 
I miss her so much. 
Bye, Gidget. 
Be a good doggy. 
Hey, Max. 
Hey, Gidget. 
Any plans today? 
Uh, yes. 
Big, big stuff today, 
Gidget. I got big plans. 
I'm gonna sit here, and I'm gonna wait for Katie to come back. 
Oh, that sounds 
exciting. 
Well, I won't interrupt. 
I've got a very busy day, too. Here you go. 
See you later, Chloe. 
MAN 13 Bye, Peppy. 
So long, Mel. 
Bye, Sweetpea. 
See you, Gino. 
Page 3/45
- Bye, Mr. Wiggles. 
- So long, pal. 
I'll miss you, Shelly! 
Later, Runty. 
Bye, everyone. 
Bye. 
Mmm. 
You be a good boy, Leonard. 
Hey, Max. 
Hey, Chloe, do you ever wonder where they go during the day? 
Do you know what? 
I just... 
I don't really care. 
Maybe that's what 
it's like for you, 
but Katie and I have 
a different relationship. 
You're a cat. 
So maybe that's why. 
Because nobody could ever love a cat the way they love a dog. I'm just saying. 
Maybe that's why. 
Whatever you need 
to tell yourself. 
Hey! Morning, Max! 
MAXI Hey, GUYS 
What's up, Sweetpea? 
Hey, Mel, 
where you been, man? 
Oh! Get this! 
Last Sunday, my owner feeds 
me a small white pill, right? 
I start to feel 
a little groggy. 
The next thing I know, 
I wake up, I'm in the sky! 
Wait a minute. The sky? 
Yeah. There are suitcases everywhere. I'm locked up in a crate. 
Come on. There 
are suitcases in the sky? 
So, I pass out from fear, 
Page 4/45
and when I wake up 
I'm in Florida. 
Um. This 
did not happen. 
I will never eat a 
pill like that again. 
Unless it's covered 
in peanut butter. 
Because, I mean, come on! Right? It's peanut butter! 
Hey, guys. 
Oh, hey, Norman. 
You still looking for your apartment? Yeah. Going 
on three weeks now. 
Is this the second 
or the third floor? 
I don't know any numbers, 
but, uh, you don't live here. 
Ah! Pellets! 
Well, see you guys later. 
You know what? 
You can do it! 
He can't do it. 
Buddy! 
There you are. 
Did you find it? 
You know I did. 
Ball! 
Ball, ball, ball! 
Katie's gonna 
be so excited! 
This is exactly like 
the one she lost! 
I mean, look at it! 
It's round. 
It fits in my mouth. 
ALL; Ball! 
Ooh! 
There is no 
other ball in the city 
like this one ball, guaranteed. Whoa! 
This is the ball. 
Page 5/45
Hey. 
Katie! 
I'm home, Max. 
Hey, Maximilian. 
How was your day, buddy? 
That's a good boy. 
Oh, yes. I'm so psyched 
to see you too, buddy. 
Okay, boy. 
Calm down, it's okay. 
Let's all be calm. 
Now, I have 
some big news. 
I know this'll 
take some getting used to, 
but I think it's gonna be a 
great thing in the long... 
Oh! 
Max, this is Duke. 
He's going 
to be your 
brother. 
No, Max. 
It's gonna be 
all right, Duke. 
It's okay. 
Aww. See? 
He likes you. 
Whoa! 
AWW. 
Yeah, that's it, Duke. Take 
a look around. 
I know, buddy. 
This is a lot to take in. 
But he didn't 
have a home. 
So you and I are gonna have 
to take care of him. 
Okay? 
Oh, my gosh! 
Duke found 
our lost ball! 
What a great team we're gonna be. Love you, Maxie. 
Page 6/45
Love you, Duke. 
Sleep tight, boys. 
Psst. 
Psst. 
Hey. Little guy. 
This place 
is so great! 
Uh-huh. 
By the way... 
That is one 
gorgeous bed. 
Yeah, it's okay. 
Maybe we could share? 
You know, one night you get the bed. The next night, I do. 
That kind of thing. 
You know, 
this bed is mine. 
You? You get 
an old blanket. 
That suits you. 
You're an old-blanket kind of a dog. on, WOW. 
You are stubborn. 
Hey, I get it. 
I'm stubborn, too. 
But we gotta learn to get along. Wait. What are you... 
I bet we can both fit in 
this bed if we really try. 
Let me scoot on 
in there. 
No, wait. 
Ah! 
Perfect. This is 
comfy, right? 
No, it is not. 
I'm comfy. 
Duke is just 
ruining our lives! 
It's an emergency that 
you get rid of this dog. 
He stole my... 
And he's scary, 
Page 7/45
and he's frightening, 
and he's the death 
of all good things. 
Aww. You little 
cutie pie. 
We'll play tomorrow, 
buddy,okay? 
Okay, sleep well. 
Are you trying 
to get rid of me? 
Before I answer that... 
I'd like to know 
how much you heard. 
So, that's how 
it's gonna be, huh? 
Oh, man, are you 
making me angry! 
And when I get angry, 
I do this. 
And I don't want to do that. 
I need this place. 
And if it's gonna 
come down to you or me... 
It's gonna be me. 
Morning, Max! 
Max! Max! What 
are you doing? Hi! 
It's me! Hi! Hi! 
Chloe! 
Chloe, Chloe! I got a bad situation. Katie brought 
home a new dog from the pound. She said he's my brother. 
I don't want a brother. 
I don't even 
have a bed now. 
I'm sleeping on the floor, 
like a dog. 
Why would Katie 
do this to me? 
Because she's 
a dog person, Max. 
And dog people do weird, 
inexplicable things. 
Page 8/45
Like they get dogs 
instead of cats. 
Okay, please don't 
start now, Chloe. 
That is not helping. 
Max? Come on, 
I'm your friend. 
Okay? And as your friend, 
I gotta be honest with you. 
I don't care about you 
or your problems. 
But if you don't do something 
about this guy, and soon, 
your perfect little life 
with your dumb, bleh, human 
is gonna be over, forever. 
Forever? 
Forever. Yeah, 
that's what I just... 
Why is this mouse 
on my paw still? 
Look, if you really 
want to get your turf back 
you're gonna have to start 
acting like the alpha dog. 
Right. Alpha dog. 
I can do that. 
Okay, okay. 
Please don't go! 
This time, 
really don't go. 
I'm running late. I gotta go. 
Wait, wait. Stay! 
Stay for the trick. 
"Spin!" I'm doing "spin." 
You guys be good. 
I'll see you later. 
Wait. No, look... 
Okay, Max. 
Listen, Duke. I'm not 
sure if you're aware, 
but one of those 
food bowls, technically... 
It's reserved for... 
Page 9/45
I know, maybe you didn't 
read the names, but... 
That's my bowl. 
Mmm. 
I know that it... Hey... 
I was just thinking, 
I don't know, 
maybe we could institute 
some ground rules. 
I just thought that... 
Or not. 
I don't need a bowl. 
Here again? 
Rodent! 
Ah! 
Oh, Duke. 
Duke, Katie is not... 
Katie's gonna be so upset 
when she sees that. 
Katie's gonna flip out... 
When she sees how you 
trashed her whole place. 
Oh, it's just one vase. 
Is it, Duke? Is it? 
Oh, that's a shame. 
What are you doing? 
Whoa, what am I doing? 
Nothing. 
I'm a cute little doggy. 
Katie knows I wouldn't 
do anything like this. 
No, no. Whoa! 
Mmm. 
This could only be the work 
of a dangerous stray, 
who hasn't laid down a 
foundation of trust. 
You're the new dog. 
And, Duke, what'd 
you go and do this for? 
I'm gonna... 
What? Bite me? 
Rip my face off? 
Perfect. Wait till 
Page 10/45
Katie finds out. 
Oh! Help, Katie! Thank 
goodness you're here. 
I tried to stop him, 
but he's crazy! 
Now, sit. 
Okay, okay, okay. 
Lay down. 
Good boy. 
Hi, Max. 
Hey, Gidget. 
Who's your 
new roommate? 
Is it a girl dog 
or a boy dog? 
Not that I care. 
It doesn't matter to me. 
Oh, that's nobody, Gidget. 
He's just visiting. 
Yeah, he's gonna be 
gone soon. 
Hey, what's up? 
Oh, hi. 
Your hat is the best 
hat I've ever seen. 
Hey 
Uh, excuse me. 
Genius! 
You forgot my leash. 
Never mind. 
Hey, fellas, how's it... 
Hey, fellas, how's it... 
Hey, fellas... 
Oh, uh... 
Say, Duke... 
Yes? 
Be a good lad and bring 
me a stick, won't you? 
It would please me to 
chew on a stick just now. 
You heard me. Fetch. 
Nah,nah,nah,nah. 
Nah, not that one. 
That one doesn't 
Page 11/45
please me. 
Find a really 
good one, Duke. 
Yeah, that's it. 
Hey, Max. Boy! 
Oh, wow. 
There are a ton of 
sticks over here, Max! 
You should come over and look at them. Yeah, I wanna make sure I 
grab you the right one. 
Well, that's 
very, uh, thoughtful. 
Look at all 
these sticks! 
MAXI Whoa! 
Help! Help! 
Hey, did you 
hear that? 
Butterfly! 
Butterfly! 
Butterfly! Let's get it! 
Wha... What's... 
Huh? 
Whoa! 
Help! Help! 
So long! 
Don't leave me here! 
Didn't have to 
be this way, Max. 
Wait! 
No hard feelings! 
Duke! 
Please! 
Oy! 
What's going on here? 
Mind your own business. Oh, my gosh, what happened to you? 
I had a fight. 
All right? 
With a 
big, stupid dog. 
He lost. 
Oh, you're headed into dangerous Page 12/45
territory there, kitty-cat. 
I'd watch your tone, 
sunshine. 
You know what I'm gonna do? 
I'm gonna cut you into 
string, ball you up, 
and then bat you 
around for hours 
in a game that 
only I understand. 
Oh, very nice. 
I'll take that! 
Wha... 
Ooh! Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! 
You want to start with 
me, little raisin? 
Okay. 
Get your umbrellas 
out, kitties, 
because here they come! 
The thunder 
and the lightning! 
Right down on your face! 
Gosh, there are a lot 
of you up there. 
I'm talking about the thunder and the lightning that's coming down on all of your 
collective faces! 
Attack on three... 
Two... 
I just remembered 
I gotta be somewhere! 
That guy, huh? Am I right? 
Okay. You know what? I'm just gonna... No offense, but good-bye! 
Whoa! 
Whoa! 
Hey! 
You little... 
Duke? 
You came back? 
Run! 
It's the po-po! Scram! 
Page 13/45
Wait! 
Two, four, six, eight... Hmm... See you tomorrow, 
Guillermo! 
You know it. 
Ten... 
Eh, okay. 
Right. 
Uh-huh. 
Sheez, did you see that? 
Yeah, I saw it. 
Throw it with your arm, 
you lazy weirdo! 
I would not fetch that. I'm old-school. Thanks a lot, Duke. 
I don't like to 
use this phrase 
because it's offensive 
to our kind, 
but you are 
a bad dog! 
Katie's not 
going to like this. 
I can't go 
to the pound. 
What? What's wrong 
with you? 
Well, Katie just... 
She just got me 
out of the pound. 
And if I go back... 
Max, it's the end 
of the line for me. 
Yes! Mmm... 
Why? Why? 
What's the matter, Maria? 
Maria, your face, 
it wears 
a thousand sorrows. 
What is wrong? 
Oh, I have come 
face-to-face 
with the worst thing 
in the world. 
Page 14/45
What? Oh, tell me, 
Maria. Tell me now! 
I cannot bear another 
moment without knowing! 
Loneliness. 
Max! Max! 
Max? Huh? 
Hey, I see you, 
squirrel! 
This is not 
your area! 
We marked that tree! 
Don't you try and hide! 
I can see... Oh! 
What was that? 
- How dare you! 
- Guys, where's Max? 
Nobody likes you, 
squirrels! 
Guys, seriously, 
where is Max? 
Calm down, girl. 
He's right... 
Huh. He is gone. 
Oh, it's fine. 
I heard him screaming after he disappeared into those bushes. Max is gone? 
This is bad. 
This is so bad. 
Maria, if he is 
your true love 
you must go to him! 
Save him! Save him! 
Yes! Yes! 
Save my true love! 
I'm coming, Max! 
Hi, Chloe. If anyone 
asks,... - 
I'm on my way to the 
roof to look for Max. 
Okay, bye-bye. 
Whoa. You see that? 
Yeah, give me 
Page 15/45
a second. 
Oh! Hey, there, 
cute little bunny. 
Whatcha doing in the middle of the road? Bunny! 
What's going on? 
What the... 
Save yourself! 
Shut it, human! 
Let's do this! 
Now! 
Now! Yeah! 
Get off me! 
Wait up! 
Get off me, pig! 
Get off! 
Ow! Ow! 
Whoa... 
What's happening? 
I don't know! 
Ripper! Ripper, 
where you at? 
Let's go, Ripper! I'm busting 
you outta here!. 
The revolution has begun! 
Liberated forever! 
Domesticated never! 
Yeah! 
Who's driving 
this thing? 
Whoo! 
Ha, ha! 
Let's go! Let's go! 
Let's go! 
Who are you guys? 
Huh? Who are we? 
Who are we? 
We are the Flushed Pets... 
Thrown away 
by our owners 
and now we are 
out for revenge! 
It's like a club, 
but with biting 
Page 16/45
and scratching. 
Take us with you! 
I don't think so, pets. 
Yeah, you got the stench 
of domestication all over you. 
You chose your side. And 
now you're gonna burn. 
No! Stop! 
Who you calling "pets"? 
I ain't no pet! 
You got it all wrong! 
We're just like you guys. 
We hate humans. 
Yeah! That's right! 
Hate them. 
Oh, man, don't get me started on people. Am I right, Duke? 
Yeah, that's why we 
burned our collars, man! 
We burned them 
to the ground! 
And killed our owners! 
Yeah... Wait a minute, 
that's too far maybe? 
No, they dig it. 
Yes, we whacked them. 
Yeah, that's right! 
Bang, bang with 
our own paws! 
If I had a dime 
for every owner I killed... 
Oh. yeah! 
I'd have a dime. 
Because I just 
killed the one. 
Ooh-whoo! 
Oh, y'all cold-blooded. 
Oh, man, you remind me 
of my boy, Ricky. 
He died, though. 
RIP, Ricky! 
The truth is, the struggle 
could use some more muscle. 
All right, look, 
Page 17/45
I'll tell you what. 
We'll bust the both of you out of here. But understand this. 
From now on, 
you work for me. 
That's fine. Sounds 
like a fun challenge. 
All right, guys, 
let's do this! 
To the sewers! 
The sewers? 
What are y'all waiting for? 
I'm not playing. 
I said... 
To the sewers! 
Long live 
the revolution, suckers! 
I can do it. 
Oh! 
Max? 
Max? 
Max. 
Oh, where are you, Max? 
Looks like 
you could use a little help. 
Who said that? 
Over here. 
In this dark and 
foreboding shed. 
Uh... 
Hello? 
I can see for miles. 
If you let me out, 
I'll find your friend. 
Wow! Really? 
Oh! You're so sweet. 
You're sweet, too. 
Thanks, stranger. 
But not too sweet. 
There's also a salty, 
gamey thing going on. 
Yeah, that's me. 
Come on, let's get you 
out of that shed. 
Page 18/45
Yeah, that's it. 
Just step over 
the pile of bones. 
Pile of bones. 
Okay, will do. 
I sure hope 
Max is safe. 
You're a very 
thoughtful food. 
"Food"? I didn't say that. 
I said "friend." 
I meant food... 
Ff lend. 
You know what I meant. 
I'm sure lucky 
I found you, uh... 
Tiberius. 
And, yes, this is 
a very good thing for you, 
this whole 
"meeting me" thing. 
Take off my hood. 
Ah! 
The chain! 
Oh! You tried 
to eat me! 
I'm sorry. 
You should be sorry. You 
deserve to be locked up. 
You're a bad, 
bad bird. 
I can't help it. I was born 
with killer instincts. 
That is just 
no excuse. 
You're right. Even for a 
predator, I'm selfish. 
I'm a selfish predator. 
It's no wonder 
I have no friends. 
Nobody. 
This is hopeless. 
Oh, don't... There's 
no need to cry. 
Page 19/45
I'm sorry that I 
yelled at you before. 
Please, take off 
the chain. 
This time I'll help 
you. I promise. 
Tiberius... 
This is gonna sound completely horrible, but, um... 
I don't fully 
trust you. 
Oh, no, no, no... 
But, I guess everyone 
deserves a second chance. 
And you are just 
a lonely, old bird. 
And you do have 
weird manners 
because you live in a 
weird shed on a roof. 
So, I'll tell you what. 
If you find Max... 
I'll be your 
best friend. 
Best friend? 
You and me? 
Whoa! 
Whoo! 
Yes! 
That sounds nice. 
Let's do this. 
Okay. 
Ah... 
So, what does 
this Max look like? 
Brown and white. 
He's a short-hair, 
roguishly handsome. 
He's got a sparkle 
in his eye. 
He sounds dreamy. 
You have no idea. 
I mean, what? 
Whatever. Shut up. 
Page 20/45
Mmm-mmm. 
If my owner comes 
put on the hood and 
pretend to be me. 
Okay, thank you! 
Ugh! 
The smell is disgusting... 
...ly good. 
This is all so great. 
Love it here. 
What's... 
The... 
Pass... 
Word'? 
Password? 
Look! Look at me. 
I am your leader. 
The leader does not 
recite the password. 
The leader makes up 
the password, idiots. 
Everybody, I'm making up 
a new password right now. 
The new password is... 
"Don't ask the leader 
for the password!" 
Follow me. 
Welcome to the 
underbelly, brothers. 
Home of the Flushed Pets. 
Brothers and 
sisters! 
As you see, 
I've returned from the surface with two new recruits. 
These guys are 
owner-killers! 
Hey, hey! 
Settle down! 
Guys, I want you to tell 
them how you did it. 
Go ahead. Tell them 
the whole story 
about how you 
Page 21/45
took out your owner. 
Don't leave out nothing. 
We love gory detail, here. 
Oh, yeah! 
Tell us! 
Right. 
So, tell them, Max. 
Okay, so. 
I was like... 
Well, we were like... 
Take that! 
Yeah! 
Stupid owner. 
So, that's who 
you're dealing with. 
That story bored me 
to death. 
Boring! 
Give us detail! 
Okay. Max? 
Okay, well, uh... 
So, there's this thing 
in the kitchen... 
Yeah. Table! 
It's flat. 
Toaster! 
And then round on 
just the end of it. 
A Spoon? 
Yes, a spoon! 
Exactly. 
You can't hurt 
someone with a spoon. 
You scoop with a spoon. 
How many people 
wanna know 
how to kill somebody 
with a spoon? 
I do! Oh, yeah! 
Okay. Uh, well... 
We used the spoon... 
Hit a button on the 
machine on the counter... 
Right, and it's got those... 
Page 22/45
The, uh, you know. 
Those blades. 
The, uh... It's got blades! 
Was it a blender? 
You blended somebody? 
He talking about 
the blender, guys. 
Oh, please, tell me 
it was a blender! 
Hey,buddy,I don't ask what it's called, we just kill with it. 
But it was a blender. 
Whoo! Do y'all hear this? 
You know who was 
like this? Ricky! 
Rest in peace! 
Ricky was the 
only soldier I had 
that was ready to 
kill humans on sight. 
Everybody else 
need a pep talk. 
Not these two brothers. 
See, all of us have suffered 
at the hands of man. 
I mean, take me for instance. 
I was a magician's rabbit 
for kids' parties. 
But then bunny tricks 
went out of style. 
So, what did 
my owner do? 
My owner went and 
left magic behind 
and made me disappear... 
From his life! 
Uh-huh. 
I lived 
in a tattoo parlor! 
The trainees used 
to practice on me! 
Until they ran out 
of space! 
I mean, yes, 
Page 23/45
humans say they love us. 
But then they turn around 
and throw us out like garbage. Ain't that right, 
Sea-Monkeys? 
It's not our fault we 
don't look like the ad! 
Yeah! 
All right, you guys 
are joining the brotherhood. 
It's initiation time! 
Oh, yeah! 
The what? I'm sorry, what time? Summon the Viper! 
Uh, is this 
Viper poisonous? 
Because I should warn you, 
I'm very allergic to poison! 
Ow! 
All right. 
Show her! 
Max's collar! 
Where is he? 
What happened to him? 
I ain't saying 
nothing! 
You're gonna tell 
us where Max is. 
And you're gonna 
tell us now! 
Is this supposed 
to scare me? 
I'm a cat. 
I land on my feet. 
Does it always happen? 
Because your head looks like 
it's taken a lot of landings. 
Do you want me 
to cut you? 
Beoause I'll cut you this way and that. You'll look like a waffle. 
Okay. 
He's too stupid to talk, 
and too ugly to eat. 
Page 24/45
I'm done 
playing nice! 
Where is Max? 
OW. 
Tell me! 
Ooh! 
Let me finish... Ow! 
Help me! Ow! 
Don't look at him. Look at me. Nobody can help you! 
Where is Max? 
Okay! Okay! 
He's in the sewers! 
He got taken! 
Please! Have mercy... 
Adorable puffy dog! 
Snake bite! 
Snake bite! Snake bite! 
As proof of your 
allegiance 
you will now 
receive the bite 
of a one-fanged, 
half-blind Viper 
fueled by a diet 
of anti-human rage! 
Who wants 
to go first? 
Uh... Okay, 
here's the thing, though. 
Tiny Dog 
Can I call you 
"Tiny Dog"? 
It fits you. 
Let's admit that. 
Look. 
Between you and the fat 
dog, I like you the best. 
Oh, thank you! 
Tiny Dog's gonna go first. 
Everybody, 
TD's going first! 
No,no,no. 
Tiny Dog does not want to go first. Page 25/45
Take the fat dog! 
Snake bite! 
No, no, no. 
Stop! 
Snake bite! Snake bite! 
Snake bite! 
No,no,no,no. 
Stop! 
What are you doing initiating 
a couple domestics? 
Domestics? 
Yeah. We just jumped 
those two in the alley. 
Slashed off their collars. 
No,no,no. 
That's not true. 
You said you 
burned your collars. 
Well, "burned," "lost," 
"had them stolen by cats." 
It's all just words, 
really, isn't it? 
You don't deserve to 
be marked by the Viper. 
Oh, no. We'll just 
show ourselves out. 
You deserve 
to be eaten 
by the Viper. 
Get those leash lovers! 
Hold on. 
Go get them, 
Duke. Whoa! 
on... 
Uh, fellas, that 
was an accident. 
You squished 
the sacred Viper! 
He's a flapjack. 
Oh, Viper! 
Viper, you in a better place! 
You and Ricky! 
You ain't never did 
nothing to nobody! 
Page 26/45
Well, you bit a lot 
of people, Viper. 
So, technically, you might 
actually deserve this. 
This might be something 
that was long overdue. 
But it shouldn't have came like this. Not on my watch. 
Get them! 
Oh, no! 
Come on! 
Ah! Wait up, Duke! 
Hyah! 
We're sorry. Can this be 
over now? 
We've got a problem. 
We have so 
many problems. 
Which one do you 
mean at this moment? 
Stop running, dummies! 
Stop it right now! 
Hold your breath! 
Hold my breath? Ah! 
Get them! 
This is my least favorite part of this whole thing so far! 
Friends! 
I am afraid that I have 
some terrible news. 
The squirrels are gonna 
take over the world! 
I knew it! 
I always said, squirrels are 
little shifty little guys. 
No. We're not doing the squirrel thing right now. That's not... No! 
Max is missing! 
He's out there somewhere. 
Lost. Scared. 
So, so handsome. 
We have got to find him 
and bring him home! 
Page 27/45
But the outside world 
is loud and scary. 
Ooh! Is that a hawk? 
This is my friend, Tiberius. 
He's going to help us. 
He's not going to eat us. 
We've already been over it. 
Come on, Gidget. We go out 
there without a leash... 
We'll get 
caught by a net. 
Or something worse! 
Yeah, like a hawk! 
We're wasting time! 
Max needs us! 
Come on, girl, Max doesn't 
even know you're alive. 
Well, I don't care! 
I love him! I love him 
with all of my heart! 
And I'm gonna go look for Max, no matter who's with me. 
So... 
Who's with me? 
All right, fine. Fine. 
Oh, come on, guys. 
I can't believe you. 
When I got my claws 
caught in the curtains 
who pulled me down? 
Max did. 
Buddy, Mel. 
When you were fixed, who taught you to sit the comfortable way? Max did! 
Max did! 
Max did. 
He did it! 
And when that random cat 
tried to eat Sweetpea 
who saved him? 
It wasn't a random cat. 
It was you. 
The identity of the random 
Page 28/45
cat is not the point. 
We're talking 
about who saved him! 
Max did! 
We gotta save him. We 
gotta go save Max! Yeah! 
Yeah! Let's go 
save Max! 
Uh, which one 
is Max, again? 
Um... 
Tiberius! 
No! Bad, bad bird. 
Nice little guy. 
Nice little guy. 
I like this bird. 
Crazy bird. 
Come on! 
We gotta get to shore. 
I only know the doggy paddle! 
And I don't know it well! 
Swim, Tiny Dog. Swim! 
Duke! 
Help! 
Max, grab the ring! 
I can't! 
Keep it up, Max! 
You're doing... 
Well, you're not 
doing great. 
But you're not drowning, 
and that's something! 
You're almost there! 
Thanks, Duke. 
No problem. 
Finally. 
I'm going home. 
Oh. 
Isn't home that way? 
Ah! Seriously? 
They're going 
to Brooklyn. 
They say everyone's going 
to Brooklyn these days. 
Page 29/45
It's making 
a real comeback. 
I'm not talking about 
hipster real estate trends. 
I'm talking about 
vengeance,Tattoo! 
Death is coming 
to Brooklyn. 
And it's got buck teeth 
and a cotton tail. 
Let's go! 
Whee! 
Hi, how are you? 
Chug! Chug! Chug! 
What is this crazy joint? 
This is Pops' place. 
His owner is never home, 
so it's kind of a hot spot. 
Pops knows everyone 
in this city. 
If he agrees to help us, 
Max is as good as found. 
Cool! 
Fabulous! 
Tell me 
you got that! 
Oh, heck yes, I did. 
What's up, Peanut? 
Hey, Buddy. 
You see Pops 
around here? 
Yeah, he's over there. 
Hey, Pops. 
Mud and sweet potatoes. 
Pops! 
Who's that? What? 
Oh, 
hey, Buddy. 
How you been, 
old-timer? 
Paralyzed. 
Great! Listen, 
Mr. Pops, 
our friend Max 
Page 30/45
was taken. 
Last we heard, 
he was lost in the sewers. 
Buddy said that maybe 
you could help us. 
You know, I do know 
a guy in the sewers, 
but, ah, 
I don't 
go out anymore. 
What a waste of time. 
Who said that? 
Oh, I said it. 
By the way, I meant 
no offense, I just... 
Have you seen yourself? 
Welly-well, 
well, well... 
Looky what we 
apparently have here. 
Meezy would like 
to have a look-see. 
Myron! Brows! 
Oh, no. 
Oh, yes. 
Me like what me see. 
Well, what me can see. 
It's all 
an attractive blur. 
Uh. Little lady, 
this is my city. 
I'll find your friend. 
All right, 
party's over! 
Myron! Vacuum! 
So, where are you 
from, my fuzzy angel? 
Dude, I'm a cat. 
Well, nobody's perfect. 
I'm so hungry. 
Oh, man. Would you 
look at that sandwich! 
All right. Time 
to work the gift. 
Page 31/45
No, no, no! 
Okay, this'll be fine. 
We're fine. 
We can find our way home. 
We are descended 
from the mighty wolf! 
We have raw, primal instincts 
that are mere 
moments away 
from kicking in 
and leading us home! 
I cannot wait! 
Here it comes! 
Anything? 
No. 
Wait! Oh, I... 
No. 
I don't 
know, Duke. 
Maybe the legend of dogs coming from wolves is just wrong. 
Maybe one puppy asked his mom, "Where did we come from?" 
And the mom said, 
"Woof." 
And the kid was 
like "Oh, wolves?" 
And she was like, 
"Yeah, fine." 
Sausage. 
Huh? 
You smell that? 
Oh, man, it is. 
Sausage! 
Well, then, 
what are we waiting for? 
We're coming 
for you, baby! 
Lower the ramp, 
dummy. 
Who are they? 
This is Puffball, 
Squash-Face, 
Weiner Dog, 
Page 32/45
Yellow Bird, 
Eagle-Eye, 
Guinea Pig Joe. 
And, of course, 
my girlfriend Rhonda. 
100% wrong. 
Good enough. 
Come on! Let's go! 
Move it or lose it! 
Every bird instinct 
I have says 
don't follow a dog 
on wheels. 
Um, Mr. Pops, sir. 
Shouldn't we be 
heading to the sewers? 
Now, if we take 
the human route, 
getting there is 
gonna take days. 
You may have lots of time, 
but for me every breath 
is a cliffhanger. 
So, we gotta take 
the secret route. 
Okay. The secret 
route was death. 
Well, that's that, 
I guess. 
Come on! 
Get down here! 
Sweetpea... 
Keep moving! 
Oh, no. 
Stop it! Look away! 
Come on! I don't 
have all day! 
Yeah! 
Wheel 
Come on, slowpokes! 
Ugh! What is 
that smell? 
It's poo-poo 
with a dash of caca. 
Page 33/45
The scent is 
getting stronger. 
Oh, man. 
Duke, let's eat! 
Oh, yes! 
Oh, it smells 
so good! 
Oh yes! 
Sausages! 
Ah! 
Come on, boys! 
Holy schnitzel! 
We go together Like rama lama 
lama ka dinga da dinga dong 
Remembered forever 
As shoo-bop sha wadda wadda 
yippity boom de boom 
Chang chang 
changitty chang sha-bop 
That's the way it should be 
Wha-oooh, yeah! 
We're for each other Like a wop ba-ba lu-bop and wop bam boom 
Just like my brother is 
Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na 
yippity dip de doom 
Chang chang 
changitty chang sha-bop 
We'll always be together 
Ah! 
Wha-oooh, yeah! 
Getting 
a weird vibe, man. 
All right, now, these 
guys are a bit testy. 
So, just let me 
do the talking. 
Hey, you crybaby! 
Where's the Viper at? 
Don't you worry, 
Viper! 
You will not 
be forgotten! 
You will be avenged, Viper! 
Page 34/45
If you don't believe me, 
you can look at 
my battle plans. 
It's all laid out right here. 
Uh, boss... 
I can't tell 
who anyone is. 
Well, you gotta really 
look at it to understand it. 
That's you guys right here. 
And, see, that's Brooklyn. 
That's where we 
gonna get them dogs. 
Bam! Bam! 
That ball of fluff's 
got a screw loose. 
Let's skedaddle. 
You get it, 
you see what I'm saying. 
Bottom line is, I'm coming 
right for you, Tiny Dog! 
And that big, fat, brown dog? 
He gonna get it, too. 
Tiny Dog? 
There are lots of 
tiny dogs in the city. 
I mean, you're a tiny dog, okay? So, let's just go. 
He also said, 
"big, fat, brown dog." 
Like Max's new roommate. 
Not necessarily. 
Max, Max, Max... 
You are gonna get it! 
That's kind 
of hard to dispute. 
Hey, you stay away 
from... 
Wait, what? 
You know Tiny Dog? 
He's my friend! 
And some might 
say my boyfriend! 
Uh, nobody says that. 
Page 35/45
I can't believe 
you know Tiny Dog! 
That's cool. 
It's such a small world, 
that's the funny 
thing about it. 
Get them! 
Scatter! 
Not good! 
See you guys later! 
Hang on! 
Everybody, run! 
Derick, you idiot! 
Did they all get away? 
Uh... 
Phew! That was 
a close one! 
Oh, nuts! 
Yes! We got one! 
Oh, good for you guys! 
Yay! 
Yeah! 
Oh, yes, Tiny Dog, 
we got your friend! 
Advantage, me! 
Uh-oh. Just ignore what 
just happened. Okay? 
Yes! 
You know what? 
This may be the 
sausage talking, 
but you're okay. 
Right back 
at you, man. 
When I met you, 
I was all like, 
"I don't know 
if I like him." 
But now that 
I know you, I'm like, 
"I like him." 
You know, I saw this 
place from the outside 
many times. 
Page 36/45
Had I known what treasures 
awaited within these walls, 
I would've 
broke down that door 
a long time ago, 
I'll tell you! 
What are you 
talking about? 
My old owner and I 
used to live around here. 
Duke, man, wait. 
Did you used 
to have an owner? 
Well, it was 
a long time ago. 
I don't want 
to talk about it. 
Yes, you do. 
Come on. 
I don't know. 
But you know what? 
He was so cool. 
Yeah? 
Yeah. 
He was the best. 
Man, we had fun. 
We'd play fetch. 
We'd go for walks. 
We'd take naps. 
We were both big nappers. 
I got out one night, chasing 
a butterfly, or a car. 
By the time I had caught 
up with it and ate it... 
Probably a butterfly, 
then. 
...I realized I was so 
far away from my home 
I couldn't find it. 
A few days later, I was 
picked up by Animal Control. 
I had 
a great thing going. 
But I had to go 
Page 37/45
and mess it up. 
Duke, we gotta go 
to your house. 
Nah. 
Your owner's gonna 
be relieved! 
Will he? 
Yeah, but... 
But he never 
came for me. 
Maybe he... 
Maybe he didn't like me. 
Of course he liked you. 
He was your owner. 
I mean, he's probably 
worried sick! 
I don't know. 
Well, I do know 
and we're going! 
Your owner's 
gonna freak! 
I'm freaking out 
just thinking about it. 
Okay. 
Let's do it! 
There they are! 
All right, doggy, 
come on. 
Hey, hey, hey! 
Where do 
you think you're going? 
Come back here, you dogs! 
That rabbit... 
He had crazy eyes. 
There ain't no curing what's 
wrong with that thing! 
Gidget, 
here's an idea. 
Maybe there's a dog in the 
neighborhood that looks like Max. Start hanging out with him. 
After a while, 
you'll think it's him 
you'll be done. 
Page 38/45
We are not 
just giving up! 
We're dedicated. 
We're loyal. 
We're easily the 
greatest pet ever. 
We're dogs! 
Cat. 
Hawk. 
Well, congratulations! 
Today you're dogs, whether 
you like it or not! 
Sweet. 
Now let's find Max 
before that rabbit does! 
Break! We're dogs! 
Oh. 
I don't like it. 
Sassafras... 
Yep, they were here. 
Excellent 
We're closing in! 
This is groundbreaking 
evil behavior, people. 
Groundbreaking! 
Oh! 
A light bulb just 
went off in my brain. 
The bunny has an idea. 
Okay, so, uh, 
how do I look? 
You look great. 
How do I smell? 
Like a dog, Duke. 
Relax, man. 
There it is. 
Well, go on up. 
Go scratch 
at that door. 
Remember that sausage factory? That was fun, huh? 
Are you stalling? 
No. Why do you 
think that? 
Page 39/45
Let's have a long talk about 
why you think I'm stalling. 
Duke, you have nothing 
to be nervous about. 
Your owner is going to 
be thrilled to see you. 
Okay. 
Huh. That car is new. 
Can I help you? 
No. We're good, thanks. 
You're not good. 
You look dirty. 
And I'm gonna have to ask 
you to get off my lawn 
before I get, um, 
what you have. 
This is my lawn. 
Duke, maybe 
we should go. 
And why would 
Fred get a cat? 
He hates cats. 
That's one of the things 
I love about him. 
Fred? The old guy? 
He, um... 
He died. 
Duke, maybe I made a mistake, 
saying we should come here. 
Let's go. 
You're a liar! 
Max, cats lie 
all the time. 
Don't fall for it! 
Who are they? 
Hey, this is my home. 
Go away! 
Duke, it's time 
to go. 
Duke, let's go! 
Come on! 
This isn't your home 
anymore. 
Why did you 
Page 40/45
bring me here, Max? 
Wait a minute. 
This is my fault? 
I was trying 
to help you! 
You were trying 
to get rid of me! 
You know what, Duke? 
I don't need this. 
I'll see you later. 
Gotcha! 
Come on, settle down! 
Go home, Max! 
Hey, help me out, here! 
Hold on! 
I'm coming! 
Let's go. 
Finally 
got you, big fella. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
Come on. 
This is it for you. 
Duke! 
Aw. 
Koochi koochi koo! 
Tiny Dog! 
Ah, are you kidding me? 
You thought 
this was over, Tiny Dog? 
Stop! 
Huh? 
Jab, jab, jab! 
Body blow! Body blow! 
Karate chop to your neck! 
Would you get off me! 
Tattoo! 
No, no, no. 
Oh, TD. 
This kills me to say, 
but we gotta 
join forces, man. 
Whoo! 
We make a great team, 
Tiny Dog! 
Page 41/45
Well, mainly, I'm doing all the hard work, but you're helping! Yes, yes, fine. 
Just keep your eyes on the road. You're driving like an animal! Whoo-hoo! 
What was that? 
Oh, that was a pothole. 
You're hitting 
things on purpose! 
Heh. You know me 
too well, TD! 
Always keeping me 
in check. 
Do you see the van? 
Yeah, I see it. 
We're about to hit it. 
Relax, Snowball, 
I got you. 
There he is! 
He's got Snowball! 
Look, fellas, this is 
not what this looks like. 
Shush,you! 
You were gonna 
eat the boss! 
No,no,no. Snowball and I 
are on the same side now. 
Tell them! Snowball, 
tell them! 
That raccoon is lying. 
He's not the president. 
Come on, now. 
Come here, you. 
Gidget? 
Go, Max! 
Right. Okay, 
gotta go. 
Thank you! Thank you! 
Stay down! 
Duke, hang on! 
Whoa! 
Duke! 
Max? Max! 
Page 42/45
Oh, get the keys! Right! 
Hurry! 
Ha! 
Come on, come on. 
I got them! 
Max! 
Remember me! 
I feel heroic! 
And handsome. 
I'm a little wet, 
but I still look good. 
I look good. 
Are you... 
Are you okay? 
I'm good. 
I'm good. 
Thanks for coming 
to save me, Max. 
Max! 
Oh, Max! 
You need a lift? 
Yes, we need a lift! 
Let's go, Tattoo. 
Taxi! 
Whoa! 
Yeah! 
Hey, hey... 
Uh, Gidget, wait up. 
Oh, hi, Max. 
Yeah. Hi. Um... 
Play it cool. 
Yeah, I... 
I just wanted to... 
Look. 
Have you ever lived across 
from someone your whole life, 
but you don't really 
appreciate them, until... 
I don't know... 
Until they're beating up dozens of animals on the Brooklyn Bridge? I guess what I'm 
trying to say is... 
If you ever wanna... 
Page 43/45
Okay 
Oh, great. 
You're in love. 
How gross for everyone. 
Now move it! 
Good-bye! See you later! 
Good-bye! 
Does anyone know 
where we are? 
Bye, Max. 
Bye, Gidget. 
Okay, bye-bye! 
See you guys. 
Man, I feel sorry 
for them. 
Gotta run home 
to their owners. 
Not us. 
Now, it's back to 
our primary mission. 
The downfall of 
the human race! 
It is on, humans! 
It is on! 
Yeah! 
Mommy! Can I have a bunny? 
And a pig and a 
crocodile and a lizard? 
Uh-oh. 
Yay, bunny! 
Jab, jab, jab! 
Body blow! Body blow! Break-away move. Aww... 
What's going on? 
What's she doing? 
Bunny, I'm gonna love you 
forever and ever and ever. 
Aww. Bunny. 
Aw. 
Here you go. 
Duke, this is the 
best part of the day. 
Ooh! Is that her? 
Nah, no. That's... Wait... 
Page 44/45
Yeah, that's her. 
That's her. 
Katie! 
There they are! 
Max and Duke, 
Duke and Max! Aw! 
My boys! 
So, how'd it go? 
Great, right? I... 
Uh... 
So, maybe a few bumps. 
But I knew this 
was gonna work out. 
So, who's hungry? 
Welcome home, Duke. 
Thanks, Max. 
Come on, man. 
Hurry it up. 
Okay. 
I'm coming, 
I'm coming. 
Sheesh! 
Welcome, my dogs. 
Oh, you guys 
look weird. 
Hurry up, come on in. 
You said it was 
a costume party. 
Why do you 
listen to me?

Were you 
a good boy, Leonard? 
All right, party's over.

FADE IN: 
EXT. RABBITON, USA 
YOUNG BUNNIFER GOODWIN is starring in an elementary school production of “How to Exposit the Premise of Your Entire Universe Without Really Trying”. CGI YOUNG BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Many years ago, predator animals had a nasty habit of killing and devouring us prey animals, which kind of prevented us from getting along. But we were able to get past all that once predators adapted to, I dunno, absorb nutrients from the atmosphere or something? 
(shrugs) 
So since then we’ve had an alternate evolutionary history where we were the ones to develop human intellect, language and technology. We even had the foresight to develop the opposable digits necessary to use that technology, instead of bumbling around trying to work stuff with our mouths like certain Good Dinosaurs we could name. 
(snorts) 
Anyway, in this advanced animal civilization, it’s my dream to grow up to be a police officer! 
CGI ASSHOLE FOX KID 
Hur hur, a rabbit cop? Don’t you go gettin’ ideas above yer station, you uppity lagomoron! 
CGI YOUNG BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
That’s the kind of bigoted thinking civilization needs to rise above! Animals should be judged not by the diet of their species, but by the content of their character! #bunnylivesmatter 
(pause) 
Oh. So that’s what kind of movie this is. 
CGI ASSHOLE FOX KID 
Yup! And just to remove any lingerin’ threat of subtlety, they’ve given me the only redneck accent in town, a-HYUCK! Or in other words, we’re protestin’ ethnic stereotypes by usin’ a whole ’nother ethnic stereotype. CGI YOUNG BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Speaking of annoying one-dimensional cartoons: to the police academy! EXT. POLICE ACADEMY 
Years later, BUNNIFER trains at the POLICE ACADEMY for one twenty-second throwaway montage, before graduating top of her class and preparing to move to ZOOTOPIA to be a POLICE OFFICER. 
CGI BUNNY HUNT: 
Have fun in the big city, sweetheart! But also be careful. You should take this canister of fox repellent, which is a product that in this world ought to be about as legal as a real-life can of “Mexican-B-Gone”. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Page 2/11
Hold on, at the police academy most of the prejudice seemed to be that I was too small and weak to be taken seriously as a candidate. And now when I go off to the big city you’re giving me some mace to protect myself against “predators”. 
(examines canister) 
PINK mace! Is this movie trying to make a point about race politics, or gender politics? 
CGI BUNNY HUNT: 
It’s making whatever point you want it to make! Rule number one about putting social commentary into your family movie: maximum vagueness equals maximum deniability. 
EXT. ZOOTOPIA 
BUNNIFER moves to ZOOTOPIA, a huge multi-ecosystem city where many species intermingle. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Boy, this place is such a melting pot! Isn’t it beautiful that, in this world so full of prejudice and hate, there can be a place where all the different species come together like this? 
(pause) 
Well, all the MAMMALS, of course. All those gross non-mammal species can go fuck themselves. Fuckin’ lizards and birds and shit. 
(shudders) 
She goes to her first day at the POLICE STATION, where she serves under POLICE CHIEF IDRIS ELBUFFALO. 
CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO 
There’s been a rash of disappearances, all predators. This is our number one priority, people! By which I mean our only priority. I’m assigning every officer to this case, every last one of them, so I guess for the time being all other criminals can just go nuts. 
(pause) 
Oh, except for those heinous parking violators! Bunnifer, I’m putting you on parking duty. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Sure, okay. I guess since it’s my first day ever on any form of active duty it stands to reason that the most menial assignment would fall to me. You’re only being reasonable here. 
CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO 
Ha, what movie do you think you’re watching? I’m being super duper racist, of course! 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Oh, well in that case this is BULLSHIT! That’s it, I’m gonna be unforgivingly militant in handing out tickets the split second any meter expires anywhere in the city, and thus prove myself good enough to escape 
Page 3/11
the career purgatory that is parking duty! 
CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO 
Boy, this explains SO MUCH about parking inspectors. 
BUNNIFER goes and hands out A HUNDRED BAJILLION PARKING TICKETS. While out she sees JASON BATEFOX being refused service at an ELEPHANT ICE CREAM STORE. 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
Come onnn, sell me one of your giant elephant-sized ice pops! It’s a birthday treat for my son here. Kindly fail to notice his distinctive giant ears which ought to make it obvious to anybody that he isn’t even the same species as me. 
CGI ELEPHANT: 
Meh, all you foxes look the same. But either way, fuck off, I’m not selling you anything. 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
I don’t suppose that would be out of legitimate concern about me giving my supposed toddler twenty times his own body weight in sugar? 
CGI ELEPHANT: 
Nope, it’s just another fun fun fun case of rrracism! 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Not so fast! I’ll step in and force you to serve these guys or else I’ll file charges against you for health code violations! Rather than, say, breaking anti-discrimination laws, which I guess don’t exist here?? BUNNIFER pays for JASON’S ICE POP. 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
Heh heh heh, SUCKER! Now I’m gonna melt this thing down into many tiny ice pops, then sell them to lemmings, who would regard them as full size and thus pay full price! ...Which kind of raises the question of how the hell you could even have a functioning economy when some citizens require literally hundreds of times as much nutrition, space, energy and general resources as others. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Well I guess you could just pay the smaller animals less money for equal work OH GOD IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE. 
(shakes fist) 
Anyway, curse you, you vulpine stereotype, you’ve disillusioned me with your slightly dishonest and vaguely unethical pseudo-scam! She goes home feeling DEPRESSED and ANGRY and JADED ABOUT ALL DAMN CIVILIZATION, which, once again, really clears up a whole bunch about PARKING INSPECTORS. But on her next shift she espies a thief on the lam! CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Aha, a chance to thwart an actual crime! I’ll just chase him into a Page 4/11
miniature rodent town where I’ll stomp around like a kaiju, causing massive property damage and risking the life and limb of countless civilians. PROTECT AND SERVE! 
(charges through tiny traffic, nearly kills a thousand people) CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO 
Damnit Bunnifer, I racistly, but also kinda legitimately, won’t stand for your reckless heroics! You’re through! Turn in your badge and - well, this entire police force seems weirdly devoid of guns, but turn in your badge at least. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Turn in my badge? Crap, you just awakened Bigyellinchief, the god of police chief clichés! 
CGI JENNY UNGUSLATE 
(pokes head in) 
Say Idris, as the sheep assistant mayor, I just wanted to know that as of RIGHT NOW the mayor is breathing down your neck about letting Bunnifer help find one of those missing predators. 
CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO 
Aw damnit. Well if I’m stuck with police chief clichés I might as well go all out. YOU HAVE FORTY-EIGHT HOURS TO SOLVE THE CASE! 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Ooh, that one’s a cherry. 
BUNNIFER looks at the LAST KNOWN PHOTO of a MISSING OTTER and discovers that he was eating one of JASON’S FRAUDULENT CONFECTIONS. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
So the last random shot of this otter tells me he’d moments earlier spoken to the ONE civilian from this entire giant metropolis who I’ve had a meaningful encounter with? I smell a Mystery Full of Big Convenient Coincidences in the offing! 
EXT. STREET 
BUNNIFER goes and blackmails JASON. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
I have here in my hand a recording that incriminates you, so help me find the otter! Funny how nonchalantly I’m threatening you when you’re a predator twice my size and I’ve been raised to believe your kind are all violent murderers. 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
Damnit, while it would be both extremely easy and entirely in character for me to just grab the recording device you're waving under my nose and hurl it into a storm drain, I guess I'll cave and work with you instead. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Great! We're gonna be such a comically mismatched odd couple! You, a fox, which folklore has always characterized as a quick-witted troublemaker, your textbook trickster archetype; and me, a rabbit, which folklore has 
Page 5/11
always characterized as a quick-witted troublemaker, your textbook trickster - hey wait a minute. 
They go to the NUDIST COLONY where the OTTER was headed, where they learn about him getting into a LIMO. 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
Well that’s all the intel I had, can I go now? 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Wait! I don’t have access to motor vehicle records, so instead of asking any of my fellow cops to look up that limo’s details I’ll get you to use your contact at the DMV! 
They go and do that SLOTH TRAILER at the DMV. 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
Well now I’m REALLY out of useful information, can I go NOW? CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Wait! I need to use you as a flimsy justification for breaking into a parking lot! 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
(sighs) 
So we’re just gonna keep scrounging up increasingly strained reasons to keep me around until I stop hating you, huh. 
The LIMO turns out to belong to a MOB KINGPIN called “MR. BIG”, by whose GUARDS they are suddenly SEIZED. 
INT. UNCLEVER GODFATHER PARODY 
BUNNIFER and JASON are brought before MR. BIG, who turns out to be MAURICE LaSHREW. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Haw, a shrew! He’s called “Mr. Big” and he has a big car and a big office and his henchmen are giant polar bears, but then AW SNAP it turns out he’s actually the SMALLEST of all mammals! What a funny twist! CGI JASON BATEFOX 
Indeed! And now I’ll make a joke about selling him a rug made entirely from the hair from a single skunk’s butt, oh wait I already made that joke ages ago and ruined the whole “he’s tiny” punchline ooops. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Anyway, you don't scare me, Maurice! You can't stop me from finding out what happened to that otter! 
CGI MAURICE LASHREW 
Well I wasn't involved, so what do I care. In fact, the otter was a friend of mine, so presumably I'd WANT this matter cleared up. With all that in mind, I think the most logical course of action would be to have you, a police officer, murdered. I am a smart mobster. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Shit, I need another absurdly convenient coincidence to save my ass. Maybe I could just borrow that horrible one from Training Day? 
Page 6/11
It suddenly turns out that some RANDOM WOMAN whose LIFE BUNNIFER SAVED earlier in the movie is an IMMEDIATE RELATIVE of the GANGSTER who is now about to MURDER HER. 
CGI MAURICE LASHREW 
All is conveniently forgiven! As for that otter, I don’t know where he is. He ran off after he mysteriously went berserk and attacked my driver. One moment he was an ordinary decent mob-connected nudist otter, the next he was like a snarling beast! 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
All right then, since you care about the otter and the clock is ticking on my investigation, I’m sure you’ll agree I should go talk to that driver immediately 
CGI MAURICE LASHREW 
Or you could waste several hours attending the wedding of a stranger. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Or that could happen, sure. 
EXT. RAINFORESTTOWN 
Eventually BUNNIFER and JASON go to talk to the JAGUAR LIMO DRIVER (a LIMO DRIVER who is a JAGUAR, not the driver of a JAGUAR LIMO), but HE TOO has gone FERAL and tries to KILL THEM! They manage to RESTRAIN HIM and call in REINFORCEMENTS, but by the time IDRIS and the other COPS arrive, the DRIVER has disappeared. 
CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO 
Bunnifer, you ass! Clearly this whole tale of a jaguar gone savage is the product of your malfunctioning bunny imagination! 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Well you could always go and see his smashed-up house if you want proof. It’s like two minute’s walk from here. The door’s open and everything. CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO 
Enough of your nonsense! Your forty-eight hours are up, hand in your CGI JASON BATEFOX 
Hold it! I’d like to point out that the thirty-eight hours she’s had so far is LESS than forty-eight, because of how numbers work. 
CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO 
Curse you and your technicalities! Fine, I’ll give you the remaining ten hours. Plus like ten more, I guess, seeings it’s nighttime again by the time you actually solve the case. 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
All right Bunnifer, I suggest we track what happened to that driver by using traffic cameras, which monitor every square foot of every street throughout all of Zootopia, even in deserted little backwaters like this one. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Then how the hell was that picture from the otter’s file the “last known Page 7/11
image” of him? Considering everything we wind up learning about the case, shouldn’t the cops have been able to track his every move from the get-go and solved this thing in under an hour? 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
Luckily for you, it would seem not! 
EXT. CREEPY ABANDONED HOSPITAL 
BUNNIFER and JASON track the DRIVER to some LAB which is guarded by an army of WOLVES. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Wolves? Right before he went nuts, the otter was heard ranting about "night howlers". Wolves howl at night! That's what he must have meant! CGI JASON BATEFOX 
Then why wasn't he ranting about, you know, "wolves"? That's the word most people use for wolves. If he'd been attacked by camels would he have been yelling about "desert walkers"? Seriously, it's a good thing this revelation turns out to be a red herring, because it's fucking stupid. They sneak into the LAB, where it turns out all the MISSING PREDATORS are being kept captive by MAYOR OF ZOOTOPIA J.K. LIONS. 
CGI J.K. LIONS 
Another one! For the fifteenth time, a predator has flipped out and gone feral! Why is this happening? And how have we been able to find out about each incident and kidnap the subject before they were able to hurt anybody or be seen or leave any evidence whatsoever? None of it makes any sense! CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Holy crap! This is a conspiracy that goes all the way to the mayor, who happens to be a huge intimidating lion! It’s going to be a real challenge for me, a bunny rabbit nobody takes seriously, to bring down INT. PRESS CONFERENCE 
The MAYOR has been ARRESTED and BUNNIFER is a HERO. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Oh. Well that was really, really easy. 
CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO 
Go on, Bunnifer, talk to the press. Since this is a potential PR disaster involving corrupt politicians, controversial police officers and some kind of unexplained plague, normally we’d coach you on what you should and shouldn’t say, but pfffft, that sounds like hard work, just wing it. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
All right, I think I can do this. 
(to press) 
Well clearly predators are all just vicious, mindless monsters at heart, and now their thin veneer of civilization is finally falling away to reveal the slavering beasts within, and we can’t trust a damn one of these ticking time bombs of violence. Nailed it! 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
Page 8/11
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?! 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Aw, I wasnt’ talking about you! You’re one of the good ones! ...Okay, you know what, now I hear it. 
JASON STORMS OFF and ZOOTOPIA promptly descends into ANTI-PREDATOR BIGOTRY. CGI SNOW LEOPARD NEWS ANCHOR 
This just in, predators continue to go unpredictably bonkers, with numerous incidents of huge strong animals with claws and sharp teeth suddenly trying to murder unsuspecting pedestrians. But nobody's died yet and let's just all pretend that's plausible, okay? 
CGI MOOSE NEWS ANCHOR, OR SOME OTHER LOCALIZED ANIMAL STEREOTYPE DEPENDING WHERE YOU LIVE 
This has resulted in similarly non-violent prejudice against predators. So now I guess we’re making some comment about how bigotry is a two-way street and even the racial majority can be the victim of racist attitudes? CGI SNOW LEOPARD ANCHOR 
Maybe? But “violence in the blood” is traditionally a racist attitude that has been held against black people in real life, so maybe predators are just another minority. So this movie has been a parallel for, I don’t know, black-vs-hispanic racism the whole time? 
CGI MOOSE NEWS ANCHOR 
Come to think of it, who ISN’T a minority around here? Prey are discriminated against for being small and vulnerable, predators are discriminated against for being former carnivores. And animals like foxes and sloths face more specific prejudice because of specific stereotypes and limitations of their species. Is it even possible to avoid ticking some box or other in this crazy pan-racist town? 
CGI SNOW LEOPARD ANCHOR 
I suppose if you’re a big, powerful herbivore whose race doesn’t have any kind of a questionable reputation. Which would make the only character in this movie who doesn’t suffer from any kind of race prejudice... the one played by Idris Elba? 
CGI MOOSE NEWS ANCHOR 
This is giving me a headache. 
INT. MAYOR’S OFFICE 
BUNNIFER is meeting with NEW MAYOR JENNY UNGUSLATE. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
I know you want me to be the new face of the police force, but I fucked this town up pretty badly, so now I should use my newfound fame to speak out against racism and help defuse this atmosphere of hatred slink off back to my home town and wallow in self-pity. I’m turning in my badge. CGI IDRIS ELBUFFALO 
Wait, you didn’t let me say it! Come on! 
EXT. RABBITON, USA 
Page 9/11
BUNNIFER returns home to sell CARROTS for a living. 
CGI BUNNY HUNT: 
Sorry about everything that happened, honey. Maybe another convenient coincidence would cheer you up? Look what we have growing on our farm even though we know they’re really dangerous: night howlers! 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Gasp! Night howlers are FLOWERS! Somebody must have DRUGGED those predators! Oh, and I know how to find out who! Remember that robber I chased, when I nearly destroyed Rodent Town? 
CGI BUNNY HUNT: 
You mean the one other crime you ever investigated during your entire cop career? 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Yes, the single solitary criminal I ever arrested before getting involved with the missing predator case, was stealing bulbs for these flowers and was clearly heavily involved in the missing predator case! Now THAT is a convenient coincidence, right there. 
CGI BUNNY HUNT: 
It's also convenient that you had enough expertise in that flower to instantly recognize its bulb and rattle off its botanical classification and Latin name, while at the same time you didn't know its regular name or the fact that it makes people go crazy. 
BUNNIFER hurries back to ZOOTOPIA and meets up with JASON. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Hey Jason, sorry for being all racist and stuff. You gotta help me find out who’s behind all this. 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
Um, shouldn’t you be taking this information to Idris instead so he can use the full might of the police force to investigate this? Hell, shouldn’t you have just called him on the phone? In the time it took you to get here some panther might have flipped out and bitten a gopher’s head off or something. CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
This isn’t about public safety, it’s about me getting redemption, damnit! BUNNIFER and JASON question the FLOWER THIEF and wind up tracking down the CRIMINAL MASTERMIND at a NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, who turns out to be... CGI JENNY UNGUSLATE 
That’s right, it was I, the new mayor, the only person to actually have benefited from all these goings-on, who’d’ve guessed! 
She shoots JASON with an INSANITY PELLET and he goes to TEAR OUT BUNNIFER’S THROAT. 
CGI JENNY UNGUSLATE 
Page 10/11
Mwa ha ha, and now to simply leave and let this grisly scene be discovered in the morning whilst keeping my name completely out of it. OR: (calls cops) 
Help, police! I, the mayor, happened to be taking a midnight stroll through the natural history museum with a few thuggish minions, when by total chance I stumbled across Jason murdering Bunnifer! Please get every single officer in the precinct to this location within the next three minutes! (hangs up) 
And now, whilst I should probably do something about the highly incriminating weapon that's currently in my hand before the cops get here, I will instead take this opportunity to declare aloud that I was entirely behind all these predators going crazy, that it was a deliberate crime that I planned and executed, signed Mayor Jenny Unguslate. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
GOTCHA! We were faking the whole attack and recorded your confession. We swapped out your crazy juice pellets for harmless blueberries! CGI JENNY UNGUSLATE 
Wait, seriously? You’re saying that you just happened to be carrying on you a liquid-filled sphere the exact color and dimensions of my psycho-balls? CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
Indeed we were! CONVENIENT COINCIDENCES FOR THE WIN! 
JENNY is ARRESTED and ZOOTOPIA, having lost TWO CRIMINAL MAYORS in RAPID SUCCESSION and unearthed a RACIST PLOT to cause RACISM, naturally goes right back to being COMPLETELY STABLE. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
And now Jason’s become my cop partner, so our hamfistedly metaphorical relationship is healed and we’re closer than ever, yay! 
(pause) 
Although in defiance of how almost any other version of this story would go, it’s still purely platonic. Because in a somewhat injudicious move, Disney’s put out a movie about racial tolerance where “interracial” couples are absolutely off the table. 
CGI JASON BATEFOX 
I can guarantee that won’t stop the furry community. 
CGI BUNNIFER GOODWIN 
...Oh dear GOD. They’re going to write ALL THE PORN, aren’t they? Just ALL OF IT. EWWWWWWW . 
END.
